<DOCNO>Mr. COBLE. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Madam Speaker, during my tenure in Congress, I have consistently opposed granting the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco. As I have stated on many occasions, I believe allowing the FDA to regulate tobacco in any capacity would inevitably lead to the FDA's regulating the family farm.     
   Let's be candid, Madam Speaker; should the FDA spend its time regulating tobacco on the farm and in manufacturing facilities, despite warnings on cigarette labels which alert consumers to their danger, or should it focus on the core mission of ensuring the safety and soundness of our food, drugs and cosmetics? 
   I also have concerns with the impact this legislation would have upon tobacco manufacturers and their employees. These companies employ many hardworking, diligent working North Carolinians, and I believe the FDA regulation of tobacco would negatively affect these manufacturing jobs. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, taxing tobacco companies to fund additional regulation and avoid PAYGO problems is ill-conceived and will create an incentive, in my opinion, for black market activity such as counterfeiting and smuggling. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation is misguided and, in my opinion, will not achieve the goals identified by proponents. Indeed, I believe it will further exacerbate an already stretched FDA, negatively impact manufacturers and farmers, and create a strain on Federal revenues to the Treasury. I adamantly oppose the measure and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Speaker, tobacco is a product that is lawfully grown, lawfully marketed, lawfully manufactured and lawfully consumed. We don't need the FDA inserting its oars into these waters.

   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had the good fortune to attend the graduation and exercises in 2008 at New London, Connecticut, home of the Coast Guard Academy, during which time Ensign Davis was recognized as the valedictorian of the graduating class. It was apparent to me that day, as I observed the proceedings, that she was held in very high esteem by her shipmates and her classmates. 
   And I felt real good, Mr. Speaker, as I spent most of the day on the campus of the Coast Guard Academy, as I viewed the spirit and the esprit de corps that was so obviously apparent. And I'm sure the same spirit and esprit de corps occurs in Kings Point, Annapolis, West Point, Colorado Springs, not only in our academies, but our training centers for the enlisted personnel throughout our armed services. If one doubts that we are prepared, I just urge him or her to visit one of the academies or one of the training centers throughout the country. 
   I am pleased to stand and honor Ensign Davis today, and to honor the U.S. Coast Guard, America's oldest continuous seagoing service.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2565, the Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery Act of 2008. The House passed similar legislation earlier this year to honor the men and women of law enforcement who are injured in the line of duty. 
   America's law enforcement officers protect our communities from street gangs and drug dealers, investigate bank robberies and kidnappings, and apprehend violent criminals. From a simple traffic stop to a complex counterterrorism investigation, our Federal, State, and local police forces put their lives on the line every day. They don't seek fame or recognition, and when honored for their bravery and sacrifice, they will simply say, ``just doing our job.'' 
   There are more than 100,000 Federal law enforcement officers and 900,000 State and local law enforcement officers employed across our nation. And each year approximately 150 of these Federal officers and 160,000 State and local officers are injured in the line of duty.

<DOCNO>Mr. COBLE. (VESSEL HULL DESIGN PROTECTION AMENDMENTS OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 6531, the Vessel Hull Design Protection Amendments Act of 2008, and urge its passage by the House. I'll try not be too detailed, Mr. Speaker, but the subject matter invites some detail. 
   I understand this bill is better informed through a review of the underlying statute, the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act, which Congress passed as part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998. Chairman Howard Berman, the distinguished gentleman from California, and I were the primary sponsors of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of that year. 
   Boat manufacturers invest significant resources in the design and development of safe, structurally sound, and often high-performance boat hull designs. Including research and development costs, a boat manufacturer may invest as much as $50,000 to produce a design from which one line of vessels can be manufactured. 
   When a boat hull is designed and the design engineering and tooling process is complete, the engineers then develop a boat plug from which they construct a boat mold. The manufacturer constructs a particular line of boats from this mold. 
   Unfortunately, those individuals intent on stealing an original boat design can simply use a finished boat hull in place of the manufacturer's plug to develop a mold. This practice is referred to in the trade as splashing a mold. The copied mold can then be used to create a line of vessels with a hull seemingly identical to that appropriated from the design manufacturer. 
   Hull splashing is a problem for consumers as well as manufacturers in boat design firms. Consumers who purchase these knock-off boats are defrauded in the sense that they are not  benefiting from the many attributes of hull design, other than shape, that are structurally relevant, including those related to quality and safety. 
   It is also highly unlikely that a consumer will know if a boat had been copied from an existing design. More importantly for the purposes of promoting intellectual property rights, if manufacturers are not permitted to recoup at least some of their research and development costs, they may no longer invest in new, innovative boat designs that boaters eagerly await. 
   In response to this problem and a Supreme Court case called Bonito Boats that prohibits State action on the matter, we wrote the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act a decade ago. The statute has functioned well during this time, but its continued viability is complicated by an eleventh circuit opinion, Maverick Boat Company v. American Marine Holding. 
   Maverick involves a dispute under the vessel hull statute between two marine manufacturers. Unfortunately, the holding of the case has created a loophole that knock-off manufacturers may well exploit. Because the statute protects the design of a vessel hull, and a hull is defined as the frame or body of a vessel, including the deck, exclusive of masts, sails, yards, and rigging, the court presumably reasoned that a hull must be examined in its totality. In other words, when assessing the design attributes of a hull under the statute, one may not examine its components, meaning the frame or body and the deck, separately. 
   This reasoning subverts Congress' intent when we passed the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act. At the time, proponents of reform were responding to the Supreme Court's ruling in Bonito Boats, which struck down State plug-mold statutes that effectively banned hull splashing as a method for copying hull designs. That is, the very practice, that is, hull splashing, that Congress sought to prescribe in 1998 would, in part, be legitimized by the eleventh circuit's decision in the Maverick case. 
   In brief, H.R. 6531 cures this problem by amending the definition of vessel hulls. The new definition will prevent knock-off manufacturers from indulging in hull splashing or misappropriation of either an original design of a hull or a deck. The bill specifies that only the hull's exterior frame or body is protected and clarifies other terms under the statute. 
   Importantly, H.R. 6531 contains a provision that was omitted from an earlier draft, S. 1640, that the other body passed last October. The new provision creates an exception to the vessel hull statute for the Armed Forces. This is necessary because the United States Navy, the United States Coast Guard, and perhaps the United States Marines, often have vessels built to specifications. It is not unthinkable that a vessel constructed for use by the Armed Forces might infringe a registered design. 
   Nothing in the legislative history of the statute suggests that Congress intended to complicate national security in any way. This is especially true since a separate provision of the U.S. Code, section 2320 of title X, addresses the rights of the Armed Forces and private parties to use patented inventions, copyrighted works, and technical data related to defense projects. 
   H.R. 6531, therefore, ensures this provision or a contract between the government and relevant third parties will determine the rights of the Armed Forces in a registered hull design. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a noncontroversial bill that has received process in the form of hearings in this Congress, as well as the 109th Congress. It is a technical fix that allows the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act to operate as Congress intended. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6531.

<DOCNO>Mr. COBLE. (PAUL WOLFOWITZ -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. I thank the Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, in this town when a Democrat screws up, Democrats are reluctant to criticize. By the same token, when a Republican screws up, Republicans are reluctant to criticize. Today, Mr. Speaker, I intend to depart from this accepted practice and direct attention--if not criticism--to the World Bank matter. 
   Mr. Paul Wolfowitz was one of the architects of the war in Iraq. He was generally awarded low marks for his Iraqi performance. Then he was subsequently elevated to the presidency of the World Bank. Allegations of mismanagement of the World Bank under Mr. Wolfowitz's leadership have recently been prominently reported. 
   The Congress may or may not become involved, and the two House committees on which I sit--Transportation and Judiciary--likely will not become involved, nor am I accusing Mr. Wolfowitz of wrongdoing. That is for the appropriate World Bank panel to resolve. 
   Mr. Speaker, if it is determined in fact that mismanagement did occur on President Wolfowitz's watch, I suppose two options would follow: his resignation or his retention. If the latter, the appropriate World Bank panel may consider attaching a shorter, tighter leash to Mr. Wolfowitz because the present leash--if there is a leash at all--appears to be inadequate. But based upon my limited familiarity with facts surrounding the World Bank matter, I opt for the retention of Mr. Wolfowitz in lieu of his resignation. 
   His questionable and misguided leadership regarding the Iraqi War, plus the allegations of mismanagement at the World Bank under his watch notwithstanding, Paul Wolfowitz has made significant contributions during his years of public service and probably deserves another chance with the aforementioned leash permanently attached. 
   Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, if Members of the Congress openly criticize members of our own party--especially members of our own party--when criticism is warranted, I believe our constituents will applaud such objectivity. And I furthermore believe, Mr. Speaker, that fewer accusations of screw-ups, mischief, mismanagement and scandal will be voiced and hopefully fewer acts of screw-ups, mischief, mismanagement and scandals will be practiced. 
   Mr. Speaker, on that optimistic note, I conclude and yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COBLE. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2830, COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. I thank my friend from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill. We in the Congress cannot lose sight of the purpose of Deepwater, which is to provide the men and women of the Coast Guard with the necessary tools to protect our homeland. I applaud actions undertaken to move this program in the right direction and support this language. I remain concerned, however, that some provisions in H.R. 2830 may create undue burdens and delays, which will, in turn, delay the desperately needed modernization and may ultimately add to the overall costs. 
   The marine safety components of the underlying bill also cause me concern. Previously, the Commandant announced a number of changes he had directed the Coast Guard to implement regarding marine safety. Under his leadership, his able leadership, I might add, the men and women of the Coast Guard continue to examine and improve upon the Coast Guard's marine safety role. 
   Having served in the Coast Guard and the Coast Guard Reserve, I know this armed service is unique because of its structure and flexibility. On a daily basis, Coast Guard men and women focus on drug interdiction, environmental protection, migrant interdiction, port security, search and rescue, homeland security, maritime safety, and aids to navigation. The list is almost endless. Each of these roles complements the other. 
   I continue to support efforts to provide stakeholders an opportunity to voice their concerns, provide constructive feedback, and work together to improve the marine safety aspect of the Coast Guard. At the same time, however, I firmly believe that we should give the Coast Guard the time, opportunity, and resources to improve and expand on its marine safety efforts prior to congressional intervention. 
   I'm equally concerned regarding the underlying bill which lacks provisions that would provide the Coast Guard the authority to protect seafarers who facilitate the government's ability to investigate and prosecute environmental crimes. This is another example where current law impedes our ability to prosecute criminals. 
   I would also like to express my concern with section 720 of the underlying bill which addresses security at liquefied natural gas facilities. Consistently, I have cast votes in favor of legislation which I believe will help to make our Nation energy independent. While there has not been focused attention on LNG, it remains a viable energy alternative. Therefore, I'm concerned by provisions that would designate the Coast Guard as the sole agency responsible for LNG security.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition to H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007. 
   I'd like to first comment on provisions in the underlying bill which affect the Deepwater program. We in Congress cannot lose sight of the purpose of Deepwater, which is to provide the men and women of the Coast Guard with the necessary tools to protect our homeland. I applaud actions undertaken to move this program in the right direction and support this  language. I remain concerned, however, that some provisions in H.R. 2830 may create undue burdens and delays which in turn will delay this desperately needed modernization and may ultimately add to the overall costs. 
   The marine safety components of the underlying bill also cause me concern. Previously, the Commandant announced a number of changes he had directed the Coast Guard to implement regarding marine safety.

On a daily basis, Coast Guard men and women focus on drug interdiction, environmental protection, migrant interdiction, port security, search and rescue, homeland security, and maritime safety. Each of these roles, in my opinion, complements the others. 
   I continue to support efforts to provide stakeholders an opportunity to voice their concerns, provide constructive feedback, and work together to improve the marine safety aspect of the Coast Guard. At the same time, I firmly believe that we should give the Coast Guard the time, opportunity, and resources to improve and expand upon its marine safety efforts prior to congressional intervention. 
   I am equally concerned the underlying bill lacks provisions that would provide the Coast Guard the authority to protect seafarers who facilitate the Government's ability to investigate and prosecute environmental crimes.

   I'd also like to express my concern with section 720 of the underlying bill which addresses security at liquefied natural gas facilities.

While there has not been focused attention on LNG, it remains a viable energy alternative. Therefore, I'm concerned by provisions that would designate the Coast Guard as the sole agency responsible for LNG security. In my opinion, this is neither reasonable nor practicable for the Coast Guard or the communities where these facilities currently exist. In my opinion, this provision will act as a barrier to entry for future facilities and result in higher energy prices for consumers. Later today or tomorrow, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting an amendment made in order which would strike this dangerous provision. 
   Finally, I'd like to address the inclusion of H.R. 2399, the Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act. It is my understanding that upon engrossment of H.R. 2830, this language will be included in the underlying bill. I support this action as maritime alien smuggling has become a business where smugglers game the system and have little to lose under the current law. The Coast Guard confronts smugglers on a routine basis who know they can use a lack of authority to their advantage. These kinds of cases are dangerous to our Coast Guard men and women and dangerous to the smuggled aliens and occur at increasing frequency. 
   This measure is necessary because it provides a tool for the Coast Guard and Department of Justice to ensure the integrity of our maritime borders. Currently, there are enormous procedural and jurisdictional hurdles that protect and actually embolden alien smugglers. It will begin to deter unsafe and inhumane sea-based smuggling by delivering enhanced consequences to those who flee from or lie to our Federal law enforcement officers. Later today or tomorrow, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Representative Lamar Smith, will offer an amendment to clarify this authority. While I support the underlying measure, I believe the Smith amendment augments this provision and merits adoption. 
   It is my hope that during the amendment process some of my concerns in the underlying bill will be alleviated, but as we speak I cannot support passage of H.R. 2830. That said, I look forward to working with my colleagues as this process moves forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1130, the Judicial Disclosure Act. The distinguished gentleman from Michigan and the distinguished gentleman from Texas, Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Smith, should be recognized for their leadership and efforts to shepherd this bipartisan legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense legislation that was unanimously approved by the House Judiciary Committee. It reauthorizes the Judicial Conference to redact certain personal and financial information that judges and judicial officers are required by the Ethics in Government Act to publicly disclose each year. 
   The authority was originally granted in 1998 and was subsequently renewed, but expired on December 31, 2005. This legislation extends the authority until 2009. 
   Under H.R. 1130, Mr. Speaker, Federal judges and judicial officers are still required to submit information required by the Ethics in Government Act. The Judicial Conference would be permitted to redact personal and sensitive information from public disclosure to protect the safety of our judges, judicial officers and their families. Examples of the information that may be redacted include where they reside, where their spouses work or where their children attend school. 
   The Judicial Conference reported in 2005 that 3,942 Federal judiciary employees filed financial disclosure reports. Only 177 reports were partially redacted prior to release. Four redacted reports were based on specific threats, and another 137 reports were redacted based on general threats. We know these threats are real, and it only makes common sense to ensure that we do not needlessly expose personal and sensitive information of the judiciary's top officers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to support H.R. 1130, and hope that the other body will provide for its expeditious consideration.

   Mr. COBLE. I thank my friend from Louisiana for yielding. 
   Last week, I voted ``no'' on this bill for two reasons. Number one, I don't like to hurriedly vote on significant legislation. I'd rather do it thoroughly and deliberately. 
   The second reason, my telephone calls and e-mails were overwhelming in opposition against the bill. On Monday I voted ``no.'' 
   The telephone calls and e-mails continued to be overwhelming, but guess what: Then in favor of the bill. Now I'm not exclusively dictated by telephone calls and e-mails, but neither do I dismiss them, Madam Speaker.     
   And I weighed this very carefully. And by having waited, I think we did improve the bill. 
   The increase of the FDIC threshold to $250,000, a good move; the AMT patch that will affect favorably 21 million middle class families, a good move; SEC, I am told, Madam Speaker, is addressing or has addressed the mark-to-market issue, a good approach. Compelling arguments can be proffered on both sides of this issue, but I believe, Madam Speaker, that inaction is not an option. 
   I don't believe the sky is falling. I was told that earlier and I refuted it. And I think when I disagree with the sky falling charge, that's not irregular for me to refute it. 
   Now, this vote for me, I am voting ``aye'' today, and it may be politically damaging. And the sky may fall tomorrow, but it will fall upon my head; it won't fall upon anyone else's, and no one else will be adversely affected. 
   I believe that the limited access to credit--and in many instances no access to credit--can certainly contribute to a crisis. And we can put on blinders and go one way or the other, but I think this is a bill that must be addressed today, it must be addressed in a positive way, both sides of the aisle. My friends to the left, my friends on this side have done a good job, I think, in crafting it, and I am pleased to announce that I am voting ``aye'' when the vote is called later.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in mild opposition to H.R. 580, primarily against the process rather than substantively. 
   Scrutiny over the dismissal of several U.S. Attorneys in recent days may have triggered this legislation. While we are still learning the facts surrounding those dismissals, it does remain clear that the U.S. Attorneys do indeed serve at the pleasure of the President. Some are calling for oversight investigation because of the political appearance surrounding those dismissals, and this is fine; but amending the appointment process for interim U.S. Attorneys I believe is the wrong response. 
   Prior to 1986, the district court appointed interim U.S. Attorneys to fill vacancies until a Presidential appointee had been nominated and confirmed by the Senate. In 1986, the process was changed to authorize the Attorney General to appoint an interim United States Attorney for 120 days, at which time, if the Senate had not confirmed a new United States Attorney, the district court would then appoint an interim to serve until a new permanent United States Attorney was indeed confirmed. 
   This process was not infallible. Some said authorizing the judiciary to appoint the prosecutors before their court created a conflict of interest, and I think a good argument can be made for that. Others said the Executive could maneuver the Constitution by terminating a court-appointed interim by repeatedly substituting its own interim for 120-day stints. A good argument could well be made for that as well. 
   In 2005, the process for appointing interim United States Attorneys, however, was changed once again. This was an amendment to section 546 of title 28, which eliminated the 120-day time limit for an Executive-appointed interim to serve and eliminated the authority for the district court to appoint an interim. 
   Unfortunately, one of these responses to the recent dismissals had been H.R. 580, which would return the process of appointing interim United States Attorneys for 120 days and authorizing the judiciary to appoint interims if a permanent United States Attorney is not confirmed prior to the 120-day passes. 
   The bill, H.R. 580, was accelerated through the Judiciary Committee. Only one hearing was held on the bill. That hearing focused mostly on the current U.S. Attorney controversy, not the bill itself. It was then heard by the full committee, but there was no opportunity for the Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial Administrative Law markup to therefore improve the bill.  
   Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, many of us, would have liked to have worked with the Democrats in a bipartisan fashion more thoroughly, and I think we may have come at the finish line with a more favorable finished product. Given more time, we might have considered some promising ideas. For instance, this bill does not address the problem of appointing and confirming United States Attorneys in a timely fashion. Senators KYL and SESSIONS introduced amendments in the Senate proposing several other responses to inherent conflicts created by United States Attorney vacancies and possible ways to provide for interims. 
   In these times of the war on terror, Mr. Speaker and colleagues, and the continuing age-old war on crime, the service of the United States Attorneys, indeed the front line of Federal law enforcement, is more than ever a matter of first importance to the Nation. Their appointment is serious business. We should not have rushed to judgment in attending to this business, but instead have given the legislative process more time to work. I think we missed an opportunity to improve the bill as a result. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 137, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007, creates Federal felony penalties for animal fighting. The distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Gallegly) is the lead sponsor of this bill with over 300 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. 
   The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act increases criminal penalties for illegal dog fighting and cockfighting. The act, furthermore, imposes penalties for the interstate promotion of animal fighting and the interstate transportation of animals for use in an animal fighting venture. 
   All 50 States, Mr. Speaker, prohibit dog fighting, and 48 States prohibit cockfighting. Louisiana and New Mexico, the two States that do, in fact, allow cockfighting, may take up legislation to ban the practice as early as this year. 
   According to the Humane Society, animal fighting, particularly cockfighting, has become an interstate venture with small syndicates of cockfighters moving across the country staging these different fights. Animal fighting is also linked oftentimes with other criminal conduct such as drug trafficking, illegal firearms sales, and gang activity. 
   By raising this offense from a misdemeanor to a felony, we are more likely to deter illegal animal fighting and increase the likelihood that Federal prosecutors will pursue these cases. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

   Since that time, hundreds of thousands of Azoreans and other Portuguese have migrated to the United States. They have made important contributions to many aspects of American society and the American economy. They are most well-known for their contributions to America's fishing and dairy industries.

   I rise in support of H.R. 6853, the Nationwide Mortgage Fraud Task Force Act of 2008. I appreciate the willingness of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to address some concerns that we had with the bill. 
   However, I understand that despite improvements to the bill, there was a rush to bring it to the floor. The Judiciary Committee held no hearings or markups on the bill. At a minimum, the committee could have sought the input of FBI Director Mueller when he appeared before our committee last Tuesday. Unfortunately, however, we were not aware of the majority desire to move this legislation at that time. 
   The subprime mortgage crisis has taken a toll on millions of Americans across the country. Inflated housing prices, combined with fluctuating mortgage interest rates, have left many homeowners struggling to make their monthly mortgage payments or, worse, facing foreclosure on their homes. 
   Many factors have contributed to this crisis, including predatory lending by corrupt lenders, mortgage fraud and even foreclosure fraud. Estimated losses for mortgage fraud are between 4 and 6 billion dollars, with $813 million in losses in fiscal year 2007 alone. 
   According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the western region of the United States led the Nation with 37 percent of mortgage fraud-related reports filed during fiscal year 2007. States with the most significant mortgage fraud problems in 2008 include Florida, Nevada, Michigan, California, Utah, Georgia, Virginia, Illinois, New York and Minnesota. Other States significantly affected by mortgage fraud included Arizona, Maryland, Utah, Nevada, Missouri, Indiana, Tennessee, Virginia, New Jersey and Connecticut. 
   Clearly this is a nationwide problem. The FBI has been actively investigating mortgage fraud since 1999. In his testimony before our Judiciary Committee last week, FBI Director Robert Mueller informed us that 42 FBI mortgage fraud task forces are currently handling 1,400 mortgage fraud investigations across the country. This includes 24 investigations into large-scale corporate fraud. The FBI's Operation Malicious Mortgage is an immense multiagency operation focused primarily on three types of mortgage fraud, lending fraud, foreclosure rescue schemes and mortgage-related bankruptcy schemes. 
   As of June, this operation has nabbed more than 400 defendants, 173 convictions, and 81 sentencings in crimes accounting for more than $1 billion in estimated losses. Just last month, in my home State of North Carolina, four defendants were indicted in Federal court for using various fraud schemes, including inflated property values and false representations to lenders to secure financing for the purchase of property and mobile homes. 
   H.R. 6853 lends additional support to the FBI for its mortgage fraud investigations and provides additional tools to State and local law enforcement. The bill designates the chief of the FBI's Financial Crimes Section as the nationwide mortgage fraud coordinator and directs her to oversee all mortgage fraud investigations, provide additional training to State and local law enforcement, and collect and report annual mortgage fraud data to the Congress. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues for amending the bill to address our objections and concerns, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5352, the Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2008. I wish to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for having worked with the Judiciary Committee Republicans to address our concern with this bill. I am pleased that we now have legislation before us that enjoys bipartisan support. 
   Elder abuse is a serious problem facing our older Americans. Adults over the age of 50 account for 12 percent of our Nation's murder victims and 7 percent of other serious and violent crime victims, and our eldest seniors, those over 80 years of age, are abused and neglected at two to three times the proportion of all other senior citizens. 
   With the population of people aged 85 or older expected to double by 8.9 million by the year 2030, the problem is inevitably sure to grow. H.R. 5352, the Elder Abuse Victims Act, seeks to curb these acts of abuse against the elderly. The bill authorizes grants to State and local law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts to aid in the investigation and prosecution of elder abuse. 
   The bill directs the Justice Department to complete a study of State laws and practices relating to elder abuse,  neglect and exploitation. The bill also directs the Department to develop a long-term plan addressing the prevention and detection of elder abuse, intervention and treatment of victims, and training and evaluation of elder abuse programs. The National Institute of Justice within the Department has been studying elder justice issues for several years and issued a preliminary report on the subject in 2006. It is fitting that the National Institute of Justice continue its work and undertake the study directed by this legislation. 
   During the Judiciary Committee markup of H.R. 5352, we expanded the scope of these grants to include identity theft, mail fraud, and telemarketing fraud as additional types of victimization for elder abuse grants. The bill now also authorizes the Department of Justice to award grants for electronic monitoring of older Americans. These funds will support monitoring programs offered by local law enforcement agencies and first responders to locate missing elderly. 
   These changes, among others, have improved H.R. 5352 and will assist States with protecting our senior citizens and prosecuting elder abuse. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, I am in opposition to the proposed tax increase as a source of funding for the SCHIP program. 
   Tobacco is lawfully grown, marketed and consumed, and tobacco manufacturers to growers, Madam Speaker, employ thousands of citizens in my State, hundreds in my district. These manufacturers and growers, small and large, provide well-paying jobs and make valuable contributions to their communities. 
   At one time, Madam Speaker, tobacco was king. Now it is a beleaguered industry; yet it remains a convenient whipping boy regarding the raising of revenue for this body. 
   When SCHIP was authorized and debated a decade ago, I did not support it because of its potential to become one more entitlement program that would, in time, cost more than what's projected. It has, Madam Speaker, surpassed my apprehensions in cost and scope. 
   Today, CBO projects that this expansion would cost nearly $87 billion over the next 5 years. This has led to the proposal that billions of dollars be cut from Medicare providers such as hospitals and health care services, coupled with the increase in the tobacco tax, to finance this expansion. 
   I cannot condone such an abuse of taxpayers for a program that would take from one group of vulnerable citizens to expand services to citizens, in many instances, who are less vulnerable.

   Mr. COBLE. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill before us. 
   All crimes are deplorable, particularly when they are motivated by some form of discrimination. But this bill, in my opinion, does nothing to prevent these acts. States and Federal governments traditionally prosecute hate crimes now. I agree with the argument that this bill would unfairly classify crimes against certain groups of people, and ignore others such as law enforcement, children, veterans or senior citizens who deserve the same degree of protection.     
   I am concerned that this legislation will lead to unseemly investigations, possibly into thoughts and beliefs, which could have the effect of criminalizing religious or political speech. 
   Furthermore, I understand that the legislation does not have a nexus with interstate commerce that would survive a constitutional challenge. 
   I understand the need to protect vulnerable people, Mr. Speaker, and I support funding to help community safety and to prosecute criminals, but I cannot support this legislation. 
   Oftentimes, Mr. Speaker, those of us who oppose hate crime legislation are accused of being uncaring and insensitive. Now, to those charges I plead ``not guilty,'' but I oppose this, among other reasons, because hate crime legislation is duplicative. There is sufficient statutory relief readily available now to aggrieved victims. There is such a thing as having too many laws, and I think this would result if we enact this today, and I urge its defeat.

<DOCNO>Mr. COBLE. (CELEBRATING 75 YEARS OF EFFECTIVE STATE-BASED ALCOHOL REGULATION -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas who serves very ably as our ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of H. Con. Res 415. This resolution celebrates the 75th anniversary of the end of Prohibition. Furthermore, it recognizes our effective regulation of alcohol by State and local governments and the dedication of our State lawmakers, regulators, law enforcement officers, the public health community, and industry members for creating a workable, legal and successful system of alcohol regulation, distribution and sale. 
   Prohibition, Mr. Speaker, began in 1919, when the 18th amendment was ratified. This led to a dramatic increase in illegal activity, including unsafe black market alcohol production, a growth in organized crime, and increasing noncompliance with alcohol laws. As a result, only 14 years later, on December 5, 1933, the 21st amendment was ratified, which repealed Prohibition and granted to the States control of alcohol. 
   The 21st amendment wisely established a State-based regulatory system for alcohol. This has permitted each State to adopt laws that reflect the views of its citizens. The result has been one of most comprehensive and community-sensitive alcohol regulatory programs in the world. Furthermore, it has created a safe and reliable marketplace for alcohol. Our consumers are free now from the threat of the harmful chemicals that were unknowingly consumed during the Prohibition Era. 
   For 75 years, local regulation has worked well. And while alcohol laws are continually tweaked and improved, adjusted and amended, our beer, liquor and wine providers have worked diligently together with regulators to ensure that public health and safety are first and foremost. 
   Many beer distributors who strongly support this resolution and recently concluded their national meeting in San Francisco play a vital role in their respective communities by sponsoring a vast array of programs that promote responsible consumption. The programs range from providing free taxi rides home for restaurant patrons who do not have a designated driver, to sponsoring alcohol-free after prom events and producing educational materials to assist parents in talking to their children about underage drinking. 
   Distributors also promote alcohol education initiatives that bring guest speakers into local schools and community centers. Some of these speakers who have made mistakes about alcohol, just as the distinguished gentleman from Texas mentioned earlier, became reckless and abandoned discretion and responsible drinking, but they have overcome those mistakes and have lived to retell their stories, and therefore, encourage others not to make the same mistakes. 
   The beer industry, Mr. Speaker, I'm sure in probably every district represented on this floor, creates innumerable job opportunities. The beer industry, furthermore, has spent nearly $700 million in communities across the country to fight and oppose drunk driving, underage drinking, and promote responsible consumption of alcohol through public safety, prevention and education campaigns. 
   Additionally, the National Beer Wholesalers Association was instrumental in working with Congress to pass the STOP Underage Drinking bill, which was signed by President Bush in December of 2006.     
   Mr. Speaker, there are many alcohol vendors in my district in North Carolina who devote enormous amounts of time and money to improve the lives of people in our communities. They have openly supported community efforts for organizations such as United Cerebral Palsy, the Special Olympics, law enforcement, the Greensboro Children's Museum, the Greensboro Economic Development Partnership, the Rockwell Project for alcohol awareness at Greensboro area high schools, the Hospice of Greensboro, and others. 
   Many of these vendors have also unanimously supported countless other efforts throughout the Sixth District of North Carolina. I'm sure many of you can duplicate that in your respective districts. 
   The benefits vary from community to community. While there are sound reasons that alcohol should be regulated, it is clear to me that we should recognize and celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of Prohibition. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 415. 
   Again, I thank the gentleman from Texas for having yielded to me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. I thank the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose deploying 20,000 additional troops to Iraq. Oh, if you oppose the surge, the troops will be demoralized, we are told. The five ``d'' words will be prominently exposed this week as my friend just mentioned: debate, dialogue, discipline, deliberation, and democracy. 
   The troop morale will be adversely affected because we are involved with these disciplines? I think not. I believe they would more readily be demoralized if we were willy-nilly rubber-stamping every issue confronting us. 
   I approved of removing Saddam Hussein because it is my belief, and I continue to believe it is the general consensus of this Congress, that Saddam was indeed an international terrorist. I regret that we were inept in formulating a post-entry strategy. I am not convinced that any particular strategy was ever in place. 
   It is unfortunate and, yes, unfair, that many people, strike that, some people, perhaps many people, are blaming President Bush, the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and our other allies for the civil unrest in Iraq. Saddam was removed and a free election was conducted, so the Iraqi people were given a choice between freedom and civil war. Unfortunately, they chose the latter. They rejected freedom and chose civil war. And the longer we maintain a presence there, the more they will rely upon us. The time has come, in my opinion, for the baton to be handed to the Iraqis. 
   Finally, permit me to discuss cutting and running. Oh, you cannot leave; you will be accused of cutting and running, we are told. If we had removed Saddam, which most Iraqis wanted, and then withdrew 4 or 5 weeks later, or even 4 or 5 months later, that would have constituted cutting and running. But we have been there for years, Mr. Speaker. Over 3,100 of our troops have given the ultimate sacrifice, in excess of 25,000 have suffered injuries, many permanent disabling injuries. This is sacrifice, not cutting and running. And I insist that we do not maintain an eternal presence in Iraq if for no other reason than the cost to the taxpayers, which has been astronomically unbelievable. 
   In excess of 2 years, Mr. Speaker, I have stressed the importance of retaining troop withdrawal as a viable option. Early on, virtually no one was even remotely considering withdrawal. I believe withdrawal is not unsound for the reasons I have previously cited. 
   Some Americans and perhaps some in this body oppose the Iraqi operation because they dislike President Bush. I, however, do not march to that drum. I am personally very high on President Bush. But on the matter of troop escalation, I am not in agreement. 
   The noted British statesman Edmund Burke, while addressing Solicitors at Bristol many years ago said, ``As your representative, I owe you my industry, but I also owe you my judgment. And if I sacrifice my judgment for your opinion,'' he said, ``I have not served you well.'' 
   Some of my constituents will embrace my vote as demonstrating sound judgment. Others will likely reject my vote as a result of flawed judgment. 
   Not only do I owe my best judgment to my constituents, but to our troops as well, who we continue to remember in our thoughts and prayers. 
   I thank the Speaker and I thank the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us. The cost of maintaining our Federal, State and local prisons is ballooning out of control. We must continue to enforce our criminal laws, but we cannot ignore the fact that most of the people who are released from incarceration are likely to return. The Second Chance Act will support programs that help prisoners reenter society which is essential to reducing recidivism. 
   We can expect, Mr. Speaker, over half of the adult prisoners who are to be released around the country this year will be rearrested again and likely will return to prison. This cycle is overwhelming our criminal system, it is overwhelming our prisons, and it is costing more than $90 billion every year, $50 billion as far as Federal institutions are concerned. 
   I am in agreement that stiff sentences serve a good purpose. Criminals must know if they violate the law, they will be punished. But when we seeing growing numbers of ex-offenders returning to our prisons, something in the system is not working. Something, Mr. Speaker, is flawed. 
   The Second Chance Act is endorsed by the Council of State Governments, the National Sheriffs Association, the American Bar Association, and countless religious organizations from around the Nation. For some time many of you have heard me express alarm and concern about the dangers of prison overcrowding. It is a ticking bomb waiting to explode. 
   In my district, in fact, there is a county jail that is bursting at the seams. We can begin to defuse this bomb today by passing the Second Chance Act and supporting programs that reduce recidivism. 
   Now, much has been said about the cost. And I will stipulate, I will say to my friend from Texas, it is costly. But if the Second Chance Act proves to be effective, I believe it is realistic for us to conclude it will result in saving taxpayer money because to house prisoners is a costly operation. 
   Rarely do I disagree with my colleague from Texas, but on this occasion we are going to disagree agreeably. I think this is a good proposal. I heartily endorse it. 
   Chairman Scott, you remember I chaired, along with you, two hearings in the last Congress, and I believe this is the third time it has passed the House Judiciary Committee, if the gentleman from Michigan will corroborate that.

   But the beneficiaries of this game, Mr. Speaker, are the underdogs, the little guys who are given little or no chance of tasting the spoils of victory. Appalachian's Mountaineers and Michigan's Wolverines will post impressive records during the 2007 season.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Chairman, aviation is a growing industry in the 6th Congressional District of North Carolina, and therefore my interest in the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration stems from both a consumer and industry perspective. I'd like to take a few moments to highlight some provisions in H.R. 2881 which are beneficial to my area and others which cause concern. 
   There is a vibrant general aviation community within North Carolina, and many of the airports in my district are dependent upon the Airport Improvement Program to fund necessary infrastructure improvements. I am pleased that this legislation builds upon this successful program. It is my hope that as the bill moves forward, we will continue to seek ways to augment, and even create incentives, within the AlP program because it is a vital tool for economic development. 
   In addition, I remain supportive of the Small Community Air Services Development Program which is reauthorized in H.R. 2881. I have seen first-hand the success this program has had in my district, and believe that it is another tool which encourages community development, particularly in rural areas. 
   I'm also pleased that the bill before us takes the initial steps to modernize and update our air traffic control system. While I don't pretend to understand the technology, I do believe that upgrading our current air traffic control system will create more efficient and effective management of our airways. I'm hopeful that this investment, coupled with improving infrastructure, will help to alleviate much of the delays and cancellations that each of us currently face all too often when we go to the airport. We still have much work to do, but I believe this bill is a step in the right direction. 
   There are also areas in the base bill which concern me. I have nothing but the utmost respect for the air traffic controllers of this Nation, and especially those that live and work within my district. I have had frank and constructive conversations on a variety of issues with them in the past several months. 
   Despite that, I still have reservations about the intent and ramifications of the language in the base bill which would reopen the recently implemented contract. First and foremost, the issue of back pay concerns me from a fiscal and fairness perspective. Regardless of whether you support or oppose the current contract, to simply invalidate the contract, in my opinion, undermines the bargaining process. Further, I remain concerned at the effect this amendment will have on our Nation's taxpayers. 
   Additionally, I remain concerned by language in the bill which would require non-pilot employees to be covered under the National Labor Relations Act. This language, which is directed at one express shipping company, in my opinion could undermine the national transportation network and create many unintended consequences. 
   As this bill moves forward, I hope that we can continue to work towards modernizing our air traffic control system and also resolve issues where there is disagreement. Because of the concerns outlined above, I intend to oppose the base bill, but do so recognizing that there are provisions which I support.

<DOCNO>Mr. COBLE. (ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROGRAM IN CERTAIN DISTRICT COURTS TO ENCOURAGE ENHANCEMENT OF EXPERTISE IN PATENT CASES AMONG DISTRICT JUDGES -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   And I probably won't use 5 minutes, but, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 34, a bill to establish a pilot program in certain United States district courts to encourage enhancement of expertise in patent cases among district judges, is a bill that deserves the continued support of the Members of the House. As has been indicated both by Mr. Berman and Mr. Smith, drafted by Representatives ISSA and SCHIFF, this bipartisan legislation was passed unanimously by the House last year, but due to the press of time the other body did not consider the measure. With House action early in this Congress, we will be able to ensure our colleagues on the other side of the Hill have maximum  opportunity to fully and fairly consider this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that our Nation's patent laws have become the subject of much scrutiny and debate. Indeed, Judiciary Committee Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH and the chairman of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee, Representative HOWARD BERMAN, with whom I look forward to working this Congress, have been leaders in developing substantive and comprehensive reforms to our Nation's patent system. The further consideration of these proposals is the IP Subcommittee's highest priority this Congress. I am encouraged and hopeful that we will be able to look back at the end of the 110th Congress satisfied that we ran the course and completed this important task. 
   But there is related work this House can complete immediately that will serve as a step in the right direction. By passing H.R. 34, a commonsense and narrowly tailored measure that will provide designated Federal district judges the opportunity to improve their expertise in the handling of patent cases, the House will be taking an early, positive first step along the road to comprehensive patent reform. 
   Mr. Speaker, a typical Federal district judge may preside over no more than three or four, five at the most, patent cases which are litigated to conclusion during the course of his or her career. Patent cases comprise only 1 percent of cases filed in Federal court, yet they make up nearly 10 percent of complex cases. The timely and appropriate resolution of these cases is vital to uphold the rights of individual litigants. But it also serves the larger interests of consumers and the economy. 
   Patent litigation, Mr. Speaker, is characterized by disputes that involve the interaction of numerous parties, the integration of sophisticated technologies, and the application of technical aspects of substantive patent law by judges who are rarely presented with such cases. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 34 is a modest bill that will enable a small number of these district judges to be designated to gain additional experience and resources in handling these cases, the outcome of which is so crucial to our economy. 
   This legislation also includes safeguards to prevent these districts from being used to promote ``forum shopping'' as well as provisions to ensure that the Congress is provided with useful periodic reports on the progress of this new initiative. 
   Again, I thank the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Berman), the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), and Representatives SCHIFF and ISSA for their work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I recall several years ago, when we were discussing proposed patent legislation before a crowded hearing room, and I remember one Member saying to the crowd, he said, I have friends for this bill, I have friends opposed to this bill, and I want to make it clear, he said to that group, I'm for my friends. Well, we don't do it quite that easily; easier said than done. But as has been mentioned before, the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Berman) and I, along with the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Michigan, we've plowed this field before. And I've heard many argue that H.R. 1908 undermines everything that we accomplished in 1999 when the American Inventors Protection Act was implemented. 
   Madam Chairman, this is simply inaccurate. Mr. Berman and I shepherded that legislation which, among other things, created patent reexamination, banned deceptive practices, clarified the term for patents, required that patents be published before they're granted, and made the Patent Office independent within the Department of Commerce, among other things. 
   As our domestic economy becomes increasingly dependent on the global economy, Madam Chairman, so, too, does our patent system. 
   Other challenges stem from the marketplace. As our domestic economy becomes increasingly dependent on the global economy, so does the patent system. In many international markets, patent protection is one certainty on which American manufacturers can rely when they are trying to compete internationally. 
   H.R. 1908 addresses these challenges in several respects. First, the bill implements a first-to-file patent system, which is in line with other countries and will streamline the patent review and issuance process. 
   Other provisions in the bill dealing with willful infringement, post-grant opposition, publication, inequitable conduct and best mode will also help improve patent issuance and patent quality. 
   By improving patent quality, patent disputes and litigation should be reduced, and patent examiners' ability to perform the daunting task of searching scores of records and files should improve greatly. 
   Unfortunately, H.R. 1908 has not enjoyed universal support. Several key stakeholders have voiced concerns and objections which cannot be overlooked. And I understand that many, if not all, of the changes in the manager's amendment will address many concerns, but I am still troubled that another key coalition may not endorse H.R. 1908 at the end of today's debate. Many of these companies in this coalition, unfortunately for me, are either located in or near my district, and I'm concerned that anything in H.R. 1908 would adversely affect them. 
   So while I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1908, I do not mean to cast  any aspersions upon those who may very well have meritorious concern, particularly dealing with applicant responsibility and how any change to the rule for calculating infringement damages could impact the value of their patents. 
   That being said, Madam Chairman, I know that Chairman Berman, the distinguished gentleman from California, the distinguished gentleman from Texas, the Ranking Member Smith, have accepted all criticisms in good faith and have worked diligently to forge some sort of compromise where it has been possible. I hope that after today we will continue to pursue compromise so that with some good fortune we may convince all stakeholders to support what I believe is needed patent reform. 
   And I say to the gentleman from Texas, I thank you for having yielded.

I thank the gentleman from Texas and, Mr. Speaker, at the outset I, too, want to recognize and express thanks to Judiciary Chairman  JOHN CONYERS, Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH, and Subcommittee Chairman HOWARD BERMAN for having made every effort to address all concerns raised during the development of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008 reflects a bipartisan recognition and shared commitment to the strengthening of our Nation's intellectual property laws. 
   A comprehensive measure, it is not confined to making marginal improvements in the available civil and criminal authorities. Instead, it incorporates bold and urgently needed provisions that will permanently elevate the importance of intellectual property, IP, enforcement in future administrations. 
   This is accomplished by providing focused and accountable strategic leadership in the Executive Office of the President and at key enforcement agencies. 
   Mr. Speaker, in considering why we should take steps to improve the enforcement of U.S. IP rights, Members should be aware that U.S. losses from global copyright piracy and counterfeiting cost our innovators and entrepreneurs from $200 to $250 billion each and every year. 
   The impact in America has been widespread. More than 750,000 Americans in communities across our land have lost their jobs due to counterfeiting and piracy. Counterfeit goods lack proper quality control and can be dangerous. Toothpaste, medicines, cigarettes, and fake auto parts are but a small sample of the virtually unlimited supply of goods that have been counterfeited. 
   The United States Chamber of Commerce has done an excellent job of documenting the extent of this problem. I encourage anyone interested in learning about these issues to visit the Chamber's Web site for additional information or to take the time to watch the documentary Illicit which was produced by National Geographic and the Chamber. 
   Mr. Speaker, fighting piracy and counterfeiting, as you all know, is easier said than done because most of this illicit activity occurs outside our borders. In recent years, the Federal Government has made progress in improving both our domestic and global enforcement efforts, but it is also clear that achieving success in the fight against piracy and counterfeiting requires government-wide coordination and cooperation. 
   In addition to authorizing the Office of the United States Intellectual Property Enforcement Representative, H.R. 4279 also raises the profile of IP enforcement within the Department of Justice through the creation of a new IP enforcement division. This is absolutely necessary in my opinion. 
   The bill creates an additional 10 attaches at the United States Patent and Trademark Office who will be assigned to work with foreign countries to better coordinate our international enforcement efforts. 
   And the bill enhances existing anti-piracy and counterfeiting criminal statutes, authorizes grants to assist local anti-piracy and counterfeiting efforts, and directs the Justice Department to refine its policies for investigating and prosecuting piracy and counterfeiting operations. 
   Before closing, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to note for the record three final amendments the managers agreed to incorporate into the bill. The first is designed to harmonize the cooperative provisions in title II of the bill. 
   The second, in section 301, places an affirmative limitation on the authority of the new IP enforcement representative that makes clear the official has no authority to control or direct law enforcement agencies in the exercise of their respective investigative or prosecutorial discretion in particular cases. 
   And the third, which amends section 323 of the bill, simply contains technical and conforming changes to make the text of the bill clearer. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize some of the stakeholders who have worked so diligently on this effort. Specifically, I'd like to note the efforts of the Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy, which has been so ably led by Mr. Rick Cotton; and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which, of course, is led by President Tom Donohue; and the Congressional International Anti-Piracy Caucus, which is led by Representatives ADAM SCHIFF of California and BOB GOODLATTE of Virginia. 
   In closing, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4279, and I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas for having yielded to me.

   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding. We are in disagreement about the proposed COLA. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the proposed cost-of-living allowance increase because it is ill-timed. I represent constituents, as do many of you, who earn $25,000 to $35,000 annually, and they read that the Congress approves a COLA increase for themselves. Not good. 
   According to recent polls, Americans don't like the Congress. Our numbers, lower than President Bush's numbers, are in the tank. To enact this COLA proposal will do nothing, in my opinion, to improve our already diminished reputation. 
   Mr. Speaker, my fiscal philosophy is very simple: Taxpayers pay our salaries, and beyond that, in my opinion, they owe us little more. I have refused a congressional pension, so when I leave the Congress I will receive not one brown penny of congressional pension money, because I don't believe taxpayers owe me a congressional pension just because I served in the Congress. By the same reasoning, Mr. Speaker, I don't believe they owe us a  cost-of-living allowance increase at this time. Do we deserve a cost-of-living allowance increase? Probably. Is now the time to enact a cost-of-living increase? Probably not. 
   Mr. Dreier, my good friend, you and I are in disagreement on this, but we can do so agreeably, hopefully. 
   Anytime you are talking about money, Mr. Speaker, sometimes emotions become frayed, and volatile activity may result. But I don't want to offend anybody, especially the gentleman who yielded to me. But I feel very strongly about this, and I thank you, Mr. Dreier, for having yielded to me.

   Every year our economy loses an excess of $200 billion to counterfeiting. This has directly impacted many American businesses and also cost our country countless jobs. Today, counterfeiting has grown into a global and illicit black market trade.

   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Chairman, when it comes to earmarks, it's easy for me to embrace my earmark as good government and reject your earmark as wasteful pork. By the same token, it's easy for you all to embrace your respective earmarks as good government and reject mine as useless, wasteless pork. That probably amounts to hypocrisy, but it is nonetheless a political fact of life. 
   Now, when you talk about the textile industry, I become very subjectively involved. My late momma was a machine operator in a hosiery mill. She later worked for the Blue Bell Corporation, which was the predecessor to the Wrangler and the VF Corporation. Her job was to sew pockets on overalls, a tedious, demanding job, before the days of air conditioning, I might add. So when people gang up on the textile industry, they are ganging up on my momma. It bothers me. 
   We could talk all day here. Many of my friends from North Carolina, we represent what was recognized as the buckle of the textile belt. It's a beleaguered industry, and we don't need to be piling on at this juncture. 
   My friend from North Carolina (Mr. Price) has already suggested the significance, but let me repeat it. 
   The National Textile Center, NTC, and the Textile/Clothing Technology Corporation, [TC]2, play a critical role in helping the U.S. textile and apparel industry, which currently employs over 600,000 workers nationwide and contributes nearly $60 billion to the Nation's gross national product on an annual basis to compete with textile manufacturers in other countries. 
   It should also be noted that the industry is a primary supplier of employment to women and minority workers, with many of these jobs located in depressed and rural areas as well as major inner cities. 
   The NTC is proven and provides a highly effective structure for maximizing fundamental research and development efforts of value to the textile and apparel industrial sector. The value of new textile products and processes that have been created by NTC research is over $300 million, nearly three times the Federal investment in NTC to date. 
   [TC]2 is engaged in helping to transform the U.S. textile and apparel industry into a highly flexible supply chain, capable of responding to rapidly changing market demands. During calendar year 2006, 60 percent of [TC]2's  annual budget was supplied by the private sector. [TC]2 expects at least 55 percent of its 2007 funding to be provided by the private sector. To date, the public investment alone in [TC]2 has produced technology advancement valued in excess of $375 million, a return of more than 400 percent. 
   These programs do not specifically benefit any particular congressional district. They are an important element of our national textile industry which once led the world but, as has been noted, is now struggling to keep pace. 
   The textile industry needs these programs and our support, which have proven to be a wise investment in the past. This is why this amendment should be defeated. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This statement that I am about to read is the statement of Congressman JOE BARTON, the distinguished gentleman from Texas, who I am told is in transit and is not able to be here: 
   I rise in support of the bill before us today, which extends the programs of transitional medical assistance and the title V abstinence education program. I am pleased that the Congress is able to work together to extend funding for these programs. 
   I believe it is important that we support the goals of abstinence education and not get bogged down by the politics that inevitably surround the concept. Our school children deserve the opportunity to receive an education regarding the merits of an abstinent life-style. Title V funds are optional for States, and it does not prohibit the funding and teaching of contraceptive-based programs. 
   Abstinence education provides teens the opportunities to learn about the ramifications of sexual activity including pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. As I am sure many of my colleagues would attest, I have heard from numerous programs within my State, and I am sure in the State of Texas from where Mr. Barton hails, that rely on this Federal funding. They believe in the program and hope to continue providing abstinence education opportunities to local teens. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate my support for this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 660, the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. This legislation is a bipartisan effort, as the chairman just mentioned, to improve the security of those who administer our justice system, as well as those who serve as witnesses, victims, and their families. 
   In recent years, Mr. Speaker, we have seen an increase in violence and threats against judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, law enforcement officers, courthouse employees; and the list is virtually endless. It is critical that we address this violence in order to preserve the integrity of, and the public confidence in, our justice system. 
   The murders of family members of U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow and the brutal slayings of Judge Rowland Barton and his court personnel in Atlanta are just a few of the many examples that underscore the need to better protect those who serve our judiciary and their respective families. 
   According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, almost 700 threats a year are made against Federal judges. In numerous cases, it has been necessary to assign Federal judges security details for fear of attack by terrorists, violent gangs, drug organizations, and disgruntled litigants. 
   The problem of witness intimidation and threats has also continued to grow, particularly at the State and local levels, where few resources are available to protect witnesses, victims, and their families. 
   H.R. 660 improves coordination between the United States Marshals Service and the Federal judiciary and bolsters security measures for Federal prosecutors handling the dangerous trials against terrorists, drug organizations, and other organized crime figures. 
   This bill also prohibits public disclosure on the Internet and other public sources of personal information about judges, law enforcement officers, victims, and witnesses, and protects Federal judges and prosecutors from organized efforts to harass and intimidate them through false filings of liens or other encumbrances against personal property. 
   Additionally, H.R. 660 provides grants to State and local courts to improve their security services. I want to thank the majority for working with us to include other important provisions that were not in the original legislation. 
   Under our bipartisan agreement, the legislation we consider today, Mr. Speaker, also contains increased criminal penalties for assaults against Federal law enforcement officers, makes permanent the redaction authority for judges filing ethics disclosure forms, and reauthorizes the Presidential Threat Task Forces. 
   Although we were unable to include in this legislation a provision that ensures retired and off-duty police officers permission to carry firearms under a Federal law enacted in 2004, I appreciate Chairman Conyers' and Subcommittee Chairman Scott's promise to move and pass on suspension the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2007, which accomplishes that goal. 
   It is imperative, it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that we continue to work together on a bipartisan effort to ensure that judges, witnesses, courthouse personnel, and law enforcement officers do not have to face threats and violence when discharging their duties. 
   At the State and local level there is a dire need to provide basic security services in the courtroom and for witnesses. H.R. 660 represents a significant first step in this area. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I served as chairman of the Crimes Subcommittee in the previous Congress, the House passed legislation to improve court security, only to see it die in the other body. I commend Chairman Conyers, the distinguished gentleman from Michigan; Ranking Member Smith, distinguished gentleman from Texas; as well as Crime Subcommittee Chairman Scott, the distinguished gentleman from Virginia; and another distinguished gentleman from Virginia, Representative Forbes, for their continued leadership on this issue, and hope that we can successfully get this legislation across the finish line. 
   Finally, I want to acknowledge what Chairman Conyers did, what Ranking  Subcommittee Chairman BOBBY SCOTT did, and the effects, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, of Congressman LOUIE GOHMERT, the distinguished gentleman from Texas who himself is a former judge. These three gentlemen were tireless advocates for better judicial security, and I urge my colleagues to support this critical bipartisan measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. COBLE. (INTERSTATE RECOGNITION OF NOTARIZATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Representative Aderholt's bill eliminates unnecessary impediments in handling the everyday transactions of individuals and businesses. Many documents executed and notarized in one State, either by design or happenstance, find their way into neighboring or more distant States. A document should not be refused admission to support or defend a claim in court solely on the ground it was not notarized in the State where the Court sits. H.R. 1979 ensures this will not result. 
   A notarization, in and of itself, Mr. Speaker, neither validates a document nor speaks to the truthfulness or accuracy of its contents. The notarization serves a different function. It verifies that a document's signer is who he or she purports to be and has willingly signed or executed the document. 
   By executing the appropriate certificate, the notary public, as a disinterested party to the transaction, informs all other parties relying upon or using the document that it is the act of the person who signed it. 
   H.R. 1979 compels a court to accept the authenticity of the document, even though the notarization was performed in a State other than where the form is located. This reaffirms the importance of the notarial act. 
   Mr. Speaker, after hearing testimony on this subject before the Judiciary Committee during the 109th Congress, I have concluded that the refusal of one State to accept the validity of another State's notarized document in an intrastate legal proceeding is just plain provincial and insular. 
   Some of the examples were based on petty reasons. For example, one State requires a notary to affix an ink stamp to a document, an act that is not recognized in a sister State that may well require documents to be notarized with a raised, embossed seal. 
   Passing this bill will streamline interstate commercial and legal transactions consistent with the guarantees of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution. Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the chief sponsor of the bill, the distinguished gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), for such time as he may consume.

   Mr. COBLE. In closing, Mr. Speaker, this addresses a problem that has come across my path many times. Back home, Mr. Conyers, I don't know about you in Michigan, but in North Carolina, I hear this complaint frequently. A document properly notarized in one State, and then as I said, it must be by happenstance, crosses a State line and goes to another State, and then, of course, denial rears her ugly head, and all sorts of confusion results.     
   So this addresses a problem that needs to be fixed, and I think this legislation does it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. I thank the gentlelady from Florida for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I voted against the surge. And for 2 1/2 years, I have said that we need to keep the troop withdrawal issue on the table, but I have also said during that time that the date for withdrawal should be reserved for the commanders on the ground. 
   The bill before us was not introduced until yesterday, and in my opinion, it is vague, at best; generously laced again, in my opinion, with politics. 
   I excel at an understatement, Mr. Speaker, when I declare that this war has been mismanaged. It was appropriate to remove Saddam, an international terrorist, but there was never, in my opinion, a post-entry strategy; therefore, mismanagement. 
   The Iraq issue, Mr. Speaker, is neither as favorable as its proponents contend, nor as unfavorable as its opponents profess. The good news is the evil-driven terrorists have not attacked us again. And I am confident that many moderate Muslims do not embrace the useless killing and destruction of property that has occurred in Iraq, but their silent vocal opposition has been disappointing, at best. The Iraqi Government has been disappointing as well, and we need to insist upon more compliance it seems to me. 
   But given all the facts surrounding this matter, Mr. Speaker, I believe this Chamber is well-advised to wait until September. We're told that the general will be here in September to report what, if any, favorable or unfavorable results have occurred since the surge, and I believe that is our best policy today. 
   The cost has been enormous, as has been said, and we would be remiss if we tried to deny that. But I think the right vote is against this proposal today, and then let's revisit it subsequently when the general comes before us in September.

<DOCNO>Mr. COBLE. (HONORING THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. COBLE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Madam Speaker, initially, I would like to express thanks to Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairman Cummings for their support of H. Res. 866, and I also want to express thanks to Ranking Member Mica and Subcommittee Ranking Member LaTourette for their support of the measure and the members on the subcommittee who cosponsored the resolution. 
   H. Res. 866, Madam Speaker, recognizes the men and women of the United States Coast Guard whose efforts led to a record year in drug interdiction. They are to be commended for their dedication and selfless service in protecting the American people. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm going to read some numbers imminently, and oftentimes when one reads numbers, it becomes boring and induces sleep, but these numbers I think are significant to the issue at hand. 
   In 2007, the Coast Guard seized over 355,000 pounds of cocaine, besting the previous record by almost 20,000 pounds. These interdictions removed more than $4.7 billion worth of illegal drugs destined for our communities. Because of these efforts, today our families, schools and communities are more safe and secure despite the bold and sophisticated actions of drug smugglers. 
   I'd like to take a minute to highlight a few interdictions which led to this year's drug seizure record. First, the Coast Guard made its largest maritime cocaine seizure when it intercepted a Panamanian vessel carrying more than 33,000 pounds of narcotics in March of last year. Additionally, in September of 2007, the Coast Guard interdicted more than 9,000 pounds of cocaine and 3,600 gallons of liquid cocaine. 
   Finally, Coast Guard men and women, in collaboration with interagency partners, interdicted and boarded a self-propelled, semi-submersible vessel loaded with an estimated $352 billion worth of cocaine this past August. 
   These success stories, Madam Speaker, are the result of an interagency approach to stemming the tide of illegal drugs. According to Director John Walters of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the efforts are clearly working as the average price of cocaine has increased and the quality decreased. 
   Since 1790, the Coast Guard has been the Nation's leading maritime law enforcement agency. Today, missions include drug interdiction, migrant interdiction, fisheries enforcement, environmental compliance and safe boating enforcement. Clearly, the success of the men and women of the Coast Guard is attributed to the multifaceted nature of this branch. 
   The Coast Guard also confronts unique obstacles with migrant smugglers who, not unlike drug runners, are becoming more brazen and bold in their efforts. I believe we must continue to work to provide the enhanced penalties necessary to deter and punish dangerous, high-speed pursuits and other patently unsafe activity associated with maritime alien smuggling. If we can implement increased deterrence, I have no doubt that the success that the Coast Guard has in drug interdiction will translate to similar success with migrant interdiction. 
   As we move forward, we need to ensure that the Coast Guard has the appropriate resources to ensure our safety and security. Currently, the Coast Guard is in the midst of a fleet modernization. The overall intent is to provide the men and women of the Coast Guard with the necessary tools to protect our homeland. I applaud the actions taken by Admiral Allen, the commandant, to move this acquisition program, which is desperately needed, in the right direction. 
   I also again applaud Chairman Oberstar, Subcommittee Chairman Cummings, as well as Congressman Mica and Congressman LaTourette, the ranking members of the full committee and the subcommittee, for their efforts to complement and oversee these actions, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the Coast Guard has the equipment necessary to meet our homeland security and safety needs. 
   Again, Madam Speaker, we commend the men and women of the United States Coast Guard for their drug interdiction success in 2007, and again, I want to thank my colleagues for their consideration and support of H. Res. 866. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
