<DOCNO>Mr. LoBIONDO. (CLARIFYING PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN VESSEL DISCHARGES -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to rise on this piece of legislation and the one prior, S. 2766. 
   Mr. Oberstar, let me again tip my hat to you. I continue to be amazed and impressed at the bag of pixie dust you sometimes carry around for special circumstances to get the other body to move when it looks like they have no movement in their mind at all. 
   As Mr. Oberstar and Mr. LaTourette so accurately detailed on the previous bill, S. 2766, and for this bill S. 3298, thanks to the Ninth District Court of San Francisco, who have added to their disgraceful list of decisions on how they are completely disconnected from the real world, and what actually happens in people's lives, we are forced to deal with these issues. 
   When we have people that are upset with us, we want to make sure that they understand that this is the Ninth Circuit Court, it wasn't the EPA. We are very hopeful that the EPA will take the time necessary to look at this very closely. 
   I rise in very strong support of S. 3298. A few minutes ago the House considered a bill that I also strongly support to permanently exempt over 15 million recreational vessels from being slapped with $32,000 in fines daily for incidental discharges, and that's the part that I think that gripes us the most, is incidental discharges. 
   But the bill, I think, needed to have a little bit extra attention in a particular area. It didn't really treat all boats equally. While the bill did exempt recreational vessels and other small commercial boats, like many of the fishing vessels and tour-boat operators in my district, they would not have received an exemption. It would have been unfair to provide exemptions for 15 million recreational vessels while refusing to extend the same exemption to approximately 30,000 commercial vessels that are of equal and, in many cases, a smaller size. 
   In addition, rainwater runoff, bilge water and engine-cooling water and other charges are materially the same, regardless of whether they are discharged from a recreational vessel, a  fishing vessel or a small tour boat. Since the Clean Water Act's inception in 1973, these discharges have been exempt from EPA permitting. For 35 years these exemptions have been accepted by Congress and have stood unchallenged in the courts. But, more importantly, these exemptions have been applied to all vessels equally. Therefore, it was fair. 
   The commercial fishing industry in my district is the second largest on the east coast, but it's suffering from a lot of the stress and strains that other areas of the economy is, increased fuel costs, catch limitations and the economic slump in general. 
   Now this infamous court in California is attempting to make things worse by forcing the EPA to make our fishermen abide by costly permits or face tens of thousands of daily fines and lawsuits. At a time when our economy is experiencing a downturn, it is critically important that Congress move both of these bills, S. 2766 and S. 3298, to protect both the recreational and commercial boating industry, and the millions of jobs that they support from unfair regulations. While S. 3298 does not go as far as I would have liked, it represents a very fair compromise. 
   I want to take the time again to thank Mr. Oberstar, Mr. Mica and Mr. LaTourette for their work on these issues, as well as many others in this Congress. The 2 years that we have for the exemption or the extension will give the EPA some of the time they have requested to study the issue of incidental discharges and their effect on the environment before being forced to implement regulations by a court. 
   While I support this legislation, I would like to clarify language in the bill that excludes fishing vessels from this temporary exemption when they are secured to a storage facility or a seafood-processing facility. It is clear this language applies to fishing vessels that are permanently secured or are at least secured for extended periods of time to a storage facility or to a seafood-processing facility, and is not meant to apply when a fishing vessel is unloading its catch at a seafood-processing facility docked at the processing facility for a short period of time or stored at the facility during the off season. 
   With that, I would like to again thank Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, Mr. LaTourette and all the others who have worked so hard on this. I especially want to thank Mr. Taylor. We had many early morning meetings, but we got a lot accomplished.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to strongly support this amendment. This amendment would simply put in $1 million and then take back out $1 million for the purpose of directing the administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Research to use these funds to conduct initial long-term testing of children exposed to mercury from mercury-contaminated industrial sites. 
   Last July, I learned that a daycare center in my district had been opened mistakenly on a site that was previously used by a thermometer manufacturer. The manufacturer had a history of mercury contamination and had not properly cleaned up the site. 
   The mercury contamination of this site was so egregious that parents spoke of their children coming home from the daycare center with bubbles of mercury clinging to their backpacks. As a result of this, the children who innocently played on the grounds of the daycare center were diagnosed with mercury levels much higher than normal and suffered symptoms of mercury poisoning, such as headaches, sleeping problems and rashes. 
   As you may know, mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can affect the nervous system.

<DOCNO>Mr. LoBIONDO. (CELEBRATING AMERICA'S HERITAGE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1483, which includes legislation to extend the authorization of the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route. I would first like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the New Jersey delegation for their continued support of this extension. I would also like to thank Chairman RAHALL, Ranking Member YOUNG and their staff for their support and guidance. 
   Established by Congress in 1988, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail incorporates the very best of what the great State of New Jersey has to offer to the rest of the Nation. The Trail unifies New Jersey's many scenic points of interest. These points of interest include a wealth of environmental, historic, maritime and recreational sights found along New Jersey's coastline, stretching 300 miles from Perth Amboy in the north, Cape May in the extreme southern tip of the State and Deepwater to the west. 
   The Trail's area includes three National Wildlife Refuges, four tributaries of a Wild and Scenic River system, a Civil War fort and National cemetery, several lighthouses, historic homes, and other sites tied to southern New Jersey's maritime history. Through a network of themes and destinations, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail connects people with places of historic, recreational, environmental and maritime interest. 
   One exciting aspect of the Trail is its focus on maritime history. There is a rich story to be told about the industries once sustained by the Delaware Bay, such as whaling, shipbuilding, crabbing and the harvesting of oysters. While we often define our Nation's history through military or political milestones, the Trail will serve to remind visitors that maritime-dependent commerce was a major factor in the growth of the United States. 
   ``Eco-tourism'' along the Trail has proven to be a huge success. There is an abundant variety of natural habitats and species to be found on the Trail. Whale and dolphin watching have become extremely popular, and bird lovers from throughout the country, and in fact around the world, are realizing what Southern New Jersey residents have known all along: our region is unmatched for observing migratory birds, ospreys and bald eagles. 
   The Trail has also helped to foster important partnerships between the Federal government and individuals, groups, corporations, State and local governments. Since the Trail began, these partnerships have resulted in additional funding amounting to almost double the investment of the Federal government. 
   Legislation reauthorizing the Trail was included in S. 203, the National Heritage Areas Act of 2006, which the President signed into law in October of 2006. S. 203 requires a strategic plan for the Trail to be prepared ``Not later than 3 years after the date on which funds are made available.'' Unfortunately, under S. 203, the Trail is only reauthorized through September 30, 2007. 
   The language pertaining to the Trail included in H.R. 1483 has the support of the entire New Jersey Congressional delegation. It would extend the authorization of the Coastal Heritage Trail Route in New Jersey until September 30, 2011. This would allow for adequate time to complete the required strategic plan, which will explore opportunities to increase participation by private and public interests, as well as organizational options for sustaining the Trail. S. 1039, a bill containing language very similar to the Trail language in H.R. 1483, was introduced in the Senate in March. 
   Since its inception, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail has not only helped New Jersey residents develop pride, awareness, experience with, and understanding of our coastal resources and their history, it has encouraged visitors to explore this area, bringing with them much needed tourism dollars. The extension of the authorization contained in H.R. 1483 will allow the Trail to continue and flourish. I urge my colleagues in the House to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LoBIONDO. (BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LoBIONDO. Madam Speaker, to my colleague Mr. Cannon, thank you very much. 
   I would also like to particularly thank Mr. Visclosky. In 1997 when we first started talking about this, there was a dramatic and very sad incident that took place in my district, the Second Congressional District of New Jersey, and I believe that Mr. Visclosky had a similar situation in his district. 
   Through the 1990s, a variety of groups had been sort of cobbling together the ability to buy vests for officers by selling doughnuts and for cake sales and a number of different ways because they understood the need, but there wasn't a resource to be able to do this. Unfortunately, in 1996, at a State prison in my district, Officer Fred Baker, a corrections officer who was on duty, who was not wearing a vest, was stabbed in the back by an inmate and that stab was fatal. 
   We can only speculate what the fate would have been of Officer Baker if he had a vest on. I happen to believe that he would be alive today. And when I got back from that break at home, I got together with Mr. Visclosky, and we embarked upon this road to convince our colleagues of the importance of this program. 
   You've heard the statistics, 40,000 jurisdictions, 1.5 million vests, and people ask, Well, why is it important to keep doing this? Once you've done a vest, why isn't that enough? Well, they have a shelf life. When you put a vest to an officer, it doesn't last forever. The technology increases and they wear out. 
   This is a critically important program. At a time when all of America wonders whether what's happening in Washington really works on Main Street and in the real world, this is a program that we can point to with absolute certainty that has conclusive, positive benefit. It saves the lives of our police officers. 
   This is something that works. This is something that Main Street understands. This is something that law enforcement understands, and this is one of those programs where we can do the right thing and continue it. 
   When an officer is sworn in and receives their badge and their gun, they should be receiving a vest. All across America people get up every morning and don't expect to have a problem, but if that problem occurs and they need that thin blue line, they expect our law enforcement to respond as quickly as they can, and part of that response for law enforcement ought to be the protection that a vest provides. It's the least that we can do. 
   I strongly support this bill. I thank Mr. Visclosky, I thank Mr. Conyers, I thank Mr. Smith of Texas, and all those who are responsible for having this move to the floor today.

<DOCNO>Mr. LoBIONDO. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Oberstar, thank you very much. The circumstances are difficult. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is more than 5 years that we are into the global war on terror. Since the horrific attacks to our country on September 11, we are fighting a faceless enemy, an unbelievably ruthless enemy, an enemy who is undeterred in their hatreds for our freedoms and our way of life. 
   We must remain strong in our resolve to defeat the enemy, and it is no accident that our Nation has not been attacked since September 11. It is not because the enemy and its supporters have not wanted to bring destruction to America, it is because we as Americans have remained committed to the defense of our homeland. 
   It is because we have remained vigilant in working with our international partners to prevent terrorists from being successful, and it is mostly because of our brave men and women in uniform, who have taken the fight to the enemy. Likewise, our commitment to the troops on the battlefield, whether in Iraq or Afghanistan, or wherever the global war on terror may take our brave young men and women, must run deep. Our commitment must include that our soldiers have all the necessary equipment and armor that they need. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the well, to the podium today very troubled. For 3 days, the majority will have us debating the very critical issue of the war in Iraq, but this debate is really without real substance. 
   This debate is without an alternative strategy that many of us acknowledge we desperately need to be discussing. This debate will not bring about one positive change for our men and women in harm's way, and will rather likely result in the wrong message to many of our soldiers, our partners and, avoidably, the enemy. 
   I believe this debate is dividing the Congress. I believe this debate is dividing the American people and sending the wrong message to our soldiers in the field, who may question our unwavering support on their behalf. I continue to be awe struck and proud of the valor of our servicemen and -women of Iraq. However, this debate sends a mixed message to them, their families, and the families of those who were lost in the global war on terror. We could have, and we should have had a debate that sends a strong message to support our troops in their commitment, but the majority has chosen against us. 
   While I do not support the President's latest strategy, I believe the American military should not serve as a referee in the sectarian conflict that has lasted for centuries. It is the responsibility of the Iraqi Government to take a stronger role to set benchmarks and not let the American military and our forces be caught in the middle. This resolution is silent in its requirements to the elected Iraqi Government and to the Iraqi people, and holding their own destiny in their hands. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have listened to the generals and military experts, administration officials, tell us that Iraqi forces are ready for greater responsibilities in securing Iraq. However, after being to Iraq five times myself, and talking with a number of soldiers in the field, the reality on the ground is that Iraqi forces are not being used to the extent that they should at this point. I think that needs to change. 
   I would like to also say that it is with great regret that I will not be here at the conclusion of the debate this week. Unfortunately, my father-in-law passed away after a battle with cancer, and I will be heading out to the funeral with my wife and the family. 
   I wanted to be on record before leaving as to what this critical motion means. This debate cannot and should not be the end of what we are talking about, and for the reasons stated before all future debates must be substantive on policies. It is clear to me the majority has a strategy that many have talked about that reflects far beyond just the surge in Iraq and what it may mean, but has implications for funding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me make it perfectly clear. I support the troops, but on the basis of the message that this is sending to our partners, to the troops, to their families on this nonsubstantive resolution, I cannot support it. 
   I will close by saying that I received a call from a father, who has two children that are in Iraq. One felt so strongly that he sent a letter to our local newspaper, Specialist Matthew J. Smith of Hopewell Township, and I have just a few excerpts from his letter. ``I personally feel as if I am here  for a great purpose and goal that our Commander in Chief has ordered us to achieve. I have never felt it would be an easy task, nor should those at home living their comfortable lives. Have we forgotten that this great country of ours was not handed to us on a silver platter? I am asking everyone, please don't allow those of us who have died to die in vain. When we have completed the mission and have been successful in defending freedom, we will come home.''

   Mr. LOBIONDO. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Saxton-LoBiondo-Smith-Andrews amendment which will provide members of the Armed Services and their families living on military bases with more security. It would require a federal background check for unescorted civilians, including contractors and vendors. 
   The security gap that exists at our Nation's military bases was highlighted by the recent plot against Fort Dix by terrorists. Fortunately due to the intervention of an ordinary citizen and the professionalism of the FBI, this plot to attack was thwarted. Next time, we might not be so fortunate. 
   It is simply common sense that we should know who is entering our military bases and why they are there. Background checks on all contractors and vendors will help secure these sensitive facilities and ensure an additional layer of security for our servicemen and women who live and work on our military bases. 
   I strongly urge that all Members vote for this amendment to protect our military bases and our military personnel and their families.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired. 
   Pursuant to the rule, the amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the bill is considered as an original bill for the purpose of amendment and is considered read.

   Mr. Oberstar, let me thank you and Mr. Cummings for your very thoughtful approach to these critically important issues, and to Mr. Mica and Mr. LaTourette for your diligence in these areas. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your consideration of this important issue, and Mr. LaTourette's thoughtful approach to making sure that we do not have a chilling effect on the future development of LNG in our country. It would effectively block the construction of a widely supported plant that is just north of my district that could definitely help provide much needed relief for home heating costs. 
   The bill I believe would also have the potential to undermine our security by not the allowing the Coast Guard to determine the personnel and assets necessary to escort LNG shipments. This should be a decision by the Coast Guard. I believe they are best able to do this, and the LaTourette amendment represents a very reasonable and realistic compromise which will give the Coast Guard the flexibility they  need to ensure the security of LNG shipments as well as to deal with the other potential threats in our ports and waterways. I strongly urge all members to support the amendment.

   Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Inslee amendment. 
   This amendment would restore a ban on taking polar bear parts and importing them into the United States, a ban that was in place for 22 years. As Mr. Inslee indicated, it was right around the end of last year when the Secretary of Interior and U.S. Fish and Wildlife service surprised many of us by proposing to list the polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. They have now taken public comments and must issue a final decision by December, 2008. At the very least, stemming the tide of polar bear imports, imports, I stress, until this decision is made makes sense. 
   Those who oppose the amendment would like to use the argument that this is all about restricting the right to hunt. It is not. If it were, I would not be standing here in support of it. I remember fondly, with my dad, my cousins, my uncles, hunting as a young man, and I don't believe this restricts the right of hunting. 
   So I would ask my colleagues to think seriously about the importance of this amendment and to give it their utmost consideration and strong support.

<DOCNO>Mr. LoBIONDO. (RAW SEWAGE OVERFLOW COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LoBIONDO. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2452, the Sewage Overflow Right-to-Know Act. 
   Last year, nearly 250,000 gallons of partially treated sewage leaked from the Asbury Park, New Jersey, sewer treatment plant into the Atlantic Ocean threatening beach goers for miles down the shore. It was the result of a broken pipe that went undetected for over 6 hours. Fortunately, no one got sick and the environment did not suffer any long term consequences. But that is not always the case. 
   The EPA estimates approximately 900 billion gallons of untreated sewage enter our waterways each year, sickening nearly 3.5 million people annually. 
   That is why I was pleased to join with Representative BISHOP to introduce H.R. 2452, the Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act. This commonsense legislation will help keep the public safe from waterborne illness by requiring sewer operators to put in place monitoring systems to detect overflows and to promptly notify the public in the event of an overflow. While some States and localities have strong notification programs in place already, the majority do not. Establishing a minimum standard for public notification is the right thing to do. 
   H.R. 2452 makes sewer operators eligible for existing grant funds and loans to help defer the cost of implementing monitoring and notification programs, and it provides flexibility to States that already have these critical programs in place. 
   I want to thank the National Association of Clean Water Agencies and American Rivers for working with Chairman OBERSTAR and Ranking Member MICA to make improvements to this legislation. The bill before us today represents a good compromise between all interested parties. 
   I want to thank Chairman OBERSTAR, Ranking Member MICA, Chairwoman JOHNSON, and Ranking Member BOOZMAN for their assistance and support. I also want to thank Jon Pawlow on Mr. MICA's Staff, Ryan Seiger on Mr. OBERSTAR's staff, and Mark Copeland on Mr. BISHOP's staff for their tremendous effort. I urge all members to support this common-sense measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LoBIONDO. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, very much. 
   I am here tonight to talk about one of our retiring colleagues from New Jersey, Congressman Jim Saxton, who after 24 years in Congress is hanging it up this year. Jim has been a colleague and a mentor of mine. 
   When I was first elected to Congress in 1994, I remember going through orientation. People were asking me what it was like, and it was like trying to get a drink of water from a fire hose. There was so much information that it was difficult to get. 
   Jim Saxton said, ``Listen, I have a desk in my office. I want to make my staff available to you, and I want you to get off on the right foot.'' It was the beginning of a great relationship. 
   He has been a teacher; he has been a mentor; he has been a leader, and he has been an individual who has been focused on generating results. He wasn't so much interested in the rhetoric. Jim was never one to be running to a camera, to be wanting to do that interview and to get his face on TV or anything like that. He was interested in finding out about the problem, in determining what the possible solutions were and then in working for a consensus. He is known for many things within his district and for doing a great job in representing his constituents, but his work on the Armed Services Committee and his leadership on Armed Services is what he is best known for. 
   To talk about that a little bit, I would like to yield time to Chairman Duncan Hunter, who is probably Jim Saxton's closest friend in this Congress of the United States, who knows more about Jim Saxton and who will share some of the stories with you.

<DOCNO>Mr. LoBIONDO. (HONORING CONGRESSMAN JIM SAXTON -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LoBIONDO. I thank you very much. 
   Picking up what Mr. Hunter said, shortly after the global war on terror began, I believe it was my first trip into theater, Jimmy Saxton was codel leader. And for a rather new member of the Armed Services Committee, to understand how this all came over, Jim Saxton had a passion for understanding where the problems were and getting results. 
   As Chairman Hunter indicated, he focused on special forces. I remember we visited with some special forces folks. Jimmy, true to form, listened very intently and found that there was a problem that was occurring with some small items, batteries that troops in the field had a great deal of difficulty with at the time. 
   I remember Jimmy talking about it and getting a lot of detail and coming back before one of the subcommittee hearings with I believe it was DARPA, and he explained in great detail what the problems were and had people focusing on something that they wouldn't have focused on only because he was there with the troops and had them in mind. Very respectful, very bipartisan, very inclusive, and a real model for how to get things done. And especially on Armed Services where, and I believe everything we do here is important, but Armed Services is not selling wheat to Bulgaria. It is about the lives of the men and women in uniform who are volunteering and serving our Nation, and Jimmy Saxton always had their best interests at heart. 
   And when it came to the State of New Jersey, we are not considered a military State, but we have some great military bases. Jimmy Saxton looked at the three bases. We had Fort Dix, Fort McGuire and Lakehurst Naval Air Station, and he saw the great value in what they were doing. But he saw an even greater value in the quality of work that they could do if they could be combined together in a mega-base. 
   People sort of smiled and chuckled when they first heard about this. And he came to Mr. Hunter about it and he convinced Duncan it was a good idea. Jimmy, as he always did, very quietly rolled up his sleeves, and when that last BRAC commission came out, we now have a mega-base. It is good for New Jersey, but it is really good for America. It makes sense for America. It makes sense for our men and woman in uniform to integrate these assets into something that is much more powerful as a whole than they were individually. 
   He was a great assistance to me with the 177th Fighter Wing, which is in my district, the 2nd Congressional District. It is the premier homeland security base in the entire Nation because of its strategic location. When our jets are alerted and they fly combat air patrols over Washington and New York, they are 8 minutes from the time they are alerted to get over our Nation's capital. 
   We had need for military construction projects to keep this alert facility on a solid footing. Jimmy came along with you, Chairman Hunter, on one of those trips, and he was the kind of guy who rolled up his sleeves. He was not just interested in his district, but what was best for the country. He did that time and time again. 
   My regret is I feel I have so much more to learn from him and he was such a great mentor and teacher. I am thinking about contacting Webster's and making sure that when they put the word ``congressman'' in the dictionary, they put Jim Saxton's picture next to it because as far as I am concern, he epitomizes what we should all be about, focusing on the greater good and focusing on what is best for America and understanding how to get results and not just produce rhetoric. 
   Chairman Hunter, I thank you for your years of service, and I thank you for joining me tonight and honoring Jim Saxton.
