<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to very sincerely thank my good friend from Missouri for his leadership in bringing this revised edition of the National Defense Authorization Act to the floor in an expedited manner. It's unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position, but through Mr. Skelton and Mr. Hunter's leadership, we were able to find a mutually agreeable compromise in an expeditious manner. 
   On December 12, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act, as my good friend just pointed out, by a vote of 370-49. This amended version is a good bipartisan bill, with very few changes from the original legislation. In section 1083, we ensure terrorism victims have the legal redress against state sponsors of terrorism, while granting the President the waiver authority to protect our relationship with the new government of Iraq. This provision was the crux of the issue that brought this bill back to the House after we sent it to the President, and it's something that is near and dear to many of our hearts, and some of us worked very closely with Members of the other body, in particular Senator Lautenberg, over several years to bring the language that we had in the original bill to the attention of the House and inclusion in the NDAA bill. 
   The new version simply gives the President the ability to waive the totality of this pertinent section as to claims against Iraq for terrorism acts that occurred before or on the date of enactment of the fiscal year 2008 NDAA bill. As my good friend, Mr. Skelton, just pointed out, this is perhaps a better way to write this because certainly we can't or shouldn't hold the current government of Iraq responsible for things done by its predecessor, Saddam Hussein. And so this is a good compromise and a good effort. We also make some other provisions. We make the 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise and targeted pay raises retroactive to ensure American servicemembers are not penalized due to this delay. 
   Overall, the defense bill takes care of the brave men and women serving our country at home and abroad. It authorizes $506.9 billion in budget authority for the Department of Defense and the national security programs of the Department of Energy. Additionally, it supports current operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in the global war on terrorism by authorizing $189.4 billion in supplemental funding for operational costs, personnel expenses, and procurement of new equipment for fiscal year 2008. 
   Once again, I want to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Ike Skelton and Ranking Member Duncan Hunter for their hard work in shepherding this vital legislation expeditiously through their chamber. Through their work, this bill guarantees that our service men and women will get what they need, and when they need it. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SAXTON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would just like to say to my friend from Cleveland, who speaks very articulately on this bill, as I am sure he did on the original bill, the gentleman made some points that he believes I am sure very much that there  are some things in the bill that he disagrees with, and the gentleman and 48 other people voted against the original bill, and I am sure for many of the same reasons. 
   In fact, it would be surprising if they weren't the same reasons, because the 1,513 pages that the gentleman has under his arm that he referred to are almost identical to the original bill which is here, which has been available since December 6 of last year. And the 1,513 pages that my friend referred to had one single change from the copy that I have in my hand that has been available since December 6. And that change, both the ranking member and I took care to explain, I think we explained it well, had to do with terrorism, had to do with Iraq, had to do with not holding the current government in Iraq responsible for acts committed by the previous regime. And we also of course added the second provision that had to do with back pay. 
   So, this is a good bill that passed by 370-49 previously.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Madam Chairlady, I rise to strike the last word. 
   Madam Chairlady, I would like to engage my distinguished colleague from Washington, Chairman Dicks, in a colloquy regarding funding for an important conservation project in the district I represent. 
   The State of New Jersey has only 3 percent Federal land ownership and is also the most densely populated State in the country. From national parks and wildlife areas to soccer fields and city playgrounds, our investments in conservation, preservation, wildlife and recreation pay dividends each and every day. 
   The coastal areas of our Nation are under extreme pressure for development. The Third District of New Jersey, where the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge is located, is no exception. It is vital that we assist our States and local governments in a true Federal/State/local partnership to purchase tracts of land like the one within the Forsythe Refuge boundary, environmentally valuable land that can be bought now but most likely will be lost permanently for future use in the very near future. 
   I appreciate the challenges that the subcommittee faced in this difficult budget year; however, I am hopeful that we will recognize the importance of this project to the people that I represent and New Jersey as a whole. 
   We have a responsibility to our children to ensure that green spaces remain to provide clean air and water and ample opportunities to enjoy wildlife and the great outdoors. The economy of the district I represent depends on a vibrant and healthy economy.  
   I yield to my friend from Washington.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Hoekstra for yielding. 
   I would just like to build on something that Mr. Shadegg said. He said, in essence, that this subject is so important because it goes so much further than Iraq. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I try to keep close tabs on where our soldiers and sailors and marines and airmen are deployed. And it may surprise some on the other side of the aisle, but perhaps not, to know that we have troops deployed in Southwest Asia in five countries; we have troops deployed in Europe in quite a few countries, several countries; in Central Asia we have troops in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan; in Southeast Asia we have troops deployed in the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia; in South America in Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Guantanamo Bay; and in 19 countries in Africa, all in support of the war on terror. 
   And as Mr. Shadegg mentioned a few minutes ago, it has been clearly stated that Iraq is the first battleground chosen to make their stand and clearly stated that all of these other places where we have sent troops, not because we have extra troops to send somewhere, not because we have extra taxpayer dollars that we are trying to get rid of or spend, but because every one of those countries exhibits a piece of geography where there is a threat related to the global war on terror. 
   So a vote for this resolution is a vote, perhaps, of goodwill on the part of those who will eventually in a few days vote for it, but it won't end this war. It won't end the desire of the Islamists to take advantage of various situations and, as Mr. Hoekstra mentioned, achieve their goals. 
   And so this is a broad war. This is a war where it will be years and perhaps decades to bring to a conclusion. And the worst thing we can do is to send messages that we are not serious about carrying out our duties in defense of this generation and, as I will point out later, future generations of Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in opposition to the resolution that will be voted on Friday. And my statement, as clearly as I can, says why. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recently attended the funeral of an old friend who passed away after a wonderful, productive 90 years of life. His family and friends gathered at the church to celebrate his life and to remember his accomplishments. During World War II, he served as a member of the Army Air Corps. 
   Near the end of the service, two Air Force sergeants unfolded and refolded an American flag, and then caringly presented it to my friend's widow saying, ``On behalf of the President of the United States, the United States Air Force, and a grateful American people, I present this flag in honor of your husband's service to his country.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we survive as a nation today in large part because of the selfless service to our country by a great many Americans just like my friend. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, members of the Coast Guard, and members of the foreign service organizations have been supported by the American people and by American resources and funding. 
   Because we are once again involved in a war which threatens our country, we find American military personnel are again deployed to many parts of the world. Last week, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Peter Pace listed the long list of countries where our forces are deployed and are present to help protect us as part of the global war on terror. Earlier tonight, I read from that list. There are 70 countries where Americans serve abroad in support of the global war on terror. We don't send them there because we want to send them off to some far off part of the world for no good reason. There are threats there, threats like al Qaeda, threats like Hezbollah, threats like the Quad groups that are funded by Iran. 
   This is a unique and historic struggle for a number of reasons. Chief among them is that our enemies are both state and nonstate actors. They are lethal and deadly. Fortunately, the great citizens of this country have responded. Americans have volunteered in large numbers to work, defend, and fight to protect our way of life. Yet,  today some among us would question whether we are on the right track. And I think they are on the wrong track. 
   As many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know, I have devoted much of my career in Congress to studying and understanding this enemy. I must say that I believe I have developed some understanding of them, and so I would like to take a few minutes here tonight to share some thoughts and some facts about them. You simply cannot discuss or understand our situation in Iraq without first addressing some of the fundamental and important questions about the enemy. 
   Who is he, or who are they? How do they work to achieve their goals on the battlefield? How do they work to achieve their international objectives? What is our record against them? And what is at stake? 
   First of all, who are they? Members of al Qaeda and Hezbollah, the Quads forces, and other similar terrorist groups' view of the world is based on an extreme ideology, an ideology that is far more extreme than most Middle Eastern people want or support. I certainly can't speak for the citizens of the Middle East, but it seems clear to me that in the opinion of the great majority of citizens and residents of the Middle East, both Muslim and non-Muslim, that this is an extreme ideology which they feel they should reject. And they do. 
   The extremists are groups of individuals who do not believe in any form of secular government, and will go to seemingly any lengths to sabotage others who try to establish secular or representative free types of governments. Their tactics run the gamut from sermonizing to mistreatment to capture, torture, and death, often by beheading. Their leaders are male and assign subservient roles to females. Their ideology holds that members of society, both Middle Eastern society and otherwise, who do not share their same radical beliefs are assigned to a subservient role or simply eliminated. They are members of organizations who state openly and repeatedly, ``Death to the non-believers, death to America.'' They say it every day. This, in short, is what they are about. 
   Perhaps there are some of us here in Congress who don't take these people seriously. I do. And I am glad Franklin Roosevelt took Hitler and his people seriously as well. It is much the same. 
   Twenty years ago, while on my second trip to Israel, it was 1987 to be exact, I came across an article about Hamas. In 1987, I had never heard of them before; they were a brand-new group. So while I was there, I asked about them. And I learned much about Hamas, but also about other groups that we hear about today, groups like Hezbollah and the Islamic Jihad, other groups that existed at the time. And I will always remember getting back on that airplane to come home. I thought, ``Today these people are a huge problem in the Middle East, and I bet it won't be long until they are a huge problem in the U.S.'' They are today. 
   The second thing I would like to talk a little bit about is how they work to achieve their goals on the battlefield. It is kind of unique, certainly unique in history. Their radical ideology breeds an unconventional strategy of violence, and they are not to be underestimated. This is the method to their violence: 
   They have recognized that it is difficult or impossible for them to achieve their goals through conventional warfare strategies and techniques. They have instituted as a substitute a four-stage process that replaces traditional warfare, at least traditional warfare as we know it in the West. Their strategy is well laid out and planned; it is called insurgency. Four steps. 
   First, they work quietly to gain the support of the population through social, charitable, and ideological groups and organizations, schools, hospitals, charities. They gain the support of the people. 
   Second, now that they have developed some strength in organization, they begin to develop strength in unconventional warfare capabilities. Unconventional warfare capabilities, terrorism, if you will, until their ability exists to severely harass their enemy, usually the superior legitimate force, the government of whatever country they happen to be operating in. This is often the traditional or newly created government, just like the one that we are dealing with in Iraq. And in this way, they build popular support through unconventional warfare successes as well as through charities. 
   Step three. They develop the ability to reconsider the danger of counterattack posed by the stronger legitimate force or government, and the ability to fade away temporarily into the population until the pressure is off so they can come back and fight again, all the time getting stronger, all the time carrying out their work through the charities and the schools and the hospitals, and the terrorist acts against their enemy. 
   Finally, the fourth step, they develop it over time, the conventional capabilities that are necessary to be used against the stronger traditional force with the objective of defeating the legitimate government. 
   If that sounds familiar, it should, because it is exactly what is happening in Iraq. This is the traditional four-step insurgency process first used in China by Mao in the 1920s, and in Vietnam during the 1960s and 1970s. 
   Studying this concept, one can apply it to various theaters around the world in the global war on terror and identify various stages in various theaters in many places in the world. I believe, for example, Hezbollah in Lebanon has worked its way nearly to the fourth stage of the insurgency process. Other groups like al Qaeda in Iraq are following the same course elsewhere. 
   The third thing I would like to talk about a little bit is how they work to achieve superiority strategically internationally. Let's look at the process, the process that fosters the doubt that some citizens in the U.S. have today. That is why we are here tonight. Some people doubt our capabilities. And this is the type of thinking that brings us here tonight. This is the doubt that fuels the desire to disengage, to pretend that the danger doesn't exist, to discuss, as we are here today or tonight, solutions to limit our success and move toward disengagement. 
   The enemy has demonstrated a strong understanding and some success internationally in developing this unconventional strategy of warfare. It has evolved something like this: 
   In the early 19th century, armies met each other on the battlefield, frontline to frontline. We all remember looking at those old movies of wars in the 19th century. Warriors were trained in techniques aimed at defeating their foe's frontlines so as to prevail on the battlefield. There was little thought, planning, or training given to reaching beyond the frontlines in battle, much less to strike directly at central governments. Today, this strategy of warfare is called first-generation warfare. 
   Then, during the 20th century, specifically during World War I and World War II, two new generations of warfare evolved. During World War I, armies were trained to carry out tactics not only against frontlines but also against logistical supply lines. The intent was to damage the enemy's ability by reaching back beyond the battlefield frontline. This is called second-generation warfare. 
   World War II brought about third-generation warfare by using tactics to reach even further behind the lines to attack the industrial production facilities of the enemy's central governments. 
   Finally, the most recent evolution, strategic and tactical execution of warfare, designed as fourth-generation warfare. The goal, to destroy the determination of the enemy's decisionmakers to continue the fight.     
   Today's decisionmakers are the citizens of Europe and the rest of the West, including, of course, the United States and the decisionmakers of the United States Congress. Unconventional tools have been used by al Qaeda through fourth-generation warfare and other groups to convince the decisionmakers to discontinue the effort. Unconventional tools such as the Western media, terrorist acts such as those on 9/11, and unconventional warfare such as killing Shiia citizens, Sunni citizens and coalition military participants with IEDs and car and truck bombs. 
   Through the media, every one of these acts which is reported has an effect and carries a message intentionally to discourage decisionmakers,  and that is precisely the plan. That is precisely why we are having this debate tonight. 
   That brings us to the debate today. Often American decisionmakers have been convinced through fourth-generation warfare used by al Qaeda and used by other groups, Shiia militias, Sunni insurgents, to convince some here to vote to discontinue necessary efforts in one of the central theaters of the global war on terror, Iraq, and hence convince us not to provide the level of national security so important to the citizens and children and future generations of the United States of America. 
   Fourth, let me talk about understanding the consequences of withdrawal and our record. Withdrawal under fire is unacceptable and history is replete with examples of harmful consequences in doing so. Lebanon and Somalia are two examples where we presently face increased threats to our national security as a result of previously ill-timed withdrawals. 
   As a result of the U.S. withdrawal in Lebanon, for example, after the Marine barracks bombing in 1983, the country, Lebanon, even today remains a terrorist hotbed. The withdrawal strengthened Hezbollah. It contributed to years of civil war in Lebanon. It diminished U.S. prestige in the region and influence throughout much of the world. 
   The lingering question: Could the U.S. have prevented the rise of Hezbollah and the influence of Tehran with sustained engagement in Lebanon? We will never know. 
   In 1993, we withdrew our forces from Somalia after a failed military operation in Mogadishu. A decade later an Islamic militia with ties to al Qaeda has controlled that country and is responsible for destabilizing the entire Horn of Africa. We didn't know it at the time. We decided to withdraw. It was a mistake. This radical movement briefly shows signs of regaining lost ground in Somalia, even today. 
   At the very least, Somalia remains a dangerous, ungoverned place, and the lingering question, could the United States have prevented the spread of radicalism in the Horn of Africa with a sustained engagement in Somalia, but we withdrew. 
   Further evidence of failure to respond to terrorism emboldened al Qaeda. In 1993, the World Trade Center was bombed. No response. In 1996, Khobar Towers were bombed. No response. In 1998, the U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania took place. No response. In 2000, the attack on the USS Cole took place. No response. 
   Result? September 11. We are not alone. The Soviet Union and Israel both paid heavy prices for implementing a precipitous withdrawal on two separate occasions. The Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 and left behind the conditions of anarchy and warlordism, which ultimately led to the rise of the Taliban and provided safe haven for al Qaeda. 
   Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 resulted in an empowered Hezbollah, weakened Lebanese moderates failed to keep peace. The best example was Hezbollah's naked aggression this past summer in delivering unbelievable attacks against Israel's civilian population. As one commentator has put it, this is from Victor Hanson in the National Review Online, December 1, 2006, ``By not responding to a decade of prior attacks in East Africa, New York, Saudi Arabia and Yemen and withdrawing precipitously from Lebanon and Mogadishu, we gave the fatal impression that terrorists could strike the U.S. with near impunity.'' That is what we are talking about doing now in Iraq. 
   The lesson here is obvious. We must remain engaged until we complete our mission. Finally, what is at stake? It is clear that al Qaeda and other groups constitute a serious threat to the citizens of the U.S. for this generation and, even more importantly, for the future generations. Our enemies have demonstrated significant success in carrying out activities to the detriment of the citizens of the U.S. 
   They have successfully attacked numerous targets overseas, mostly with explosives, and have used missiles known as jumbo jets to attack New York City and Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon, and they have used explosives in terror operations in Afghanistan, and even more successfully in Iraq to pit the minority Sunni population against the Shiia. They fueled the insurgency and have cost Sunni, Shiia, as well as the lives of U.S. soldiers. 
   Our choices may be difficult. It is not easy to be at war. It is even harder to stay at war, but it is clearly proven by history that we must not abandon the missions in the war on terror nor in the Iraqi theater. We have seen the results of the precipitous withdrawals. It would be unconscionable to vote and to do other than to support the administration's plan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Madam Speaker, in the upcoming debate on the supplemental, I just want to point out to my friends on both sides of the aisle that the message counts. 
   As we prepare for the debate on the supplemental appropriations bill, I want to caution my colleagues to bear in mind that our words are heard and seen all over the world by the Iraqi people, by our allies, and by our enemies. 
   The President has given guidance on benchmarks for the Iraqi Government to meet, but this does not give Congress license to attach timelines and penalties. If we do, we are undermining the authority of General Petraeus, to whom we have entrusted this very important mission. 
   Perhaps those who would vote in Congress to set deadlines, or any other maneuver aimed at limiting the ability of the White House and the Department of Defense to manage this dangerous situation under the guise of sending a message to the Iraqi leadership, will consider how their message will be received and interpreted by others. 
   The future stability of Iraq and the national security of the American people would be better served with a message that clearly states ``We will stand with our allies and partners until Iraq's goal of stability is utilized.''

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (RECOGNIZING THE STRONG SECURITY ALLIANCE BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Let me thank the gentlelady for yielding. And let me begin by thanking my good friend and colleague, Chairman TOM LANTOS, for the great high level of cooperation that was exhibited on this resolution on a bipartisan basis with Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and others. And also, let me acknowledge the great support of my friend, Mr. Faleomavaega, on the resolution. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 508, obviously, which recognizes the strong security alliance between Japan and the United States and expresses appreciation for Japan's role in enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific region in combating terrorism, and specifically in Japan's very significant contribution toward global missile defense. 
   I am pleased to highlight our special relationship with Japan following World War II. Our alliance has served as a valuable conduit allowing the United States to achieve our security goals throughout East Asia. This dynamic nation is the world's second largest economy, one of our top trading partners, provides 600,000 U.S. jobs, and is actively engaged with many other democracies. 
   Our two countries have encountered similar challenges and fought shared threats while working to guarantee political and economic freedoms for our citizens and for many others. This goal of spreading democracy-based prosperity became particularly evident following the events of September 11. Following these deplorable acts, Japan readily provided support for U.S. and allied forces. Their effort included invaluable maritime operations in the Indian Ocean, aircraft to conduct support missions for our troops in Iraq, and logistical support that even continues to this very day. These actions reveal Japan's dedication to eradicating the destruction caused by sponsors of terrorism. Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces have provided roughly 30 percent of the fuel used by U.S. and coalition warships. They are the third largest donor in country for relief and reconstruction in Afghanistan, and they have provided billions of dollars for reconstruction in Iraq, and Japan continues to renew the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law that allows for these activities to take place. 
   I applaud them for recognizing that the international threats of terror will require the cooperation of the world's strongest democracies to effectively combat the growing capabilities and support systems of terrorist organizations. 
   Our strategic relationship extends beyond Japan's involvement in the Middle East. Japan offers financial and material resources to the U.S.-deployed forces, 50,000 of which are stationed in the country. 
   Several years ago, our two countries agreed to redefine and strengthen the missions of both of our military forces. My resolution mentions examples of this coordination by reducing the number of troops in Okinawa and expanding the cooperation of ballistic missile defense. 
   Once again, I want to reiterate my thanks to Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN for their assistance in bringing this to the floor today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this 21-day extension to FISA. If Congress does not act this week, critical tools that allow our intelligence officials to monitor terrorist communications overseas will expire. We not let that happen! 
   As we all know, yesterday, the Senate approved a comprehensive, long term, bipartisan bill by a vote of 68-29 to close the terrorist loophole in our intelligence laws. Their bill represents a strong compromise between Congress and the Administration. It is a responsible plan for protecting our nation against the threats of terrorism. 
   The intelligence community needs a long-term fix to gaps in our intelligence laws--not a 21-day delay. After 7 months of stalling and a 15-day extension, passage of another short-term extension is irresponsible, when we have a long-term solution ready to be voted on. 
   The Senate has passed a strong, bipartisan bill. The House must now act quickly to pass the Senate's bill and send it to the President. Failing to do so is effectively failing to protect our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this extension, and instead immediately pass the Senate's version of the bill so we can send this important bill to the President.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, some years ago as I was working to have a subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee established on terrorism, I was making the rounds among my party's leadership. I  made the case about why I thought we needed, and of course this was before 9/11, a subcommittee on terrorism. And I will never forget, one of my good friends told me that he thought, he said, JIM, he said, I think you and your friends see a terrorist behind every bush. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that the Democratic majority leadership has adopted that same frame of reference. There is not a terrorist behind every bush, but they present a clear and present danger. We were told so as late as today by representatives of the Intelligence Committee. 
   Passing a 21-day extension simply continues the uncertainty in the intelligence community, the uncertainty in the telecommunications community, and uncertainty among the American public itself. 
   Just yesterday, as it has been said here several times, the Senate approved a comprehensive, long-term, bipartisan bill by a vote of 68-29 to close the terrorist loophole in our intelligence laws. Their bill represents a compromise between Congress and the administration. It rightly restores the original intent of the FISA by ensuring that intelligence officials can conduct surveillance on foreign targets without a court order while still protecting the civil liberties of the American people. It also grants liability protection to telecommunications companies that helped the government after September 11. Allowing these companies to be subjected to frivolous lawsuits threatens their future cooperation, which could cripple America's counterterrorism efforts. 
   The Senate bill is a responsible plan for protecting our Nation against terrorist threats. Many times the Senate sends bills over here and they are very shortly passed by the House. The House must act quickly on the Senate's bill, as well, and send it to the President so he can sign it. Failing to do so is effectively failing to protect our country and American citizens. 
   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 5349 and instead immediately pass the Senate's version of the bill so we can send this important bill to the President. 
   There may not be, Mr. Speaker, a terrorist behind every bush, but they, today, present a clear and present danger.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (NATIONAL OCEAN EXPLORATION PROGRAM ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his kind remarks and great description, I might add, of the bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I obviously rise in strong support of H.R. 1834 and am very pleased that it's here under this bipartisan arrangement. It authorizes both the Ocean Exploration and National Undersea Research Programs in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
   According to the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, about 95 percent of the ocean floor remains unexplored. This vast area teems with undiscovered species and natural and cultural resources. On virtually every expedition, oceanographers and explorers make fascinating new discoveries. Hydrothermal vents in the Pacific, numerous new species, and important archeological sites are but a few of the important discoveries made in the past 30 years. 
   Consequently, the report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation should lead and expand our national ocean exploration and undersea research programs. 
   I am proud to be the sponsor of H.R. 1834. I'm proud that it's a bipartisan piece of legislation, and I'm proud that it promotes implementation of the commission's recommendations. 
   This bill authorizes two important programs: the Ocean Exploration Program as well as the National Undersea Research Program, also known as NURP. The Ocean Exploration Program was created to investigate the oceans for the purpose of discovery and the advancement of knowledge. It is the NOAA program established to, first, explore and map the oceans unknown and poorly known living and nonliving resources and, second, to gain new insights about its physical, chemical, biological, and archeological characteristics. 
   Title I of the bill, the National Ocean Exploration Program Act, will create better coordination between NOAA and the National Science Foundation. The purposes of the act are to expand the ocean exploration to discover new marine substances that potentially have therapeutic benefits; to study the unique marine ecosystems, organisms, and the geology of the world's oceans; and to maximize ocean research effectiveness by integrating multiple scientific disciplines in the ocean science community. 
   A new element created by the legislation is an Ocean Exploration Advisory Board. The National Undersea Research Program is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. As the Federal agency responsible for managing living marine and coastal organisms, NOAA requires a presence beneath the sea and the Great Lakes to better understand the systems under its management. NURP provides NOAA with the unique capability to access the undersea environment. NURP also provides scientists with the tools and expertise they need to investigate the undersea environment, including submersibles, remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, mixed gas diving gear, underwater laboratories and observatories. 
   Title II of the bill, the National Undersea Research Program Act of 2007, formally authorizes the National Undersea Research Program for the first time, and we're very proud of this. The legislation creates a competitive process for the extramural undersea research centers to encourage the very best undersea research program for the United States. 
   Both of these programs authorized in this legislation are core to the mission of NOAA. I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (ASIAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr Speaker, as the author of this legislation, I am pleased the House is now considering H.R. 465. This simple non-controversial legislation will extend the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund at existing authorization levels of up to $5 million each year until September 30, 2012. 
   During our public hearing on H.R. 465, the Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers this Fund, testified that: ``The Asian Elephant Conservation Act has greatly enhanced the conservation status of the Asian elephant''. 
   There are currently only about 40,000 wild Asian elephants living in south and southeastern Asia. As a result, this species is listed on our Endangered Species Act, on Appendix I of CITES and on the World Conservation Union's Red List. 
   In response to the ongoing slaughter of this keystone species, Congress adopted the Asian Elephant Conservation Act which I was pleased to sponsor in 1997. In the decade since its enactment, the Secretary of the Interior has carefully reviewed over 300 conservation projects designed to save Asian elephants for future generations. The Secretary has approved 183 of these grant proposals which  have received $9 million in Federal funds and $11.3 million in private matching funds. 
   As every witness testified, there is an overwhelming need to extend this important conservation program and there is no question that these conservation funds have had a profound impact on protecting this irreplaceable species. While everyone enjoys seeing elephants at the National Zoo, it is far more important that they continue to exist in the wild in Burma, India and Thailand. The road to extinction is a one-way street and we must work to ensure that the Asian elephant does not make that journey. 
   I am proud to urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on H.R. 465, the Asian Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act. It is an appropriate and sound investment of U.S. tax dollars.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am in very, very strong support of this amendment. The Future Combat System is a system that leverages technology in a way that it will help us in the future a great deal. This system has been underdevelopment for quite some years, and for the last 3 years in a row, not counting this year, for the last 3 years in a row, there have been significant cuts made to the program. 
   This year, as Mr. Akin correctly pointed out, is the year where we get out the yardstick and say how much progress have we made? Do we want to continue the system or do we want to cancel it? A $233 million cut to this program this year to me seems to be very unwise because this is the yardstick year. This is the year where we make the decision, based on the progress that we have been able to measure, whether the program goes forward or is modified or is cancelled. 
   And so I believe that this amendment should be one we all support.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (ENSURING MILITARY READINESS THROUGH STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY DEPLOYMENT POLICY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. I want to thank Mr. Hunter for yielding time and just say to my friend, Mrs. Tauscher, that I very much understand and appreciate the goals that she has in bringing this legislation forward, but, at the same time, I think there are some realities that we have to face relative to the subject that the bill addresses. 
   The problem here is twofold. Number one, there is the issue of command flexibility. As Mr. Hunter pointed out just a few minutes ago, we learned in previous wars that making decisions on tactical activities in a war should not probably be made at the White House and probably should even less likely be made here by 435 Members of Congress. 
   So while I very much appreciate and agree with the goal of making sure that every soldier and Marine and every member of the four services gets time to recharge their batteries between deployments, having a law which stipulates how precisely that is to be done is a very unwise thing to do. 
   Secondly, let me say that this problem involves the total number of people that we have in the service. We make decisions from time to time, and sometimes those decisions are right, hopefully most of the time those decisions are right, but sometimes they are not. 
   In 1991 and 1992, when we started to hear about the ``peace dividend,'' we decided, collectively, all of us together, some in disagreement, that it would be okay to reduce the size of the Army from about 18 divisions to the equivalent of 10. We collectively decided to reduce the number of people in the Army significantly, almost by half. So today we are operating with the equivalent of 10 divisions, made up in a different structure, a brigade structure; and today 20 of those brigades, Army and Marine brigades, are deployed in Iraq. 
   When the Commander in Chief and his military commanders in the field decide they need to make changes, they make them based on need, based on threat, and based on operational plans and operational capabilities. That flexibility must in this situation, in my opinion, be preserved. 
   So, while those of us on this side of the aisle certainly share the goals of the gentlewoman from California, this bill is most unwise and will do, as Mr. Hunter said, much more harm than good to our troops in the field.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (HONORING THE 53,000 SOLDIERS, SAILORS, AIRMEN, MARINES, AND CIVILIANS THAT COMPRISE THE NATION'S SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES COMMUNITY -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I have the highest regard for every man and woman who serves in the United States military. Whether they be a member of the Air Force or the Army or the Marine Corps or the Navy or the Coast Guard, everyone who volunteers to serve our country deserves the gratitude of every American citizen. And to the extent that they have provided the great service to our country, we all thank them, each and every one. 
   Just as people volunteer to be in the military, some people, various people, in the military volunteer to do different things. And those who volunteer to be members of the Special Operations Command are often referred to as the ``tip of the spear.'' This is the insignia on this plate of the Special Operations Command. It is the tip of the spear. And we refer to them as members of an organization that is the tip of the spear because they volunteer to put them themselves in great danger very often. They do it for our country. They do it for our government. They do it for their families and their friends and neighbors; and it makes them, in my view, a very special cadre of people in the United States military. 
   Today, there are 53,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines in the joint organization made up of members of all four services known as the Special Operations Command. The acronym, of course, that we use is SOCOM. These are highly trained individuals who devote themselves and commit their lives to the very defense of our country. 
   There are people in the Special Operations Command who take part in something called direct action. The Navy SEALs would be such an organization, Naval Special Warfare Command actually is the formal name, or Navy SEALs as they more generally are known as people who are often direct actors. 
   And then there are special operations folks who are indirect actors, who try to manipulate, if you will, the shape of the battlefield or attitudes on the battlefield among our enemies that would be beneficial to us. These are civil affairs people and psychological operations people and others who take part in an indirect way rather than in a so-called direct way. 
   Since SOCOM's inception, the special operators have conducted high-profile missions, including operations to establish a democratic government in Panama, hunting Scuds during the first Gulf War, providing relief to Kurds during Operation Provide Comfort, and the mission to capture Mohammed Hadid in Somalia, and many other operations around the world. 
   Not only did they put themselves in great danger, and not only do they perform a great duty to our country, but they do it at great sacrifice for themselves and their family. They train constantly. They have deployed very often and they are, indeed, a credit to themselves, a credit to their families, who pay a sacrifice as well, and a great credit to our Armed Forces. 
   So I rise today to commend the gentlelady from Virginia (Mrs. Drake) for offering this resolution. It is certainly one that is well deserved on this 20th anniversary of the establishment of the United States Special Operations Command.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (COASTAL AND ESTUARINE LAND CONSERVATION PROGRAM ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting authorization of the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program. H.R. 1907--the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program Act authorizes a voluntary partnership program to provide badly needed Federal funds for the purchase and protection of sensitive coastal ecosystems with the goal of better ensuring the ecological and economic health of our coastal communities. 
   It is well known that more and more people are moving to the coast to enjoy its beauty and recreational opportunities. An estimated 60 percent of Americans will live along our coasts by 2010. Fourteen of our Nation's 20 largest cities are located on the coast. More than ever, the pressures of urbanization and pollution along our Nation's shores threaten to impair watersheds, impact wildlife habitat and cause irreparable damage to the fragile coastal ecology. 
   Created by Congress in fiscal year 2002, the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program--also known as CELP--was modeled after the successful Forest Legacy Program. To date, this program has invested nearly $200 million towards 150 conservation projects in 26 of the Nation's 35 coastal and Great Lakes States and territories. This Federal investment has leveraged more than an equal amount of State, local and private funding, demonstrating the importance of coastal protection throughout the Nation and the critical role of Federal funding to its success. 
   More importantly, the program has helped to conserve lands and waters that will offer numerous benefits to local communities by preserving water quality, natural areas for wildlife and birds, and outdoor recreational opportunities--thereby protecting for the future the very things we love about the coasts. Although the program has been in existence for six years, it has yet to be formally authorized. This legislation seeks to do just that. 
   This bill will formally authorize this Federal/State partnership program explicitly for conservation of coastal lands. CELP will award grants on a competitive basis to the 35 coastal and Great Lakes States and territories or National Estuarine Research Reserves for the purpose of protecting lands that are critical to the health of our coasts and estuaries. This legislation will allow coastal States to compete for 1 to 1 matching funds to acquire land or easements from willing sellers to protect coastal areas that have considerable conservation, recreation, ecological, historical or aesthetic values threatened by development or conversion. 
   By establishing a plan for the preservation of our coastal areas, the Act will build on the foundation laid down by the Coastal Zone Management Act, and will encourage voluntary land conservation partnerships among the Federal Government, State agencies, local governments, private landowners and nonprofits. It will not only improve the quality of coastal areas and the marine life they support, but also sustain surrounding communities and their way of life. 
   I thank Representative Capps and all of our cosponsors for their support of H.R. 1907 and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been said here on the floor by more than one speaker, or suggested at least, that the war in Iraq is not part of the war on terror. I disagree. I could not disagree more with that statement. But if you agree with that statement, and if you are casting your vote because you think that is a rationale upon which you can justify your vote, I hope you are sure. 
   I would say I would hope you are sure because I am in my 23rd year, and I know how this place works. It is a wonderful system, because we almost always have a chance to come back and correct our mistakes. A vote on tax policy? I happen to favor lower taxes. But if we make a tax vote that is a bad vote, we can come back next year and fix it. Or if we spend too much money on transportation this year, we can come back next year and reduce it. 
   This resolution takes us down a different road. This starts us down a road where, at some point, we won't be able to come back next year and just fix it. 
   You don't have to believe me. But listen to what our enemies say. I have here the text of a letter that was written on July 9, 2005, from Ayman al-Zawahiri, the author, the second in command in al Qaeda, to al-Zarqawi, the person who at that time was the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq. ``Our intended goal in this age is to establish a caliphate in the manner of the prophet.'' 
   Now, I don't claim to be an expert in Islam, but I am told that at one time under this establishment of a caliphate, the caliphate stretched from Spain through the Middle East and Northern Africa to Central Asia and to India. That is a vast stretch. If that is the goal, then we ought to be aware of it, because it becomes a very serious matter. 
   The first stage of this process is to expel the Americans from Iraq, according to al-Zawahiri. 
   The second stage, establish an Islamic authority or an emirate, to develop it and support it until it achieves a level of a caliphate over as much territory as you can spread power in Iraq. 
   The third stage, he says, is to extend the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq. 
   The fourth stage, it may coincide with what came before, he says, the clash with Israel, because Israel was established only to challenge any new Islamic entity.     
   So clearly, the al Qaeda leadership believes that Iraq is part of the global situation that we refer to as the global war on terror, and if that is right, and I think at least for me I have to assume that that is their intention, Iraq is certainly part of the global war on terror from a Western perspective. And so what the President has suggested is to take advantage of the assets that we have developed, while training Iraqi soldiers to provide for their own security, and send three brigades into the Sunni Triangle, mostly in Baghdad, to be supported by the 21,500 Americans who he has proposed to send. I heard yesterday that the Iraqi brigades are, in fact, showing up in Baghdad at a 75 percent level, which is better than anyone expected, at least better than I expected. Maybe others expected better. 
   So I think if we are going to take on this effort to develop a caliphate, as one of the previous speakers said before it gets here, then maybe we ought to do what the commander of the national VFW suggests. 
   The commander of the national VFW put out a press release, and I have the text of it here. ``The national commander of the Nation's largest organization of combat veterans is very concerned that the ongoing debate in Congress about the planned troop buildup will be perceived by those in uniform as a sign that America's lawmakers have given up on them and their mission in Iraq. 
   ``My generation,'' he said, ``learned the hard way that when military decisions are second-guessed by opinion polls or overruled by politicians, it's the common soldier and their families who pay the price. 
   ``There is no question,'' he said, ``that mistakes have been made in the prosecution of the war in Iraq,'' but ``there is no playbook to fight an unconventional war against an unconventional enemy that wears no uniform and acts without conscience, yet our forces have adapted and are performing brilliantly,'' and I agree with him. 
   ``We fully respect congressional oversight and the first amendment rights of all Americans to debate issues of national importance, but the VFW is very concerned with the tone and timing of it,'' he said. ``We need to send the message to our troops that America wants them to succeed in Iraq by giving the buildup a chance to succeed.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I think the commander of the national VFW is absolutely right, and I thank the gentleman for yielding time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. 
   First, let me begin by saying that I have observed several speakers here during this debate who I am sure in good faith made the representations that they did, that the short-term redeployment or surge was not a recommendation of the Iraq Study Group. 
   This is a copy of the report of the Iraq Study Group. On page 73 there is a discussion of increasing troop levels in Iraq. And the Iraq Study Group did in fact suggest that a substantial increase of 100,000 or 200,000 troops would likely be not a good idea. 
   However, they say this, and I quote. ``We could, however, support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad, or to speed up the training and equipping mission if the U.S. commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be effective.'' 
   And so I would say to my friends that is in fact the case. And so I hope that that puts that matter to rest. Mr. Speaker, this resolution, I suspect, has been drawn up as a well-meaning resolution. There have been some suggestions here today that it is political in nature. I do not know if that is true. But I would hope that it is a good, well-meaning resolution. 
   I have been here now for well over 20 years, I am in my 23rd year. I have learned a lot about the House. This is a great system. We do great work here. And we usually do it right. Sometimes we make mistakes. 
   On many issues we make corrections to those mistakes. When we pass tax bills, months later or a year later we will make some technical corrections to the tax bill, because we did not do it quite right. In many other cases, if we spend too much money in an appropriations bill this year, we can come back and reduce it in a future year. 
   But I would suggest to my friends who support this resolution that it is a start down a road; it is a start down a road that at some point could have disastrous effects. So we want to make sure, I am sure you want to make sure, that you get this right. I would like to walk you through some reasons why I think that this takes us in the wrong direction.  
   In fact, there is a bunch of evidence to point to the fact that the enemy is watching what we are doing, that they have learned from our past mistakes, and that they are in fact hoping that this resolution passes, for some fairly obvious reasons. Let me go through four case studies that we have made about similar situations. 
   First, a situation in Lebanon. Lebanon was a wonderful country. It was a democracy. It had a Parliament. Had Christians and Muslims living together sharing power. In the middle 1970s, things began to change. The big change was that fundamentalist Islam came to town and Hezbollah came to town.     
   And in 1975, a war erupted, which has been called a civil war. There was the emergence of multi-sided militia groups, sectarian violence and civilian massacres. Sounds familiar. 
   In 1982, the U.N. sent in a multi-national force to try to quell the violence. And on October 23, 1983 the Marine barracks was bombed by Hezbollah with the support of Iran. The best description of it I have heard or read comes from a description by some Navy SEALs who were sleeping in their bunker on the beach, not in the barracks. And the magnitude of the explosion, to hear them describe it, was something to behold. And it shocked America. And in 1984 we withdrew our Marines. The remainder of the peacekeeping force was gone by April of 1984. There was no serious U.S. retaliation for the Beirut bombing. The civil war continued until 1990. Hezbollah emerged from a loose coalition of Shia groups and, with Iranian assistance, quickly grew into a strong fighting force in Lebanon. That is case number one. 
   Case Number two. We have got troops today in Afghanistan. If things had happened somewhat differently a couple of decades earlier, they might not be there at all. But in the mid-1980s the Afghan resistance builds momentum with Muslim fighters to recruit a jihad against the Soviets. And we all have read about that resistance movement. It was fierce, and we actually helped them. And in 1989 the Soviets had had enough, just like we had had enough in Lebanon, and the Soviets withdrew. 
   From 1989 to 1992, the Afghan civil war continued until the government of Afghanistan fell. In 1993 and 1994, the Taliban came along, and they gained power. In 1996, Osama bin Laden moves back to Afghanistan and forges an alliance between al Qaeda and the Taliban. Since then, we know the history very well of Afghanistan. A void was there to be filled, and the fundamentalist Islamists filled it. 
   Now, I would like to turn to the third case study, the case study involving Somalia. In 1980, the Somalia Government becomes increasingly totalitarian and resistance movements emerge across the country, which leads to a civil war in 1991. Being great big-hearted Americans, in 1992 and 1993, we decided to save the starving Somalis, and we initiated Operation Restore Hope. In May 1993, the U.N. assumed the mission from the U.S. as an international mission. In October of 1993 the battle for Mogadishu took place. Eighteen Americans were killed. The U.S. stops operations against Aidid, and in March, 1995, both U.S. and U.N. forces withdraw. It was later confirmed that al Qaeda supported Aidid's militia. There is evidence that the U.S. withdrawal inspired bin Laden's first bombing of the World Trade Center. The Islamist fundamentalists filled the void once again. 
   Let me move to my fourth case study, the Israeli withdrawal, again, from Lebanon. Preceding the Israeli invasion in 1982 the PLO was conducting attacks on Israel from south Lebanon. In 1982, Israeli forces invaded southern Lebanon in response to an assassination attempt by Abu Nidal against Israel's ambassador to the U.K. After attacking PLO, Syrian and Muslim Lebanese forces, Israel occupied southern Lebanon. 
   If you want to read a great account of this, read the book entitled ``Because They Hate.'' It is a book written by a Christian woman by the name of Brigitte Gabriel, who is now living in the U.S., and she tells the story of living in a bunker, living in a bunker until the war was over, not a nice thing to do. 
   In 1982 to 1984, the multi-national peacekeeping force came to Lebanon. The PLO withdrawal in 1982 is replaced by a strengthening of Hezbollah. In 1985, Israel moves to the security zone in southern Lebanon. And in 2000, Israel withdraws. 
   I only need to point to the events of last summer in Lebanon to say, once again, the fundamentalist Islamists, Hezbollah, filled the void. 
   We are embarked today on a discussion of another potential road to withdrawal. And I don't represent that this resolution does that, but it puts us in that direction. Evidence of our failure to respond to terrorism has emboldened al Qaeda for years. This withdrawal would be another one, if it goes that far. 
   In 1993, the World Trade Center bombing took place. We didn't respond. In 1996, the Khobar Tower bombings took place and we didn't respond. In 1998, the U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania occurred and we didn't respond. In 2000, the attack on the USS Cole occurred and we didn't respond. The result, New York City, 9/11. 
   People ask me why I am so concerned about this. People ask me why, Saxton, you have been on the floor too much. 
   Let me show you the next chart. This is why I am concerned. This is my family. 
   When I first ran for Congress in 1984 the steering committee asked me why I wanted to be a Member of Congress. I said, because I have had a good life. I said, because this is a great country, and because I want my family to have the same opportunities I have had. 
   This is my son Marty and his wife and their little gal, my granddaughter Allie. This is my daughter, Jen, this is Kate, and this is Jacqueline. 
   I will admit the artist got a little carried away because they made a montage out of this picture and they put my grandchildren on here two or three times each. But I will tell you what, if we go down this road to the point where we can't correct a mistake, I wonder what the future is going to be for my family and for your family. 
   And so this resolution today is an important one. It may be only 97 words or whatever it is, and it may have only two statements in it, but we are headed down a road, and it is a dangerous one, in my opinion.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I happen to believe that this motion to instruct is extremely important. I think it is extremely important for two reasons. First, as Mr. Hunter pointed out, this provision provides instruction to authorize the full $192 billion supplemental for the war spending bill without strings or date certain to withdraw American forces from Iraq. I think that is important. And I will say why a little bit later here. But I also I think it  is important to recognize, as this provision also does, that there are consequences for not carrying out our actions in Iraq and in other places in the world, for that matter, in a responsible fashion. 
   This measure instructs the House conferees to accept a provision that has already been passed by the Senate. It is known as provision 1536 which states that it is the sense of Congress that a failed state in Iraq would become a safe haven for Islamic radicals, including al Qaeda and Hezbollah, and others, who are determined to attack the United States here at home and our allies. 
   Let me speak to the first point to say why I think it is important that we go forward to authorize the full $192 billion supplemental war spending bill. All of us should be students of history, particularly recent history. I know that the chairman of the Armed Services Committee is a great historian himself. But recent events I think are extremely important. Perhaps some of our colleagues here have not watched this as closely as perhaps some of us on the Armed Services Committee, but as we saw progress begin to take place in Iraq, many of us asked why. And I think it was universally accepted that one of the reasons was that the Sunni tribal leaders, for a couple of reasons, I believe, began to cooperate with our forces and our personnel who are there. One reason was in their own self-interest. They recognized that the time of wishing each other, that is Sunnis and Shias ill, was drawing to a close because the Iraqi people themselves were tired of the violence. So just like any of our neighbors here would be tired of violence under those circumstances, the Iraqis grew tired of it as well. 
   But the second reason I believe we began to make the progress that we see today is very simply that the Iraqi people became convinced, in spite of many days of rhetoric on this floor, became convinced that we weren't going to leave them, that we were going to stay and finish the job. And so the commitment that would be expressed by the passage of this language I think is extremely important. 
   But I also think it is important to recognize that the provision notes that a failed state in Iraq could lead to a broader regional conflict. There was a lot of talk here this morning on this floor and yesterday in the news media about the state of Iran, and why was it that in 2003 we now believe that they discontinued their effort to create nuclear weapons. Could it have been something that happened in their neighborhood? Could it have been the determination that our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines showed next door in Iraq? And could it be that the Iranian leadership recognized that there were actions that they needed to take in their best interest which perhaps included the discontinuation of their effort to create nuclear weapons? 
   Senate provision 1536 concludes by stating that the Congress should commit itself to a strategy that will not leave a failed state in Iraq, that will continue the progress that we have seen in recent months and should not pass legislation that will undermine our military's ability to prevent a failed state in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by very, very sincerely thanking my good friend from Missouri, Chairman Skelton, for the great leadership that he has provided in the months past in writing the original version and then shaping the bill and then using his steady hand to guide us through the conference, of course with the help of my good friend, Ranking Member Duncan Hunter. Both of these leaders provided great direction for us, and I might say that the product of their work is here today. I agree with the chairman, that this is a very, very good bill, and I am very fortunate to be able to stand here today to say how important I think it is that we all support it.     
   Unfortunately, Ranking Member Hunter could not be here today, but I know he is very proud of this conference report as well. I'd like to thank all of the subcommittee chairmen and their ranking members for their hard work and leadership. It is responsible for almost 1,500 pages that this bill contains. And the staff that helped make this a reality, obviously Members would not have been able to be here today if it were not for them either. 
   This is a good, bipartisan bill. Last Thursday, the House Armed Services Committee filed this conference report after an overwhelming majority of conferees signed the report. Seldom in my career here have I seen this kind of agreement among Members on the bill. Our subcommittee chairmen and their ranking members will provide a detailed summary of the bill, so I will only highlight a few key areas. 
   Most importantly, this bipartisan bill takes care of the brave men and women serving our country at home and abroad. It authorizes $506.9 billion in budgetary authority for the Department of Defense and the national security programs of the Department of Energy. Additionally, it supports current operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in the global war on terrorism by authorizing $189.4 billion in supplemental funding for operational costs, personnel expenses and procurement of new equipment for fiscal year 2008. 
   This amount provides for end-strength growth in both the Army and the Marine Corps, continuing initiatives started several years ago by the Armed Services Committee, by authorizing increases of 13,000 Army and 9,000 Marine Corps active duty personnel to sustain our required missions. 
   Additionally, this conference report authorizes a 3.5 percent pay increase, as the chairman remarked earlier. These pay raises for all members of the Armed Forces for 2008 are extremely important. 
   We talk a lot about quality of life and here we're doing something about it. Some of the initiatives in this legislation continue successful, practical programs such as the Commander's  Emergency Response Program, which is working well in battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan. Other initiatives reinforce good legislation that the House has already passed, such as the Wounded Warrior legislation to address the challenges that face our recovering servicemembers and their families. Still others modify existing authorities or establish promising new programs and new policies. 
   Some of the new programs and policies include these: 
   Providing $17.6 billion for the mine resistant ambush protected vehicle, an armored vehicle which will save lives going forward; setting guidelines for all private security contractors operating in Iraq and Afghanistan and other areas where we have combat operations. And we know from recent news reports how important this provision is. 
   We also authorize eight additional C-17s to support the intratheater lift requirements and meet the airlift needs for the increased end strength in the Army and Marine Corps. 
   We added major acquisition reform initiatives, such as establishing new responsibilities for the Joint Requirements Oversight Council and mandating that new acquisition programs be aligned with the missions of the Department and the competency and capability of the service proposing the program. 
   And finally, we acted to elevate the chief of the National Guard bureau to a four-star general and adopted many of the recommendations of the Commission on National Guard and Reserve Corps. 
   Just as importantly, this legislation avoids contentious language, such as the hate crimes provision, which would have put our bill at risk of a Presidential veto. I want to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Ike Skelton, whose hard work in shepherding this vital legislation through the conference has guaranteed that our servicemen and women will get what they need, and they will get it when they need it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   I want to say a word on behalf of the Air Land Subcommittee. I want to first thank our great subcommittee chairman, Mr. Abercrombie, the gentleman from Hawaii, for his outstanding work and for his great cooperation on our subcommittee. 
   The major highlights of the Air Land Subcommittee's portion of this bill provide aircraft providing multiyear procurement authority for the CH-47 helicopter program; ensures continued development of two options for the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter; authorizes $2.3 billion for eight badly needed C-17 aircraft; and allows the Air Force to proceed with their request to divest 24 C-130E and 85 KC-135E aircraft. These retirements will greatly help the Air Force. The aircraft are grounded or are unable to be used in combat operations. 
   The land forces under our subcommittee benefited from several areas of upgraded armor: the mine resistant ambush protected MRAP vehicles; the up-armored Humvees; the body armor that we provide in the IED fragment armor kits are very important elements of the bill. We also authorized $3.4 billion for the Army's future combat systems. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Defense continues to have acquisition directives that are rarely followed. This is not a good thing. Requirements for advancement through research and development to procurement, these provisions are routinely waived by the Department of Defense. It is hard to know if acquisition policies actually work if we rarely follow them. 
   Mr. Speaker, the conference report takes steps to address some of these issues, and I am encouraged by some of the things that I have recently seen and heard coming from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. 
   Mr. Speaker, this conference report supports our military men and women and provides them with the equipment they need while at the same time taking steps to redress acquisition concerns of Congress. This conference report certainly in this regard deserves all of our support.

   Mr. SAXTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. First let me, again, sincerely thank Chairman Skelton for the great job that he has done here bringing us to the floor with this bill today. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Ronald Reagan used to say that all of the things that Congress does are important and all the programs that we fund are great programs and important programs. But then he would say, ``But none of that really matters much if we don't have a good system to protect the American people and our national security.'' I have kept that in mind ever since I was a freshman here, because that was when I heard him say that.     
   I believe that this bill today carries on that same kind of tradition, because we work together as Republicans and Democrats, understanding that we have a finite amount of money and resources to put toward our national security, and therefore it's incumbent upon us to do it the best way we can. 
   We do face a multitude of threats to our way of life and our national security interests, and as legislators, we therefore must accept that it is our responsibility to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the best available tools at their disposal to combat those threats and protect those interests. 
   The provisions of this bill go a considerable way in demonstrating that kind of support. And so I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, the process that we've gone through to bring this bill to the floor has been an extensive one. We started under the leadership of Chairman Skelton in January, and as we moved through the days and the weeks, there were numerous, both full committee and subcommittee hearings. 
   There were visits here on Capitol Hill in our office and in other places by military leaders. There were visits by us to the Pentagon and to bases around the continental United States and, I might add, there were visits by us to our soldiers, marines, airmen and sailors who are serving overseas. 
   There were briefings too numerous to count, and a good process. And I want to just take this opportunity to congratulate and thank Chairman Skelton for the orderliness and the fairness with which this process was conducted. 
   This is a good bill, and I intend to support it. It provides for some new things, provides for some force protection measures that are so important in the war that we're now engaged in. It provides for additional money for the Stryker system. It provides for additional resources for up-armored Humvees, and it provides for steps forward in the new Joint Tactical Vehicle program. 
   We added 10 more aircraft known as C-17s, which are strategic airlifters to get us to the fight. We took care of some personnel issues, including a significant pay raise for military personnel. And, because we're at war, and because we're using our military equipment, it wears out. It's a tough terrain that we're involved in in Iraq and Afghanistan, and so we included $3.6 billion for Army reset and $8.2 billion for Marine Corps reset. 
   And I might add that quality of life remains extremely important to the chairman, to the ranking member, and to all of us who serve on the committee, and so military construction dollars were added to provide the quality of life that is important to our military personnel. 
   Now, it's a good bill, and I'm going to support it. If I were the person sitting at the desk writing the bill all by myself, I would have done some things differently. But that being said, it continues to be a bill that is worthy of everyone's support. 
   I would have tried to find a way to include more money for the Future Combat System. We cut it by almost 25 percent. This is the Army's modernization program, and the first modernization program anything like it since World War II. It combines the use of technology that's available today with  some more traditional combat equipment, but it's good for the future. It's good for urban combat, it's good for being able to see the enemy who now has found ways to hide on our conventional systems. And it's a big cut.     
   I would have also tried to add back the 9 percent that was reduced from the missile defense system. Today we have a missile defense system that actually will work once it is deployed, but we reduced it by 9 percent. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, once again I hope that the majority of our colleagues on this side of the aisle will support this bill. I think it is a good bill. It is one that is needed, particularly in these times when the United States of America is at war. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SAXTON. Thank you very much, Mr. Hunter, for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, one of the provisions that is contained in this en bloc amendment is a provision that will help provide a higher level of security for our military personnel in the continental United States. As most of you probably read in the newspaper, a terrorist cell was apprehended in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, a short time ago. 
   They had been planning a small arms attack on soldiers, Reservists, actually, who were preparing to be deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan at Fort Dix. 
   One of the elements of this planning involved a pizza delivery man. The pizza delivery man would access the base to deliver pizza to soldiers in the  evening who had completed their day's training. 
   As the apprehension was made, it was disclosed that this individual had actually entered onto the base, memorized the roads and the buildings on the base, and had actually drawn a map to provide to the other members of the cell who would take part in the attack. 
   This provision that's in this en bloc amendment would provide some extra tools for base commanders to be sure that people who enter onto Federal installations would have a background check done through the FBI, as well as through the Department of Homeland Security where immigration records are kept. 
   I want to thank Mr. Andrews for his high level of cooperation on this, and also to express my thanks to the chairman for agreeing to make this provision part of this en bloc amendment. 
   I understand there are some questions about it. Mr. Andrews and I, I won't speak for him, as we work through this, between now and the time we get a conference report, there may be some changes that are necessary. The last thing we want to do is to unduly restrict civilian activities, legitimate civilian activities on and around military bases. 
   So I look forward to working with the chairman, the ranking member and Mr. Andrews and others who may be interested to make sure that we do not do something that is harmful to morale or stymies activities on or around military bases.

   Mr. SAXTON. Madam Chairman, this amendment, is perhaps well intended  but goes much too far. This together with the $764 million that has already been cut from the bill provides us with a 20 percent cut in the missile defense program. 
   Since 2001, contrary to what the proponents of this amendment just said, the Missile Defense Agency has conducted 27 successful hit-to-kill intercepts. That is 27 out of 36 attempts. I am very proud of these results. 
   Let me just highlight some of them. On September 1, 2006, we successfully employed an operational ground-based mid-course defense interceptor. 
   In November 2005 and in June 2006, and again in April 2007, less than a month ago, the SM-3 successfully intercepted both separating and unitary targets. 
   In July 2006, January 2007, and April 6, 2007, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, THAAD, System, successfully intercepted unitary targets. 
   Finally, during this past March, we saw a successful hit in-flight test of the Airborne Laser Targeting System; all successes, not failures.

   Mr. SAXTON. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment for two very important reasons. First, there is a growing threat. Today's Herald Tribune, a newspaper owned by The New York Times, says that North Korea is developing new, long-range missiles capable of hitting Guam, an article from the Herald Tribune. 
   The second set of reasons that I support this amendment is that while there is a growing threat there is a rapidly emerging U.S. missile defense system. Since 2001, our successes have  been many. We have conducted 27 successful hit-to-kill intercepts. That's 27 out of 36 attempts. 
   Therefore, let me just highlight some of the most recent successes. On September 1, 2006, we successfully employed an operational ground-based midcourse defense interceptor. 
   In November of 2005, June 2006 and, again, in April of 2007, less than a month ago, we successfully deployed an SM-3 interceptor, both separating and unitary targets. 
   In July 2006, January 2007 and April 2007, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, THAAD, System successfully intercepted unitary targets. 
   Finally, during the past March, we saw successful in-flight tests of the Airborne Laser Targeting System used for boost-phase intercept. Each of the near-term capabilities of PATRIOT, Aegis BMD, and GMD are only successful today because we provided them funding to test and develop them. 
   Cutting the Missile Defense Agency by $764 million will have the exact opposite effect. Therefore, knowing that our warfighters are asking for additional missile defense capabilities as soon as possible and that we have a missile defense system that actually works, Congress should not reduce defense spending on missile defense in light of the growing and clearly demonstrated threat by our adversaries.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. I want to thank Mr. Hunter for yielding time. 
   Mr. Chairman, there has been a lot said here tonight about bipartisanship and working together, and it's absolutely been a fantastic experience for the last 2 years we've worked under the leadership of our good friend, Ike Skelton. I might say that one of the reasons that this bipartisanship works so well is very simply because we're all friends. We're friends in the committee, we're friends in the hallway, we're friends in our offices, and we are friends here on the floor, and we're friends when we're not in session. 
   And so we appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight on the floor in that spirit. 
   I might also thank my good friend from California (Mr. Hunter) for the kind remarks that he offered with regard to my service. But I want to say something, too, about Mr. Hunter, because for the last several years before Ike Skelton, Mr. Hunter was our chairman, and now he's our ranking member. Following in the footsteps of Floyd Spence and Bob Stump, Duncan Hunter picked up the job of being chairman and continued to set the tone for the bipartisanship that is a hallmark of the Armed Services Committee. 
   Perhaps as only Ronald Reagan could have said it years ago when I first came to Congress, he said, You know, a lot of things are important around here, but there is nothing that's more important, maybe there are some things that are as important, but nothing is more important than our national security. 
   And the bipartisanship with which the Armed Services Committee, under the leadership of both Mr. Skelton and Mr. Hunter and their predecessors, has approached this issue is very, very important. I would like to thank the gentleman for the great job that he's done, as well as my friend, Ike Skelton. 
   Force protection is a very important element of this bill. We know that force protection has changed a great deal because of the threat that we face in Iraq and Afghanistan of an conventional nature. 
   In this bill we upgraded the funding available for the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected Vehicle, the MRAP. We have $947 million to upgrade the armor on Humvees, and $2.2 million for the Abrams tank upgrades, the Bradley fighting vehicle, as well as the Stryker. And so we once again put our soldiers first and are providing the protection for them that they need. 
   One of my pet projects in the years that I have been on the committee has been the moving forward of the C-17, and here again, we've got funding or we've got authorization here for 15 additional C-17s, and hopefully we will continue to move forward with that. 
   There is one area that I have a concern about in this bill, but it's a whole lot better than it could have been when it started. Our great friend, Neil Abercrombie, compromised with us on the Future Combat System. 
   While it's important to provide force protection for today's Army, it's also important to get ready for tomorrow's Army. And while the Air Force, as well as the Marine Corps, as Mr. Hunter pointed out, adopted a revolutionary system known as the V-22, which is a fixed-wing aircraft. It can take off vertically and can fly twice as fast as a helicopter. That was revolutionary. In the Air Force, we have revolutionary systems, the F-22, the Joint Strike Fighter, which are revolutionary because they can do things that we never dreamed that we could do before. 
   The Army has been an evolutionary developer, and the FCS, the Future Combat System, is the first, in my time here, revolutionary system adopted by the Army. We cut the funding for the Future Combat System by $233 million. I think that's a mistake. This is a big year for the FCS, and in my view, we should have funded it altogether. $3.6 billion is a lot of money. That's the total authorization for the FCS this  year. A 5 or 10 percent cut may not seem much, but this is the make-it-or-break-it year. This is the year we study the progress we've made with FCS and decide whether to go forward with it or not. A bad year to make a cut in my estimation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the opportunity to be here tonight under these circumstances. This is a good bill. I am certainly going to support it, and as Mr. Hunter suggested, this should be a unanimous vote, and I urge the House to make it so.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. I would like to engage my distinguished colleague, Chairman Mollohan, in a colloquy regarding the importance of supporting ecosystem-based monitoring to better understand water quality and ecosystem effects on our fisheries. 
   U.S. fisheries are experiencing increasing pressure as the near-shore marine ecosystems that sustain them deteriorate due to human activity and as blooms of jellyfish and other organisms that compete for food with juvenile fish like summer flounder grow in frequency and abundance.     
   The present trend may well be the cause of significant economic harm to coastal communities in various areas along the coast. The lack of rebuilding in one of our most important coastal fisheries, summer flounder, may be an example of the downside to managing a fishery without taking into account the ecosystem impacts on its ability to rebuild. An ecosystem-based approach to management requires ecosystem-based monitoring. The use of innovative, cost-effective, place-based data collection systems would provide continuous high-quality data on a number of important water quality and biological parameters that will greatly improve the data which fisheries are managed. 
   I hope, Mr. Chairman, you will consider allocating some of the programmatic resources in this bill to support the use of such new technologies that hold great promise.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask my colleagues to resist the urge to begin a withdrawal of our forces from Iraq within 90 days as this bill requires. Doing so would have a devastating impact on our ability to fight terrorism here and abroad and would have severe security impacts, not only in Iraq but throughout the Middle East and the entire region. My motion to recommit will ensure that when we withdraw from Iraq, we do so based on the conditions on the ground by requiring we take into account our national security assessments and the regional security implications, as outlined by the National Intelligence Estimate for Iraq. 
   We are not in the position to determine when U.S. forces should redeploy from Iraq. Only the commanders on the ground have that information. Only our commanders and diplomatic representatives on the ground can determine effectively when conditions are in place to warrant a troop withdrawal. It would be irresponsible for us to assign such an arbitrary timeline and impose it upon our leadership in theater. 
   We have to consider the conditions that we would leave the Iraqi Government to deal with going forward if we were to precipitously withdraw our personnel. 
   In my view, there are two significant threats that would remain behind, and the Iraqi Government would not be prepared to effectively counter either one. The al Qaeda threat in Iraq is significant. Al Qaeda's deputy commented a few days ago that the establishment of an Islamic state of Iraq is an important milestone on the way to reviving the Islamic caliphate. He noted that the defeat of American forces in Iraq is a key to this objective. 
   Securing control over Iraq is the strategic objective for al Qaeda that  will enable it to conduct operations against their targets in the Middle East, particularly against Israel, in addition to Europe and other U.S. global interests. Al Qaeda is particularly interested in the Persian Gulf oil fields, and Iraq would serve as a valuable staging area for such attacks.     
   Right now the Iraqi forces, security forces working in partnership with U.S. forces, are building momentum to erode al Qaeda's influence over Sunni insurgent groups in Iraq. A premature withdrawal would derail those efforts. 
   Al Qaeda in Iraq has been conducting indiscriminate attacks on Iraqi civilians. Sunni Arabs reject this tactic, and there is a growing backlash among the population. Sunni communities have encouraged thousands to join the local police forces and improve security. This is real progress. 
   A few days ago, al Qaeda's deputy warned Iraqi citizens that have supported the U.S. to consider what will happen to them after the Americans leave. If we abandon them now, we will be hard-pressed to gain their trust any time again in the future. 
   Iran also has an interest in seeing us fail and leave Iraq early. We know that Iran has been arming militia groups within Iraq. We know that Iran has infiltrated various levels of Iraqi government and its security forces. 
   If we redeployed from Iraq before the Maliki government has the capability to contain this threat, we would leave Iraq vulnerable to becoming an Iranian surrogate. 
   The porous Iraqi-Syrian border would provide Iran with contiguous, unfettered access to the coast of Lebanon. Through its support of Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran would then become even more a danger to the prospect of security and stability in the Middle East. 
   It would be irresponsible for us to even consider withdrawing from Iraq before the Maliki government has the capacity to deter these two threats. We must be conscious of the dangerous message we are sending with an early withdrawal. 
   First, we would lose the trust and will of the Iraqi people and the democratically elected government we worked so hard to create. The extremists associated with al Qaeda will hear a message that will tell them that Americans acknowledged defeat, and do not have the stomach for this war or any other war with al Qaeda. Our defeat would only inspire like-minded jihadists to take up their cause. 
   One need only look as far as yesterday to see the headlines of what could happen here in this country. A couple of days ago, we were reminded how close to home the terror threat is. The Fort Dix, New Jersey, individuals are just one example. 
   I ask everyone on both sides of the aisle to support this motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. I would like to thank Mr. Lewis for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this vote to me is about Jacqueline, Kate and Allie. Most of you don't know Jacqueline, Kate and Allie. You see, they are my granddaughters, the next generation, the generation that will perhaps be most affected by this policy.     
   To many in this Chamber, I am afraid this vote is not about the next generation; it is about setting a date for surrender. I believe it is time that this House go on record and vote on whether emergency funding bills should have a troop withdrawal timeline. 
   I want to reiterate to my colleagues the message that we are sending if we include such a timeline in this bill. Make no mistake, it is nothing less than a date certain for surrender. 
   Some in this Congress believe that the withdrawal timeline will send a message to the Iraqi Government to get serious about taking the lead and stabilizing Iraq. This is a flawed argument. It is flawed because it fails to address the collateral effects, the other effects and damage this message will do to the Iraqi people, the United States, to our allies, and to future American generations. 
   A surrender timeline for our troops will send a very clear message to al Qaeda, to the Sunni insurgent groups, and to the Shiite militias in Iraq. It will tell them that Americans no longer have the stomach to see this through. 
   The Iranians, who are continuing down the road of development of nuclear weapon capability despite sanctions and international pressure, will also take note of our timeline. Ahmadinejad already believes that Americans are incapable of resistance. He has said so. Our partner nations in the Middle East are watching to see the level of American commitment to Iraq before they increase their level of assistance. If we tell them we are going to pull up stakes and go home in 2008, can we expect much support from Saudi Arabia, from Egypt, from Qatar, from the UAE, from Jordan? I don't think so. 
   A surrender timeline will cause us to lose credibility with our allies, our other allies in the war on terror. Al Qaeda's front man, al-Zawahiri, warned our Iraqi counterparts already that America is about to depart and abandon them, just as we abandoned our allies in Vietnam. A surrender timeline  will certainly degrade the level of trust and confidence that Iraqi soldiers have toward our forces. The negative effect of this surrender timeline on our troops will be significant as well. 
   Some in Congress say the war is already lost. We have heard that already. In my opinion, it is not. We are on the right track with a renewed strategy toward Iraqi security. 
   Fred Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute recently commented: ``The conflict in Iraq is central to our foreign policy and our future, indeed, our well-being. Surely we must keep fighting to win,'' he said, ``as long as victory remains possible. And it is possible although not certain,'' he said, ``that we will win in Iraq. Right now, the signs are more hopeful than they have been in many months. It would be a tragedy for America and for Iraq to abandon the fight just as the possibility of success begins to emerge.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from San Diego for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in support of this legislation and want to highlight two key components of the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act that have significant relevance to some of my own constituents who are currently recovering at Walter Reed Mologne House. 
   Section 101 of the bill concerns improving the medical and dental care for servicemembers assigned to hospitals in outpatient status. Under this section, medical care case managers will have the training and resources to enable them to work closely with servicemembers in managing patient care and ensuring that patients fully understand his or her status and has a realistic expectation of the process ahead. 
   One of my constituents has been at Walter Reed for close to 10 months now after being evacuated from Iraq. During this time, he has had challenges in knowing his status in the disability determination process. He has been told that he had anywhere from 30 to 60 days left, although Walter Reed is working hard to get him home sooner. He is eager to get back home to his family and employer. His employer is holding his job for him. It is difficult for him to plan accordingly, however, because without being fully informed of his status in the system, it makes his future uncertain. 
   This bill would ensure that going forward, this individual would have up-to-date information on his status so that he is no longer kept in the dark about when he can expect to go home. 
   Section 101 of the bill also includes the establishment of the service-member advocate who will assist the patient in ensuring quality of life issues are taken care of, assisting in resolving problems related to financial or administrative matters, and overall ensure the patient and the family members are informed of benefits and program issues.     
   Both of my constituents who are currently at Walter Reed could have benefited greatly from the servicemember advocate. They have both encountered various administrative problems that have since been resolved with the assistance of their chain of command. However, I believe these problems would have been avoided in the first place had they been in contact with an advocate mandated to assist in these types of issues. 
   During discussions with these two soldiers and Walter Reed officials, the pattern that I have seen is that the actual medical care these wounded warriors receive is actually quite outstanding. The problems have really occurred in the red tape and bureaucracy that surrounds the administrative requirements and disability process. It should not take 3 or 4 months to begin receiving combat-related injury rehabilitation pay, for example. Servicemembers should receive accurate information in a timely manner when they inquire about their recovery plan or about specific benefits for which they might be eligible. 
   It is difficult at best for care managers to provide the necessary attention to a patient when they are handling caseloads beyond their capability. This bill goes a long way towards addressing this problem by limiting the number of cases for managers to oversee. 
   This bill and any other actions that this Congress can do to improve this system to ensure servicemembers receive the attention they deserve merits our full support; and I, therefore, urge everyone to support this bill.

   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take this opportunity to acknowledge the occasion of Rabbi Ellen Wolintz-Fields serving as today's guest chaplain. After that opening prayer, I might say that it is easy to see why our community is so graciously and well served by the rabbi. Her 3-year-old daughter, Cameron Elizabeth, is also with us here today, and we want to welcome her here as well. 
   The opportunity for having visiting chaplain guests is very special as it allows religious leaders from different faiths to begin our day of legislative duty. 
   On August 1, Rabbi Wolintz-Fields will celebrate her first anniversary as rabbi of Congregation B'Nai Israel in Toms River, New Jersey. Since 1950, this synagogue has served as a place of worship and guidance for teachings of Conservative Judaism while offering multiple support and volunteer services for our community. Today, the rabbi has over 400 families in her congregation. 
   Throughout her time both studying and serving, the rabbi has received various awards and recognitions for her contributions to preserving the Jewish faith. She is a recipient of the Goldstein Prize for Jewish History and the Rosalyn Gooen Milians Education Award. 
   While she has numerous noteworthy achievements, the Rabbi is particularly proud of her family. She is married to Jonathan Fields and, in addition to Cameron Elizabeth, they have a 1 1/2 -year-old son, Coby Dov. 
   I appreciate the rabbi taking time from her busy schedule to visit Washington, DC in order to give the opening prayer in the people's House, and I am glad I had the occasion to assist her to do so.

   Mr. Speaker, the short title of this bill is the ``Responsible Redeployment from Iraq Act.'' But, Mr. Speaker, this bill is not responsible. It is irresponsible. This bill is an irresponsible political act that will put our troops in danger and will result in catastrophic consequences for the United States, for the Iraqi people, for Israel, for the greater Middle Eastern region, and for the rest of the world. 
   As The Washington Post said in this morning's paper, this bill is being considered today for ``reasons having more to do with American politics than with Iraqi reality.'' 
   We must oppose this bill for numerous reasons, but let me mention just three. First, this bill fails to highlight the consequences of reducing our force levels too early. Such consequences would have a devastating effect on Iraq, would embolden al Qaeda in Iran, and would have severe security impacts on Israel and throughout the Middle East. 
   Al Qaeda and its proxies are engaged in a jihad against the United States and against the West. Al Qaeda's second in command, al Zawahiri, reaffirmed in a July 4 speech an al Qaeda plan to use Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia for jihadi planning and training against us. 
   Second, instead of putting forward legislation that offers an alternative to the plan being implemented by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, this political ploy calls for a vague ``troop reduction'' to be a ``limited presence'' in a ``safe and orderly manner'' within 120 days; but it fails to define any of these terms. 
   Specifically, this bill does not define what ``limited presence'' means. Does it mean 50,000 troops or 100,000 troops or 137,000 troops? What is a limited presence? No one knows. This is not a serious bill; it is a political bill. 
   Third, the bill requires the President to address whether it is necessary for our Armed Forces to carry out missions such as, listen to this, protecting diplomatic facilities and U.S. citizens, whether it is necessary to carry out acts like acting to disrupt or eliminate al Qaeda, or if it is necessary to carry out acts including training and equipping members of Iraqi security forces. Let me ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, for goodness sake, what else would we do there? 
   It is illogical to ask whether these missions are necessary and only proves once again that this bill is a political tool and not an alternative plan. 
   There are also two other points that my colleagues should consider. First, the situation in Iraq is not conducive to a force reduction. As an example of why this is true, the British have indicated their intent to draw down and have pulled back to the Basra airport. And as a result, Basra is now in the center of a power struggle between Shiite elements and tribal leaders over control of oil and political power. Local governance control has fractured along militia lines because of a British redeployment like the ones we are talking about in this bill. 
   Second, we need to remind ourselves of what happened in Beirut and Afghanistan when forces precipitously withdrew there. In October 1983, our Marine barracks in Beirut was bombed by Hezbollah with support from Iran. We withdrew our Marines in February 1984, and by that April, the remainder of the peacekeeping force had followed. That civil war continued until 1990 and Hezbollah emerged as a much stronger force, which to this day threatens the West. We should ask ourselves: Could the U.S. have prevented the rise of Hezbollah and the influence of Tehran  had we not had a precipitous withdrawal like the one provided for in this bill? 
   Second, in the 1980s, the Afghan resistance built momentum by recruiting Muslim fighters to wage jihad against the Soviets. The Soviet withdrawal of 1989 was followed by a civil war and the collapse of the government. The Taliban rose in 1993 and gained control of Afghanistan.  
   In 1996, bin-Laden moved to Afghanistan where he forged an alliance between al-Qaeda and the Taliban. What followed were al-Qaeda attacks on the WorId Trade Center, Khobar Towers, the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the USS Cole, and then September 11th. My colleagues, ask yourself this: ``Could the U.S. have prevented the rise of al-Qaeda by responding to these threats?'' 
   I want to urge my colleagues to keep in mind that the world is watching how the United States handles this tough challenge in Iraq. If we concede defeat and retreat, we will send a strong message of weakness and inability to remain committed to our allies and to our enemies. 
   Tom Friedman noted in the New York Times this week that our withdrawal will mean ``more ethnic, religious and tribal killings across Iraq,'' adding, ``it will be one of the most morally ugly scenes you can imagine, no less than Darfur.'' The Post today also stated that a withdrawal will result in a ``full-blown civil war, conflicts spreading beyond Iraq's borders, or genocide.'' Picture the Iraqis who have helped us, picture them watch as we prepare to leave and picture them clinging to our vehicles in fear of their very lives as we start down the road from Baghdad. 
   I believe this reckless abandonment of the mission in Iraq would send a clear message to the Iraqi people, our allies, and potential partners around the world that Americans are weak and cannot be trusted. In this world of transnational terrorism and proliferation we can not afford to stand alone. 
   It is critical that we give General Petraeus the months we gave him to implement his strategy, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this dangerous bill. In this case national security should trump national politics.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the conference report of H.R. 1, the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act. This comprehensive bill addresses many of our homeland security issues, and as a conferee I am pleased that the conference report includes an important provision that protects those who see suspicious behavior and take the initiative to notify the authorities of their concerns. No one should have to fear prosecution for acting vigilantly and coming forward when they see something that doesn't seem right. If anything, we should be encouraging people to speak up when they see suspicious behavior while waiting to board a plane or shopping in a crowded mall. 
   Take the alert store clerk in New Jersey who noticed suspicious activities on a tape he was asked to transfer to DVD. This young man was at work, saw something that didn't seem right, and alerted the authorities. As a direct result of his actions, a terrorist strike against a military installation in my district--Ft. Dix--was prevented. This man should be heralded as a hero, not prosecuted like a criminal. 
   It may have taken some time, but my fellow conferees worked through their differences, and in the end supported the inclusion of this vital provision. Had this language not been included, who knows what untold tragedies could have occurred if observant individuals, afraid of possible prosecution, did not contact law enforcement officials. 
   Again, I support this important measure and urge my colleagues to vote in support of the conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to note that one of the previous speakers talked about veterans who support this resolution. As a matter of fact, yesterday I was able to announce that the national commander of the VFW said that he opposed this resolution or had grave concerns about it, and I have just been notified that the national commander of the American Legion, Paul A. Moran, announced strong support for the President's new initiative, which includes deploying 21,500 troops. And, in so doing, he said these words:  
   We will not separate the war from the warrior. Debating the new strategy is an American way, but let this be a warning that precipitous action by the Congress could lower troop morale and hinder the mission.  
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Bloomfield Township, Michigan (Mr. Knollenberg).

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (HONORING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROOKGREEN GARDENS IN MURRELLS INLET, SOUTH CAROLINA -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 186. House Concurrent Resolution 186 recognizes Brookgreen Gardens in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, in honor of the 75th anniversary of its opening to the public. 
   In 1931, Archer and Anna Hyatt Huntington founded Brookgreen Gardens to preserve the natural flora and fauna and to display objects of art within that natural setting. 
   Today, Brookgreen Gardens is a Natural Historic Landmark and contains more than 550 works from American artists in what was the country's first public sculpture garden.     
   The Gardens also offer a nature and historical preserve, small zoo, and a nature exhibition center. To honor the 1932 opening of the Brookgreen Gardens to the public, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Additionally, I would like to recognize the strong efforts of Congressman Henry Brown for his persistence and diligent work in bringing this resolution to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. SAXTON. (NATIONAL HUNTING AND FISHING DAY -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, let me thank and commend the gentleman from West Virginia for expeditiously bringing this bill to the floor. I rise in strong support of H. Res. 634, urging the establishment of a National Hunting and Fishing Day. 
   Since the founding of our Republic more than 230 years ago, hunting and fishing have been woven into the very fabric of our cultural heritage. There is no question that sportsmen are among the foremost supporters of sound wildlife management and the conservation of our natural resources. 
   In fact, without the billions of dollars that have been paid by sportsmen in excise taxes and duck stamp fees, it is likely that President Theodore Roosevelt's vision of a national wildlife refuge system would never have been achieved. Today, that system is comprised of more than 96 million acres, and more than 90 percent of those Federal lands are open to the 42 million Americans who hunt and fish. 
   It is appropriate that we designate a National Hunting and Fishing Day and that we celebrate on October 9, the 10th anniversary of the National Wildlife Improvement Act of 1997. This historic law, sponsored by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) and myself, has the fundamental purpose of working to ensure that the American people have the finest refuge system in the world and the ability to hunt and fish on lands they largely purchased with their hard-earned dollars. It is achieving that goal that I believe is very, very important. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
