<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (PERMANENT FIX FOR FISA -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the Democrat majority to pass a permanent fix to our Nation's foreign surveillance law and give our intelligence community the tools they need to protect American families. 
   It has been 6 months since this body passed a temporary patch to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. If Congress fails to pass a permanent fix, our Nation's intelligence community will once again be limited in their ability to track terrorists and defeat their efforts to murder Americans. 
   In his State of the Union address last night, President Bush reiterated to Members of both parties that the time to act is now. On this most important of issues, we owe it to the American people not to put American families at risk. 
   We can all agree that the safety and well-being of our Nation's families is our utmost priority, so let's work together on an agreement that will ensure that we meet the challenge of defending our Nation for the long term. Our enemies will not hesitate to exploit our intelligence loopholes. It is imperative that we not give them that opportunity. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, this year marks the 40th anniversary of the Special Olympics--an organization dedicated to providing individuals with intellectual disabilities an opportunity to train and compete in athletic events. Over 2.5 million individuals from across 180 countries participate in events held year-round. 
   As the world gathers in Beijing, China for this year's Summer Olympic Games, we should remember the 2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games that were held in Shanghai, China, in October 2007. This was only the second time the games have been held outside the United States and attracted over 7,000 athletes. From my home State of South Carolina, Special Olympics South Carolina sent four athletes--Diana Poiletman of Columbia, Eric Brown of Columbia, Jason Morrow of Spartanburg County, and Darlene Wycuff of Spartanburg County--who brought home an impressive total of 9 medals. These strong individuals embody the best of the human spirit and truly represent the words of the Special Olympics' motto: ``Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.'' 
   I wish to congratulate the millions of individuals who compete and participate in the Special Olympics. In particular, I want to recognize Anne Burke and Eunice Kennedy Shriver who founded the organization in 1968. Their dedication and tireless efforts on behalf of intellectually disabled men, women, and children around the world are truly remarkable. In South Carolina, Barry S. Coats, President and CEO of Special Olympics South Carolina and all his staff and volunteers should be commended for their wonderful work.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Harry Shuler Dent passed away Friday. The Charleston Post and Courier recognized him as the father of the present-day South Carolina Republican Party and White House southern strategist. 
   Lee Bandy of Columbia's The State outlined Harry Dent's successful career as a journalist, chief of staff for Senator Strom Thurmond, State Republican Chairman, White House Deputy Counsel, and founder of a multinational lay ministry. 
   I was grateful to see firsthand Harry's achievements. Under his leadership, the South Carolina Republican Party grew in the 1960s from no officeholders to having majorities in the State legislature, congressional delegation and Statewide offices. In Romania I watched his ministry take action and provide medical equipment to a local hospital. 
   His greatest achievement was to marry his high school sweetheart, Betty Francis Dent. In their 56 years of marriage, they produced four outstanding children, Harry, Jr., Jack, Dolly and Ginny, along with nine grandchildren. 
   As a political adviser, mission director and dedicated family man, Harry Dent has made an extraordinary difference to the people of South Carolina. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, our Nation's economic and national security is being threatened by our continued reliance on foreign oil. The pain at the pump is having a terrible impact on the wallets of American families. Simultaneously, we are sending billions of dollars overseas to buy the foreign oil we pay far too much for here at home. 
   Exploration of American oil and natural gas right here at home means we can rely less on unstable regimes and break the monopoly of foreign oil. The more American-made energy we use means less of our money going to line the pockets of dictators like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. We have the resources and the technology to get these resources in an environmentally sound way. 
   We must face the fact there are real consequences to congressional inaction just as there would be substantial benefits to adopting an all-of-the-above energy policy, which I and many of my Republican colleagues support. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Chairman, I thank Mr. Kline for his leadership in protecting American workers. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of Ranking Member BUCK MCKEON's alternative to the misnamed Employee Free Choice Act. Mr. McKeon's substitute, originally championed by the late Congressman Charlie Norwood, guarantees employees the right to hold secret ballot elections when deciding whether to form a union and prohibits the implementation of a coercive card check authorization. 
   Just as American voters are free to elect their public officials in secrecy, so should American workers be free to vote for or against union representation. While no one would approve of exposing voters to public ridicule or intimidation at the voting booth, this is exactly what proponents of the Democrat card check bill are seeking to force upon American workers. 
   Several of our colleagues wrote to Mexican officials in 2001 urging the sanctity of secret ballot elections be upheld. Specifically they penned: ``We feel that the secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they may not choose otherwise.'' I hope today all of our colleagues adopt the original position of 2001 for a secret ballot. 
   Evidence suggests that under card check agreements, employees are likely to be coerced or misled or falsely told the forms are nonbinding ``statements of interest,'' requests for an election, or even benefits forms or administrative paperwork. The McKeon alternative will ensure workers are not left vulnerable to this type of arm twisting. 
   A poll will be released today by the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace demonstrating that 87 percent of Americans believe workers should have the right of a secret ballot. In fact, 79 percent oppose the incorrectly named bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting the wishes of the majority of Americans and voting in favor of Ranking Member McKeon's alternative.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank Congressman JOHN CAMPBELL of California who originally was the proponent of this amendment. I am very happy to adopt this amendment because I believe that it truly expresses the concerns of the people of our country. 
   The Energy and Water appropriations bill, which spends $31.6 billion, is $1.13 billion, or 3.7 percent over the President's request. This amendment would reduce overall funding in the bill to the President's request, thus saving taxpayers $1.13 billion. If this amendment passes, the total amount of spending in the Energy and Water bill will still be $175 million greater than last year. 
   By enacting the largest tax increase in American history, the Democrat  budget allows for $23 billion in spending over that of the President's budget request. This amendment is designed to save the taxpayers $1.13 billion which will reduce some of the unnecessary increases in Federal spending this year which is fueled by the huge tax increases. This is an amendment that is an across-the-board reduction that does not destroy, interrupt or terminate needed projects, many that we just heard about that are very, very worthy. But it does provide for our Federal administrators to reduce expenditures by limiting travel, delaying filling employee vacancies, postponing equipment purchases and other innovative and creative initiatives to save taxpayers' money. Even the reduction of growth is an increase of spending of $175 million. 
   Prior to being elected to Congress, I served in the State senate of my home State and over and over again we would work toward across-the-board budget cuts and each time that we were able to achieve these, we were able to maintain the programs to benefit the citizens of our State; but, indeed, the programs were not terminated, they were made better. I have faith in government employees that they can accommodate a 3.7 percent reduction without hurting recipients of worthy projects. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, again what we're talking about with this particular amendment is to reduce the overall expenditures to the President's request, which is a reduction of $1.13 billion. It's a 3.7 percent reduction. But actually because this is the request of the President, there has been an increase of nearly $175 million. We've heard the presentation, very eloquent, a few minutes ago of many of the wonderful programs and projects, and when you think of Energy and Water appropriations, I think of extraordinarily important appropriations, indeed, the infrastructure of our country, it's so important, as to the alternative fuels, promoting the alternative fuels. But, indeed, I have seen firsthand in my experience working in public office since 1984, you can reduce and still provide for the services to be provided. 
   I know that again in my State experience one time, we had a midyear budget crisis where, in fact, the State budget was reduced by 7 1/2 percent and we had previously proposed that there be a budget reduction of 1 percent. Unfortunately, it was turned down. It was incredible that, indeed, with the 7 1/2 percent across-the-board cut by people of another political party from me, it worked. And the services were still provided. That was, in effect, almost a 15 percent across-the-board cut. 
   And so what we are proposing today, I believe, is very reasonable and responsible and in the interest of the taxpayers of the United States. 
   At this time I am happy to yield to the minority leader of the House of Representatives, a person who is so widely respected, the Congressman from Ohio, John Boehner. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The distinguished minority leader is recognized for 1 minute.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, indeed, as I am here, proposing a cut of around 3.7 percent, this is across the board. Actually, it's an affirmation of the significance of the projects that are in the bill. 
   I am not saying they should be terminated. I am saying that they should be stalled. I am certainly not indicating they should be interrupted or destroyed. My being here is to propose that there be a reduction in spending, except that it's really a reduction to the President's recommendation, which is an increase in spending of $175 million. 
   But it is a savings to the taxpayers of $1.13 billion. That's, indeed, a key reason that I ran for Congress was to, indeed, protect the taxpayers, look out for the taxpayers, make sure that the government programs that are so worthy are handled well. 
   At this time, I yield such time as he may consume to the Congressman from California (Mr. Campbell).

It should only provide money for the brave men and women fighting terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect American families at home. It is, therefore, disappointing that the supplemental bill crafted by the Democratic leadership contains billions of dollars in nonemergency spending. 
   While there may be components of the bill that should be debated, this is not the time and certainly not the bill to be having those debates while our  troops are desperately in need of additional funding. 
   Defense Secretary Robert Gates and our military leadership have told Congress that the money is vital to ensuring our troops have the resources they require to defeat terrorists overseas. Including billions of dollars in unrelated spending is a dangerous impediment.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman McKeon very much for the introduction. I appreciate his leadership on the committee. 
   I speak in opposition to the bill and in favor of mine safety, as fully explained by the Statement of Administration Policy dated January 15, 2008, from the Office of Management and Budget. 
   In 2006, the President signed the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response, MINER, Act, the most significant mine safety legislation in nearly 30 years. The administration has worked with miners, mine owners, miners' representatives, and other stakeholders in the mining industry to meet the safety improvement goals set forth in the original MINER Act, including issuing regulations to strengthen emergency mine evacuation practices, improve the strength requirements for seals, and increase civil penalties. In addition, on December 26, 2007, the President signed the Omnibus Appropriations Act, which mandates additional rulemaking on belt air and refuge chambers on rigorous timetables. 
   H.R. 2768, the Supplemental Mine Improvement New Emergency Response Act, the S-MINER bill, would place in jeopardy meaningful achievements and efforts currently under way as a result of these measures. In particular, several of the regulatory mandates in the S-MINER bill would weaken several existing regulations and overturn regulatory processes that were required by the MINER Act and are ongoing. 
   These changes would provide no opportunity for stakeholder participation in the regulatory process and would impose burdensome and unrealistic time requirements. The S-MINER bill would also fundamentally change the investigation of mining accidents and jeopardize the ability to hold mine operators accountable for violations of mine safety regulations. 
   For these reasons, the administration strongly opposes House passage of the bill. If H.R. 2768 were presented to the President in its current form, the President's senior advisers would recommend he veto the bill. 
   The S-MINER bill requires new regulations on the strength of mine seals, even though a new emergency temporary standard on mine seals was issued in May 2007 and a final regulation will be issued in February 2008. To reopen this process would cause confusion within the industry and put on hold improvements already being made to underground mine seals. 
   The S-MINER bill would weaken current regulations requiring a mine operator to contact the Mine Safety and Health Administration, MSHA, within 15 minutes of a serious accident by creating a new two-tiered notification system of 15 minutes or 1 hour, depending on the severity of the incident. 
   Of particular concern is a provision requiring the MSHA to adopt the recommended exposure limits issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as permissible exposure limits, PELs. This provision overturns a Federal court decision that requires agencies like the MSHA to perform a risk assessment prior to issuing a PEL. This provision would mandate the adoption of potentially hundreds of PELs without any input from stakeholders and without determination of whether the PEL is economically and technologically feasible. 
   The S-MINER bill would allow a stakeholder to challenge a PEL only after its issuance. This process undermines the rigor of the normal rulemaking process and places the burden  of proof of technological and economic feasibility on stakeholders instead of the Department of Labor. 
   The S-MINER bill would potentially quadruple the number of investigations into multi-injury or multifatality accidents by adding a requirement for another investigation by an independent investigative team and by giving the Chemical Safety Board, as well as the Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Labor, the right to investigate mine accidents. These provisions undermine the government's ability to hold accountable mine operators who violate mine safety and health regulations since multiple investigations potentially using different methodologies and reaching different conclusions could prejudice the government's ability to prosecute civil or criminal investigations of mine safety and health standards that contributed to or exacerbated an accident. 
   Current law gives MSHA the sole authority to investigate mine accidents, and when MSHA investigators uncover possible criminal violations, they identify the necessary enforcement action to take against a mine operator and make an appropriate referral to the Department of Justice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of mine safety and in opposition to this bill. 
   The Wilson/Kline amendment combines the key elements of the Wilson amendment offered in committee with the important safety teams amendment also considered during markup. There is much that we do not know about the tragedy of Crandall Canyon. It would be premature to legislate on many of these issues until the Crandall Canyon investigation is complete. Once the investigation is complete, we can determine if any further initiatives are necessary. It also should be noted that few, if any, of the provisions in the underlying legislation would have had any impact in preventing the accident in Utah this summer. 
   Our amendment would require the Department of Labor to more regularly communicate with the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, regarding safety concerns. Given that personnel from the BLM inspect mines daily, the Mine Safety Health Administration, MSHA, should have the benefit of knowing what BLM is observing and what concerns the agency has regarding safety. 
   Our amendment would also require two studies: one to address deep mine safety, and another to address pillar removal. Regarding deep mining, it is no secret that the mining industry is mining deeper underground. In order to assure that they have the most sophisticated science available to them, a study about the elements of deep mining should be undertaken. It is also important to recognize that deep mining and pillar removal are two separate issues, and our amendment was crafted accordingly to give each issue thorough consideration. 
   Finally, there is great concern about how information during a mine rescue and recovery effort is communicated to the public. Our amendment would create a public relations protocol similar to that used by the National Transportation Safety Board. In this way, all parties to the rescue and recovery effort must clear any information through MSHA before releasing it to the public. 
   This amendment takes the NTSB's well-regarded approach to communications. Before anyone associated with the rescue and recovery effort can make public comments, they must be approved by MSHA. In this way, we can ensure that the families have been fully briefed, that any information given to the media is factual, and that it does not interfere with the ongoing efforts of any future investigation. 
   The S-MINER Act may address some of these issues, but ultimately the underlying bill is not narrowly crafted to focus on the Crandall Canyon tragedy. Instead, it provides for a complete rewrite of a successful law. In addition to these four specific policy opportunities that respond to the tragedy that occurred at the Crandall Canyon mine, our substitute builds on the MINER Act by actively engaging miners in safety teams and implementing substance abuse testing. It is important to note that the MINER Act was the most significant piece of mining legislation passed in 30 years, which was signed into law in 2006. 
   The Wilson/Kline substitute ensures that the MINER Act is not derailed by excessive new regulations. The MINER Act has put in motion regulations, studies, and industry improvements that will be negatively impacted by H.R. 2768. I oppose the S-MINER Act and urge you to vote in favor of the Wilson/Kline substitute. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, I urge the strongest consideration of the Wilson/Kline amendment. I would like to point out that it would provide for full implementation of the MINER Act of June 2006. Additionally, it has the provisions, as well explained by Congressman McKeon of California, the provisions and concerns of the late Congressman Charlie Norwood of Georgia, providing for drug testing are included. 
   As I conclude today, I would like to read and summarize an op-ed which was in the Lexington Herald Leader, a McClatchy newspaper. This op-ed was printed on November 26, 2007: ``New mining bill premature.'' The author is Rick Honaker. Professor Honaker is the Mining Foundation's distinguished professor and chairman of the University of Kentucky Department of Mining Engineering. 
   Professor Honaker says, ``Eliminating coal mine accidents is an achievable goal. In recent years we have seen a dramatic decline in fatalities at the Nation's 550 underground mines, though the tragic accident earlier this year at a mine in Utah underscores some of the serious problems we face. 
   ``But Congress has gotten ahead of itself. However well-intentioned, it is considering new legislation before the industry has been able to implement and assess the effectiveness of a major mine safety law passed last year. 
   ``It seems very strange, almost incomprehensible, that a move is afoot in  Congress to impose an entirely new set of requirements on coal mine operators and mine inspectors, even before there has been an opportunity to comply with the far-reaching provisions of the MINER Act. It threatens to disrupt the all-important emergency rescue provisions of the law. 
   ``That process will require more work from the coal community, not more laws from Congress. Rather than leap into an abyss with new legislation, let's give mine safety and health experts an opportunity to implement the existing law.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (DEMOCRATIC PLAN FOR IRAQ IS RECIPE FOR FAILURE -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Friday's The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, detailed the dire consequences of setting artificial timelines for withdrawal from Iraq. The editorial states that it would be tragic if the rug should be pulled from under U.S. forces by the U.S. Congress. 
   The political message coming from House Democrats threatens to throw efforts to stabilize Iraq off balance. As The Post and Courier, where I was a former reporter, concludes, General Petraeus should be given the time and forces he needs to succeed, and not a legislative recipe for failure. Democrats and Republicans should be united to remember that al Qaeda spokesman for Osama bin Laden, Zawahiri, has clearly identified that Iraq and Afghanistan are the central fronts in the global war on terrorism. Bin Laden has specifically stated, ``The most serious issue today for the whole world is this Third World War that is raging in Iraq.'' 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today the House Armed Services Committee will examine the issue of body armor for our troops in combat. Fortunately, before going into recess for Memorial Day, Congress passed a critical war funding bill that will allow the military to purchase body armor and other equipment for our men and women in uniform. 
   I was grateful to visit with our troops during the break in Iraq and Afghanistan. Everywhere we went, the troops thanked us for passing the legislation to provide for their being fully equipped. 
   Our soldiers are fighting the terrorists overseas so we do not have to face them again in the streets of America. We are protecting American families in stopping al Qaeda's threat to our Nation. 
   On the 63rd anniversary of D-day, we appreciate the new greatest generation. I am pleased Congress passed and President Bush signed a bill that will provide our military with the tools it needs without handcuffing our commanders on the battlefield. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, this week Silvio Berlusconi has been reelected as Prime Minister of Italy. His coalition won a strong majority in the Italian Parliament. 
   Prime Minister-elect Berlusconi, the conservative leader of the Forza Italia political party and the new People of Freedom party, had been a strong ally of the United States in his previous tenure as Prime Minister. No doubt his reelection will mean a strengthening of our partnership with the people of Italy who have so positively influenced American culture. 
   Berlusconi's election follows a growing line of European leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who have run on a platform of greater support for a strong alliance with America. Additional presidents promoting improved friendship with America have recently been elected in Indonesia, Serbia, Liberia, Peru, Korea and Russia. 
   America has earned admiration of most nations in the world, as identified yesterday by Pope Benedict XVI at the White House as he indicated America is the beacon of liberty and freedom. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, just this morning we received reports that the al Qaeda leader in Iraq has been killed. Despite such signs that support for the terrorist group in Iraq is fading, Democrats in Congress continue to advocate retreat and defeat. Fortunately for American families and our troops in the battlefield, we have a Commander in Chief who understands that victory is essential. As the Washington Post has editorialized: ``America's defeat will lead to catastrophic civilian deaths, the reestablishment of terrorist training camps, and possibly a regional war. We must face the terrorists overseas, or we will face them again in the streets of America.'' 
   Our Nation is at war. Our troops are bravely serving their country. We have a responsibility to provide for their well-being. I support President Bush's pending veto and look forward to passing a clean supplemental bill that fully funds our soldiers' mission of protecting American families. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, after serving nearly 8 years in a Libyan prison, five Bulgarian nurses yesterday were joyously released home to Sofia, Bulgaria, escorted by Cecilia Sarkozy, wife of the President of France, America's first ally. These nurses and a Palestinian doctor were sadly sentenced to life in prison for allegedly contaminating children with the AIDS virus. 
   This successful outcome could not have been achieved without the diligent efforts of the state of Qatar; the European Union; and the President of the French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy. I commend their efforts to reach a peaceful result with Libya. This is positive for the people of Libya and the people of Bulgaria. This is a crucial achievement of extraordinary advances for North Africa and Southeast Europe, who will be partners with America. 
   As the co-Chair of the Congressional Bulgaria Caucus along with Congresswoman Tauscher of California, it is my privilege to work with Ambassador Elena Poptodorova. God bless the nurses of Bulgaria.

   Defense Secretary Robert Gates restated yesterday to the bipartisan Army Caucus that timetables will stop the military from completing its mission. The Washington Post has criticized the proposal, saying it could lead to massive civilian casualties, to al Qaeda establishing bases to attack America and our allies, and to a regional war of disastrous consequences. 
   Al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri has identified Iraq and Afghanistan as the central fronts in the global war on terrorism. Bin Laden has specifically referred to Iraq as the ``Third World War.''

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, last week, America's number one radio personality, Rush Limbaugh, auctioned off for charity a letter shamefully signed by a group of 41 Democratic Senators. The letter to Limbaugh's employer attacked Rush for comments blatantly distorted by Media Matters regarding persons who had lied about their service in the military. 
   I am happy to report that the Senate letter of infamy was auctioned for $2.1 million, an amount Rush says he will generously match. That brings the total to $4.2 million. 
   The money will be donated to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation. This charitable organization provides financial assistance to the children of fallen marines and law enforcement officers. I wish to commend Rush for overcoming what was clearly a political ploy to chill his first amendment rights of free speech. Rush took an abusive power by Democratic leadership and turned it into something positive. Between Rush Limbaugh and Senate Democrats, America knows who really supports our troops.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I wish to take this opportunity to remember a friend and colleague; Charlie Norwood, and to support H.R. 1808, a bill to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia, as the ``Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center''. 
   Charlie dedicated his life to medicine and public service--as a captain in the Army assigned to the Army Dental Corps during Vietnam, a dentist in private practice, and as a Member of Congress. During his 12 years in the House of Representatives, Charlie fought hard for conservative values, the military and our veterans, and remained dedicated to seeing a patients' bill of rights passed into law. Although this dream of his has not yet become a reality, it is all too fitting that we name the VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia, after one of that state's favorite sons. 
   Our military veterans had no stronger advocate in Congress than Charlie, and with the passage of this bill, we will be honoring that legacy. Additionally, I want to thank his wife Gloria for her loving support and her service as First Lady of Georgia's Tenth Congressional District. 
   As an original co-sponsor of H.R. 1808, a fellow veteran, a friend, and an admirer of Charlie Norwood, I want to thank Representative Jack Kingston for introducing this legislation, and I look forward to its passage.

   Two years ago, Ross E. Beard, Jr., from Camden, South Carolina, loaned the museum a vast weapons collection dating from the 1500s.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, as we stand here today, the Iraqi people enjoy a freedom and sense of self-government they were not afforded 4 years ago. Since the United States originally liberated the Iraqis, they have established a democracy, ratified a constitution, and elected a representative government. Such rights were denied under the totalitarian regime of Saddam Hussein. 
   General David Petraeus, the new commander of coalition forces in Iraq, is an expert in fighting insurgencies by murderers who defy laws of war. Our military officials have made necessary adjustments, and we are seeing signs of progress. Cutting funding, limiting reinforcements and setting artificial timetables only serve to undermine this end. Together, as Democrats and Republicans, we must achieve victory in Iraq to achieve victory in the global war on terrorism to protect American families. We must face the terrorists overseas, or we will face them again in the streets of America.

Lieutenant Colonel William Ferrell welcomed the Secretary to the air station. After visiting with the Secretary and community leaders, I am more confident than ever that the air station is uniquely suited to take on F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Thank you, Congressman Hunter, for your leadership for our troops and for your son's service in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our men and women serving in the United States Armed Forces and in opposition to House Concurrent Resolution 63, a resolution that claims to support the troops but opposes reinforcements. To truly support our troops, we must provide the equipment and sufficient personnel requested by their commander, General David Petraeus. 
   I believe that we must triumph in the global war on terrorism, that victory in Iraq is the only option, and that America's survival is at stake. My convictions are deeply derived from personal experience and from historical perspective. 
   My concerns have been developed as a member of the Armed Services Committee, through which I have visited Iraq six times, as a 31-year veteran of the Army Reserves and Army National Guard, and as the proud parent of an Iraq veteran. 
   Less than a year after the war in Iraq began, my eldest son, Captain Alan Wilson, was deployed across Iraq, where he served honorably for 1 year. Alan worked for young girls to be able to attend schools. He has been a trusted military advisor to me regarding life on the front lines in Iraq. Alan today continues to serve in the South Carolina Army National Guard. 
   In addition to Alan, my younger three sons are also in the military. My wife Roxanne and I appreciate their dedication to protecting American families. 
   The decision to support continued efforts in Iraq is not one I made lightly. In the end, however, it is the only viable solution. Retreat is not an option.  Defeat is not an option. There is no end but victory. 
   I was truly transformed by September 11th, and I live with its ramifications every day. I sincerely believe we are faced with fighting the terrorists overseas today, or we will face them in the streets of America tomorrow. 
   The attacks of September 11th were not isolated, random events. Our enemy is highly intelligent, well financed, and committed to the destruction of our freedoms. 
   Terrorists have declared war on the American people. We have a choice of opposing them overseas or fighting them again here in America. The concept that America's retreat in Iraq will bring an end to sectarian violence and terrorist activity in the region ignores history. Premature retreat will embolden the enemy and make us more vulnerable to attacks.     
   We have seen it happen before. Withdrawals from Beirut and Mogadishu led to the 1993 World Trade Center attack, the 1998 embassy bombings across Africa, the 2000 bombings of the USS Cole and ultimately September 11, 2001. 
   Al Qaeda has openly stated Iraq is the central front in the war on terrorism. Osama bin Laden himself has said, ``The issue is big and the misfortune is momentous. The most important and serious issue today for the whole world is this third world war. I say to you that the war will be won either by us or by you. If it's the former, loss and disgrace will be your lot for all eternity, and, Allah be praised, this is the way the wind is blowing. If it is the latter, you should read the history books. We are a nation that does not remain silent over injustice, and we will seek blood vengeance all lifelong. Not many days and nights will pass before we take blood vengeance, like we did on 9/11,'' end of quote of Osama bin Laden. 
   We ignore bin Laden's words to the peril of American families. 
   All of this is not to say that Members of Congress do not have an obligation to question foreign policy. As elected public officials, it is our duty to do so. If by conscience one disagrees with our direction, he or she has a responsibility to put forth an alternative plan. 
   An alternative plan, however, is not what we are debating today. Instead, the Democrat leadership has put aside 36 hours of debate for a resolution that provides no substantive solutions. 
   Our men and women in uniform deserve better. Their families deserve better. These men and women deserve to know that America supports them, that Congress will provide requested equipment and personnel, and that we are all committed to their victory. 
   There is no magic bullet, no cure-all pill, but the fact remains that we must endure. The stakes are too high, the consequences of defeat too catastrophic. As men and women elected to represent our constituencies and provide for their well-being, it is our responsibility to look out for the safety of American families. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops. We will never forget September 11. Our thoughts and prayers are with the late Congressman CHARLIE NORWOOD, his wife, Gloria, his family, his staff and his constituents.

Just last week, General David Petraeus, commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, gave his first briefing regarding the situation on the ground. Specifically, General Petraeus reported that the Iraqis are fulfilling their obligations, having sent 10 Army brigades and nine police brigades into Baghdad. 
   The Iraqi Government has unshackled U.S. forces, allowing them to target both Shiite and Sunni militias. Numerous weapons reserves have been uncovered, car bomb factories have been destroyed, and top al Qaeda members have been captured. Unfortunately, too many of my colleagues refuse to acknowledge these successes. Some have lost sight of the most important factor, achieving victory. Al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri has declared Iraq and Afghanistan the central front in the global war on terrorism. As the parent of an Iraqi service veteran, I know we must win to protect American families. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (HONORING HEROIC SERVICE OF GLIDER PILOTS OF UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES DURING WORLD WAR II -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 42, a bill to honor a  group of servicemembers who are oftentimes forgotten, the glider pilots of the United States Army Air Forces. 
   The United States Army Air Force began training glider pilots in 1942. These exceptional men provided an innovative and silent method of transporting troops and equipment in unarmed gliders during World War II, built of fragile balsa wood. 
   As the son of a member of the Fourteenth Air Force during World War II who served with the Flying Tigers in China, I especially appreciate the courageous airmen. 
   The glider pilots, along with airborne forces, participated in eight successful missions, landing behind enemy lines in their unarmed gliders in Sicily, Normandy, southern France, Holland, Bastogne, Rhine Crossing, Luzon in the Philippines, and Burma.     
   During Operation Husky, which took place in Sicily on July 9, 1943, glider pilots carried British airborne troops, completing their mission despite heavy casualties resulting from landings at sea. 
   In Operation Broadway, which took place in Burma on March 5, 1944, glider pilots took the Japanese completely by surprise; carried troops, airborne engineers and equipment by night; seized and prepared landing strips for forthcoming transport planes; and evacuated the wounded, accomplishing in 2 hours what would have taken 2 months by ambulance. 
   Operation Overlord, D-Day, on June 6, 1944, glider pilots took part in the Battle of Normandy, the largest combined airborne and seaborne invasion in history, carrying troops of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and their equipment to landing areas behind enemy lines during the D-Day liberation. 
   Tragically, many heroic glider pilots were killed as the hedgerows of Normandy of D-Day were actually rock walls that instantly destroyed the gliders. A survivor of the glider invasion was the legendary major, J. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who was elected to the U.S. Senate, achieving the age of 100 while still in office. 
   During Operation Dragoon, which took place in the coastal area of southern France on August 15, 1944, glider pilots delivered troops and cargo despite wooden poles erected in open fields to impede their landings. 
   Operation Market-Garden, the largest glider operation of World War II, took place in Holland on September 17, 1944. Glider pilots carried their usual cargo of troops and heavy equipment, thereby providing cover for an attempt to clear a road to Berlin. 
   In Operation Repulse, which took place in Bastogne on December 27, 1944, as part of the Battle of the Bulge, glider pilots, although flying directly through enemy fire, were able to land every glider, delivering badly needed ammunition, gasoline and medical supplies that enabled defenders against the German offensive to persevere and secure the ultimate victory. 
   America did not redeploy in the Ardennes offensive, but it stood with resolve for victory. 
   Operation Varsity, which took place at the Rhine crossing in Wesel, Germany, on March 24, 1945, more than 1,300 glider pilots took part in their final European mission, delivering a fatal blow to the Axis forces. 
   The gliders' final, and only, Pacific mission took place in the Philippine island of Luzon, Philippines, on June 23, 1945. In Operation Gypsy Task Force-Appari mission, glider pilots carried members of the 11th Airborne Division. 
   In the words of one pilot, ``Imagine flying a motorless, fabric-covered CG-4A glider, violently bouncing and jerking on a 11/16-inch nylon rope 350 feet back of the C-47 tow plane. You see the nervous glider infantrymen behind you, some vomiting, many in prayer, as you hedge-hop along at tree-top level instinctively jumping up in your seat every time you hear bullets and flak tearing through the glider. You try not to think about the explosives aboard. It's like flying a stick of dynamite through the gates of Hell.'' 
   Madam Speaker, we must not forget the sacrifices these pilots made for the betterment of our country and the world. Let us remember and honor the heroic service and the sacrifices made by the glider pilots. I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 42 and commend Congresswoman McCarthy for her leadership on this issue 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

They could support a bipartisan energy plan that invests in renewable energy resources, supports conservation and expands exploration for American oil and natural gas. It was not a perfect bill. There were additional items like nuclear energy that were not addressed, and should be.  
   Unfortunately, House Democrats made a different choice. They decided to stand with their leadership and support a hoax of an energy bill that had no input from the minority, had been crafted overnight by the House Democrat leadership, and failed to provide revenue sharing for States that authorized deepwater drilling off their shores. Moreover, the Democrat bill had a renewable energy mandate that would mean higher electricity bills for families of southern and midwestern States.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week the majority forced a vote on a faulty fix to the alternative minimum tax, AMT, that raises taxes  elsewhere. Consequently, this bill had no chance of ever becoming law, and everyone knew it. The Senate resoundingly rejected the tax increase legislation the week before and instead passed legislation that offers a clean fix of the AMT. The majority in the House knew this, and yet they chose to pursue a political statement rather than a solution. 
   Instead of getting down to business and working with the Senate, House Republicans and President Bush, the majority leadership in the House has failed to repeal a tax that unnecessarily threatens 23 million Americans. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has already made it clear that the delay in passing a fix or a complete repeal will cause delays in tax refunds for 50 million Americans. This is the price of inaction. The American people should not have to pay that price. The majority needs to bring a clean AMT fix to the floor, and not another tax increase.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, here are a few facts on energy I would like to share. America currently has an estimated 175 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.1 trillion barrels of oil that is off-limits to exploration. In ANWR alone, there is an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil. Currently 85 percent of the lower 48 Outer Continental Shelf energy resources remain under the lock and key of the Federal Government. Only 6 percent of the 700 million acres of federally owned subsurface mineral estate has been leased for oil and glass exploration. 
   The estimated Federal revenue that would be generated by opening up these lands that are currently off-limits to leasing is upwards of $60 trillion. Americans support exploring for these resources and breaking America's dependence on foreign oil. The American people are demanding Congress take action. That is why House Republicans will continue to fight for an all-of-the-above energy plan that will produce more American-made energy while investing in alternative fuels and promoting conservation.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the United States Army Reserve. On this date, we should take a moment to honor their proud tradition of service and sacrifice. 
   The Reserve was first established by President Theodore Roosevelt on April 23, 1908, when he signed into law the Medical Reserve Corps. Four years later, the Regular Army Reserve was established, and they have gone on to duty and served in every major conflict operation of the last century. America's Army Reserve has served in both world wars, the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and in Iraq and Afghanistan as the central fronts of the global war on terrorism. 
   As a veteran of the Army Reserve, the 460th Replacement Detachment of Florence, South Carolina, and the 815th Personnel Service Company of Orangeburg, South Carolina, I wish to express my immense gratitude for the hard work and dedication of our Reserve soldiers. Our Nation is safer because of their sacrifice. The best way to protect American families is to defeat terrorism overseas.

Revised reports show an increase, not a decline, in jobs for August, which makes 8.4 million new jobs created since August 2003. This sets the record for the longest period of uninterrupted job growth in our history. This achievement comes as the stock market has hit a record high and the unemployment rate remains low at 4.7 percent. 
   The success of our economy is a product of pro-growth policies inspired by the Home Builders Association that respect the needs of American businesses and taxpayers. However, the most important contributor to these positive trends is the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans who are investing in our economy, building successful companies, and trading on the global market. We should support these efforts by keeping taxes low and enforcing fiscal responsibility here in Congress. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September the 11th. My deepest sympathy to the family, friends, and staff of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis of Virginia.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of JO ANN DAVIS--a friend and colleague who served the people of Virginia for 7 years in the House of Representatives. 
   As the first female Republican elected to the House from Virginia, JO ANN was dedicated to representing her constituents with a genuine leadership and passion for public service. She was committed to fighting government waste and strengthening our national defense and remained devoted to her duty despite her illness. As fellow members of the House Armed Services Committee and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I am grateful to have known and worked with JO ANN. I am especially grateful for the 3 years we sat together on Thursdays at the Congressional Prayer Breakfast which she ultimately so devotedly chaired. 
   During this difficult time, our thoughts and prayers are with JO ANN's husband, Chuck, their two sons, her granddaughter, and the entire Davis family.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, our men and women in uniform deserve our wholehearted, unequivocal support protecting our freedoms. Our distinguished colleague, former Vietnam POW, Congressman Sam Johnson, has filed a discharge petition to bring to the floor of the House his bill, which declares to the United States Armed Forces that Congress will fully fund and support their mission. Unlike the proposed supplemental bill which undercuts our military, the Johnson legislation provides Members the opportunity to cast a clear vote in support of our troops. 
   As a 31-year veteran and also the father of four sons in the military, including one that served in Iraq, I understand the importance of supporting our troops. Bin Laden and his cohorts are committed to our destruction, declaring the Iraq war as the third world war and the central front in the global war on terrorism. Democrats and Republicans should work together to promote our troops' success to protect American families.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, today we vote on a piece of legislation that is an imperfect option and a terrible situation. But I hope Congress does not fail the American people by saying that this bill has solved the whole problem, because it has not. 
   The bad lending practices, mishandling by financial firms and failed oversight by the Federal Government over decades are not addressed today. But we better step forward and address them as soon as possible. 
   As a former real estate attorney for 25 years, I know firsthand that making home loans to individuals less than creditworthy can be destructive for those individuals and for this country. Government should not be telling banks that it is possible for them to make bad loans because the government will back them up. 
   Our job is not done today. Going forward, Congress has an obligation to face and fix the roots of this crisis, reducing government control.

The benchmarks outlined in the report are laudable goals, assessed by dedicated officials. Developing democracy to protect American families takes time, as we learned in Germany and Japan. It took America 13 years to adopt our Constitution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 631 and to honor the memories of the miners who lost their lives in the Crandall Canyon mine accident. Our thoughts and prayers are with the miners' families and with those miners and the Mine Safety Health Administration personnel killed as well as those injured in subsequent rescue operations. 
   The Committee on Education and Labor has announced an investigatory hearing for October 3 to begin examining the circumstances surrounding the Crandall Canyon mining accident, including the response to the accident by the Mine Safety Health Administration and other stakeholders. Only then will we be able to determine what steps Congress should take in the aftermath of the Crandall Canyon tragedy to further ensure the safety of our Nation's miners. 
   As a former member of the South Carolina Mining Council, I plan to continue to track this issue closely. I am committed to maintaining the openness and integrity of this process so that the issue of miner protection receives the fair and comprehensive consideration it deserves. 
   Coal miners have a very dangerous job, and it is our role to ensure that the conditions in which they work are as safe as possible. We renew our commitment to examining our Nation's mining laws to ensure they are protective for the changing mining environment. 
   Last year, in the wake of the Sago and other mine disasters, Congress worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass the MINER Act. That legislation took significant steps to improve mining safety. It requires the Mine Safety Health Administration to revise its penalties, increase penalties for major violations to $220,000, undertake several studies regarding mining practices, and to work to improve the technology for communications underground. 
   No law passed by Congress can console the families of those who have lost loved ones as a result of this tragedy. In the coming months, we will thoroughly review what happened at Crandall Canyon and what steps may be considered to prevent it from happening again. But today we are here to mourn the tragic loss of life at that mine in Utah and pay our respects to the families of these brave miners. 
   Kerry Allred, Dale Black, Don Erickson, Gary Jensen, Luis Hernandez, Brandon Kimber, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips, and Manuel Sanchez. We honor these men today, express our condolences to their families, and recognize the important work of the rescuers who volunteered to enter the mine to try to rescue their fellow miners. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 181, a resolution authored by Congressman Solomon Ortiz, a dedicated member of the Armed Services Committee who is a proven friend of servicemembers and their families. 
   This resolution commends a large group of selfless and dedicated people, many of whom are volunteers, in organizations that provide support to the families and children of deployed Members of the armed forces. 
   As a 31-year veteran of the Army Reserve and National Guard, and as the proud father of four sons in the military, I know firsthand the rewards of service protecting American families and learning valuable skills. 
   Our military families face extraordinary demands, stresses and challenges related to the service of their loved ones. Every soldier, sailor, airman and marine understands the challenges they will face as well as the sacrifices their families must also make. These include extended deployments, risk of injury and death, frequent relocations, long and unpredictable hours, and the unfamiliar customs and lifestyles of foreign lands. 
   Many military families have multiple family members, which substantially outnumber the servicemembers themselves. According to a recent Army report, there are more than 1.8 million family members compared to 1.3 million active duty personnel. Beyond the statistics, however, is the reality that supporting and meeting the needs of military families is a matter of military readiness. 
   Every branch of the military as well as the Department of Defense provide significant resources to the spouses and children of members of the Armed Forces. Much of the excellent support is provided on and through military installations. 
   Actually, most military families do not live on military installations. Nearly two-thirds of the active duty Army family members live off post, and for virtually all the families of National Guard troops and reservists who reside in civilian communities, there is the challenge of ensuring access to the support they need, particularly during extended periods of mobilization and deployment. 
   To ensure that military families get the proper support wherever they live, numerous nongovernmental organizations have sprung up. This extraordinary community of volunteer and nonvolunteer groups seek to ease the challenges and promote the extraordinary opportunities of military life in many ways.  
   For example, some of their efforts include providing essential extracurricular activities for school-aged children, assisting new parents, building support systems in school districts not located on military installations, building bridges between local communities and military families to improve access to State and local services, and providing emergency and financial assistance. 
   Today's resolution, introduced by my colleague, Representative Solomon Ortiz, is a fitting way to celebrate and thank such organizations as Our Military Kids, Parents As Teachers, Kids Serve 2, Operation Homefront, American Military Family, and the Citizen Soldier Support Program, along with other volunteer groups who help families and children of deployed members of the Armed Forces maintain as normal a life as possible. 
   Again, as a 31-year veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard and having a son, Alan, who served for a year in Iraq as a member of the Army National Guard, I have seen firsthand the many challenges and opportunities our National Guard troops and their families face. 
   Many members of my former unit, the 218th Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Bob Livingston and currently stationed in Afghanistan, have families and loved ones that can benefit from the types of assistance these organizations and programs provide. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 181 and to recognize and commend all the volunteers and others who help to take care of our military families and children. This new greatest generation deserves our support and assistance whenever and wherever we can be of service. 
   Additionally, with personal sadness, my sympathy to the families of our late colleagues, Paul Gillmor of Ohio and Jennifer Dunn of Washington State. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield so much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite).

Elena Poptodorova, the able ambassador from Bulgaria, has been vital in developing Bulgarian-American friendships. 
   I especially wish to thank Bulgaria for their continued support in the global war on terrorism. I have visited Bulgarian troops in Afghanistan, and my son Alan served with Bulgarians in Iraq. Our Nation and the world is safer and more prosperous by defeating terrorism overseas.

   The terrorist bombing of the Khobar Towers in 1996 was a vicious attack upon the United States and our allies in Saudi Arabia. It took the lives of 19 brave U.S. servicemembers and hundreds of civilians were injured. This attack was and remains a clear example of the type of enemy we face in the Global War on Terrorism. And so, it is incumbent upon us all to honor the lives of those lost as we comfort the families that were forever changed by this horrible event. 
   As we pause to remember their lives and their sacrifice, we should recommit ourselves to doing all we can to protect Americans--those serving overseas and those here at home. We must be ever vigilant of the enemies we face and resolve to do all that is necessary to defeat terrorism wherever it may be.

   The NAR consists of 1.3 million members from around the country who are working together to promote positive and ethical service to Americans looking to sell or purchase a home. They are an advocate for homeownership, sound housing policies, and property rights. As a former real estate attorney, I have worked with the Realtors for over 25 years, and I know firsthand of their professionalism. 
   Homeownership is part of the foundation of the American dream. It is a sign of success and prosperity for millions of Americans and, most often, the largest investment a family will make. Today, a record of almost 70 percent of Americans own their own homes. This is a testament to the excellence efforts of Realtors. 
   I commend the Realtors for their hard work and congratulate them on their anniversary, ably led in South Carolina by Andy Walker as State president and Nick Kremydas as executive director. I'd like to pay a special tribute to Jerry Fowler who was one of our finest Realtors who sadly passed away over the weekend but what a great citizen, and he will always be remembered.

This affects me personally, as I was a member of the 218th for over 20 years. In July 2000, we trained together in the Mojave Desert at Fort Irwin to face this very evil, and now our courageous troops are stopping terrorists overseas. 
   Chuck Crumbo of The State newspaper reported the suicide bomber followed the Guard convoy and detonated himself in the midst of innocent women and children on a crowded street. This act of cowardice confirms why we must stop the terrorists overseas or they will return to America. In the past 96 hours, there was an attack in Baghdad, terrorists acted in Lebanon, and a shopping mall was blown up in Turkey.

   Sadly, this week, as the House considers the Democrat Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we find that included in this legislation is a provision allowing localities to ``shut off'' funding for this vital border fence. 
   As the debate regarding our immigration system continues to wage on, one thing we know for certain is that controlling our borders should come first to any effort we undertake. We welcome legal immigrants who follow the rule of law. But it is unfortunate Democrats are backtracking on the progress we have made. It is time to fund the fence.

   For too long D.C. residents have been denied the fundamental right to protect themselves and their families. This ruling is truly a victory for law-abiding, gun-owning citizens in the tradition of the late Rick Daniel, who championed the success of concealed weapons permits in South Carolina. 
   I find it ironic that our Nation's capital, a symbol of American freedoms and rights worldwide, has had one of the most restrictive gun control laws in the country. Despite these oppressive measures, D.C. has maintained one of the highest murder rates in the Nation. Sadly, last July, 13 people were killed in 12 days.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Congress adjourned for Memorial Day having failed to pass an emergency troop funding bill that our military says is vital to successful operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including pay for our brave men and women in uniform. 
   Because the majority refuses to bring a clean bill to the floor, the military has announced that they will shift funding from one priority to another in order to meet the needs of our troops and civilian military employees. It is disappointing that when our military needs money to protect American families, the majority refuses to appropriate the funding without tying on billions more in unrelated spending. 
   On behalf of my constituents, many of whom serve proudly in the military, we need to work together for a clean emergency supplemental bill to be brought to the floor immediately for consideration. Our Nation is at risk with a delay in military funding, a failure to renew FISA, and limits on our energy independence. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, 20 years ago Brent Bozell, armed with a handful of employees, a black and white TV and a rented computer, set up shop for what is now the acclaimed Media Research Center. 
   Believing that an overwhelming percentage of news media exhibit a distinct liberal slant, Bozell intended to document and prove the bias existed. Bozell created a news-tracking system that provides comprehensive analysis based on scientific research. 
   From its humble beginnings, the Media Research Center has grown to be the Nation's largest news monitoring operation, employing 60 staffers with a $6 million annual budget. 
   Bozell, his employees, and their compatriots will celebrate 20 years of success tonight at the company's annual gala. As a former reporter, I congratulate them for their success; and while I remain hopeful liberal bias in the media will dissipate, I am proud the Media Research Center will be on watch until it happens.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 100th year of the Boy Scouts. On August 1, 1907, Robert Baden-Powell, along with 20 young men, opened a camp at Brownsea Island, England. Since that day, Scouting has been responsible for inspiring more than 300 million individuals from over 216 countries and territories. The role and mission behind Scouting is to create an education program that promotes common ideals such as loyalty and honor. 
   Scouting has achieved success with dedicated adult volunteers who encourage young people to be constructive citizens. As the grateful father of four Eagle Scouts, encouraged by my wife, Roxanne, I have seen firsthand the positive influence of Scouting. 
   Four years ago today, I participated in my second backpacking trek at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. I wish the Boy Scouts a happy 100th birthday and congratulate them on their 21st World Scout Jamboree.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today has been historic for the Capitol building, in that today we were able, through the Friends of Scotland Caucus, to welcome the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond. This was a great honor for me because he presented to the Heritage Golf Foundation an authentic golf club from the St. Andrews course. This was presented to the trustees of the Heritage Golf Tournament, the members who were present, John Curry and Bill Miles. And this is in recognition of the strong relationship that we have of the United States, particularly the State of South Carolina and Scotland. 
   We were very pleased that the very first golf course located in North America was in South Carolina. In recognition of this, we have the Heritage Golf Classic which is held every year, April 14, this year, through the 20th, at Hilton Head Island at Sea Pines Golf Course, sponsored by Verizon. Indeed, the money raised for this goes for scholarships for persons in the low country. 
   This has been an exciting time for those of us Scottish heritage. Last night we had a reception with the St. Andrews Society of Washington, recognizing Alex Ferguson, the Speaker of the Scottish Parliament. 
   For me, the week began with a Kirkin' o' the Tartan at the First Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina with a program that was hosted by the St. Andrews Society of Columbia.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Democrats are as predictable as the sun: it continues to rise in the east, and they continue to tax and spend. 
   The Democratic budget released last week proposes the largest tax increase in American history: $392.5 billion. Not only does it allow for the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, but it does nothing to control unsustainable entitlement spending. 
   Republicans believe fiscal restraint and pro-growth economic policies will lead to budget surpluses and new jobs. Democrats believe out-of-control government spending should be subsidized with the hard-earned money of American taxpayers. 
   Unfortunately, the Democratic budget continues to squeeze taxpayers' pocketbooks without tightening the belt of Big Government. Such reckless policies will chill our growing economy by reducing job creation.

The American people are rightfully concerned when they see a $700 billion price tag on a plan to address this crisis. They are hesitant to give the Federal Government an extraordinarily large amount of taxpayer dollars, especially before the right questions and the right concerns have been given their due process. 
   This Nation has a long history of balancing the needs of a market economy and the realities of government involvement in those markets. We have weathered our fair share of storms as well. Before Congress endorses a multi-billion dollar effort to address our financial situation, it would serve this Nation and the wallets of those we represent not to forget that history. 
   We need a full review of different alternatives to a simple bailout. Otherwise, we risk placing a daunting financial burden on our children's futures.

   Currently, the package we plan to vote on tomorrow will include a 50 percent bonus depreciation for the first year for certain machinery and equipment purchases. This increase in bonus depreciation was included in the Jobs Tax Relief Act of 2003 and contributed to the productivity of small businesses, a boost in job creation, and a steady rise in the growth of the economy over the last 5 years. This incentive for small businesses enables them to compete with foreign competitors. The best way to weather this current economic storm is to build on the principles that have made our economy the envy of the world. That means lower taxes, less government regulation, and economic incentives for American businesses. We should promote the concept that the people should keep their own money which they know how to spend best as explained by editor Jerry Bellune of the Lexington County Chronicle.

Never mind the fact that this bill was written by the House Democrat leadership, never considered in committee and devoid of any input from the minority. 
   Among the numerous troubling parts of their proposal is the refusal to allow States such as South Carolina to share in revenues from offshore drilling. What a slap to those coastal communities to say that we will drill off your coast, but yet withhold revenues. 
   This is the money that could help pay for new roads and beach renourishment. Meanwhile, they insist on a renewable energy mandate that will increase America's electric bills and harm our rural electric co-ops. They raise taxes and fail to address refineries, ANWR or expanding clean nuclear power. 
   This bill is a hoax on the American people. It won't become law, and the Democrat leadership knows it. This is not leadership and not what the American people deserve.

Our Nation's short-term and long-term energy needs require a comprehensive approach which includes conservation and the development of alternative resources. 
   At a time of economic uncertainty, a realistic and innovative energy strategy would be a powerful boost not only to the advancement of new technology but also of economic opportunity. Additionally, any efforts we can make to relieve the pain at the pump and reduce electricity bills for American families would be in itself a positive incentive to grow American small businesses and commerce.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the amendment introduced by my friend Mr. KLINE of Minnesota, a dedicated U.S. Marine veteran, which restores much needed funding to the Office of Labor Management Standards (OLMS). I applaud Representative KLINE's continued efforts to draw attention and support to this very important issue, and I appreciate his dedicated leadership in this area. 
   This straightforward amendment would add $2 million to the current legislation and restore funding for OLMS to its fiscal year 2007 levels. This addition would also enable the agency to hire 13 full-time employees. 
   The Office of Labor Management Standards plays a vital role in administering and enforcing provisions of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, LMRDA. This bipartisan law was enacted by Congress to ensure standards of democracy and fiscal responsibility in labor organizations representing employees in private industry. 
   When enacting the LMRDA, Congress expressed that union members and the general public would benefit by having access to information about labor unions. As a result, each union subject to LMRDA is required to submit annual financial reports to OLMS. This public accountability is achieved through the filing of LM-2 forms. Millions of working Americans have a portion of their paychecks given to labor organizations, and they deserve to know where their hard-earned money is going. 
   According to a September 2006 Wall Street Journal article, up to 60 percent of labor organizations' budgets are going to PAC contributions and lobbying activities. In one instance, only 36 percent of the funds actually went to representing union members in labor negotiations. 
   There is a high level of demand for this information. In fact, between May 2006 and May 2007, there were 767,908 hits on OLMS's website. That's an average of about 64,000 per month and over 2,100 per day. 
   Again, I am pleased to recognize the important work of the Office of Labor Management Standards, and I urge members to support this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   While I share the majority's commitment to ensuring workplace safety, I believe the underlying bill fails to provide for the most effective means to ensure that safety. 
   Currently, there are several initiatives concerning dust under way at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA. Since October, the agency has implemented a combustible dust National Emphasis Program. This agency has sent high hazard alert letters to over 30,000 businesses emphasizing the need to prevent dust from accumulating. 
   Most importantly, OSHA is in the midst of the investigation of the February disaster at the Imperial Sugar refinery. The Imperial Sugar refinery in Georgia is located in a community adjacent to the Second Congressional District of South Carolina, which I have the honor to represent. 
   Instead of undermining the progress of existing combustible dust safety efforts, this substitute requires the Department of Labor to gather all necessary information about the Imperial refinery explosion specifically, as well as the broader dust hazard being examined through the National Emphasis Program. Once that information has been gathered and analyzed, the Secretary of Labor will be able to determine whether and what type of combustible dust standard is necessary. 
   Should the Secretary determine that existing safety requirements can effectively protect against the combustible dust hazard, the Secretary will be required to report to Congress as to why no new regulatory framework is necessary. But if the National Emphasis Program and the results of the Imperial refinery investigation show that additional guidance and regulation are needed, this substitute requires OSHA to complete a rigorous regulatory process that includes all relevant stakeholders within a fixed time frame. 
   Our amendment will allow for the regulation to be completed expeditiously and thoroughly without circumventing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Administrative Procedures Act and other laws and regulations that ensure effective Federal regulations. 
   We have heard concerns from OSHA that the underlying bill will be difficult to comply with and difficult to enforce. This leaves workers at risk. I have trust in my constituent, Monty Felix of Sandy Run, South Carolina, who is the National President of the American Composites Manufacturers Association, to promote safety. We need the expertise of successful manufacturers. 
   Our goal today should be to move forward with the most effective strategy to ensure a safe workplace. I believe this substitute achieves that goal, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this substitute. 
   I yield at this time to the ranking member from California (Mr. McKeon).

   There is a bill that has been supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators, including the chairman of the Select Senate Committee on Intelligence, the Department of Justice, the White House, our Intelligence Community, and publicly by Democrats in the House. Rather than take the necessary steps to protect American families by holding a vote on this legislation, the majority leadership has chosen to try and discredit the entire issue and claim that all is well.

As the father of three college graduates and a college sophomore, I understand the financial burden higher education poses on families and students. That is why I am proud of Republican efforts, particularly those of Representatives Buck McKeon and Ric Keller to expand college access and increase affordability. 
   As lawmakers, our number one education priority should be to ensure that college is affordable for any student. Unfortunately, H.R. 2669 pits the Federal Family Education Loan program against the Direct Loan Program and creates an imbalance in the student loan industry. Instead of helping students, the Democrat entitlement bill would require student borrowers to pay thousands more for a college education. H.R. 2669 creates nine new entitlement programs, placing the interests of colleges and universities above the needs of low-income students, and does nothing to expand college access and affordability for middle-class families.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, all Americans should be grateful that the New York Stock Exchange closed at a record high of 14,000 last Thursday. Students benefit as college endowments grew, reducing tuition costs. Retirees benefit as retirement accounts appreciated. And with increased liquidity, jobs are created for small businesses. The stock market in 5 years has soared 91 percent from the decline caused by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 
   More than 2 million jobs have been created in the last year, and 8.2 million jobs have been created since the tax relief was initiated in June 2003. This has led to an unemployment rate lower than the average of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. There is record high homeownership. 
   The Republican tax reductions are helping workers. I urge my colleagues to act immediately to make the tax cuts permanent so American workers, not the Federal Government, can continue to decide how to spend their hard-earned money. This proves the point of Jerry Bellune, editor of the Lexington County Chronicle, that the earnings of America's workers belong to the people and are not a handout from the government.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2 and in favor of the alternative. Circumventing market forces to mandate an arbitrary Federal minimum wage increase is bad economic policy. If it is done, however, we must offer protection for America's small businesses. Refusing to do so will ultimately hurt the very workers it intends to help. 
   We all want employees to make more than the minimum wage; and, through tax cuts, 7.3 million jobs have been created in the past 40 months by workers keeping their own money. 
   When the minimum wage is increased, unfunded mandated costs on small businesses increase. As a result, business owners must be forced to cut jobs or reduce entry level workers to avoid incurring additional expenses. 
   Republicans are seeking to provide relief for these businesses by offering alternative health care plans and tax incentives. Unfortunately, House Democratic leadership has shunned the proposal supported by Senate majority leader HARRY REID, President Bush and House Republicans. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Republican alternative, which will ensure businesses receive the protections they need and our economy continues to thrive.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this has been a joyous new year for the people of Bulgaria. On January 1, Bulgaria and Romania were admitted into the European Union. In less than 16 years Bulgaria has successfully transitioned from a Communist totalitarian regime into a free market democracy. 
   Three years ago, I was honored to be at the White House with former Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg Gotha as  Bulgaria was admitted into NATO. Bulgaria has proven to be a true ally in the global war on terrorism and there are currently plans for three U.S. bases to be located within Bulgaria. Bulgaria has one of the fastest-growing European economies, and membership in the EU will accelerate its pace. 
   Congratulations to President Georgi Parvanov, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, Ambassador to Washington Elena Poptodorova, and my longtime friend and former ambassador to Athens, Stefan Stoyanov. I am grateful to serve with Congresswoman ELLEN TAUSCHER as co-chair of the Bulgaria Caucus. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. McKeon, for his leadership and expanding opportunities for students to attend college. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5. As the father of three college graduates and a college freshman, I am all too familiar with the financial burden higher education poses to families and students. That is why I am proud of the Republican efforts to expand college access and increase affordability. 
   During the past decade, House Republicans under the leadership of John Boehner and Buck McKeon tripled overall Federal aid to a record $90 billion, helping millions of Americans achieve their dream of a college education. 
   In addition, Republicans increased new aid for Pell students more than $4 billion over 5 years, establishing the first ever grant program for high achieving Pell students in their first and second years of college. The program also provides grant aid to low income, high achieving students pursuing degrees in math, science, and critical foreign languages in their third and fourth years. 
   While the Democrat bill was well-intentioned, its focus on interest rate reduction does nothing to expand college access for new students. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the McKeon alternative, which will truly expand college access for young Americans.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this majority has accumulated a number of broken promises since taking over the majority, but perhaps the most disappointing and painful for the American people has been their lack of a plan to lower gas prices and help American families. 
   There are very deliberate steps that can be taken in bipartisan cooperation to lower the price of gasoline--investing in local energy exploration, building new refineries, promoting conservation, investing in alternative energy resources like nuclear power that are proven, clean, and cost effective. These steps, some short term, some long term, will give the American people relief at the pump and at the store. 
   And while most agree we should invest in 21st century energy sources, it seems some in this body are adamantly opposed to taking the necessary steps to provide American families relief with the resources we already have here at home. 
   America's blessed with oil and natural gas reserves. We are blessed with the ingenuity and technology to take advantage of our natural resources without damaging the environment.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, when I looked at the issue of diacetyl in manufacturing during the debate in committee, the answer seemed very clear to me at the time: proper ventilation. Even though it is unclear what is affecting manufacturing workers, all the experts agree that engineering controls, such as ventilation, reduce worker exposure. 
   I take very seriously lung illness. For nearly 10 years, I served on the State board of the South Carolina Lung Association. In the South Carolina State Senate, I introduced innovative legislation promoting clean air. 
   Fundamentally, the science does not exist to state a link between diacetyl  and impaired lung function. Indeed, last year, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, noted, ``At this time, insufficient data exists on which to base workplace exposure standards or recommended exposure limits for butter flavorings.'' 
   Unfortunately, this bill goes beyond the issue of what is known. The underlying bill requires the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, to set a standard based on documents that OSHA informs us cannot guide rulemaking. These documents provide guidelines of how to solve the problem at issue but are not the foundation for a rule. 
   More research is currently under way to determine a connection between diacetyl and this respiratory condition. I fully support that research moving forward. In fact, the underlying measure contains an amendment I offered during the committee consideration of the bill to require NIOSH to study similar flavorings to determine possible exposure hazards with flavorings similar to diacetyl. Until there is conclusive evidence, it remains to be seen if diacetyl alone is to blame or whether the chemical, in combination with the other flavorings, places workers at risk. 
   On June 18, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, Edwin Foulke, a distinguished attorney from Greenville, South Carolina, of the highest integrity, reiterated this in a letter to Congress, in which he stated, ``Focusing on diacetyl ignores the possibility that other flavoring components, many of which are irritants and airway-reactive substances, are playing a role in the development of disease. Given the wide variety of ways and forms in which diacetyl and other flavoring components are used in the food manufacturing industry, a narrow focus on diacetyl would likely result in the selection of risk-management strategies that may not adequately protect employees.'' 
   This is a critical point. Until we know the true cause of this lung impairment, I do not see how we can effectively legislate on it. Further, major manufacturers, using this flavoring have already announced they will no longer be using diacetyl. 
   The lack of scientific foundation is, unfortunately, not the only problem with the bill before us. There are numerous flaws outlined by the OSHA administrator's letter. Further, the President has announced strong opposition to the bill, largely because it is flawed. Undermining the rulemaking process, as this bill does, would almost certainly exclude input from key stakeholders that often proves imperative for a balanced rulemaking process. 
   Because this bill fails to allow time for appropriate scientific research and because it undermines the proven regulatory framework, I fear it will not do enough to protect workers. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment that was made in order would resolve much of this problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, we are considering this bill under unfortunate circumstances. A number of workers have become ill, and it is not entirely clear why. We suspect this particular food flavoring diacetyl may be involved, so we all support a thorough investigation into this substance and how exposure to it may impact workers. 
   Like my friends on the other side of the aisle, I wish there was an easy answer. If only we knew what had made these workers ill, we could immediately eliminate the risks. If only we knew for sure that diacetyl and manufacturing alone caused lung obstruction, then Federal agencies could go through the appropriate regulatory process to establish exposure limitations and take the necessary steps to protect workers. 
   Unfortunately, we do not have enough information at this point in time to take such action. Research is underway, and it is my hope that the research continues quickly so we can get to the bottom of these questions about how diacetyl impacts manufacturing workers. 
   Until that research is available and until we have a scientific basis for regulation, in my mind we simply cannot move forward. There is a very real danger that by acting too quickly, we could inadvertently push manufacturers to begin using substitute flavorings. There is a possibility that these substitute flavorings could also put workers at risk; thus, a hurried regulation may provide a false sense of security while manufacturing workers remain vulnerable. 
   Again, I understand the frustration about a lack of clarity on the administration's intent in this area. Until the recent announcement by the Department of Labor that it intends to undertake a rulemaking process for this flavoring, we had not received any clear indication from the administration that it intended to take action. As such, I believe some on the other side the aisle believed they had no choice but to act themselves. 
   Mr. Chairman, I recognize the difficulty we face. We have workers who have fallen ill and we do not know why. We have questions about a flavoring that workers are exposed to during manufacturing, but we do not know whether it is the sole cause of their ailments. We have a Federal regulatory agency that is responsible for ensuring workplace safety, but until this week we did not know whether the agency would act.     
   Republicans proposed a sensible alternative when this bill was considered in the committee, and we plan to do the same today. We want to balance our pressing desire to act quickly to protect workers with our equally important need to adhere to sound science. 
   Because I believe it undermines the basic regulatory framework and neglects the necessary scientific foundation, I regret I cannot support the bill in its current form. I hope my alternative will be adopted so that we can quickly increase evidence to guide the final rules to provide the strongest protections possible. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very straightforward. This would ensure that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, sets a permissible exposure limit as directed by the underlying bill, which can be relied in science. 
   I offered this amendment in the Education and Labor Committee, and we agreed to work together to see if we could reach an agreement. Between committee action and today, we were unable to reach an agreement on the timeframe addressed by my amendment. So I'm offering it for floor consideration. 
   I understand my colleagues' goal is to set a standard for a substance that appears to be harming manufacturing workers in and around microwave popcorn manufacturing facilities. I know the well-meaning intention of their efforts. Unfortunately, I do not share their belief that this legislation will accomplish that goal. 
   First, there is widespread concern that while diacetyl is unquestionably a marker, it is not the sole cause of lung impairment in these workers. In addition to this, however, this bill would regulate diacetyl and require a standard to be set based on little or no available science. In other words, if a food manufacturing facility substitutes diacetyl with another flavoring chemical, there is no guarantee that that chemical is not the one making manufacturing workers sick. 
   Technically, the bill before us requires OSHA to set an interim final rule for diacetyl manufacturers and microwave popcorn plants to implement engineering controls for diacetyl exposure. It then directs OSHA to set a standard that will apply to all food manufacturing facilities. The expansion of coverage from the interim rule to the final rule and the time frame of 2 years in which OSHA is given to set the standard will impact OSHA's ability to follow the appropriate legal guidelines that would apply to a normal rulemaking. 
   All my amendment does is ensure that OSHA promulgates a regulation with appropriate stakeholder input and the science to establish a technically feasible permissible exposure limit. Also, I would note that OSHA announced Monday that it would undertake a rulemaking on this substance. 
   I should note that there is a great deal of ongoing research and data gathering concerning the health effects of diacetyl. For example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is working to improve measuring diacetyl, while the National Jewish Medical Center is working to gather data from workers about lung function. California OSHA also is working with the industry to gather the much-needed information to set a standard. Without any conclusive evidence, which has yet to be generated by any source at this point in time, we are putting the cart before the horse, and because of this, I respectfully urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Thank you, Mr. McKeon. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this legislation. We have heard from many of our colleagues this morning about the flaws of this legislation across a range of policy areas. I would like to focus on one in particular that concerns many Members of the Committee on Education and Labor, and particularly the subcommittee on which I serve as ranking Republican, the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. That issue is, of course, that the application of Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, which is expanded no less than five times in this bill. 
   I submitted an amendment to the Rules Committee which would have conditioned the effective dates of the Davis-Bacon expansions in this bill on the completion of a study by the GAO to determine how effective the Davis-Bacon wage system is, and in particular whether progress was being made on improving its known flaws. I will give my colleagues some background. 
   In 2004, the Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General examined the Wage and Hour Division's attempt to update the Davis-Bacon wage-gathering system, a system that the Department of Labor spent $22 million updating. The results were troubling. 
   The IG report stated: ``Wage and fringe benefit data supplied wage and hour, and used in its surveys continue to have inaccuracies and may be biased. Further, prevailing wage decisions developed from the data are not timely.'' 
   Indeed, the problems identified are dramatic. My amendment simply would have required the Government Accountability Office to examine the status of the Department of Labor's efforts to remedy these identified flaws and make progress implementing the IG's suggested reforms before we expand Davis-Bacon wages and its associated costs in the wholly new areas of law. 
   That is why I submitted my amendment to rules and why I am disappointed we are not debating it today. The Wilson amendment may not have solved all of the problems in this bill, but it would have at least made an effort to correct one significant issue that we know sorely needs fixing. 
   As the Democrat Congress endeavors to expand Davis-Bacon into unprecedented areas under this bill, states and private parties receiving loan guarantees, grants and bonds will now be required to comply with the act. That is an unprecedented expansion beyond the original purposes of the act. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

   Fiscal responsibility means not just being cautious in how much we spend. It is just as important to be responsible in where we spend.

It is misguided to obstruct our ability to track our enemies out of an unfounded fear that our intelligence community has the intent and the time to go spying on everyday Americans. The original FISA law addresses those concerns. This fix to FISA is about tracking potential terrorists overseas and not punishing individuals and businesses that would cooperate with our government.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (THANK YOU TO THE 218TH -- (House of Representatives - April 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, soldiers of the 218th Brigade Combat Team of the South Carolina Army National Guard, under the leadership of Brigadier General Bob Livingston, are successfully returning to South Carolina. For the past year they have been in Afghanistan as part of Task Force Phoenix working to build the Afghan military and police. 
   As a 28-year veteran of the 218th, I know firsthand of their competence and patriotism. These citizen soldiers have built one Afghan military battalion to be fully independent with 13 additional battalions to be operational by this summer. After overhauling the Afghani police forces to eliminate corruption, the 218th helped build an Afghan police force of 79,000. 
   Additionally, the 218th provided humanitarian relief, including the construction of schools, hospitals and roads. They conducted 200 medical assistance missions and delivered 300 tons of food and supplies to the 37,000 Afghans. 
   At this time, we also remember the fallen. Staff Sergeant James D. Bullard, Sergeant Shawn F. Hill and Sergeant Edward O. Philpot lost their lives during the year-long deployment. These patriots gave the ultimate sacrifice in defense of American families by defeating terrorists overseas. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.  
   In addition to the information provided above, the 218th Brigade Combat Team has had extraordinary success in working alongside the Afghan forces. During the past winter--a time when Taliban forces often regroup--soldiers from the 218th, along with Afghan soldiers, stayed in forwarding operating bases around Afghanistan and took the fight to the Taliban. This action kept the enemy from gathering strength. 
   Due to the commitment and professionalism of the men and women of the 218th, the Afghan army now has a reenlistment rate of 55 percent--more than double the 20 percent a year ago. The percentage of Afghan soldiers ready for duty has gone up from 55 percent to 85 percent. Their absent without leave percentage has dropped to eight percent, and they have 29,000 recruits that have completed basic training. 
   The Afghan police continue to grow in size and ability. As a sign of success, this winter the police were able to defend and hold their 364 district centers. This is something they have not been able to accomplish since the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001. 
   I appreciate the above factual information provided by embedded reporter Chuck Crumbo from Kabul, Afghanistan, in The State of Columbia, South Carolina, on April 27, 2008.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 100th anniversary of independence for the people of the Republic of Bulgaria. 
   On September 22, 1908, Bulgaria emerged from the control of the Ottoman Empire as an independent nation. Following World War II, Bulgaria was subject to totalitarian rule for much of the 20th century until the defeat of communism in the beginning of the 1990s. 
   Today, Bulgaria is a dynamic member of NATO and the European Union. I am grateful for the growing partnership between the United States and Bulgaria, in particular their courageous military contributions in the global war on terrorism. Last month, I was grateful to visit our extraordinary friends during a visit to joint Bulgaria-U.S. training bases in Bulgaria. 
   As the co-chair of the Bulgarian Caucus, I have seen firsthand for the people of Bulgaria this remarkable achievement of freedom and democracy. The friendship between Bulgaria and America has never been stronger. Much credit is due to the professionalism of the departing ambassador, Ambassador Elena Poptodorova. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

But when the retirement savings of hardworking Americans are threatened, when businesses start to fail, jobs begin to dry up, or jobs of American taxpayers are in danger, it is clear that the price of doing nothing far exceeds the price of what we are considering. 
   Small businesses and families are the heart of this bill. They did not cook the books or make bad financial decisions. They had faith in the free market and worked hard for their success. 
   This bill is an imperfect option in a tragic situation, but it protects jobs and taxpayers. It provides transparency and oversight to the actions of the Treasury. It provides free market alternatives to spending tax dollars, like insurance, loans, and an increase in the FDIC cap. And it helps keep taxpayers from paying an even higher price for the misdeeds of Wall Street.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Thank you, Congressman Deal, for coordinating this tribute to a patriot. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute and remembrance of my dear friend and our colleague CHARLIE NORWOOD. Upon my election 5 years ago, two of the first people to offer guidance to me were CHARLIE and Gloria Norwood. As a Member of Congress from an adjoining district, I learned firsthand of CHARLIE's dedication to the public and his love of America. Gloria has been a model First Lady for the district, enthusiastically assisting CHARLIE in his life of public service. 
   CHARLIE was a committed health care practitioner, a loving family man and a passionate public servant. He spent his entire life fighting for the people of his beloved Georgia. 
   True to his character, CHARLIE fought to the end, despite debilitating health conditions. He was always in good spirits, even though we knew he was exerting extraordinary efforts to fully represent his constituents. He reminded me so much of my predecessor, the late Congressman Floyd Spence, a fellow courageous lung transplant recipient. 
   I had the pleasure of serving with CHARLIE on the Education and Workforce Committee. I am honored to, this  year, be the Republican ranking member on the Workforce Protection Subcommittee, which CHARLIE ably chaired for three terms. 
   In Congress, CHARLIE was an ardent advocate for health care reform and patients' rights. He was a good friend and strong supporter of the employees of the Savannah River Nuclear Laboratory. I was proud to work closely with him in our efforts to create a MOX facility for the transformation of plutonium waste at the Savannah River site.     
   CHARLIE is survived by his wife Gloria; his two sons, Charles and Carlton; and four grandchildren. Roxanne and I join with his colleagues in mourning his passing and send our prayers to his family, staff and constituents. May God bless the Norwood family at this time, and may they know that he made a significant and positive difference for America.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as we continue the debate of opposing reinforcements for American forces in the global war on terrorism, I am reminded of how crucial it is that we achieve victory to protect American families. 
   The current situation in Iraq reminds me of a smoldering fire in an urban area. Proper equipment and a sufficient number of professional firefighters are brought in to put out the fire. To sit back, overlook the seriousness or leave the scene of the fire only enables the fire to grow, become more intense and spread throughout the neighborhood. 
   This analogy is applicable to Iraq. As Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said recently, the violence in Iraq, if unchecked, could spread outside its borders and draw other states into a regional conflagration. Just as we know our fire chiefs would call up additional firefighters to contain a spreading fire, we must give our troops in Baghdad the chance to suppress violence and stabilize the region, which protects American families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate your leadership for the people of the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2831. This legislation is being improperly classified as a narrow bill with limited ramifications, that simply overturns a Supreme Court decision made on May 29, 2007. In actuality, it is one of the most overreaching pieces of wage discrimination legislation that has ever been considered. If enacted, this legislation would make it impossible for businesses to defend themselves against actions that occurred years in the past. 
   We all oppose discrimination. Action against those who discriminate in the workplace should be taken quickly. Current laws ensure that disputes over discrimination are addressed expeditiously and with certainty. This bill would eliminate the 1964 Civil Rights Act statute of limitations governing the time within which a party must make a pay discrimination claim, currently 180 days or 300 days, depending on the State of employment. 
   As an inactive attorney and a person who practiced for 25 years and the proud father of an attorney, who appreciates the legal profession, I believe a statute of limitation serves many purposes. It encourages the timely filing of claims, helps prevent the filing of stale claims, and, most importantly, protects against abuse of the legal system. 
   Cases should be brought to court as soon as possible after an incident occurs to guarantee memories are fresh and witnesses are available to testify. In the absence of a statute of limitation, a worker or retiree could sue for pay discrimination resulting from an alleged discriminatory act that might have occurred 5, 10, 20 or even 30 years earlier. This same worker or retiree could seek damages against a company run by employees and administrators that had nothing to do with the initial act of alleged discrimination that occurred dozens of years ago. 
   I am grateful for the leadership of the Education and Labor Committee ranking member Buck McKeon on this issue. I urge my colleagues to oppose this flawed legislation

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I want to thank my Republican colleagues for bringing this motion to instruct to the floor. It is important to me as a member of the Armed Services Committee, as a 31-year veteran of the Army National Guard, and as the parent of a soldier who has served in Iraq, with another son soon to deploy to Iraq. Additionally, our family is grateful to have two additional sons serving in the military. 
   This motion to instruct is straightforward. It simply confirms that the representatives of the American people understand the consequences of our actions in Iraq and that we are not going to pull the rug out from underneath our brave soldiers. Congress should never act to undermine our troops and jeopardize the success they are achieving in Iraq today. Unfortunately, the strategy of precipitous withdrawal and defeat some continue to advocate has brought us to this point. 
   The Democrat leadership has continued to propose legislation that aims to micromanage our military leaders and tie their hands as they stop the terrorists. This undermines the extraordinary gains by our troops that I have seen on my eight visits to Iraq, which has been possible by the surge led by General David Petraeus. We must not forget al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri has declared Iraq and Afghanistan the central front in the global war on terrorism, and we must succeed in stopping terrorists overseas and protecting American families at home.     
   This motion to instruct is a right opportunity for this body, for the leadership here in Washington to say with one voice that we are invested in success, that our aim is not to leave behind a failed Iraqi state where safe havens for terrorists will threaten American families. Our military should be able to count on our unwavering support for the fight in which they are engaged. 
   Our colleagues in the Senate have already acted with near unanimous support, 94-3, to include the language of this motion in their authorization. Only three Senators voted against this, showing a unified United States Senate. They have gone on record recognizing that a failed state in Iraq would have dire consequences for the safety and security of the region, for American families, and for our allies around  the world. It is imperative that we follow their lead. 
   Again, I want to thank the ranking member, DUNCAN HUNTER, for his leadership. He is a dedicated veteran and father of an Iraq veteran. And additionally, I want to thank my Republican colleagues for bringing this motion to the floor. I encourage all of my colleagues to support it and send a bipartisan message to our enemies and allies that we are committed to victory in Iraq and ensuring that Iraq does not become a failed state and a safe haven for terrorists.

   The Democrats have failed three times to push through their energy tax increase but here it is on the floor again today. When will our neighbors across the aisle realize we cannot tax our way to energy independence? Innovation and competition, the free market forces that have led to extraordinary discovery, do not emerge from tighter bureaucracy and punitive tax policies; yet, the majority still wants to raise taxes on the American people. 
   The truth is that our antiquated domestic refinery capacity, a dependence on foreign oil, and a growing global demand for oil are responsible for the increase in oil prices. Raising taxes on American companies simply punishes American taxpayers by implementing a policy which will raise the price at the pump and hit us all in the wallet.

Whether it's a war tax, an Internet tax, or a cigarette tax that will overly burden low-income families, the first Democrat solution seems to be to tax hard-working Americans. 
   And when they are not trying to raise taxes on American workers, they are spending their hard-earned money at reckless levels. The $23 billion in new domestic spending this majority has proposed is just another sign that they feel they know better how to spend your own money. 
   We must restore fiscal sanity to government, but we should do that by making the necessary decisions here in Washington to save taxpayer money and spend wisely. Both parties need to pass fiscally responsible appropriations legislation rather than wait until we are forced to vote on a giant omnibus spending bill that will be full of earmarks.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to speak on H.R. 1338. 
   I want to thank the ranking member of the committee, Representative Buck McKeon of California, for his leadership here today. 
   I know we can all agree that discrimination in the workplace is unacceptable. That is why employment discrimination, including pay discrimination, based on gender is already prohibited by law. As an attorney myself, I believe there are already considerable legal ramifications for discrimination  in our Federal laws, which makes the legislation we are considering here today unnecessary and redundant. 
   Additionally, it seems the premise for bringing this bill to the floor today is in response to potential wage gaps between men and women in the workforce. I would remind my colleagues that research into this issue, including a report by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, concluded that the ``wage gap'' was not simply derived from sex discrimination or pay discrimination. In fact, the reasons for such a gap can be numerous. 
   But to the bill itself, I am concerned that this legislation will not strengthen current laws or improve workplace protections but rather create additional and greater potential for individuals, well-meaning or otherwise, to abuse these protections in our courts. 
   This bill does two very damaging things to current law. It allows for unlimited compensatory and punitive damages for claims brought under the Equal Pay Act, and it does not require proof of intent to discriminate in those claims. These two components could have unintended consequences for employers and employees, and they make it more attractive for unsubstantiated claims before the courts. 
   I welcome a healthy debate on employee and employer protections in the workplace. In fact, I would hope that before going forward, the debate on these issues would be more open where both the minority and majority might have greater opportunity to offer amendments to strengthen legislation and address the real concern of America's hardworking families. 
   I want to thank Ranking Member Buck McKeon for his leadership, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose this legislation. American workers deserve reasonable protections that are enforced. This bill would undermine those efforts in America's workforce. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. 
   The motion was agreed to. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. Woolsey) having assumed the chair, Mr. Capuano, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1338) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.

   Mr. Speaker, complete discussion regarding the way forward in Iraq is certainly appropriate. In fact, it's our duty as elected public officials. It is sad that the resolution before us offers no solutions. It is contradictory to say in one paragraph that we support the troops and in the next paragraph oppose reinforcements for them. As the parent of a son who served proudly in Iraq and three others in the military, I want to fully support the troops. 
   Al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri has made it clear that Iraq is the central front in the global war on terrorism. In a January 22, 2007 transcript, Zawahiri boasted, ``The backing of the jihad in Afghanistan and Iraq today is to back the most important battlefields.'' The enemy know Iraq is the central front of the global war on terrorism. 
   We must put our trust in the commanders on the ground who are living the situations we are merely debating. General David Petraeus in Baghdad is an accomplished general with a proven record of success. He has expressed his confidence that victory in Iraq can be achieved--provided he has the personnel required to do so. General  Petraeus has just been unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate to lead our troops in Iraq. We need to support him with reinforcements. 
   In my six visits to Iraq, I have gone to encourage our troops, but each time it is them who have encouraged me. They know firsthand that the enemies fighting us today in Iraq want to fight in the streets of America tomorrow. We must face them today to protect American families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Carol Shea-Porter for introducing this resolution and my colleagues, led by Representative Robin Hayes, on the Armed Services Committee, for bringing it to the floor for our consideration. 
   As a proud co-sponsor, I am honored to have this opportunity to celebrate the United States Marine Corps and recognize their 232 years of service to our Nation. 
   On November 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution that called for two battalions of  marines to be raised for use as naval infantrymen. From that day forward, marines have defended this Nation in every American military conflict. They first saw combat in the Bahamas in 1776 under the leadership of Captain Samuel Nicholas, the officer who is considered by most to be the first marine commandant. 
   Though the Marines were disbanded following the Revolutionary War, they were reestablished on July 11, 1798, and from that day forward have protected and defended Americans and our allies around the world. From Europe to the Philippines, South America to Asia, and the Middle East, marines have fought in every corner of the world. 
   In addition to traditional military duties, marines protect our embassies and dignitaries around the world. They have served in a humanitarian capacity bringing relief and aid to citizens of other nations as well. 
   In the global war on terrorism, 76,000 marines have been deployed to Iraq to help establish peace, root out insurgent remnants and al Qaeda terrorists, and bring stability to that young democracy. I am grateful for my son, a naval doctor, who is working with the marines in Iraq today. 
   As part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, marines have helped topple the repressive Taliban regime and dismantle the al Qaeda network. For their service on these two fronts of the global war on terrorism, marines have been decorated with thousands of honors and medals. These decorations include 7,720 Purple Hearts for wounds suffered during combat, and 866 Bronze Stars with ``V'' for exceptional valor in a combat situation. 
   Since the inception of the United States Marine Corps, 298 marines have earned the Congressional Medal of Honor, our Nation's highest military honor. On a personal note, the Second District of South Carolina, which I have the honor of representing, is home to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort and Parris Island. All marine recruits east of the Mississippi River go through Parris Island. 
   Marines are the most elite fighting force in our military. Their reputation for professionalism and selfless duty has earned them the thanks of a grateful Nation and the appreciation of millions around the world over two centuries of service and sacrifice. My late father-in-law, Major Julian Dusenbury, and my late brother-in-law, Captain Tim Dusenbury, were proud marines, and our family especially appreciates the service of the Marine Corps. 
   On behalf of my colleagues in the House of Representatives and the American people, I want to thank the tireless men and women of the United States Marine Corps for their service and sacrifice. Each and every day they are working to protect our Nation and our allies around the world. 
   I encourage all my colleagues to join me in supporting and expressing our most humble appreciation for the few, the proud, the Marines. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Having no further speakers, I would like to make one further statement. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity, 2 years ago, of visiting in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, where the Marine Corps ably served to assist the people of Pakistan in their recovery from the horrific incidents of the earthquake. And it was so reassuring to visit and see the hospital that they set up, with female doctors, due to the cultural concerns of the people in that region. It had just an extraordinary impact. 
   I had the privilege of meeting with President Musharraf, who indicated that at that time the most famous toy, the most appreciated toy, in all of Pakistan was the Chinook helicopter, representing the deep affection of the people of Pakistan for the Marine Corps and their service.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (VETERANS GUARANTEED BONUS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3793, as amended, a bill to ensure that military personnel who die or who are retired or separated for medical reasons are paid their full enlistment or re-enlistment bonuses and are not subject to repayment of any portion of those bonuses. 
   Last month, media stories sparked outrage among Members of Congress and citizens alike when they highlighted what appeared to be a potentially widespread practice by the Army and Department of Defense. Media reports stated that wounded servicemembers who could no longer continue on active duty because of those wounds were being required to repay portions of their enlistment or re-enlistment bonuses because they had not fulfilled the terms of their contracts. In some cases, the Army was cited as demanding repayment of thousands of dollars from soldiers who, but for their wound or injuries in combat, continued to serve the Army in this Nation honorably. 
   What the media failed to report completely was that the Department of Defense and the military services had an active policy in place that addressed this problem. The policy did the following: first, in cases where a servicemember died, not at the result of his or her own misconduct, the unpaid portions of an enlistment or re-enlistment bonus would be paid to the servicemember's survivors, and there would be no requirement to repay already paid bonuses. 
   Second, when the servicemember was unable to complete an enlistment or re-enlistment due to circumstances reasonably beyond the service-member's control, no already paid bonus would be recouped. Finally, the Secretaries of the military services had broad discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to forego recoupment and pay out unpaid portions of bonuses. 
   H.R. 3793, as amended, captures and codifies the most effective parts of the existing DOD policy, and goes beyond that policy. When enacted, H.R. 3793 will guarantee that a servicemember who dies or is retired or separated for medical disability will not be required to pay any portion of a bonus or similar benefit that they had received. It mandates that the full contracted amount of any unpaid bonus or similar benefit be paid, as appropriate, to the estates of servicemembers who die or to servicemembers who are retired or separated due to a disability. And it mandates that payments are to be made not later than 90 days after the death, retirement, or separation of the servicemember. 
   Additionally, if a service Secretary determines that requiring repayment or withholding payment of the unpaid bonus would be contrary to a personnel policy or management objective, against equity and good conscience, or be contrary to the best interests of the United States, then they would be allowed to waive repayment or to continue payment of unpaid bonuses. Discretion should be allowed for the most beneficial interpretation in favor of our courageous servicemembers. 
   H.R. 3793 is a good bill, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting it. Our servicemen and -women deserve our most humble thanks, and this bill would ensure that we are honoring their sacrifices by not denying them or their families their due pay. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (EXPRESSING UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank Representative Ginny Brown-Waite for introducing this resolution and my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for bringing it to the floor for our consideration. 
   As a proud co-sponsor, I am honored to have this opportunity to recognize the contributions of our citizen soldiers in the United States National Guard. 
   From the earliest days of our country's founding to today, average Americans have stepped forward to serve their Nation. Soldiers of the National Guard have served in every major combat throughout our great history, and since September the 11th, they have taken a tremendous role in support of the global war on terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Since these terrible attacks 6 years ago, 329,982 members of the National Guard have been mobilized for military operations around the world. Unlike their traditional military comrades, National Guard members are not career military soldiers. They are most often employed in other careers and serve when called upon to assist with combat operations and as first responders during domestic emergencies and rescue and recovery situations. This unique role underscores an immense dedication to their patriotic duty and to this Nation. 
   As a 31-year veteran of the Army Reserve and National Guard, I am honored to have known and worked with many of these extraordinary and dedicated individuals.     
   My former unit, the 218th Mechanized Infantry Brigade of the South Carolina Army National Guard is currently serving in Afghanistan under the leadership of Brigadier General Bob Livingston. Its 1,800 troops are the largest deployment of National Guard since World War II. I have visited the troops in June, August and November, and I know firsthand they are training Afghani police and military forces to help that young democracy stand on its own two feet. The best way to stop terrorism is to deny terrorists safe havens anywhere in the world. Additionally, my son, Alan, was deployed with the South Carolina National Guard to Iraq, along with my son, Julian, with Guard service in Egypt. And my family and I are grateful for their service and the service of their comrades, led by Major General Stan Spears, America's longest serving adjutant general. Our family knows that National Guard membership is rewarding for service for America and for our State while receiving extraordinary opportunities for education, travel and meeting talented people of competence and patriotism. I encourage every American to consider National Guard service. 
   With this resolution, we recognize the contributions of the Guard, but we also pledge to support their efforts with the necessary resources and express our deepest gratitude to the families whose loved ones serve this Nation. Above all, our deepest sympathies go to the families whose loved ones have been lost. 
   On behalf of my colleagues in the House of Representatives and the American people, I want to thank the brave men and women of the Guard for their service. In times of peace and times of war, there they are working to protect our Nation and our allies around the world and the citizens here at home. I want to thank Representative Ginny Brown-Waite for introducing this resolution. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it and expressing our most humble appreciation for the citizen soldiers of the National Guard.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the brave men and women of our Armed Forces, our local first responders, and our intelligence community for the incredible work they do to protect our Nation and stop the enemy overseas so we will not face them again here at home. 
   On the upcoming anniversary of September 11th, we must take this moment to reflect on the terrible tragedy that occurred 6 years ago, causing our response to this global war on terrorism. We must maintain our resolve against bin Laden who has declared this struggle the ``third world war'' with Iraq and Afghanistan as the central front. 
   Independent Senator Joe Lieberman wrote in today's Wall Street Journal: ``In Iraq we are fighting and defeating the same terrorist network that attacked us on 9/11.'' 
   We will succeed by remaining dedicated to promoting the safety of American families by denying extremists safe havens. And we are grateful to our servicemembers, professionally led by David Petraeus, who works day and night to defend our freedom. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 125, championed by Ranking Member ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, Dr. BOOZMAN and Mr. Ackerman, which opposes using civilians as human shields. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, as a 31-year veteran of the Army Reserves and National Guard, and as the father of four sons in the U.S. military, I know firsthand that using human shields violates international law. 
   Just last year, American and international leaders condemned the use of human shields. The Lebanese have been particularly victims of human shields in the past year. On August 11, 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated, ``Hezbollah and its sponsors have brought devastation upon the people of Lebanon, dragging them into a war that they did not choose and exploiting them as human shields.'' 
   On August 14, President George W. Bush stated, ``Hezbollah terrorists targeted Israeli civilians with daily rocket attacks. Hezbollah terrorists used Lebanese civilians as human shields, sacrificing the innocent in an effort to protect themselves from Israeli response.'' 
   Also, as to Israel, we should note that the Israeli Supreme Court has ruled a ban to the use of human shields. Additionally, Israel has a strict policy against the use of civilians as human shields, and in dealing with the isolated incidents where the policy is violated, takes measure to punish those responsible and prevent these acts from occurring in the future. 
   It is clear, as eloquently reviewed by Mr. Ackerman, that no one should seek to apply a moral equivalency between isolated incidents formally opposed by Israel's democratically elected government and the actions of Hezbollah, whose policies and tactics show disregard for human life and advocate intentionally using the tactic of embedding its forces among civilians to use them as human shields, abusing the people of Lebanon. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 125, condemning the use of human shields.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (HONORING THE LIFE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF GIAN CARLO MENOTTI -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 68. This resolution honors the life and accomplishments of Gian Carlo Menotti, and recognizes the success of the Spoleto Festival USA, which he founded in my birthplace of Charleston, South Carolina. 
   Born in Italy, near Lake Magiore and the Swiss border, Mr. Menotti began writing songs at the age of 7. By 11 he wrote both the story line and music for his first opera, ``The Death of Pierrot,'' and shortly thereafter began his formal musical training at Milan's Verdi Conservatory.     
   After the death of his father, Menotti and his mother immigrated to the United States, where he enrolled at Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music. 
   In 1951 Mr. Menotti wrote his beloved Christmas opera, ``Amahl and the Night Visitors,'' for the Hallmark Hall of Fame. ``Amahl and the Night Visitors'' was the first opera ever written for television in the United States and was first aired on Christmas Eve in 1951. ``Amahl and the Night Visitors'' was such a success that it became an annual Christmas tradition and remains Mr. Menotti's most famous popular work to this day. 
   In 1958 he founded the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. This festival was intended to bring opera to a popular audience and helped launch the careers of such artists as singer Shirley Verrett and choreographers Paul Taylor and Twyla Tharp. 
   In 1977 he founded its companion festival, Spoleto Festival USA, in Charleston, South Carolina. Spoleto Festival USA is an annual 17-day festival of the arts which produces opera, and it presents dance, theater, classical music, and jazz. The festival is held in late May and early June. 
   Charleston was chosen as the location for the festival due to its wealth of theaters and other performance spaces. Each year the festival hosts over 100 performances by international artists in a variety of disciplines. Since its inception it has presented 100 international premieres and 93 American premieres, notably ``Creve Coeur'' by Tennessee Williams and ``The American Clock'' by Arthur Miller. World-renowned artists who performed at Spoleto Festival USA early in their careers include Renee Fleming, Emanuel Ax, Joshua Bell, Joanna Simon, and Yo-Yo Ma. The festival claims an audience annually of between 70,000 to 80,000 persons each year. 
   In 1984 Menotti was awarded the Kennedy Center Honor for Achievement in the Arts, and in 1991 he was chosen Musical America's ``Musician of the Year.'' In addition to composing operas to his own texts, on his own chosen subject matter, Menotti directed most productions of his work. 
   Gian Carlo Menotti died on February 1, 2007, at the age of 95 in a hospital in Monte Carlo, Monaco, where he had a home. 
   I want to thank my colleagues, led by Congressman Henry Brown and my fellow members of the South Carolina delegation, for honoring the life of this great Italian American artist as well as his lasting legacy, the Spoleto Festival USA. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Last week, Senate Democrat Leader Harry Reid declared the Iraq war ``lost.'' Just yesterday, a Democrat Congressman said it is the job of Congress to micromanage the war. Our military leaders should manage the war, not politicians in Washington. 
   Despite reports of progress by our military leaders, Democrats continue to advocate withdrawal and defeat. This puts American families at risk at home. Early withdrawal will escalate, not end, the global war on terrorism. 
   Our troops deserve more from the men and women elected to provide for their well-being. Members of both parties should support our troops and pass a clean supplemental bill. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 292, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that schools should celebrate National Garden Month through a curriculum that includes outdoor learning through gardening. 
   I appreciate the leadership of its lead sponsor, Congresswoman DEBORAH PRYCE of Ohio. 
   Around the Nation, more and more schools and youth groups are becoming savvy to the ecological and educational benefits of building gardens. It gives students another reason to get outdoors and use their knowledge and academic skills to solve a real world problem. 
   Gardening offers active and engaging connections to academics from science and math to nutrition and literacy. Educators will tell you students retain information better when they design experiments, use more than one style of learning, and share their newfound knowledge with others. 
   Additionally, gardening benefits children's health and well-being, as well as their attitudes toward the environment. Indeed, gardening benefits the whole child. It captivates children's interests, teaches them nurturing skills, and gives them a sense of pride in their accomplishments. It introduces them to healthful foods and provides a way to improve and give back to the community. 
   I grew up with an appreciation of gardening in that my mother, Wray G. Wilson, was the garden editor of the Charleston News and Courier, where she encouraged the establishment of a municipal parks department for America's most historic city, with the leadership of Mayor J. Palmer Gailliard, Jr. Additionally, my two youngest sons, Julian and Hunter, have developed an appreciation of gardening, the environment and conservation by attending Camp Wildwood, sponsored by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and the Garden Clubs of South Carolina. I am grateful to Brad Taylor and Steve Bates for their enthusiastic coordination of Camp Wildwood. 
   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join my friends, Congresswoman Pryce, Congresswoman Clarke, Congresswoman McCarthy and students across the Nation in celebrating National Gardening Month, and ask my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 121, which highlights the benefits and importance of school-based music education. I would like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper) and the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Porter) for their leadership on this issue and for introducing this resolution we are considering today. 
   Research has shown that students' involvement in their school music program is crucial to a complete education. Musical study develops critical thinking and self-discipline skills and improves a child's early cognitive development, basic math and reading abilities, self-esteem, SAT scores, ability to work in teams, spatial reasoning skills, and school attendance. 
   In an analysis by the U.S. Department of Education, data on more than 25,000 secondary school students, researchers found that students who report consistent high levels of involvement in instrumental music over the middle and high school years showed significantly higher levels of mathematics proficiency by grade 12 regardless of a student's socioeconomic status. 
   A 1999 report by the Texas Commission on Drug and Alcohol Abuse found that individuals who participated in band or orchestra reported the lowest levels of current and lifelong use of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs. So it is not surprising that children involved with music education are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college and are less likely to be involved with gangs and substance abuse. 
   In fact, many colleges and universities view participation in the arts and music as a valuable experience that broaden students' understanding and appreciation of the world around them. 
   For these reasons, I support H. Con. Res. 121. The resolution states it is the sense of Congress that music education grounded in rigorous instruction is an important component of a well-rounded academic curriculum, and should be available to every student in every school. 
   Music education is important to our children. It can broaden and strengthen their education and improve their lives. I join my colleagues in commending music educators and organizations across the country for the key roles they play in helping our students succeed in school and throughout life. 
   As former President Gerald Ford said, ``Music education opens the doors that help children pass from school into the world around them, a world of work, culture, intellectual activity and human involvement. The future of our Nation depends on providing our children with a complete education that includes music.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Con. Res. 121 and music education in our schools.

I appreciate Chairman IKE SKELTON and Ranking Member Duncan Hunter's work in crafting this legislation. 
   As directed by the House Committee on Armed Services, in fiscal year 2008 the Army's end strength will be 525,400, a 13,000-person increase, and the Marine Corps' end strength will be 189,000, 9,000 more than last year. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, as a 31-year veteran of the Army Reserves and Guard, and, most importantly, as the proud parents of four sons who are serving in the military today, I know firsthand of the extraordinary opportunities of military service. 
   Increasing the size of our military is imperative in our fight to win the global war on terrorism. By ensuring we have an adequate number of soldiers, we can decrease troop deployment time and increase training and readiness, thus improving our military's capability and effectiveness. 
   The bases I directly represent, Fort Jackson for the Army and Parris Island for the Marines, are producing the best professionals to protect American families in the world. I am particularly pleased that the effort to increase troop strength is bipartisan. I have been impressed that last year Congresswoman ELLEN TAUSCHER of California introduced legislation for troop strength increase.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 624, which congratulates the State of Israel for chairing a United Nations committee for the first time in its history. This accomplishment is long overdue. Israel, as a fully democratic and sovereign state, should be entitled to all of the privileges and opportunities of any member state of the United Nations. 
   Unfortunately, the anti-Semitism and anti-Israel bias that pervades the United Nations has long prevented Israel from fully participating in that body. To this day, Israel remains only a temporary member of the U.N.'s Western European and Others Group and is excluded from many consultations, discussions and leadership posts within the group and the U.N. itself. 
   The anti-Semitic, anti-Israel attitude shown by some members of the U.N. is unacceptable. It shames the principles of the United Nations. The United Nations has slowly begun to make progress in addressing this problem in restoring Israel to its rightful place at the U.N. However, there is much to be done, and this resolution calls upon U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to resolve this disgraceful problem. Until this happens, the United Nations will not live up to its own charter where the preamble states that the U.N. was founded ``To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and nations large and small.'' 
   In addition, Madam Speaker, Israel's ability to finally chair a U.N. committee is a well-deserved accomplishment for Israel and a privilege and honor for a U.N. that has not done nearly enough. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague and longtime friend from the State of Florida (Mr. Hastings) for introducing this resolution, and I urge its adoption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I support this resolution, which condemns both Syria and Iran for their continuing campaign of murder and intimidation aimed at anti-Syrian politicians and public figures of Lebanon. It warns them against interfering either directly or through their many representatives in the Lebanese presidential elections scheduled for later this month. 
   Over 2 years after the Cedar Revolution, and despite the withdrawal of Syrian troops, Lebanon's fragile government continues to be targeted for destruction by internal and external threats. Hezbollah has continued to carry out its strategy of assassinating anti-Syrian Lebanese politicians. The aim is to gain a parliamentary majority that would allow both Syria and Iran to impose their choice for a president on the Lebanese people. 
   Furthermore, the inclusion of pro-Syrian, Iranian and terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah in the Lebanese political process only empowers the Syrian and Iranian regimes and holds Lebanon hostage to their whims. Allowing a terrorist entity to use the political process and legitimize itself without first demanding a renouncement of violence has only served to perpetuate and enhance the threat. 
   We support the underlying intent of this resolution, which is to advocate for the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon. The Lebanese people deserve the right to be free of interference and intimidation by any outside country or terrorist group. However, despite supporting the resolution, we are concerned about language in this resolution referring to the entire Lebanese Parliament as ``democratically elected,'' because it sets a dangerous precedent by both legitimizing and providing congressional approval for the role of a foreign terrorist organization in the political process in Lebanon. Sadly, it legitimizes current election law which was constructed by the Syrians and imposed on the Lebanese people. 
   Finally, it undermines the very essence of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559, aimed at truly removing Syria from the Lebanese political process. Elections conducted under a Syrian-controlled electoral process where foreign terrorist organizations are allowed to participate without first requiring them to lay down their weapons should not be considered ``democratic'' by this Chamber. 
   Madam Speaker, the United States and other responsible nations must encourage the Government of Lebanon and leading Lebanese policymakers not to compromise on their commitment to reform the political process by purging from it the influence of Syria, Iran and Hezbollah. Our support for the Lebanese people and the pro-democracy forces in Lebanon is vital to counterbalance the pressures surrounding Lebanon. 
   The brave people of Lebanon continue to stand against the tyrannical regime in Damascus, and they deserve nothing less than our support. It is for this reason that, despite reservations about the implications of some of the clauses in this resolution, I will vote for this resolution, and ask my colleagues to do the same.  
   I especially remember Congressman LaHood being prophetic. Last year I attended a White House meeting with the President of members of both parties giving reports on their recent trips to Iraq. Congressman LaHood pointed out progress in Iraq, but he also stated the public needed reassurance of the capture or killing of the al Qaeda leader in Iraq, Zawahiri. Just as he concluded, National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, sitting next to me, received an important cell call which he took and then several hours later could announce: the butchering beheader Zawahiri had been killed by a successful American airstrike.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (DEFICIT CONTINUES TO DECLINE -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, the Department of Treasury and Office of Management and Budget have announced that today's budget deficit is $85 billion less than last year. That marks a $250 billion decline over the last 3 years and brings us even closer to balancing the budget.  
   This good news is a clear sign that a government which taxes less and spends less taxpayer dollars and spends them wisely can balance its checkbook. These recent record tax revenues are paying down the deficit, but we must do our part by honoring the hard work of the American people and not passing future bloated budgets and tax hikes. 
   The American people have learned to live within their means; it is time that Washington do the same. That means we do not spend $22 billion more than we need to or tax Americans $400 billion more than they deserve. Above all, the government must address the pending entitlement crisis. This is a situation where Congress cannot pass the buck. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, the continued rise in energy prices threatens our economy and our national security. There are unfriendly nations around the world that are reliant on the world's addiction to oil. Unstable leaders like Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez delight in our dependence on imported oil and they are invested in using that power to promote their destructive agenda. Our national security is threatened by these circumstances. At the same time, we are sending billions of our dollars out of this country to buy foreign oil. 
   House Republicans have proposed a sensible plan of exploration, innovation and conservation that outlines long-term and short-term solutions to promote energy independence. 
   There is absolutely no reason why we cannot expand American oil and natural gas exploration, develop alternative energy sources and promote energy efficiency all at the same time. Incorrectly, the energy debate in this country has been sold as a fight between those who support alternative fuels and those who want to drill. The House Republican plan includes all of the above.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, we need to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program so children from low-income families without health insurance can get it. That is why my Republican colleagues and I remain supportive of a program and funding that will do just that. Unfortunately, the current SCHIP bill would send precious health care dollars to cover adults, illegal aliens, some children from families that are not low income, and others that have private insurance. 
   Republicans remain committed to putting children first. We want to provide the funds necessary to cover eligible children and enroll the low-income children still not covered. President Ronald Reagan foresaw this diversion of funds. He once said, ``You know, we could say the Democrats spend their money like drunken sailors, but that would be unfair to drunken sailors. It would be unfair because the sailors are spending their own money.''

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, while Congress debates how to address our economic crisis, I am grateful for those who are standing up for conservative free market principles--promoting limited government. 
   Surely, we owe it to the American taxpayer to consider what capital and market confidence could be garnered through private companies and investors before dipping our hand into the wallets of everyday American taxpayers. We need to look at options that will help Wall Street fix its own problems so Main Street doesn't have to foot the bill. 
   We need targeted and sensible oversight. It ensures that individual or corporate bad judgment and mishandling do not destabilize the entire economy. 
   I want to thank my colleagues Minority Leader John Boehner, Minority Whip Roy Blunt, Eric Cantor, Spencer Bachus, and Paul Ryan, who have played an integral role in the fight for a free market solution. I appreciate the innovative proposals of Congressman DARRELL ISSA of California.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (THE PELOSI PLAN FOR IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the Washington Post has usually been associated with the Democratic Party. Today's lead editorial is especially courageous in criticizing the Democratic plan for Iraq. 
   I would like to draw to your attention the following: ``In short, the Democratic proposal being taken up this week is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself. Will Iraq collapse into unrestrained civil conflict with massive civilian casualties, as the U.S. intelligence community predicts, in the event of rapid withdrawal? Will al Qaeda establish a powerful new base for launching attacks on the United States and its allies? Ms. Pelosi's strategy leads not toward a responsible withdrawal from Iraq, but to a constitutional struggle with Mr. Bush, who has already said he will veto the legislation.'' 
   Members of both parties should acknowledge the point of this editorial. Al Qaeda spokesman for Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, has clearly identified that Iraq and Afghanistan are the central fronts in the global war on terrorism. To undermine Iraq as clearly part of a global war puts American families at risk. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last Saturday I had the honor of attending a memorial service celebrating the life of Sergeant First Class George Walter Koon. Sergeant Koon was a soldier of the United States Army Infantry during the Korean War. He was a POW murdered while in captivity in 1951, but his body remained unrecovered for over half a century. It was not until recently that the hard work of his family and the Department of Defense helped positively identify Sergeant Koon and return him from North Korea to his family in Leesville, South Carolina. 
   The life and story of Sergeant Koon is an example of tremendous courage and commitment. His brother Reverend Carl Koon correctly stated that ``freedom isn't cheap and it isn't free.'' His sacrifice and that of his fellow American soldiers will never be forgotten to liberate dozens of countries so that more people today live in free market democracy than ever in the history of the world. 
   The memorial service was conducted by Reverend John McKeown and Reverend George A. Koon, nephew namesake of the deceased hero, at the Old Lexington Baptist Church of Leesville. He received full military honors.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of the resolution designating July 26, 2008, as the National Day of the Cowboy. 
   For the last 3 years on the last Saturday of July, people across America gathered to honor one of the greatest icons of our Nation, the American cowboy. National Day of the Cowboy first emerged in July of 2005 in large part to the efforts of the late United States Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming. 
   Cowboys are the original heroes of American culture. From the earliest western settlers to present-day ranchers and cattlemen, their tireless courage, integrity, and adventurous spirit has made them a symbol of values that built this great Nation.  
   Their trade nourishes our bodies as well as our souls. The values inspire each of us. From Maine to California, from twisted urban streets to the vast, open plains, Americans envy and respect those who each day, ride off into the sunset.  
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution and leave you with the words of poet laureate Ron Wilson-- 
 We give thanks for all that cowboys and cowgirls do, To keep the Cowboy way alive and true. So we honor this legacy for the value it will employ, As we celebrate the National Day of the American Cowboy.

   I rise in support of H.R. 5506, a resolution to designate the post office located at 369 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Jersey City, New Jersey, as the ``Bishop Ralph E. Brower Post Office Building.'' 
   Bishop Ralph E. Brower, a Methodist pastor and native of North Carolina, has been a vital presence in the religious and civic communities of northern New Jersey for over five decades. 
   A community leader and accomplished intellectual, Bishop Brower is, above all, a devoted family man. Married to his loving wife, Alberta, for over 60 years, the bishop has been the guiding force in the lives of his three wonderful children and 18 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
   His dedication to his denomination and community is exemplary, and it is fitting to name the post office in Jersey City, New Jersey, in his honor.  
   Generous and compassionate, Bishop Brower's passion for religious and civic duties is fueled by a personal commitment to intellectual development. After receiving his B.A. from Kettle College, he went on to earn an M.A. from Kings College, and finally a Ph.D from Grambling State University. 
   Academic accolades only scratch the surface of a man who has devoted so much of his life to improving the lives of the people surrounding him. He served in numerous positions including as the Commissioner for the Jersey City Redevelopment Agency and 4 years as the Deputy Mayor of Jersey City. His service demonstrates that he truly is a man of the people. This devotion has not gone unnoticed. Over the years, the Bishop has received a number of accolades for his civic devotion by organizations such as the New Jersey Urban League and NAACP.

   I rise in support of H.R. 4010, legislation to designate the post office at Indianola, Mississippi, as the ``Minnie Cox Post Office Building.'' 
   Minnie M. Geddings Cox was born in 1869 in a Mississippi emerging from the Civil War. After graduating from Fisk University, she returned to teach in the common schools in her hometown of Lexington. 
   In 1891 at the age of 22, Ms. Cox was appointed postmistress of Indianola by President Benjamin Harrison, becoming the first black postmistress of the United States. She was reappointed by President William McKinley and, again, by President Theodore Roosevelt. 
   In 1902, however, some of the local whites of Indianola demanded Ms. Cox's resignation, determined to remove her from her leadership position solely because of her race. 
   Ms. Cox refused, but when threats against her and her family persisted, she submitted her resignation to be effective in January 1903. Theodore Roosevelt felt that Ms. Cox had been aggrieved and refused to accept her resignation. Instead, he closed the post office in Indianola, rerouted the mail, and continued paying Ms. Cox. 
   It is important to remember determined and dedicated Americans such as Minnie Cox and be ready to stand for what is right when people are treated unjustly. 
   Let us now commemorate this courageous woman by naming the post office building in Indianola in honor of Minnie Cox.

   Under this bill, 48 acres of previously held land would be removed from the system, which would allow the affected homeowners to qualify for Federal flood insurance. We would be making this change because this property is not contained within the designated Clam Pass Conservation Area, these are not inholdings, and these lands were never held for conservation or recreation purposes. 
   We would be providing this relief because this bill satisfies the threshold of being a legitimate mapping mistake. The Fish and Wildlife Service testified in support of this technical correction, and the new implementing map would add 65 acres of conservation land to the Coastal Barrier Resources System that was overlooked when the unit was originally created. As a result, the net effect of H.R. 1714 is to actually increase the size of the system by 17 acres.

   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join House Republicans and the American people in calling for an immediate lifting of the congressional ban on offshore drilling. 
   We need to invest in future alternatives to oil, but until we find a viable, affordable alternative energy source that can move our cars and transport American commerce, we need to expand exploration of American-made oil and natural gas, particularly when we have the tools and know how to do it in an environmentally sound way.

Our intelligence community has stated unequivocally that our ability to track and spy on potential enemies has been degraded. 
   The Senate passed a fair and commonsense extension to the Protect America Act months ago, and it has received vocal bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. That is why it is particularly disappointing that the Democrat leadership has failed to bring the bill to the floor. They refuse to do so because they know it will pass. For leadership to deny a vote on such an important piece of legislation, because they know it will pass, is an insult to the majority in this House who want to defeat terrorists overseas. 
   With each day, our intelligence community is being told to do their job without the tools and resources we can and should provide for them. This is unacceptable to keep American families at risk.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, sadly, many people try to separate the current Iraq conflict from the attacks of September 11 and the Global War on Terrorism; it is impossible to do so. The attacks of September 11 were not isolated, random events. Al Qaeda has openly stated Iraq is the central front in the war on terror. And our enemy is highly intelligent, well financed and committed to the destruction of freedoms. 
   The concept that America's retreat in Iraq will bring an end to sectarian violence and terrorist activity in the region ignores history. Premature retreat will embolden the enemy and make us more vulnerable to attacks. Withdrawals from Beirut and Mogadishu led to the 1993 World Trade Center attack, the 1998 embassy bombings across Africa, the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, and then September 11. Osama bin Laden has characterized the struggle in Iraq as the third world war. We ignore this claim at our peril, which threatens American families.

   Our outdated domestic refinery capacity, our dependence on foreign oil, and a growing global demand for oil are responsible for the increase in oil prices. So we need to target those issues. We need to build more refineries in the United States, promote all alternative energy sources, and tap unexplored oil and natural gas reserves, including ANWR. This majority wants to target the American taxpayer and raise taxes on American companies.

This nonpartisan organization is dedicated to supporting our veterans by achieving victory in the global war on terrorism to protect American families by defeating terrorism overseas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 171, a resolution that honors Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch-Gilbert Du Motier, commonly known as the Marquis de Lafayette, on the occasion of his 250th birthday. 
   Lafayette is honored here in the House Chamber with a greater-than-life-size portrait, only joined by a portrait of George Washington. This is a reminder also that France was America's first ally. 
   H. Res. 171 was introduced by a man I admire greatly, the Armed Services Committee chairman, Ike Skelton, a leader in promoting the study of history. 
   My family has a strong French heritage. My home State of South Carolina is proud of the French Huguenot settlers highlighted by General Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox of the American Revolution, and I am grateful to have cosponsored this resolution. 
   The Lafayette family was one of ancient nobility. Lafayette was merely 2 years old when his father was killed in the Seven Years War. At the age of 16, he inherited his title, although he later renounced the ``marquis,'' and a large fortune was received from his grandfather. 
   In keeping with his family tradition, Lafayette joined the French Army at the age of 14, and was a junior officer in the French army when he defied the orders of King Louis the Sixteenth and sailed to the American Colonies from Spain. In speaking of the colonists' Declaration of Independence, he stated in his memoirs, ``My heart was enrolled in it.'' 
   At age 20, after volunteering to serve in the American Army at his own expense, he received the rank of major general from the United States Congress. 
   My home State of South Carolina is particularly appreciative of Lafayette in that he landed in America near the South Carolina city of Georgetown on June 13, 1777, at the young age of 19. 
   Lafayette commanded members of the American Army during several conflicts, faced off against Benedict Arnold, and ultimately faced off against Lord Cornwallis where he commanded the brigade at the siege of Yorktown in Virginia. 
   Throughout his time in America, Lafayette became close friends with General George Washington. They were so close that Lafayette named his son Georges Washington-Lafayette, and asked General Washington to be his son's godfather. He also was very close with young Alexander Hamilton, Washington's chief aide-de-camp. 
   Because of Lafayette's service to the American people, he was made an honorary U.S. citizen in 2002. Many U.S. towns and cities have been named after him, and three U.S. naval vessels bear his name. 
   I am proud that Lafayette's dedication, military skill and strategic thinking as an officer now serve as a model for our officers in uniform. General Lafayette symbolizes the assistance America received from Europe during our dynamic struggle for independence. And because of our shared values for democracy and human rights, a deep, long-lasting friendship between the United States and France continues and flourishes to this day. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased this resolution has been brought to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday's The Hill features an advertisement by Merrill Lynch that praised the 2003 tax cuts, proclaiming, ``Lower capital gains and dividend tax rates have produced major economic gains.'' 
   I was present 4 years ago this week when President Bush signed the tax reduction legislation. The results are some of the most successful ever. The economy has expanded $1.6 trillion; 7.8 million new jobs have been created; unemployment rates are near historic lows. The stock market is at a record high, soaring 40 percent. Tax revenues are the highest ever because of private sector growth. Twenty-four million  families have received an average tax cut of $950. The lower rate on savings and investments has helped our economy grow to benefit American families. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.

   Ms. Sumpter's dedication to the growth and success of minority- and women-owned businesses is evidenced in her efforts with the South Carolina Minority Business Development Center, which is operated by her company. The center has assisted businesses by acting as a liaison to facilitate business growth for over 10 years. 
   Since DESA was started in 1986, it has been awarded service contracts from HHS, the Department of Commerce, the Minority Business Development Agency, the Army, the Air Force, the Small Business Administration, as well as various contracts from the private sector. DESA works with companies from the very beginning of projects until their completion.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, last week the House of Representatives passed unanimously a resolution condemning the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Included in the resolution was a reaffirmation of our commitment to assist Pakistan in the global war on terrorism and to help promote democratic principles there, a cause for which Ms. Bhutto ultimately gave her life. 
   I had the honor with Congressman DAVID DREIER and Congressman DARRELL ISSA to have breakfast with Ms. Bhutto at her home in Islamabad just 4 weeks prior to her murder. I was tremendously impressed with her passion for the principles of democracy and  dedication to seeing democracy spread throughout Pakistan and the region. No doubt, these are principles which her assassins were determined to stop. 
   It is incumbent on us to continue to stand up for the principles Ms. Bhutto championed, to help our partner work toward a more open and democratic Pakistan, and, above all, not to tire in our stopping of the terrorists who wish to stand in the way of free and democratic societies. Stopping terrorists overseas is the best way to protect American families at home. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, there are over 500,000 children in foster care homes around the country. I am proud to support legislation recognizing the dedicated efforts put forth by foster parents. 
   These men and women open up their homes and their hearts to these youths by providing them with a stable, caring environment for months and, in some cases, years. H. Res. 179 establishes a National Foster Parents Day to praise their contributions to society. 
   These parents provide a vital role in the welfare and upbringing of children who need emotional support, guidance, and mentors. They teach children family values and morals and help them become significant members of society. Foster parents teach these values to help enable children become stable and confident adults. Children being cared for in foster homes can be traced all the way back to biblical times. 
   Foster care became increasingly widespread in the United States when Charles Loring Brace, a minister and director of the New York Children's Aid Society, noticed a large number of homeless immigrant children in New York. In 1953, Brace came up with a plan to provide them homes by advertising for families in other areas of the United States who were willing to take them in. 
   While many of these children were often indentured, Brace's movement is the origin of today's foster care program. Today, foster parents and families provide a safe and nurturing temporary home for children living in unstable conditions. There they can learn and grow until they have the opportunity to return living with their family.     
   Foster parents are crucial towards ending the vicious cycle of neglect and child abuse that endanger children's lives. 
   This resolution also calls on the President to issue a proclamation bringing greater awareness to foster care through various ceremonies, activities, and programs. These events educate communities and demonstrate support for foster parents who devote their lives lending a hand to children in need. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join me to support this resolution.

Toward the end of the show, Blue Angel No. 6, piloted by Lieutenant Commander Kevin Davis of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, crashed. 
   Lieutenant Commander Davis did not survive. Fortunately, there were no other fatalities. Lieutenant Commander Davis was a decorated pilot who joined the Blue Angels in 2005. He served in the Navy for 11 years, 8 of them as a fighter pilot. He flew 26 combat missions in Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism. Lieutenant Commander Davis's parents, John and Ann Davis, are residents of Aiken, South Carolina. He has two brothers, Christian and Phil. 
   The Blue Angels are an elite team of fighter pilots to fly F/A-18s in air shows around the country. Because of their high skill level, their courage and intense practices, accidents such as this Saturday's are uncommon. The thoughts and prayers of my wife, Roxanne, and I are with the Davis family. Americans will always cherish the service of Lieutenant Commander Kevin Davis for our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Conference Report on H.R. 2669. As the father of three college graduates and a college sophomore, I am all too familiar with the financial burden higher education poses on families and students. 
   As lawmakers, our number one higher education priority should be to ensure that college is affordable for any student. Instead of helping students, the conference agreement would require student borrowers to pay thousands more for a college education. 
   The conference agreement does not contain any language to address the issue of rising college costs. Instead of holding colleges and universities accountable for how they spend taxpayer dollars, the agreement does the exact opposite and throws additional Federal funds at institutions while denying new information to consumers. 
   The most appalling aspect of this agreement is that it achieves minimal deficit reduction. The conference agreement only produces $750 million for deficit reduction, even though the bill cuts $22.3 billion from the student loan program. Last year, President Bush signed into law a Republican reconciliation measure that achieved a full $12 billion in deficit reduction while increasing benefits for students. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this agreement and encourage President Bush to veto this legislation if it comes to his desk.

Democrats promised  the American people 2 years ago last week that they had a plan to address rising gas prices. It appears that plan was nothing more than election year politics. That's a shame because right now, Americans are paying nearly $4 a gallon for gas. The effect of these rising prices is felt not just when we fill up our tank. We see the rising prices at the grocery store because our food is shipped in trucks all across this country. 
   The American people do not expect a quick fix, but they do expect us to work toward energy independence rather than simply pointing fingers and blame. We live in a global market and many nations are competing for oil. Let's start by promoting American alternative energy. Let's invest in American oil. Let's advance American energy exploration. The co-ops of America, led by National President Jack Wolfe, are leading the way.

As Jerry Bellune of the Lexington County Chronicle would say, ``It's the people's money, not the government's money given to the people.'' 
   It seems that this Democrat majority which rode to power on a wave of promises about open and transparent Congress has decided these principles do not apply when it comes to all earmarks. So I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if identifying who is sponsoring an earmark is okay on spending bills, why is it not okay on all legislation? 
   The American people deserve more transparency from their government, not multi-million dollar spending packages slipped silently into legislation under a bureaucratic cover.

   The Navy League was formed in 1902 with the objective and purpose of educating and motivating the American people to support our maritime capabilities, services and personnel. One of their main focuses is on maintaining a strong maritime component to our national defense. 
   As a member of the Subcommittee on Sea Power and Expeditionary Forces and a member of the Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus, I have seen firsthand that the decline in our Naval ships is a threat to our national security. In the past 20 years, the U.S. Naval fleet has been cut in half to its lowest numbers since World War I. We need to push to increase our Nation's shipbuilding capability from our current average of six ships a year to a minimum of 10 so that we can be able to meet America's global security needs.

   According to the author, the decision by Fannie Mae was meant to ``spur banks to make more loans to people with less than stellar credit ratings,'' and he forecasts that ``Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk.'' They ``may run into trouble during an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.'' 
   These views were shared by Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute, who remarked that ``the government will have to step up and bail them out.'' These are voices from the past predicting the problem we face today. 
   Indeed, it was not the failings of the free market, but the failure of those participating in the markets, as well as government mishandling, that has led to this current dilemma.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 1307, a resolution commemorating Bhutan's participation in the 2008 Smithsonian Folklife Festival and commending the people and leaders of that isolated and mountainous country for their commitment to democratic reform. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Kingdom of Bhutan, called by its people ``the Land of the Thunder Dragon,'' is one of the most hauntingly beautiful and remarkable countries in the world. 
   If the diversity of its peoples, geography, and ecosystems weren't enough to make Bhutan stand out, this traditional society is also experiencing an extraordinary political evolution. 
   Due to the perceptive policies of its two most recent rulers, Bhutan has been transformed from one of the world's most reclusive poor countries to one of its more enlightened. The economy has grown at an average annual rate of 7 percent over the past 25 years. With huge investments in public health, life expectancy rose during the King's reign from 40 to 66. During the 1990s, the primary school enrollment rate rose by over a quarter to 72 percent. 
   This March, Bhutan held successful elections for the lower house of parliament. This event, which built upon the historic and peaceful elections for the upper house of parliament in December 2007, marked another positive  step in Bhutan's transition to a democratic, constitutional monarchy.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Thank you for this opportunity to speak on House Resolution 1383, a resolution recognizing the 100th anniversary of Bulgaria's independence. I want to thank the Ranking Member on the committee, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Chairman Howard Berman, in addition to Chairman Robert Wexler of the Subcommittee on Europe and Ranking Member of that subcommittee, Elton Gallegly of California, for their support in bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   I am grateful to serve as the cochair of the Bulgaria Caucus of Congress along with congresswoman Ellen Tauscher of California. We work for parliamentary exchanges between Bulgaria and America, along with hosting Bulgarian officials and citizens in Washington. 
   The people of Bulgaria should be proud that on September 22 of this year they will celebrate 100 years of independence. 
   At the beginning of the 20th century, Bulgaria struggled to free itself from the Ottoman Empire. Toward the end of that century, they once again fought to emerge from beneath Totalitarianism following the defeat of Communism. Bulgaria's story is a success because of the hard work and dedication of its people. They should be proud of these accomplishments. 
   On a personal note, 18 years ago I had the great honor to serve as an elected observer for Bulgaria's first and free elections as a participant with the International Republican Institute. At the time, I saw a nation battling the challenges of building a democratic society based on the rule of law. Communist Totalitarianism was replaced by freedom and democracy. 
   Bulgarians have faced the opportunities and the difficulties associated with building a prosperous free economy. 
   Additionally, just last month I served and visited with American troops stationed in Bulgaria on a codel led by Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo of Guam, and I am proud to report that the immense economic and diplomatic progress the people of Bulgaria have made is remarkable. We were hosted by the National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Solomon Passy. Chairman Passy served with great distinction as the former foreign minister of Bulgaria. 
   We met with former Bulgarian Minister to Greece Stephan Stoyanov, along with Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev, and National Assembly Speaker Georgi Pirinski. During my visit to Bulgaria in 2005, I was honored to be hosted by President Georgi Parvanov. 
   Indeed, the World Bank recently classified Bulgaria as one of the top 10 nations to have undertaken important economic reforms to attract business investment. Bulgaria, admitted to the European Union in 2007, is the only EU Nation to be listed in the top 10. 
   In closing, we should recognize the people of Bulgaria for their continued support in the global war on terrorism. I have visited Bulgarian troops in Afghanistan and was proud that my son, Alan, served with Bulgaria during his year of service in Iraq. 
   As a dynamic member of NATO since 2004 and as a nation of free and democratic people, Bulgaria has stood with America in these difficult times. The partnership with America has never been stronger, built by Bulgaria's ambassador to the United States, Elena Poptodorova. 
   So today we recognize this immense achievement of theirs and commend them on 100 years of independence. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman Berman, Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, subcommittee Chairman Wexler and subcommittee Ranking Member Gallegly for their work today. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I appreciate the gentleman from Michigan for his leadership on this important issue of Gitmo. 
   I rise today in strong support of the motion to instruct conferees on H.R. 2669. When the other body considered this legislation, the Republican leader inserted language to prohibit dangerous terrorists being detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, from being transferred to American soil. I believe it is crucial this language remain in the bill. 
   The findings of the sense of the Senate quoted threats of Osama bin Laden. Item 8, Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, said in his 1998 fatwa against the United States that: ``The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies, civilians and military, is an important individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.'' 
   Item 9 in the same fatwa, Osama bin Laden said: ``We, with God's help, call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes to be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill Americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they can find it.'' 
   These terrorists currently held at Guantanamo Bay are treated in accordance with U.S. and international laws. I have visited the facility two times, and both times I was impressed by the high level of security and the professional management of the detainees. 
   Importing dangerous foreign terrorists, like 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, into American communities would be dangerous and irresponsible. Terrorists would have the opportunity to recruit and teach their skills. Additionally, I am very concerned that they could potentially escape and harm Americans here at home again. 
   Since April, American forces have captured two terrorists with strong al Qaeda ties: al-Hadi al-Iraqi, one of al Qaeda's highest ranking and most experienced senior operatives, and Haroon al-Afghani, who has admitted to being a courier for the al Qaeda senior leadership. Both men are currently detained at Guantanamo Bay. Inviting these criminals into American communities would be reckless. Any domestic detention facility would be a prime target for a terrorist attack that al Qaeda could mount within the borders of the United States. 
   As the former chairman of the Lexington County Law Enforcement Advisory Council of Sheriff Jimmy Metts and as a former member of the South Carolina State Senate Corrections and Penology Committee, I am very familiar with corrections facilities. The Guantanamo detention facilities are world class as to humane lodging and security of the inmates and for the personnel who serve as guards or medical support. 
   As America continues to fight the global war on terrorism, I am confident that Guantanamo Bay remains the safest place to detain captured terrorists who pose a serious threat to American families. These terrorists have disclosed terrorist cells which have been stopped from attacking Americans and our allies worldwide. 
   I urge my colleagues to rise with me in strong support of this motion that would ensure Americans are kept safe from known terrorists.

   Too many Democrats in Congress believe the debate over energy independence is simply about the price at the pump. Some want to try to lower the price by socializing the oil industry or taxing American energy resources, neither of which will lower the price. Meanwhile, House Democrats refuse to expand exploration for American oil and natural gas. They fail to acknowledge that until we find affordable, reliable fuel sources to replace oil, our Nation will be reliant on this form of foreign energy. 
   When we invest in American resources, we not only add more supply to the market that has seen increased demand, we invest in our national security by ensuring more of our oil and natural resources come from right here at home. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, November is Military Family Appreciation Month. As many brave men and women fight overseas to protect American families at home, we must not forget to recognize the millions of military families. 
   Military families lead unique and often challenging lives. They can be separated from their loved ones for months or years at a time. This is offset by extraordinary opportunities of education and travel and meeting new people around the world. 
   As a member of a three-generation military family, I know these families share a kinship with each other. As a 31-year veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard and the father of four sons serving in the military, I ask my colleagues to join me in showing our gratitude and appreciation for these families. 
   I wish to recognize and thank the incredible work being done by the South Carolina National Guard Family Readiness Program. Whether it is during times of peace or war, these individuals are always ready to help military families with whatever assistance they may require. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, some Members of Congress are proposing legislation that would attempt to develop a new military strategy for our troops in Iraq. This meddling by politicians ties the hands of our capable military. We should trust in the leadership of GEN David Petraeus and not second-guess his efforts to protect American families. 
   Senator Joe Lieberman, former Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, recently said, ``The fanatics ..... who exhort the tens of thousands to shout `Death to America' ..... don't distinguish between Republicans and Democrats ..... and we should have the common sense, let alone the sense of responsibility to our country, to come together to defend our Nation against those who want to destroy us.'' 
   Failing to secure Iraq will provide a fertile ground for terrorist safe havens, threatening America and our allies. Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri have both stated that Iraq is a central front in the global war on terror. We must stop the terrorists overseas and not face them again in the streets of America. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend the world was reminded that we face a global war on terrorism. Terrorists murdered or maimed hundreds of innocent civilians in India, Turkey, and most recently, yesterday in Iraq. These attacks, which numbered well over a dozen, are a stark reminder of the hideous nature of the enemy, who have declared war on modern civilization. 
   The groups responsible for these attacks are not always the same people. However, their motives in disrupting peace and prosperity and taking the lives of innocent individuals are the same as those who seek to kill American families. That is why we must stand together with our allies against such heinous attacks. 
   I want to express my deepest sympathies to the people of India, Turkey, and Iraq. If we are to defeat those who will murder innocent civilians and destroy the prosperity of free Nations, then we must work together. Despite their best efforts, our enemy's brazen disregard for innocent life will only strengthen our resolve.

Mashhadani, known to be the most senior Iraqi in al Qaeda leadership, operated as chief communicator between his terrorists and senior al Qaeda leaders, including bin Laden and Zawahiri. 
   This arrest further confirms the connection between al Qaeda and Iraq and  the global terrorism network. I believe this news is significant in proving that the al Qaeda our troops are fighting in Iraq is inseparable in the front on the global war on terrorism. 
   Our troops are fighting to protect American families. Stopping the terrorists in Iraq, which Zawahiri and bin Laden have identified as the central front in the global war on terrorism, is vital to this effort.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, we are debating critical legislation that would update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This law must be updated to allow American agencies to listen to foreigners in foreign countries without a warrant. Like many of my colleagues, I believe that this is crucial to our national security. We must remain on the offense, and updating FISA will help us prevent future terrorist attacks. 
   Just yesterday, the Director of National Intelligence issued a statement urging Congress to make changes to FISA so we may protect American families. He said, ``We must urgently close the gap in our current ability to effectively collect foreign intelligence. The current FISA law does not allow us to be effective. Modernizing this law is essential for the intelligence community to be able to provide warning of threats to the country.'' 
   Congress must act immediately to ensure that our intelligence community can do their job successfully. They should not be forced to obtain court orders that hinder them from learning of terrorist threats. We must ensure that those who help our Government and report suspicious activity are protected. I urge my colleagues to act now and help keep your constituents and our country safe from impending terrorist attacks. 
   I have said many times on the floor of the House of Representatives that I have not forgotten September 11th. I urge my colleagues to act now to protect American families. We must face our enemies overseas so we do not have to face them here at home. Let's enact commonsense real reform that gives our intelligence officers the tools they need to effectively protect us.

That is why we must pass a permanent update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that will protect the privacy of Americans while restoring our intelligence-gathering capabilities. 
   Unfortunately, the RESTORE Act, the Democrat FISA bill, jeopardizes our intelligence capability and provides unprecedented protections for terrorists. It is a step in the wrong direction. The Protect America Act signed into law in August made critical changes that help intelligence officials properly track our enemies. It should be extended. 
   The National Intelligence Director, Mike McConnell, said this law was urgently needed by our intelligence professionals to close critical gaps in our capabilities and permit them to more readily follow terrorist threats. We should keep American families safer and make these changes permanent.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, Americans are speaking up about rising gas prices. 
   The polls show that well over 60 to 70 percent of Americans support exploration of American oil and natural gas reserves, and we are seeing a vocal outpouring of disappointment in Washington's refusal to take action. 
   For example, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has put a petition on his Web site asking Americans to send a message to Washington that we need to ``Drill Here, Drill Now, and Pay Less.'' As of today, the petition has over 1.1 million signatures. Surely this is only a snapshot of the millions more in America who are feeling the pinch from rising energy prices. That is the bad news. 
   The good news is that House Republicans have a plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, invest in a future of renewable, cleaner energy resources, and ask the American people to participate through conservation. We have a plan, and the American people have the will to put that plan into action if House Democrats stop standing in the way.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, it is a basic rule of economics that when demand goes up, but supply remains stagnant, prices go up. That is the primary cause of the recent rise in gas prices. 
   Energy costs affect our transportation costs, our food costs and our national security. If there were a silver bullet, an alternative energy source that could replace oil tomorrow, we would all be for it. But there isn't. So while we are working with oil, it makes economic and national security sense to reduce our dependence on foreign imports. 
   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to invest in alternative energy, good. So do we. If they want to promote conservation, good. So do we. But if they continue to stand in the way of opening up new areas right here at home for oil and natural gas exploration, then they will stand alone. 
   House Republicans are ready to act because Americans want an all-of-the-above energy policy. When will House Democrats stand with the American people, rather than in their way?

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 29, which celebrates mentors who are positively impacting the lives of young people and highlights the need for additional mentors to make themselves available to America's youth. 
   I applaud Representative SUSAN DAVIS' continued efforts to draw attention and support to this very important issue, and I appreciate her dedicated leadership in this area. 
   Mentors give their time and energy to improve the lives of American young people who increasingly spend less time with concerned adult role models. According to the National Mentoring Institute, young people with mentors are roughly half as likely as those without mentors to begin using illegal drugs, 27 percent less likely to begin using alcohol, and 50 percent less prone to absenteeism from school. The positive effects of mentoring also include the improvement of academic achievement, a reduction in violent behavior, and a higher self-esteem. 
   In December 2006, President Bush proclaimed January 2007 as National Mentoring Month, giving public recognition to mentors who serve as role models and provide quality involvement and interaction in the lives of America's youth.     
   As the President said, ``Through friendship and encouragement, mentors can help prepare young Americans for a hopeful future.'' 
   By honoring mentors and mentoring programs, we recognize the importance of mentoring programs implemented in our local schools and communities. We also draw attention to the components of a quality program, including appropriate screening of potential mentors and careful matching of youth with adults who have a genuine interest in providing guidance and being exemplary role models. 
   Mentoring programs are varied and unique. They can be school-based or faith-based, and they may be established through community organizations or corporate initiatives. I encourage people across the country to take the time to discover what mentoring programs exist in their communities and see what they can do to help. Many volunteers are needed to meet the growing demand for mentors. 
   Again, I am pleased to recognize the important work of mentors and the quality mentoring programs, and I urge Members to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 51, offered by the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. DAN LIPINSKI. This resolution increases the awareness of Catholic education while honoring the contributions of America's Catholic schools. They are dedicated to not only educating their students academically, but to developing their moral, intellectual, physical and social values. 
   January 28 through February 3, 2007, is Catholic Schools Week, an annual tradition in its 33rd year and jointly sponsored by the National Catholic Education Association and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The purpose of this resolution and Catholic Schools Week is to celebrate the vital role Catholic elementary and secondary schools play in providing a values-added education with high standards of quality and excellence to millions of children in America. 
   As President George W. Bush has noted, Catholic educators share the basic conviction that every child can learn, which is the grounding principle behind the No Child Left Behind Act. 
   Catholic schools have also played a vital role in the gulf coast's path to recovery after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. They worked as quickly as possible to reenroll their students, while also opening their doors to thousands of public school students displaced by the storm. 
   Catholic schools continue to demonstrate their faith in every student and commitment to excellence with overwhelming results. According to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic schools have a greater than 99 percent graduation rate, and about 97 percent of Catholic high school graduates go on to postsecondary training at 4-year colleges, community colleges, or technical schools. 
   I know firsthand of the significance of Catholic schools in that my new daughter-in-law, Jennifer Miskewicz Wilson of Fairfield, New Jersey, was influenced by a Catholic education. 
   I appreciate the great work being done by Catholic schools, their administrators and teachers, as well as their parents and volunteers. Catholic schools carry out their servant mission by building the academic achievement, character and values of their students. I commend my colleague from Illinois for introducing this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I would like to congratulate and thank Mrs. Davis and Mr. Lipinski for their leadership on the past two resolutions.

   Al Qaeda has stated Iraq is the central front in the war on terrorism. Osama bin Laden has characterized Iraq as the ``third world war.'' Withdrawing from Iraq will not end the global war on terrorism.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I think it is reasonable to assume that I am not alone when I say that my office has been contacted with hundreds of phone calls and e-mails asking Congress not to spend billions more to bailout the Big 3 American automakers. Congress has already asked the American taxpayer to stomach a $700 billion package of economic relief aimed at unfreezing the credit markets. It is wrong to ask American families to trust that billions in bailout relief for three specific companies will do anything but cement a dangerous and expensive precedent for future big government spending and control of a vital industry in America. 
   In fact, at this time the credit markets have not been unfrozen after the onslaught of this recent economic downturn, and I hope Congress, this current administration, and the incoming administration will ensure that the programs we have passed into law already are implemented and reviewed. Recent reports of a failure to adequately utilize the oversight mechanisms outlined in the economic rescue package are troubling. The taxpayers deserve to know that we are following the letter of the law. 
   Nevertheless, the debate today is on whether we should give $15 billion dollars to help shore up the books of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. The primary argument that continues to be made in support of this bailout is predicated upon the claim that bankruptcy is not an option. Never mind that other companies and industries--most notably the members of the airline industry--have successfully emerged from bankruptcy stronger, more agile, and successful. We have a bankruptcy process in place, the sole purpose of which is to deal with circumstances similar to those that GM, Ford, and Chrysler face. Unfortunately, in typical Washington fashion, Congress wants to reinvent the wheel and create a new process and a new bureaucratic office in the form of a ``Car Czar.'' Such a redundant proposal would be slightly less harmless were  a $15 billion taxpayer funded price tag not tacked onto it. But it is. 
   The bankruptcy process that already exists does not spell the end of a company or the loss of every one of their jobs. The scare tactics that have been spread around that without this multi-billionaire bailout, the American auto industry would disappear is just not the case. In fact, bankruptcy procedures would allow the companies to restructure to make them competitive in the global market. Bankruptcy is never an ideal situation for any company but it is far more preferable to spending billions of taxpayer dollars and ceding control to big government. 
   It should be noted that opposition to this massive bailout is not a commentary on my or my colleagues' support for the American auto industry. We represent American automotive dealerships, American automakers, parts manufacturers, the people they employ, and in many instances, we own American automobiles. We want to see these companies prosper, build the future fleet of automobiles for the world to drive, and continue to employ millions of hardworking Americans. What many of us are unwilling to accept is the suggestion that taxpayers need to be signing the check to keep particular businesses in a particular industry afloat when there is a sound, bankruptcy process already available. 
   It is clear from every angle that the American auto industry needs to make some dramatic changes to their business model and to the current agreements they have with the unions who represent their employees. These changes will make them financially stronger and more competitive. It will help protect current and future employees. They can accomplish this without a taxpayer funded bailout, and it would be unwise to betray the interests of American taxpayers by choosing to simply throw money at the problem.

We are all proud that Rob is currently serving with the 218th Brigade Combat Team of the South Carolina Army National Guard in Afghanistan. 
   South Carolina is grateful for Judge Stilwell's years of dedicated public service to his State and country, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman Hunter. I appreciate your service here in Congress, and I appreciate you being the parent of a veteran who has served in Iraq. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, a bipartisan bill authored by Chairman IKE SKELTON. 
   Our men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces deserve the best medical care we can provide. As a 31-year veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard, with four sons currently serving in the military, I was greatly concerned when learning of the inadequate living conditions our Nation's wounded veterans have been made to endure at Walter Reed Medical Center. 
   My eldest son served for a year in Iraq and came under enemy fire twice. Had he been injured, I would have expected him to receive top-notch health care which should be provided to every soldier. 
   While Walter Reed is renowned as a world-class facility, recent management neglected to provide adequate care. We have the best military medicine in world history, saving more lives than ever before and providing for the maximum recovery for patients. 
   I know firsthand from Major David Rozelle of the successes at Walter Reed Army Hospital for our amputees, where dedicated staff members are so caringly effective helping our troops recover. In fact, Major Rozelle wrote an excellent book, ``Back in Action,'' the inspiring true story of the first amputee to return to active command in Iraq.  
   I am pleased Congress is coming together to improve the paperwork complications and ensure our military medical system remains the best there is. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill and provide America's brave, injured warriors the care they so deserve. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, what can brown do for you? You may be familiar with this phrase because it is the new UPS advertising slogan. During the past 100 years, UPS has done much for American workers and the American economy. 
   Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, UPS employs more than 427,000 people and is the world's largest package delivery company. It is incredible to know that this global behemoth began in Seattle, Washington, as a messenger service by a 19-year-old teenager who borrowed $100. 
   Throughout 2007, UPS is celebrating its milestone 100th birthday by hosting employee events around the world. The celebration in more than 55 U.S. cities will revolve around the arrival of a mobile centennial exhibit. I was pleased South Carolina's Second Congressional District had the opportunity to participate in UPS's success when the birthday celebration came to the Midlands, and Rich McArdle was introduced as the new district manager.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, right now Americans are feeling the pinch from rising gas prices, health care costs, and food prices. There has been a slowdown in the growth of our economy. In light of this, it seems downright wrong for Congress to be proposing a budget that will raise $683 billion in taxes, the largest tax increase in America's history. This will hit 116 million Americans, while spending billions more on wasteful government spending. 
   American taxpayers will have to foot this bill if we do not stand up and protect their wallets from the Washington tax and spend machine. I support the Republican Study Committee budget, a plan that meets the needs of the American people, balances the Federal budget by 2012, fixes the AMT, addresses the runaway entitlement crisis, and does not raise $1 of taxes on hardworking Americans. At a time when Americans pay too much at the pump, at the store, and at the hospital, it is wrong to ask them to pay more to the government. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, despite all the rhetoric about the State Children's Health Insurance Program which was created by Republicans, the fact remains that we all want low-income children to have access to health care. The only difference is that Republicans have stood by the principle of covering poor children first and not covering adults, illegal aliens, and those already covered by private insurance. 
   The President's SCHIP proposal provides an increase of $5 billion to cover those who are currently enrolled and the 500,000 children eligible but not yet covered. The billions more in spending that the Democrats are requesting will use taxpayer dollars to provide health care for individuals SCHIP was never meant to cover. Additionally, the Democrat proposal pulls the rug out from underneath these children when funding to the program is drastically cut in 2012. 
   When you take the Democrat legislation at face value and look past the political rhetoric and the demagoguery, the Republican proposal to promote SCHIP is best for families and children.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (GENERAL PETER PACE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Congressman Kline, thank you for your leadership tonight. And particularly I want to thank you for your family service, your service in the Marine Corps, your son's service, who is in the central front himself, having served in Iraq. We are very grateful for your family's service. 
   I am here tonight really indeed to point out the extraordinary service, 40 years of service, of General Peter Pace. I think it's extraordinary, and I hope the American people indeed look at this record of service. 
   The perspective that I am here is that I served 31 years myself in the Army National Guard, the Army Reserves. Really, the reason I served so long is because I have such great appreciation for the confidence and capabilities and the patriotism of the military of our country. 
   Additionally, I have the perspective of being a parent. I have four sons who are currently serving in the military of the United States. In particular, I am very grateful my oldest son served for 1 year in Iraq. I know firsthand of the bravery of our troops, the success of our troops in protecting America by keeping the terrorists and stopping them overseas. I am also grateful, I have a son who is a doctor in the Navy. We are very proud of his service, and his wife, and what they mean to our country. 
   Additionally, I've got a third son who is a signal officer who has served in Egypt with the Army National Guard, and a fourth son who has just joined the Army ROTC. He will be participating in the simultaneous drill program of the National Guard. 
   I give all my credit to my wife, Roxanne, for training these four guys. But I will point out that a reason that we have such faith in their service is because I have such faith in people like General Pace. I have entrusted my four sons to the leadership of the American military, which by every poll, every time it is done, I am afraid lawyers don't come out too well, politicians don't come out too well by standards, even the media suffers when it comes time to judge the level of perception of a profession, even ahead of the clergy is the military of the United States, and I believe they deserve it. 
   The final perspective I have as a Member of Congress. I have been here 5 years. I serve on the Armed Services Committee. The communities I represent, Fort Jackson, Paris Island, the Marine Air Station in Beaufort, the Beaufort Naval Hospital, but the greatest highlight that I've had is to visit with our troops overseas. 
   I have been to Iraq seven times. I have been to Afghanistan three times. I've visited probably 30 different countries. When we visit, we visit with the generals; we visit with the diplomats; we visit with the top American and foreign officials. But one of the real highlights is that we have the opportunity to go into a dining facility. And of course, they make it pretty simple for Members of Congress; they have a little flag identifying our home State. And we will go and we will find junior officers and enlisted personnel. And that's where you find out the extraordinary quality of the young people serving our country. Indeed, I believe it is the new Greatest Generation, people who don't whine, who understand that our Nation has been attacked. On 9/11, it was attacked. Beginning back in 1979, with the seizure of our embassy in Tehran,  we have had multiple attacks until we came to 9/11/01. And we've learned a lesson. And these young people are protecting our country. 
   Indeed, it was just three weeks ago today that I was in Baghdad and had the great opportunity to meet again with General David Petraeus. I have great faith in his leadership and what he's doing, protecting American families by creating a level of stability in Iraq. 
   Additionally, I had the privilege of visiting with the 218th Mechanized Infantry Brigade in Kabul, Afghanistan. This is the Army National Guard of South Carolina being very ably led by General Bob Livingston. 
   I was in that unit, Congressman, for 25 years, so I know firsthand of the capabilities of the person serving that unit as they are training the Afghan police and training the Afghan Army. A sad reminder today with the heinous homicide attack on the Afghan police; 35 policemen were killed yesterday. It is a chilling but a sad reminder that, indeed, the police that are being trained in Afghanistan and being trained in Iraq, the armies being trained in both of those countries, they have been the primary focus of attack of the terrorists because we are making progress in training people to provide stability in their own country. 
   Now, when I think of General Pace, it's really incredible that he has had a 40-year record of service. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1967. He was sworn in as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on September 30, 2005. And what is particularly meaningful is that he is the first Marine to serve in this position and also the first Marine to serve as Vice Chairman----

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, when a government program is not working, we have an obligation to fix it. This is not the case, however, with the Medicare prescription part D. In fact, part D is working well. 
   Just yesterday, the Medicare Prescription Education Network released a study showing that 80 percent of seniors enrolled in Medicare part D are satisfied with their coverage, and an 80 percent satisfaction rate is unprecedented for such an important and positive program. I am particularly pleased that a Blue Cross/Blue Shield call center assisting recipients with part D enrollment has been operating in the district I represent. 
   Moreover, government involvement would likely limit access to medications and restrict the development of new treatments. As USA Today recently editorialized: ``The public would be best served if the new Congress conducts an in-depth oversight to gather facts, rather than rushing through legislation within 100 hours to fix something that isn't necessarily broken.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to protect part D and vote against H.R. 4.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to bring attention to an anomaly in Federal higher education policy that I have been trying to fix. It has been Federal policy for many years to provide incentives to individuals to work in either high-growth professions, high-need areas, or both. These incentives have included a variety of loan forgiveness and loan cancellation programs. In fact, this chamber just created a new program for public sector employees last year. 
   The Federal Perkins Loan Program is a relatively small student loan program targeted at low-income individuals. It provides these individuals with low fixed-rate student loans. Additionally, the Federal Government is willing to cancel these particular loans for borrowers who work in high-growth professions and/or high-needs settings for at least 5 years. 
   Unfortunately, when my office examined the Federal Family Education Loan Program and the Direct Loan Program to see if these programs were treating their borrowers in a similar fashion, we found inconsistencies. One such inconsistency is the fact that individuals who borrow Perkins Loans, obtain a degree in speech-language pathology, and work in a Title I school for 5 years can seek to have a portion of their loan cancelled. The net result is an increase in individuals providing necessary services to children who require specialized care. However, both the FFEL and Direct Loan programs do not treat school-based speech-language pathologists like their special education teacher colleagues with whom they work side-by-side with as they provide valuable education services to children with disabilities. The teachers receive the incentive; the speech-language pathologists do not. 
   Four years after the re-authorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, while we are in the midst of a re-authorization of the No Child Left Behind Act, and while we know how critical the academic performance of children with disabilities affects a school or school district, I think it is unwise and unfair to deprive these children of the opportunity to receive the special education services they need to succeed. 
   I will work with my colleagues on the House Education and Labor Committee and our counterparts in the Senate to try to resolve this matter. I look forward to discusing this matter with them as we proceed to a conference with the Senate.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, in the past weeks terrorists with possible al Qaeda ties have attempted car bombings in London. Following these failed attempts, terrorists struck the Glasgow, Scotland airport. This attack by two doctors in a flaming Jeep Cherokee, doctors who have been sworn to protect life, were arrested for attempting mass murder by incineration of innocent civilians. 
   In addition, terrorists held children captive in a mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan; and an al Qaeda homicide bomber in Yemen murdered seven Spanish tourists and two Yemeni guides while they were visiting a temple of the ancient Queen of Sheba. 
   Recent events such as this should alert Americans that the global war on terrorism is a worldwide threat and that Iraq and Afghanistan remain the central front of the battle as claimed by bin Laden's spokesman Zawahiri. 
   Instead of practicing party politics, Congress should rely on the leadership of our military leaders such as General David Petraeus. By stopping terrorists overseas, our troops are protecting America's families at home.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Thank you, Congressman Hunter. Thank you for your leadership on behalf of our troops. And I appreciate that your son, Duncan, Jr., has served in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, just today we received President Bush's report to Congress on progress in Iraq. I find it sad for American families that on the same day the House is considering legislation that sets arbitrary deadlines and timelines for retreat, the provisions of H.R. 2956 mandate a hasty troop withdrawal starting within 120 days. 
   Additionally, the bill states that this withdrawal would be conducted in a safe and orderly way. Logistically, it would be impossible to remove our troops safely from Iraq in this short time line. Such rapid retreat would embolden the enemy, leaving American forces subject to ambushes, rockets and IED attacks. 
   As a 31-year veteran of the Army National Guard, and as a father of four sons in the military, my oldest an Iraq veteran, I especially understand the threats to our troops. In my seven visits to Iraq and three to Afghanistan, I've been continually inspired by the competence of our military leaders and the dedicated troops. 
   In today's edition of the Washington Post, the lead editorial makes the case against arbitrary withdrawal. It states, ``The generals who have devised a new strategy believe they are making faithful progress. Before Congress begins managing rotation schedules and ordering withdrawals, it should at least give those generals the months they ask for to see whether their strategy can offer some new hope.'' 
   Additionally, al Qaeda has stated that Iraq is the central front in the global war on terrorism. And I believe to withdraw our troops before their mission is complete would invite future attacks at home. The Washington Post editorial states, ``Advocates of withdrawal would like to believe that Afghanistan is now a central front in the war on terror, but Iraq is not; believing that doesn't make sense.'' 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops. We will never forget September the 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are today considering the ``Brigadier General Francis Marion Memorial Act''. It is with the support of the entire South Carolina delegation that I reintroduced this legislation in January. 
   Brigadier General Francis Marion well represented the State of South Carolina and our fledgling Nation with his brave service in the Revolutionary War. As a South Carolinian, I am proud his legacy has been honored with a memorial park in Washington, DC. Yet, I feel strongly that a statue of the ``Swamp Fox'' should be erected on its premises. Passage of this bill is a crucial first step in making this dream a reality. 
   I would specifically like to thank Ken Driggers and Nancy Stone-Collum of the Palmetto Conservation Foundation. Additionally, I would like to thank the South Carolina Humanities Council for supporting John McCabe, the historian who originally had the vision to honor the ``Swamp Fox.'' John created the Francis Marion Park Project to assist with fundraising and planning once this bill is enacted. The National Park Service also deserves recognition for their guidance through this important process. 
   The House of Representatives originally passed this bill in the 109th Congress, yet it failed to be considered by the Senate. It is my hope we can enact this legislation during the 110th Congress and erect a memorial befitting General Marion. 
   Today I was presented a copy of The South Carolina Encyclopedia, edited by the noted historian Walter Edgar. The book is a project of The Humanities Council, ably led by Director Randy Akers. Presenting the book was Bob Hazel of West Columbia who is former Council Board Chair who was elected to the board of the Federation of State Humanities Councils. South Carolina was the site of more battles and skirmishes than any other province during the American Revolution. 
   General Francis Marion is a significant entry in the encyclopedia with highlights beginning on page 591:  
   Marion, Francis (1732-1792). Soldier. Marion, of Huguenot descent, was born in St. John's Berkley Parish, the youngest of six children born to Gabriel Marion and Esther Cordes. A planter, Marion in 1773 built his home, Pond Bluff, about four miles south of Eutaw Springs, a site now beneath the waters of Lake Marion. He commenced his military career in the parish militia in 1756 and joined the campaigns against the Cherokees (1759-1761), rising to the rank of first lieutenant. Having served in local offices, he was elected in 1775 to the First Provincial Congress. Commissioned a captain in the state's Second Regiment in June, he participated in the capture of Fort Johnson in September. As a major, Marion distinguished himself at the Battle of Sullivan's Island (June 1776), after which he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the Continental army. 
   With a militia commission as a brigadier general, Marion organized a partisan force in the Pee Dee region. Between August and December 1780, in an otherwise dismal period for America, Marion gained national recognition for his actions at the Great Savannah (August 20), Blue Savannah (September 4), Black Mingo (September 29), Tearcoat Swamp (October 26), Georgetown (November 15), and Halfway Swamp (December 12-13). While some counts place the number of ``Marion's Men'' at more than two thousand, his band generally consisted of considerably fewer than that and included Continentals. Marion's nickname, the ``Swamp Fox,'' reportedly came from the infamous British officer Banastre Tarleton, who, unable to snare Marion, called him a ``damned old fox'' and swore that ``the devil himself could not catch him.'' 
   Marion's small-scale hit-and-run tactics disrupted supply lines, intercepted communications, and hampered the enemy considerably. In December 1780 he established a camp on Snow's Island between Pee Dee and Lynches Rivers and Clark's Creek. Conditions improved by the spring of 1781, when Marion became a vital part of General Nathanael Greene's combined operations in South Carolina. In 1781 Marion's troops participated in the battles at Fort Watson (April 23), Fort Motte (May 12), Quinby Bridge (July 17), Parker's Ferry (August 13) and Eutaw Springs (September 8). 
   After a penniless Marion, whose plantation had been ruined, was awarded a gold medal, a full Continental colonelcy, and command of Fort Johnson in Charleston harbor. He served in the S.C. Senate in 1783-1786, 1791, and 1792-1794 and was elected to the 1790 state constitutional convention.  
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 497.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (IN RECOGNITION OF MONGOLIAN AMBASSADOR RAVDAN BOLD -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of Ravdan Bold, Ambassador of Mongolia to the United States. Ambassador Bold is retiring as Mongolia's emissary to the United States, and I want to thank him for his service on behalf of the Mongolian people. 
   As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and co-chair of the Mongolia Caucus, I've had the pleasure of getting to know Ambassador Bold over the past few years. During his tenure, America celebrated the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our countries. He is an honest and capable public servant whose work here in Washington has been vital to the growth of democracy in Mongolia. 
   Mongolia remains a strong and strategic partner of the United States. Mongolian troops proudly serve in Liberia, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Iraq. I'm particularly grateful for Mongolia's continued support of our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan as the central front in the larger global war on terrorism, and I look forward to working with the future ambassador to strengthen this partnership. 
   I wish Ambassador Bold; his wife, Oyuum; his two daughters, Buyandelger and Buyanjargal, all the best in the years to come. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September the 11th.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (RECOGNIZING THE RELIGIOUS AND HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FESTIVAL OF DIWALI -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the proud sponsor of House Resolution 747, I am pleased that this legislation recognizing the religious and historical significance of the festival of Diwali has been brought to the floor today for consideration. 
   Celebrated by the people of India, the Indian Diaspora and the nearly two million Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains who call America their home, the Diwali festival is a five day event held in the fall that celebrates the values of kinship, knowledge, and goodness. It signifies the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness. This is commonly represented by individuals lighting oil lamps and placing them outside their homes. 
   My resolution acknowledges the international, religious, and historical importance of the festival of Diwali as well as the religious diversity in India, the United States, and throughout the world. It shows our support for the strong and growing partnership and dialogue in international efforts between the United States and India. Lastly, it recognizes the importance of Indian Americans--a strong and vibrant immigrant community. 
   As co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, as well as a lifelong supporter and admirer of the Indian American community, I am grateful for the opportunity to show my appreciation. My father served in India during WorId War II, and he told me how entrepreneurial and competent the people of India are. I call on my colleagues here in the House of Representatives to do the same for the citizens of India, a strategic and economic ally. 
   I would like to commend Ishani Chowdhury with the Hindu American Foundation, my Chief of Staff Dino Teppara, my Legislative Assistant Paul Callahan, and Arshi Siddiqui with Speaker NANCY PELOSI's office for their cooperation and dedication in bringing this important resolution to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT EDWARD PHILPOT -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today, with great sympathy, in honor of the memory of Sergeant Edward Philpot of South Carolina National Guard's 218th Brigade Combat Team. Sergeant Philpot and his fellow soldiers were traveling as a convoy near Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, last Tuesday when his Humvee accidentally went off the road. 
   Sergeant Philpot is the first member of the 218th, my former National Guard Brigade, to lose his life while serving in Afghanistan. His sacrifice is a reminder of the courage and dedication to duty shared by so many of our fellow Americans. We must never forget the immense sacrifices these brave men and women are making to defend freedom and to protect American families. 
   My thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Philpot's wife, Stephanie; their three daughters; his parents, Ottas and Willa; and his entire family, friends, and fellow soldiers who continue to defend our country overseas. His sacrifice is a testament to the love for his country, his family, and his fellow soldiers.  
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

<DOCNO>Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. (PRIME MINISTER SINGH'S MAJORITY REMAINS -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, yesterday India's Parliament held a confidence vote on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's majority coalition. Prime Minister Singh's majority prevailed. This is good news for the U.S.-India civilian nuclear agreement that is currently under consideration by the International Atomic Energy Agency and Nuclear Suppliers Group. 
   A minority party of the Indian Parliament called for the vote in opposition to Prime Minister Singh's decision to send the nuclear agreement to the IAEA for consideration. Yesterday's victory provides a political mandate for the agreement between the United States and India which will strengthen our partnership as well as further the advancement of nuclear energy, which is good jobs and stable power for the people of India. 
   As the citizens of my home State of South Carolina know, nuclear energy is a clean and renewable energy source. For over 30 years, over 50 percent of electricity generated in our State has come from nuclear power. 
   As a long-time supporter of the civilian nuclear agreement, I am grateful that we will continue to step closer to having the agreement implemented. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, yesterday, General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker presented their reports to Congress. Their testimonies were professional, fact-driven accounts, and I am extremely grateful for their service. 
   During the hearing, I summarized al Qaeda spokesman Zawahiri, who has outlined his plan for Iraq. The first stage, expel the Americans from Iraq. The second stage, establish authority in Iraq. The third stage, extend the jihad wave to the secular nations neighboring Iraq. And the fourth stage, the clash with Israel and extermination of the people of Israel. 
   Ambassador Crocker acknowledged these goals, but said al Qaeda may not follow this timeline. They may try to attack America as soon as possible. 
   The Ambassador also agreed al Qaeda would not be satisfied with simply the destruction of the people of Israel. 
   We should remember what is at stake in Iraq. A failure in Iraq, a defeat at the hands of these extremists, would mean a failed state, a breeding ground for extremists. It is the scenario we saw in Afghanistan prior to 9/11. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, last week three Americans, along with a dozen Colombian hostages held by FARC terrorists, were rescued by an elite team of Colombian soldiers. Included in the hostages was Ingrid Betancourt, a former candidate for president of Colombia; and three U.S. contractors, Keith Stansel, Marc Gonsalves, and Thomas Howes. 
   President Alvaro Uribe, Ambassador Carolina Barco, and the Colombia military are to be commended for this extraordinary and well-planned rescue. 
   I am grateful for the incredible effort the Colombian government has made to strike back at the FARC terrorist rebels and to bring greater stability and security to their country. 
   I have visited Colombia, two of my sons were exchange students in Cali, and I know firsthand the hard work necessary to curb the drug trade, terrorist activity, and build Colombia's economy. America has been working to build a stronger strategic partnership with the people of Colombia for economic prosperity, led by U.S. Ambassador William Brownfield. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week Tony Snow stepped down as White House press secretary. Mr. Snow, a graduate of Davidson College in North Carolina, has served the President and his Nation with distinction, and I wish to thank him for his hard work and dedication. 
   As a speech writer in the first Bush administration and as a television and radio personality, Tony established a reputation for common sense and measured thinking. As White House press secretary, he has led a professional team of communications personnel during a time when our country faces many difficult challenges. President Bush could not have asked for a stronger spokesperson. His forthright and genuine approach to his job has earned Tony Snow the respect and admiration of his peers in the political arena as well as the media. We wish him and his family much health and happiness as they embark upon the next chapter of their lives. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you as a grateful veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard, and I have four sons currently serving in the military. You can imagine my concern upon learning of the dire conditions our Nation's wounded service members have recently been made to endure. My appreciation for our troops is as a member of the Armed Services Committee, a veteran and as a parent who expects the best for the courageous troops who protect American families. 
   While Walter Reed Medical Center is renowned as a world-class facility, recent management neglected to provide adequate care. I appreciate Defense Secretary Robert Gates' decisive action in dealing with this disturbing situation. I was honored to attend President Bush's speech earlier this week to the American Legion where he announced a creation of a bipartisan commission to review military and veterans' care. 
   We in Congress are committed to ensuring our military heroes are well cared for and receive the medical attention they deserve. 
   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.
