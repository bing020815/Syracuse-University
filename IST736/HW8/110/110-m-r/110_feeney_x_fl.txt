<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   I would say this bill tonight proves at least two maxims about Congress: One is that we have two speeds: zero and that we overreact; and the other is that the law of unintended consequences means that often the adverse or the harmful consequences of the things we do in Congress are much more meaningful than the positive things that we would like to accomplish. 
   Let me give one example. Back in the early sixties and seventies and eighties, and all the way through the nineties, Madam Chairman, there were lots of complaints that low- and middle-income people, especially minorities, didn't have access to loans, that they didn't get the same opportunity that other people of above-modest means had to own a home in America. And there were complaints, and there were all sorts of animosity, to use the Chairman's word from a few minutes ago, towards lenders for being discriminatory against low- and middle-income people again, especially minorities. 
   So the Community Redevelopment Act was enacted in 1977, and at that time one of the things that Congress had the power to do was to oversee and look at every single lender in America in order to determine that they were aggressively making loans in low and poor and minority neighborhoods so that we could measure those institutions so we could insist that there be more access to homeownership. 
   We got exactly what we asked for, and part of that was the subprime loan crisis. And part of that was zero-document loans where people could literally line up without any proof of income. Part of that was instead of making it a 70-percent loan or 75-percent loan, which almost never fails, making 100-percent, or 110-percent loans. Part of that was teaser interest rates to get people into a home at 3 percent, which they could afford to make an $800 or $900 a month payment, and when that teaser rate readjusted to 7 or 8 or 9 percent, all of a sudden what used to be an $800 payment became a $2,000-a-month payment, and they couldn't make it. They got exactly what we anticipated. 
   Countrywide is now bankrupt. Countrywide in 2005 got the Best in Minority Lending Award from the Lending Industry Diversity Conference. This Congress had great intentions. We wanted to make more money available so that everybody could have the American Dream. In fact, as of 2 years ago, America had an all-time high, approaching 69 percent of Americans that owned their own homes. That's great. 
   The truth of the matter is because of easy money from the Feds, because of investor imprudence, because of greedy Wall Street speculators, we have now got a crisis because of a bubble that is collapsing. 
   Who is being bailed out by this bill? The $15 billion will eventually end up, after it goes to the cities and counties, in the pockets of the investors and holders of these mortgages that went seeking higher profits that put people in homes that they couldn't afford. We are doing exactly what economists want us not to do: creating a moral hazard. It is going to make it more likely, rather than less, that foolish loans are made in the future.

   Mr. FEENEY. I didn't say what the chairman said I said. I said that it has been the policy of many in this Congress for about 40 years now to criticize lenders all over the spectrum for not pushing more money into low- and moderate-income areas. I think the chairman will agree with me.

   Mr. FEENEY. I want to thank Ranking Member Hall and Chairman Gordon and, as they pointed out, all of the staff on both sides that made possible a bipartisan bill that got unanimous support in the committee. 
   I also want to suggest that terrific staff work on both sides and transparency and openness in the process is sort of a model that this Congress ought to try to emulate more often, and I want to thank, again, Chairman Gordon and Chairman Udall for doing that. 
   By the way, this is likely to be, since he's not running for reelection, Chairman Udall's last reauthorization as a House Member. He has been a champion on space issues. He's been a great friend and a delight to work with, and I know that he will continue to be a champion for space and aeronautics. And so I really appreciated the chance to work with you. 
   And following me I think at some point will be Congressman Weldon, my neighbor to the south. We share the different assets of Kennedy Space Center, Patrick Air Force Base, and Congressman Weldon will not be running for office again anytime soon, at least not the House. We appreciate Dave Weldon's leadership. He's been a terrific advocate for space in general and Kennedy Space Center and human spaceflight in specific. 
   So it's been terrific to work with two great leaders that will not be working with us in all likelihood next year. 
   NASA was created in response to the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik in 1957. The space age had begun. Fifty years have now passed. America is still the world's preeminent spacefaring Nation. NASA helped lead us to that status. 
   Today, we build on that foundation. We have laid out a comprehensive blueprint for sustaining a healthy and vigorous NASA during the next administration, and as Chairman Gordon pointed out, we don't know who the next President will be. We don't know who their next NASA administrator will be, but the starting point for the next administration's space program has been designed right here in the House of Representatives, thanks to the leadership of the people that you are hearing from. 
   Considerable care has been devoted to all elements of NASA's portfolio, human spaceflight, earth and space sciences, and aeronautics. I look forward to continued success and excellence in all of these endeavors. Each success sustains America's technical prowess and brings enormous prestige to the American people. 
   Because I represent the Kennedy Space Center, I want to particularly note this bill's unambiguous endorsement of America's human spaceflight program. By the way, all of our human spaceflight program has an international component to it. 
   Five years ago, America was stunned by the loss of the Shuttle Columbia. We had to re-examine our objectives for human spaceflight and articulate a more sustainable vision for our future spacefaring. We have done so, and this bill continues that progress by providing much-needed stability, on a bipartisan basis, in our strategy and architecture for human spaceflight. 
   The shuttle has resumed flight. We are having a successful mission as we speak today. We will complete the International Space Station and then strive to utilize its enormous potential. And we will also set forth to explore beyond lower orbit, starting with the moon and then beyond, for the future of humankind. 
   These are ambitious goals, but Americans are a strong, optimistic people willing to take up and meet any challenge. And as this bill highlights, America invites others throughout the world to join us in this journey. It is done on behalf of all mankind. 
   NASA's human space exploration and satellite programs publicly demonstrate America's spacefaring prowess. Other Nations are striving to achieve what America has already accomplished. 
   In prior generations, mastery of the sea and air brought global power and prestige. Today, such power and respect accrues to those mastering space. This bill sustains America's prowess in space, and I urge its passage.

   Mr. FEENEY. I thank Ranking Member Hall, and I thank Chairman Gordon for this amendment. I did want to take a moment or two to point out a very important aspect of this manager's amendment. It directs the White House Office of Science and Technology to establish an interagency committee to study issues related to locating a commercial space launch range in close proximity to a Federal launch range. 
   In order to have viable commercial launch operations in the United States, effective coordination and cooperation must exist between potential commercial ranges and existing Federal ranges. Federal agencies have to endeavor to assist and not choke off commercial space ranges. The interagency committee will focus on these agencies and the importance of this issue. 
   Let me say that for the last 50 years, space has been really a bipolar world. Either you were a part of the former Soviet orbit and space power, or you were part of the American-led free nations in space power. 
   Today it is a very different world. I just recently came back from the first ever global space summit in Beijing, China, where over 15 nations were represented, some six or seven major spacefaring powers. It is not just people that have to come ask the United States to get permission to get commercial opportunities in space today. There are some 50 different international agreements, many of which don't even involve the United States of America. 
   In some ways, our competitors are beating us to the punch in commercial launch opportunities. It is not just bad for business. Let me say, for example, the Chinese have launched over 33 satellites from other countries. They are doing this to help countries we would consider troublesome, for example, Venezuela or Nigeria. They are also using it to buy influence with our friends, like Japan or Brazil. America cannot shoot itself in the foot in developing and maintaining our historic leadership in commercial opportunities any more than we can give up predominance in the civilian side of human space exploration. 
   And so this manager's amendment contains a very important aspect. I sincerely applaud the chairman and others, including John Culberson, for advocating for this specific piece of the manager's amendment.

   Mr. FEENEY. Madam Chairman, on behalf of this amendment, as Congressman Rohrabacher explained earlier, this amendment is a sense of the Congress provision stating the U.S. should seek to obtain commitments for cooperation from other nations in the search for near-Earth objects. 
   Mr. Rohrabacher has been an ardent advocate in our committee for the potential threat posed by asteroids and comets having orbits that bring them close to Earth and the devastation they could create should one of them impact us. 
   By the way, I have sat through hearings, along with Congressman Udall and others, and we have incredibly sophisticated technology and capabilities one day to protect Earth if we know we are going to be targeted by an asteroid or comet, for example. In fact, the testimony was that some 99 percent of the resources today globally to prepare for this eventuality are American tax dollars. It seems seeking cooperation on behalf of all humankind only makes sense. 
   Our committee held a highly informative set of hearings on near-Earth objects late last fall. It is clear to me that the entire world community needs to be much more vigilant in finding, tracking and characterizing near-Earth objects and developing deflection capabilities and technologies. 
   I urge support for this amendment.

   With that, I would urge my colleagues to support the Rohrabacher amendment.

   Mr. FEENEY. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 
   I do not rise in opposition to the amendment. I should say I have no objection to the amendment. I have read it very carefully, and I appreciate the language ``when appropriate.'' Of course, it would be the United States that determined, in my view, when international confidence-building measures would be appropriate. 
   I should say there are times when, for example, sharing sensitive technologies with certain countries may be inappropriate, if we don't have confidence what they may use those technologies for or what their long-term intentions are. On the other hand, there are things we ought to clearly explore sharing with every spacefaring Nation; for example, a common docking device with the Shuttle, perhaps, so any nation in the event of emergency may be able to help rescue our astronauts. 
   I should also suggest, as I talked about earlier, that space is developing. It is no longer a bipolar world. Historically, people have out of habit and out of practicality had to rely on asking the U.S. if they wanted to send a satellite, for example, into orbit, to see whether or not that satellite would safely orbit the Earth without colliding into another country's satellite. That is not true because of any international treaty or convention. Anybody can send anything into space. The truth is, in terms of space law, we have really sort of an international anarchy, just as originally when we with had travel by navy or by commerce through the seas and ultimately international air travel. 
   There has to be some way to communicate ultimately in terms of maintaining space traffic. Stopping the creation of space junk or debris that would threaten all peacefaring uses of space would be another example of appropriate times the U.S. should lead in confidence-building measures to advance long-term initiatives for international cooperation. 
   With that, again, I have no objection to the amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FEENEY. Madam Chairman, I have carefully read the amendment, and while I may not press my objection, I will state that the amendment, in my view, is unnecessary, that NASA has a policy in place that goes to the very same points expressed in the amendment, and perhaps unintentionally this amendment implies that NASA cannot be trusted to factually in an unbiased manner publicize research results conducted by agency scientists. 
   Several years ago, NASA's Public Affairs Office was accused with inappropriately choosing which NASA scientists participated in specific interviews with the press. Once this interference was brought to NASA Administrator Michael Griffin's attention, he quickly and forcefully intervened, assuring Congress, NASA researchers and employees, and the public that NASA will never seek to censor agency scientists. 
   In a letter dated March 30, 2006, and this issue has been addressed over and over again, addressed to former Science Committee Chairman Sherry Boehlert, Mr. Griffin stated, ``I will not tolerate any policy or action where any NASA employee may filter, alter or  censor scientific findings and facts, and I want to reaffirm that NASA has always been and will continue to be committed to open scientific and technical inquiry and dialogue with the public.'' 
   Mr. Griffin then formed a policy development team comprised of NASA employees with science, legal and public affairs backgrounds to review existing policies, identify ways to improve them, and develop agency practices to maintain NASA's commitment for full and open discourse on scientific, technical and safety issues. The result of their work was a series of revisions to 14 Code of Federal Regulations, section 1213, which guides the agency's public affairs policies, which all Americans can visit. 
   Mr. Griffin then formed a policy development team comprised of NASA employees with science, legal and public affairs backgrounds to review existing policies, identify ways to improve them, and develop agency practices to maintain NASA's commitment for full and open discourse on scientific, technical and safety issues. The results of their work was a series of revisions to 14 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations), Section 1213, which guides the agency's public affairs policies. 
   More recently, the NASA Office of Inspector General concluded an investigation in response to a Congressional inquiry dating back to 2006, requesting a formal investigation about ``political interference'' by NASA public affairs officials. 
   The IG's investigation found that ``..... during the fall of 2004 through early 2006, the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs managed the topic of climate change in a manner that reduced, marginalized, or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public through those particular media over which the Office of Public Affairs had control. We also concluded that the climate change editorial decisions were localized within the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs; we found no credible evidence suggesting that senior NASA or Administration officials directed the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs to minimize information related to climate change. To the contrary, we found that once NASA leadership within the Office of the Administrator were made aware of the scope of the conflict between the Office of Public Affairs and scientists working on climate change, they aggressively implemented new policies with a view toward improved processes in editorial decision-making relating to scientific public affairs matters.'' 
   The IG's report also stated: ``With respect to NASA's climate change research activities, we found no evidence indicating that NASA blocked or interfered with the actual research activities of its climate change scientists ..... (W)e found that NASA systematically distributed its technical climate change research throughout the scientific community and otherwise made it available through a variety of specialized forums, such as scientific journals, professional conferences, and public appearances by NASA scientists.'' 
   Additionally, a May 2007 GAO report found ``that NASA policies are generally clear and should help facilitate the dissemination of research results. For example, NASA's recently revised media policy clearly defines the roles and responsibilities for managers, researchers, and public affairs staff; details steps in the process for dissemination via press releases and interviews; and describes a process to resolve disputes about agency decisions regarding press releases.'' 
   In closing, while I have no objection to the gentleman's (Mr. Wu) amendment, I don't want Members to surmise that NASA science findings are being manipulated by agency management. That is not what the NASA IG, or GAO reports found. 
   Madam Chairman, I don't specifically object to the language of this amendment, because I think it is consistent with NASA policy and Michael Griffin's great efforts to explain to the public that he will insist and has insisted on this policy. But I will remind all of us that a May 2007 GAO report found ``NASA policies are generally clear and should help facilitate the dissemination of research results. For example, NASA's recently revised media policy clearly defines the roles and responsibilities for managers, researchers, and public affairs staff, details steps in the process for dissemination of press releases and interviews, and describes a process to resolve disputes about agency decisions regarding press releases.'' 
   In closing, while I do not object to Mr. Wu's amendment, I don't want Members to surmise that NASA science findings are being manipulated by current agency management. That is not what NASA, IG, or GAO reports found. 
   Again, we have no objection to the language that Mr. Wu offers. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FEENEY. I don't know whether, candidly, I support or oppose the amendment, because it has some very technical effects in its interplay with other portions of Federal statutes and requirements and regulation. 
   Just one of the many questions I have would be that it seems, as I read the amendment, that it establishes different conditions on contracting fuel versus those established in section 526. So I guess one of my questions, maybe the most important, since we don't have a lot of time, do the conditions in your amendment supplant the greenhouse gas emission criteria found in 526, or do they remain in effect, and are these conditions in addition to the 526 regulations?

   Mr. FEENEY. I thank the gentleman. 
   This amendment may be very positive. The problem is that it conflicts with other statutes and regulations. It is very complicated as we read it. 
   What my friend says is a clarifying amendment actually creates a lot more ambiguity in our minds about the interplay of these different standards. 
   I talked about the interplay with 526, and I still don't know which set of rules will govern, the set of rules in the gentleman's amendment or section 526. 
   We also seem to cite a section of the Energy Independence and Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 17142. There is currently no section 526(a) nor a 42 U.S.C. 17142(a) in the law, and yet I believe the gentleman's amendment cites these sections, as I read it, that do not exist in current law. 
   I have a concern about the amendment's intention. Do you want to create an exemption under 526 for generally available fuel that is not predominantly produced from a nonconventional petroleum source, or does it create a broader exemption for all alternative or synthetic fuels as referenced in section 526? 
   So I guess I have a number of very complex questions. I wish this is something we might have dealt with in committee where we have a number of experts, both members and staff. While I don't know that I object, it is because I just don't understand all of the different regulations and statutes and the interplay, and this seems to be one more additional attempt at dealing with whether NASA can or can't do things, and I really have no idea whether this is in addition to, or whether it is consistent with, or whether it may be mutually exclusive with provisions in other portions of the law, and I wish we could spend some time with technical staff to iron out these difficulties. 
   With that, having expressed concern and not necessarily opposing the amendment because I don't really understand all of the ways it will be enforced given other statutes and regulations.

   Mr. FEENEY. I appreciate the gentleman's amendment. I think it is very well-intentioned. I do not intend to object to the language. I do believe it is designed to help NASA distribute its space images and multimedia records to the public. I share that goal; but I should say that I think this amendment is superfluous. I think it is already contained in the bill language itself. Now superfluity is not necessarily an awful thing. Sometimes the best thing we do here is just to repeat what we have already done, and it probably does very little harm. 
   But I would point out that section 407 clearly instructs NASA to develop a plan, to identify opportunities to leverage the very same technologies Mr. Arcuri references in his amendment. 
   The gentleman's amendment seeks NASA to develop a plan and examine the feasibility to ``broadcast electronically, including via the Internet.'' The language in the bill talks about already ``rapidly delivering the content through extended high bandwidth communications networks.'' 
   So I think Mr. Arcuri's concerns are already adequately addressed in the bill. I would simply argue that they are unnecessary. Having said that, I would not object to them being included. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FEENEY. I think all of us want to know the cost of every government project. That certainly includes Constellation. 
   As Mr. Wu pointed out, on behalf of Mr. DeFazio, the GAO just gave us a very comprehensive report. We had a full hearing on the matter of the progress of the Constellation program. 
   I can tell you that there are some 56 annual reports that NASA has to give to Congress, and dozens of others that it has to give to other agencies, regulatory agencies and other governmental agencies. This is not a request that NASA add to their 100 or 150 reports an additional report. It's asking CBO to take an outside look. And I'm never opposed to transparency in government, especially cost. 
   I should point out that the amendment singles out Project Constellation for particular scrutiny. Project Constellation is our follow up to the Space Shuttle Human Space Flight Program which is clearly a top priority for NASA, and has been established in this Congress as a top priority. 
   The shuttle will be retired roughly at the end of this decade. Without Constellation, NASA will have no choice but to buy assets from other nations if we intend to maintain access to our own international space station. 
   We're going to be dependent on the Russians right now under a very bad plan, but the only plan we have for 5 years. Without Constellation, all hopes of accessing, through American capabilities, the international space station or venturing the moon or other planets or asteroids will simply disappear. 
   Not all of our colleagues pay as much attention as those of us that are on the floor here today to space. I think one of our colleagues recently suggested that the first manned lunar outpost in space be named after Neil Armstrong, the great first American ever on the Moon. 
   My question, in response, was why would the Chinese, who are going to get back to the Moon before us, give us permission to name their lunar outpost after an American? We've got to remind our colleagues that this is now an internationally competitive environment in more ways than one. 
   Constellation is a technology-driven program that will achieve its initial operational capability roughly in the Year 2015, hopefully earlier. NASA has worked hard to maintain their schedule. They give us reports every day. We had a GAO report. 
   Having said that, if the gentleman feels compelled to support the DeFazio amendment, and we have one additional report on the budgetary status, I don't have any objection to transparency in government. But at some point you're doing so many reports that it's hard to send people back to the moon if you're doing 150 or 200 reports for Congress and other agencies and spending all your time filling out paperwork. 
   These are really bright engineers. I want to get into the business of flying rockets and not doing more paperwork. 
   With that, I would yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FEENEY. Madam Chairman, not only am I not in opposition, but I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically endorse the Harman-Ehlers amendment. And I should point out as she mentions the trouble in getting new people into the workforce and an aging and retiring workforce. By the way, one of those young engineers that works in the space field is my wife, and she remains eternally young. But she's the exception. 
   I've talked extensively about the competition, both civilian and commercial, coming from China. I can tell you that I recently visited CASC, which is the Chinese Civilian and Commercial Space Agency. They have 160,000 employees. About half of those are dedicated to space. And we asked the question, what the average age, because we were startled by the engineering manager that addressed us on their program, what the average age of the managers were in the Engineering Department. The average age of the managers was 40. We were stunned. 
   We asked, what's the average age of your engineers that are doing space work. And the answer is 30. 
   Madam Chairman, nothing could be more important to science and technology. 
   And with that, I want to yield the balance of my time, to, as the gentlelady said, a great advocate for science and space and technology, and for young people getting into these fields, Mr. Ehlers.

NASA does a great deal to incentivize education programs for women engineers and scientists, but a lot of us Americans remember exactly where we were the moment that Ms. McAuliffe and her colleagues perished. It reminds all of us that human space flight is an inherently risky venture and especially for teachers throughout America and school children who were contemporaries of the Challenger disaster.

   Mr. FEENEY. Madam Chairman, I will not necessarily oppose this amendment. I will point out that I think the amendment provides some confusing requirements on NASA. 
   On the one hand, for example, it says, ``The administrator shall work to ensure that NASA's policies on the sharing of climate-related data respond to the recommendations of the Government Accountability Office report on climate change research and data-sharing policies.'' 
   But then the amendment goes on to direct the administrator to also align the agency's policies to recommendations contained in a National Academy report on Earth Science Applications and ``other relevant National Academy reports.'' 
   It doesn't seem to provide any discretion at NASA to determine amongst a whole bevy or multitude of academy reports from all over the place as to which ones are meritorious or more meritorious than others. There seems to be some confusion here in terms of what NASA ought to determine. 
   Most importantly, I think we want NASA to make determinations based on good science. That's what they've been charged with. NASA has long been a leader in promoting both domestically and internationally the full and open access to science data to all. 
   I would also point out that NASA data and information are accessible to the public, on the Web through the NASA Web site. 
   And finally, we've already discussed the fact that NASA has a set of policies about data and information sharing that I think are comprehensive and are working today quite well. 
   With that, I would indicate again that I have no objection to the language; although I do think it creates some ambiguity and confusion.

<DOCNO>Mr. FEENEY. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. I guess at the outset, I'd like, if she would yield, to ask my friend a question because, as I understand the amendment, what it does is to require NASA to contract with a company or companies that have a demonstrated ability to do business and to work with certain companies. Right now, the language gives essentially a requirement that we find small businesses that we can cooperate and work with. I think all of us support that. 
   I don't understand the language in her amendment. It will substitute for small business, substitute the language in quotes, small, minority-owned and women-owned businesses, end of quote; is that conjunctive or disjunctive? If a company has a great record, for example, in its area of working with minority-owned businesses or women-owned businesses or small businesses or, for example, if a contractor has one subcontractor, do they have to demonstrate that they will be able to have three different contractors, one that's a small business, one that's a minority-owned, and one that's a women-owned business? 
   If it's a disjunctive, if they can demonstrate ability really to reach out to smaller companies or minority or women, that's terrific, but it may present a real host of problems if it is conjunctive. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend to explain whether it's disjunctive or conjunctive.

   Mr. FEENEY. Reclaiming my time, I should point out that the minority happily worked on a manager's amendment, where we enthusiastically endorsed the concept that the administrator ought to contract with external organizations to facilitate new technologies for NASA to new businesses. 
   And we were sort of provided this at the last moment. We don't really have a chance to examine what the effects are. There may be a contractor out there that only has one subcontractor. There may not be specific types of the businesses. 
   Though I don't necessarily oppose the amendment, I would suggest that there may be practical problems depending on how this becomes interpreted, and suddenly, we're adding additional requirements. 
   I think all of us want to help women-owned businesses. We've already done a scholarship today. I think minority-owned businesses are part of Federal contracting law. I think this specific language was designed to help all small businesses, without regard to what specific gender or ethnicity or background they had. We certainly support assistance in helping recently returned or long-standing veterans organizations. 
   We don't object to the intent of the gentlelady's amendment. I guess we have some real concerns as a practical matter. Small contractors, we're trying to encourage, by the way, NASA not just to pick the Goliaths that then get to divvy out the work. We're trying to encourage NASA to get down and help do business directly with small contractors that are capable. 
   This may become impossible for small businesses to comply with if they only had one or two contracts and one or two subs. 
   So, with that, I will not oppose the amendment. I will be happy to yield to my friend to respond.

   Mr. FEENEY. Reclaiming my time, I understand the gentlelady's intent, and actually, I agree with her, given the explanation. 
   I mean, we've got a NASA Web site. NASA does data sharing. Hopefully, they don't exclude anybody that the gentlelady's talking about. I'm not sure what requirements that contractors that have access to NASA data, that may not be publicly shared, have now got to do that they're not doing. But with that, sometimes we just hope that the details get worked out later in the process, as Chairman Gordon has already reminded me earlier today. 
   With that, I will not oppose the amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Oregon for his resolution. I want to rise today in support of House Resolution 421, which honors the accomplishments of the so-called Mercury 13 women whose efforts in the early 1960s demonstrated the capabilities of American women to undertake human space exploration. 
   At a time when there were many prejudices against women, the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, New Mexico, began testing female pilots to undertake human exploration of space under the same rigorous, physical and psychological standards as NASA's male astronauts. 
   In 1960, the first of the Mercury 13, Geraldyn ``Jerrie'' Cobb went to Lovelace Clinic, and by the end of 1961, 13 women had successfully completed this rigorous training. Following their testing program, the 13 women were prepared to continue their contributions to America's space program at the Naval School of Aviation Medicine in Pensacola, Florida and undergo advanced aeromedical examinations using jet aircraft and military equipment, but their program was canceled. 
   The careers and accomplishments of these great American women served as an inspiration for many other young women that followed in their careers in aviation, astronautics, science and engineering. 
   This resolution recognizes the accomplishments of Myrtle Cagle, Geraldyn ``Jerrie'' Cobb, Jan Dietrich, Marion Dietrich, Mary Wallace ``Wally'' Funk, Jane Briggs Hart, Jean Hixson, Gene Nora, Stumbough Jessen, Irene Leverton, Sarah Lee, Gorelick Ratley, Bernice Trimble Steadman, Geraldine ``Jerri'' Sloan Truhill, and Rhea Hurrle Allison Woltman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 421 and again thank the gentleman from Oregon.

I should say since that Mercury 13 program, there have been 34 women that have flown aboard the space shuttle, including four who made the ultimate sacrifice in the Challenger and Columbia accidents. 
   In order to honor such dedication after the Columbia accident, America committed to a vision for space exploration that will return Americans to the Moon. Undoubtedly, several women will make that journey. I look forward to that moment when the first American woman steps on the Moon and shares her experience with the rest of the world. 
   This resolution by the gentleman from Oregon and others recognizes the first 13 women that helped propel an entire gender and an entire nation into space.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Mr. Wu, my friend from Oregon, for this resolution and want to speak in favor of H. Res. 446, which honors the life and accomplishments of an extraordinary man, astronaut Walter Marty Schirra. Wally Schirra, as he was known to nearly everyone, was truly a great American and a terrific human being. 
   Wally Schirra was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, on March 12, 1923, and was perhaps best known as an accomplished NASA astronaut and human spaceflight pioneer, with the distinction of being the only astronaut to fly aboard the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spacecrafts. He was named one of NASA's original Mercury 7 astronauts in April of 1959 and became the fifth American to fly into space. Then, as the commander of the Gemini 6A spacecraft, he completed a dramatic rendezvous in space with the Gemini 7 spacecraft. 
   Schirra then served as commander of the Apollo 7 mission, which was the first Apollo flight after the catastrophic 1967 launch pad fire that killed the original Apollo 1 crew. At the conclusion of the Apollo 7 mission, Schirra had logged 295 hours and 15 minutes in space. 
   Before his service with NASA, Wally Schirra had already served his country with honor as a pilot in the 154th Fighter Bomber Squadron during the Korean War. Schirra flew over 90 combat missions in F-84E jets and was credited with downing at least one enemy MIG fighter. 
   What is perhaps less well-known about Wally Schirra is his personal warmth, his contagious sense of humor and his tireless dedication as an advocate for discovery. After his retirement in 1984, he spent many years working to inspire children to pursue their dreams by connecting them to the amazing possibilities of space exploration. 
   Schirra captured the pride of our entire Nation when he wrote, ``We shared a common dream to test the limits of man's imagination and daring. Those early pioneering flights of Mercury, the performances of Gemini and the trips to the moon established us, once and for, all as what I like to call a spacefaring nation. Like England, Spain and Portugal crossing the seas in search of their nations' greatness, so we reached for the skies and emboldened our Nation.'' 
   I am deeply saddened by Wally Schirra's passing on May 2, 2007. He was truly an American hero. I am proud to support this resolution honoring such a prominent American citizen, military veteran and astronaut. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 446.

   I expect to be proudly this Friday evening down at Cape Canaveral where we will hopefully send the next shuttle flight into space with some good luck and good fortune. And as I am down there I will join many Americans in thinking about Wally Schirra and the other great heroes that have come forward and made these great feats today possible and the many more opportunities in space that would not have happened without heroes like Wally Schirra.

   Mr. FEENEY. Madam Speaker, recently President Bush wrote that now is not the time to increase taxes on the American people. As the stock market hits an all-time high, employment is at an all-time high, unemployment is at a record low. Unfortunately, the first couple weeks in this House is not a good indication of Democratic leadership. 
   In week number one, we effectively repealed the three-fifths requirement to raise taxes. 
   In week number two, we passed a so-called PAYGO law that says any of the new liberal spending programs are going to be accompanied with huge new tax increases on the people of America. 
   And today, with the first major tax increase in 10 years, $7 billion is put on the backs of American energy producers that will directly translate to higher gas prices at the pump. 
   I ask all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to sign a letter that is on your desk where we encourage the President to veto any bad tax increases, and we pledge to sustain that veto. Democrats and Republicans alike ought to keep this economy rolling. Please sign the letter that is on your desk. I welcome all of my colleagues to join me.

<DOCNO>Mr. FEENEY. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. I thank the ranking member, and I am pleased to rise to talk about this bill. I just think that it's important that we be square with the American people about what this bill does and what it doesn't do. 
   This bill essentially creates a straw man or a boogeyman and attacks that straw man or boogeyman as though they were responsible for the price of gasoline and energy in America today. Regardless of whether you are voting for or against this bill, it doesn't do anything to help Americans concerned about saving the American family and American business from the high price of oil and gas. 
   Let me explain to Americans what speculators do. I am not a speculator. Speculators bet on the future. It's legal to make a gamble in America and bet on the future of commodities prices, of pork bellies, and, as the agriculture chairman and ranking member are well aware, of the price of corn and wheat in the future. Speculators bet on the future. 
   What speculators have done with the price of oil and gas on the commodities market, they have simply bet on the future price of oil and gas. Now in this case, what are they betting on? They are betting that the demand for energy in the world, places like India and China and the third world, will increase. That's a pretty smart bet. 
   But they are betting on another thing. They are betting that the Democratic-led Congress will continue to be stupid and refuse to supply more energy for America. It's a simple preponderance rule of supply and demand. If you have less corn 2 months from now, the price of corn will go up. That's what speculators bet on. 
   If you are going to have more demand for energy and oil and gas, and you know you will not produce more supply, then the price of oil and gas will go up. To punish the speculators for betting that Congress will continue to be stupid and not produce American energy is really attacking a boogeyman. It is attacking a straw man and will not help with the price of oil. 
   Now, as the ranking member said, the great news is, America has an abundant supply of energy. We just won't access it. We are the Saudi Arabia of the world's coal supply. We can produce and burn coal in a liquefied or gasified manner cleaner than ever, but we refuse to do it. China is doing it, India is doing it, our competitors are doing it. We won't, even though we are the Saudi Arabia of coal. 
   We won't drill in ANWR. We will not access oil and tar shale. We passed a fraud on the American people in a bill the other day that said 88 percent of the area where we could drill off the Outer Continental Shelf for oil can never be drilled in, and the other 12 percent can be drilled in, but only if all of the radical environmentalists and trial lawyers somehow, someday, give us permission. 
   That is a no drilling bill. It is a no energy bill. Now we won't build nuclear plants. America has the finest nuclear technology in the world. We stopped building nuclear plants 30 years ago, and American nuclear expertise, scientists and technologies went to France. You are a really foolish country if the French are outsmarting you on policy with your own technology, but that is what's happening every day. 
   So what do we do here today? Instead of passing a real American-based energy bill where American energy can be produced by American workers to save American families and American jobs, we have tax speculators who have bet on the future, and they have bet that the Democrat-led Congress will continue to be dumb. 
   I think they made a good bet.

<DOCNO>Mr. FEENEY. (WHAT IS GOOD FOR AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my friend from Iowa and to my good friend from Georgia. And I, too, just got off the last campaign cycle, and I watched the national newspapers. I saw it in the State of Florida, where over and over again I heard that there was a new, reformed Democratic Party, people that believed very differently than the Republicans in charge here in Washington, that we are going to reform the process, make it fairer and more transparent. I heard that we were going to be under new management. 
   Now I find it a little funny, because as I look at the chairmen of the committees, we have got one chairman that has been here for 56 years in Congress. We have got chairmen that have been here for 30 years in Congress, for 40 years that have been Chairmen before. So really it is deja vu in terms of who the leadership is of the important committees here in Congress. There is no change. 
   Americans need to know they are going to go back to the Jimmy Carter high-tax, high-regulation, high-speed, high-unemployment, high-inflation rates under their so-called new leadership because it is the same old, same old. 
   But I was really intent as I was working in my office, studying some of the crazy things that are coming up in our committee process this week, Mr. King. And I heard you offer to the new members of the Democratic majority that say, We are going to be very different, we are going to be transparent, we are not going to be liberal Democrats, we are going to maintain a threshold on taxes. 
   And yet in the very first 2 weeks, what we here have passed without one amendment allowed, without one committee hearing allowed, without any debate other than maybe an hour on this floor allowed, with the results preordained by a maestro--and we have to give her credit; the Speaker has been a wonderful leader in terms of making the trains run on time, which we know that people that do not engage in democratic processes, but engage in totalitarian processes are successfully able to do. 
   The first thing that the new majority, conservatives supposedly or moderates, do is pass PAYGO, which makes its easier to pass tax increases. The next thing they do is pass a minimum wage bill that exempts American Samoa. And they pass an energy bill that actually increases taxes at the pump ultimately on the people in my district that buy gas. 
   And, of course, they also gave as part of the Committee of the Whole here, a vote to the delegate from American Samoa who represents, he is a friend of mine, he is a great guy, but he represents approximately 60,000 people who are not a State which the Constitution requires in order for you to have an equal vote here on the floor. 
   Now, I would tell my friend from Iowa that I have football stadiums not far from me that hold more than 60,000 people in them. The football stadiums are not represented by a delegate or a vote in Congress. And maybe every football stadium with 60,000 or more votes under their new premise ought to be included

   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, my guess is about 80 percent of them are either payers of the income tax, the Medicare tax, the Social Security tax, or some Federal tax. 
   And with respect to American Samoa, I admire them. I actually think that they are fortunate. I am envious. They do not pay Federal income taxes, as the gentleman wisely pointed out. But they have a vote here, just like my football stadiums with 60,000 people do not have; American Samoans who do not pay Federal taxes on the Federal income code do pay taxes. 
   Now, I will tell my two great friends, I hope that I 
   do not upset them here, but the States of Georgia and Iowa are two of my favorite States in the Union. But I happen to be very jealous; and believe that I was the speaker of the house of the greatest State in the country, the State of Florida. 
   And I will have to tell you that passing budgets is a very difficult deal, passing appropriations bills, it is hard. I like to compare every budget that I have dealt with at the Federal level or the State level as like a Clint Eastwood movie; it is part of the good, part the bad, and part the ugly. The only thing that justifies a budget is the process. 
   Where every elected member at the committee level, for all of the different Appropriations Committees gets to fight for his or her priorities, where on the House floor you allow amendments, you allow the entire body to sit down and figure out collectively. And democracy is an ugly process, but the only thing that justifies the outcome of budgets, which are like a Clint Eastwood movie, The Good the Bad and the Ugly, is the process itself. 
   The process that we witnessed today in the Rules Committee, and my friend from Georgia alluded to the fact that the Rules Committee apparently has said that not one single amendment to this omnibus package that was passed, not by a committee, but was passed by one Member, this is the Pelosi omnibus package. Nobody else had any control or say in it. Not one Member had a chance.

   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, traditionally that has always been true. This has never happened in modern history that any historian of the House can recollect. 
   But let me tell you exactly what has happened. I will have to admit, one of the very few things that I have liked in the first 60 days here is that the Democrats actually pledged that we are not going to have earmarks. 
   Now, they have pledged a lot of things. They violated virtually every promise that they made. But the earmark pledge is something I really like. I was one of the outspoken critics, even of Republican earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. But I have to tell you, you have got to give credit where credit is due, when they will stand up and say, we are not going to have earmarks. I thought, you know what, I can live by that policy if every other Member of the House can, or we are going to have transparent earmarks; everybody has to be honest about what they are spending the money on. 
   I want to read to you the definition from The Citizens Against Government Waste. An earmark is any proposal that does any one of the following seven things; if you do one of them, you are an earmark. This is important, because we are facing tomorrow the largest earmark in the history of the world under this definition that everybody uses, if you do any one of these things. 
   If you are requested by only one Chamber of Congress. This bill tomorrow is only going to be requested by  the U.S. House, not the Senate. If you are not specifically authorized by committees in the House. This bill has not been authorized, not one thing in it has been authorized by any committee. 
   If there are things in the bill that are not competitively awarded. Nothing in this bill requires any competitive awards for the new spending. 
   Number four, if it is not requested by the President. There are billions of dollars of spending in this bill that have not been even seen, let alone requested or reviewed by the President. 
   Number five, if it exceeds the President's budget request or the previous year's funding. We have issues here that have never been greater than in this bill that we have not seen because it is the Pelosi omnibus package that nobody had a chance to see or vote on. 
   Number six--remember, any one of those things makes it an earmark; this qualifies for all five so far--if it is not the subject of congressional hearings. Well, the funny thing is the Speaker and the Democratic leadership would not let us have a hearing on any of this spending. $463 billion, we have not had one minute of hearings, 1 minute of review. 
   And finally, number seven, if some of the things in the bill serve only a local or special interest. Now, I will leave you with this, Mr. King, because I really admire the points you have made. Every taxpayer is paying the price of this horrible process. It is not just about process. This is a $463 billion earmark, not because it violates one of the rules, but all seven rules. 
   And I would finish with this. I was really offended when Republicans were in charge of this Chamber and we had a $250 million earmark that I referred to as the Bridge to Nowhere. The earmark tomorrow is 2,000 times greater than the Bridge to Nowhere. This is the Congress that supposedly was going to be about reform, ending earmarks, and have transparency. There is not one pledge that has been made that will not be broken tomorrow if this bill passes. 
   With that, I thank my friend.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1312 which commemorates the 25th anniversary of the Space Foundation. I want to thank its sponsors, Mr. Lamborn of Colorado and Mr. Lampson from Texas, for this very important resolution honoring the Space Foundation. 
   The Space Foundation was established in Colorado Springs in 1983 to provide a nonpartisan source of credible information to a wide variety in the space community, from professionals to the general public. 
   Over the last 25 years, the Space Foundation's mission has been to advance space-related endeavors to inspire, enable, and propel humanity. The Space Foundation has developed alongside the space community by fostering and promoting a greater understanding and awareness and practical uses of space for the benefit of civilization in all aspects of space: commercial, civil, and national security. 
   Perhaps the most notable has been the Space Foundation's commitment to space education programs. Since its inception, the Space Foundation has been a leading champion for bringing space science into the classroom. The Space Foundation's Summer Institute provides a unique educational environment in which teachers can continue their space studies and help enhance their students' classroom experience. 
   In addition to the Summer Institute, the Space Foundation hosts the National Space Symposium and Strategic Space and Defense, two of the top three conferences for space professionals worldwide. I might say I had the honor of attending a recent conference in Colorado Springs. The Space Foundation has been useful in efforts to bring together all aspects of the space industry and has established itself a crucial member of the space community. 
   I'm proud to support this resolution honoring a significant organization, and I urge my colleagues to also support House Resolution 1312.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the oceans have been the largest sink of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is a valuable natural function. When the oceans absorb carbon dioxide, it lowers the pH of the water. Although the increased acidity of the oceans to date has not been significant, many in the ocean science community are concerned about the rate of change that they have witnessed. 
   H.R. 4174 organizes Federal activities on ocean acidification research. It is intended to provide a blueprint for research and monitoring efforts at the Federal level, and encourage international cooperation for a global problem. 
   We have an obligation to ourselves and to future generations to make informed decisions on something as serious as the health and welfare of our oceans, but at this point, we do not know enough to make those decisions. We do not know how much the ocean's chemistry is going to change, how fast it will change, or what the impacts of this change will be on marine life or the health of marine ecosystems. We also do not know how all of this will affect mankind's reliance on the ocean for food, for industry, and for energy resources. How can we possibly engage in serious discussions about mitigation and adoption strategies if we do not know these important things? 
   Passing the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act is the first step we need to take to collect this vital information. The legislation directs the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology, or JSOST, to coordinate all Federal research and monitoring activities. The subcommittee is co-chaired by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, the National Science Foundation, NSF, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the White House. These are the three agencies that should be most involved in ocean acidification research. 
   This bill requires JSOST to develop a strategic research plan with an eye toward being able to produce useable products to the fishing industry, the energy industry, policy makers, and other shareholders at some point in the future. This strategic plan is not meant to reinvent the wheel. It should be based on several research road maps that have already been developed by other institutions. 
   The legislation authorizes NOAA to continue its ocean acidification research and monitoring activities as long as such activities are consistent with the strategic research plan. It also authorizes funding for NSF to provide research grants for ocean acidification. And it directs NASA to focus resources on ocean acidification monitoring in future Earth observation missions. 
   Most importantly, H.R. 4174 requires that JSOST and NOAA coordinate U.S.  ocean acidification research and monitoring efforts with those in the international community. Many countries are currently in the same place as we are, organizing their research efforts and laying out road maps for the future. Just last month, the European Union launched the European Ocean Acidification Project, an initiative to investigate ocean acidification and its consequences.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 375, to honor the goal of the International Year of Astronomy, along with the gentleman from Texas. 
   In 1609, Galileo Galilei turned a telescope to the night sky and saw an amazing array of astronomical wonders. From that point on, mankind has been fascinated by the secrets of the universe and has been committed to understanding Earth and everything beyond through extraordinary scientific leaps. 
   In honor of the 400th anniversary of Galileo's discovery, the United Nations has designated 2009 the International Year of Astronomy. The purpose of the International Year of Astronomy is to help citizens of the world discover the impact astronomy has had on their daily lives and create a greater knowledge of what the universe has to offer. The International Year of Astronomy will be a worldwide celebration aiming to stimulate interest in astronomy and science, particularly in younger generations, coalescing around the central theme of, ``The Universe, Yours to Discover.'' 
   There are eight major goals of the International Year of Astronomy. They include: 
   Increasing scientific awareness in the general public through the communication of scientific breakthroughs; 
   Promoting widespread access to the universal knowledge of fundamental science through astronomy and sky-observing experiences; 
   Empowering astronomical communities in developing countries by engaging in international collaboration; 
   Supporting and improving formal and informal science education in schools and science centers; 
   Providing a modern image of science and scientists to reinforce the connection between science education and science careers;

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to join Mr. Lampson in cosponsoring House Resolution 1313 which honors the life and accomplishments of an amazing woman, astronaut Dr. Sally K. Ride. 
   Sally Ride was born in Los Angeles, California, on May 26, 1951, and is perhaps best known as the first American woman in space. She was selected for NASA's astronaut program in January 1978, and became a mission specialist on the seventh space shuttle mission, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 18, 1983. This was the second flight of the space shuttle Challenger, and the first mission with a five-person crew. During the mission, Dr. Ride operated the shuttle's remote manipulator arm to perform the first deployment and retrieval exercise from the shuttle's cargo bay. These early demonstrations paved the way for routine, yet vitally important, operations necessary to build the International Space Station. 
   Prior to her service with NASA, Sally Ride received a bachelor of science in physics and a bachelor of arts in English, and went on to receive a master of science and doctorate degree in physics from Stanford University. 
   What is perhaps less well known about Sally Ride is the work she has done to motivate girls and young women to pursue careers in math and science and technology. She has written five science books for children, and initiated and directed education programs to encourage a fascination with science among middle school students. 
   Dr. Ride also served the Nation in other capacities, including as a member of the Presidential Commission investigating the Space Shuttle Challenger accident, and later the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. She has been a member of the President's Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology, and the National Research Council's Space Studies Board, as well as served on the Boards of Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. 
   Indeed, our country does owe a great debt of gratitude to this amazing woman, Dr. Sally Ride.

<DOCNO>Mr. FEENEY. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I'm thrilled to be part of the celebration of NASA's 50th anniversary with this House Resolution 1315. 
   NASA was created 50 years ago in the wake of the former Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik. Sputnik provided the perception of Soviet superiority in military power and scientific achievement. 
   To counter that challenge, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was founded for conducting America's civilian space program. 
   NASA actually succeeded the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, a splendid organization founded in 1915 that produced gems of aeronautical research. Now the task was to extend America's reach from the air to space. 
   NASA did so. Satellites were launched to monitor the weather, relay communications, and explore our solar system. America's human spaceflight program, Project Mercury, began. Astronauts were selected in 1959, and in 1960, NASA began planning a manned lunar landing. 
   The rest became an integral part of the American identity, not just for us but for how the rest of the world views the American experience: our journeys to the Moon; the space shuttle; the International Space Station; Apollo 13's harrowing journey; the tragedies of Apollo 1, the Shuttle Challenger, and the Shuttle Columbia; the Hubble Space Telescope; the robotic exploration of other planets; the monitoring of our dynamic Earth; and of course, the wonder of flight itself. All done in the full view of the world. 
   Today, America is the world's premier spacefaring Nation. For 50 years, the men and women of the NASA family have brought great honor and prestige to this country. Today, the House of Representatives honors those people, past and present. 
   We will continue that legacy. Last month, this House overwhelmingly passed a NASA reauthorization bill that lays out a comprehensive blueprint for sustaining a healthy and vigorous NASA. Considerable care has been devoted to all elements of NASA's portfolio, human spaceflight, Earth and space sciences, and aeronautics. We must never relinquish our leadership in space. 
   And yet, today in the Washington Post, the Washington Post points out that just like competition on Earth, space is now a global competitive environment, and I quote the Washington Post from today's edition. ``Space, like Earth below, is globalizing. And as it does, America's long-held superiority in exploring, exploiting and commercializing `the final frontier' is slipping away, many experts believe.'' 
   I agree with that assessment. Slowly but steadily, we are allowing our historic lead in space to slip away, and this House and the Senate and the next administration needs to step to the forefront. We're experiencing increasing competition from China, from India, from Japan, from Russia, from the European Space Agency, and increasingly, many others. 
   In the aftermath of the Shuttle Columbia accident, America rededicated itself to human spaceflight. We vowed to resume flying the shuttle, complete the International Space Station, and then build and fly a new generation of spacecraft that will take America beyond orbiting the Earth. The Moon will be the first of many destinations. 
   When this vision was announced, one of the first responses came in an editorial in The Daily Telegraph. Sometimes those living ``across the pond'' are the best way to observe the American people. Here's what the editorial said. ``Americans, thank Heaven, are a restless, inquisitive, pioneering people. The concept of exploration, of an ever-expanding frontier, is central to their identity in a way that some Europeans find hard to understand.'' 
   As the world watches, NASA displays this fundamental part of our American character, and that is appropriate. For we explore space not just for ourselves, we do so for all of humankind.

   Mr. FEENEY. Madam Speaker, I would like to quote Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, author of this bailout bill, ``The free market failed, it's up to government to fix the problem.'' 
   It is important that we understand the how we got here in order to address a solution to the problem. Who and what caused the subprime bubbles and the current economic crisis? 
   Treasury Secretary Alan Greenspan in 2005 said:  
   If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ``continue to grow ..... they potentially create ever-growing potential systemic risk down the road ..... we are placing the total financial system of the future at substantial risk.''

<DOCNO>Mr. FEENEY. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit clarifies that this nonbinding vote is in fact nonbinding: no court may consider the board's refusal to follow the shareholders' advisory vote as a breach of that board's duties of care or loyalty to the shareholders. It clarifies that although such a vote is compulsory, the result cannot be, and it cannot force a board of directors to act in a way that contravenes its best interest. 
   Mr. Shays offered an important amendment during the markup process to clarify that nothing in this bill imposes any new fiduciary duties on boards that the majority of the committee accepted. However, I am concerned not only about whether this statute imposes new, additional obligations on a board; I am concerned that a court might construe a board's decision to disregard the advice of a shareholders' advisory vote as prima facie evidence of a board's failure to satisfy its existing duties. 
   The chairman has frequently said, ``This bill does not do what this bill does not do.'' I hope he is right, because in the Financial Services Committee hearing and markup, in the Rules Committee, and on the floor, he has stressed that this bill is purely advisory. Rather than hope, though, I offer this motion to recommit in order to be certain and to protect the directors in their discretionary exercise of their duties. 
   If this provision is redundant, that is fine. We do a lot worse here than redundancy. As Chairman Frank often advises, the law is filled with redundancies, and when Members oppose language in language in bills because they are redundant, they are typically being disingenuous. 
   So if this bill really does bar frivolous litigation by activist shareholders, then the majority should have no trouble accepting this motion to recommit. However, if it does not preclude private rights of action, as I fear that it does not, then this motion is critical. If the majority cannot support an amendment that limits frivolous litigation, then their motives are suspect. 
   This motion to recommit protects America's competitive position vis-a-vis international capital markets. If a court can weigh a vote intended as noncompulsory when evaluating whether directors have breached their fiduciary duties, the real beneficiaries of this bill will be trial lawyers racing to the courthouse. The losers will be American enterprise, American stockholders, and, ultimately, American workers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FEENEY. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I never thought I would say that I really miss the grand old days of the liberal tax-and-spend party, because the great liberals in our Nation's recent history were never ashamed about being honest with the  American people that they wanted to raise taxes and they wanted to increase spending. In fact, they campaigned on increasing taxes and they campaigned on increasing spending. 
   One of the problems we have with the hypocrisy in what is going on in the last 6 months is that we are dramatically increasing taxes, $392 billion, secretly and surreptitiously, through the budget bill that repeals the most pro-growth tax cuts since Ronald Reagan was President. And now we have a process by which American taxpayers' money will be spent in secret, behind closed doors and in the dark. I really admire the grand old liberal days, when raising taxes and increasing spending was something that was done just right out in the open, where everybody could see it and debate it. 
   I have heard in the last 10 hours of debate that Republicans have been accused of being repetitious. It is better to be repetitive than disingenuous or hypocritical, in my view. 
   Winston Churchill once famously said that there is nothing that one government learns so readily from another as how to spend other people's money. I would tell you that there is a critical process that is being undermined here that is important to a functioning Congress and that will embarrass this institution if we don't stop it right now. 
   That is why this debate is so important. It is not about $1 million or $1 billion here or there. It is about how we go forward in spending the people's money in a transparent, honest and open fashion. 
   We have had our Democratic colleagues point out, I think fairly, that Republicans maybe aren't in the best glass house to throw stones when it comes to the issue of spending money or earmarks. I will tell you that it is very important that we acknowledge Republican failures. 
   Not all of us were happy with some of the things that happened in my last 6 years. For example, I voted against numerous GOP-led appropriation bills. I voted for virtually all of Congressman JEFF FLAKE's amendments. I was on occasion punished by having my own priorities stripped out of bills. 
   I voted for cuts in every GOP appropriations bill in my first 6 years. I criticized our Republican President for overspending and for not exercising his veto to discipline Congress. I criticized my own leadership. I supported every reform effort I can think of in the methods of opening up earmark processes to transparency and honesty. I even went on national TV and said that the Republican-led Congress was spending money like drunken sailors. 
   I have to tell you, a Navy captain in California admonished me. He said Congress was not spending money like drunken sailors; that drunken sailors spend their own money, and, when they run out, they quit spending. And I have to give it to him. 
   So I want to tell you that not all of us are coming here and ridiculing things that we have not ridiculed in the past. I applauded the Democratic reforms that were promised in terms of transparency and earmarks. As soon as we were told back in January that the reform-minded Democrats were going to open up the process and make it transparent, I said publicly that that would be one good thing about a Congress that I otherwise disagreed with its priorities. 
   But here I am 6 months later ruing the day that I ever said something nice about intentions, because the intentions never materialized. In fact, we have gone dramatically backwards. We are now going to have 434 of us give our proxy to the appropriations chairmen, all the cardinals and Chairman Obey, and we are going to let them decide how to spend the people's money. 
   We did away with proxy voting decades ago in Congress, and now we are going to have spending by proxy. That is wrong. It is fundamentally an affront to the American people, and it undermines the entire legislative process. 
   I can tell you that I was Speaker of the Florida legislature, and when there was trouble because of poor spending, it was almost always due to lack of honesty, openness, and transparency. And the Democratic leadership will rue the day, sooner than later, that it put a cloud of secrecy around spending the taxpayers' dollars. They will regret going back on their word.

   Mr. FEENEY. Madam Speaker, I find almost a surreal debate going on with my friends on the left side of the House saying to us don't you like democracy. We have got soldiers fighting for democracy throughout the world, while we are saying to our friends on the left, don't you like the Constitution? 
   The question is are we a pure democracy or a constitutional republic? The Constitution is made up of powers delegated by the States, and the States alone, to the Federal Government. The States and the States alone, according to the language of the Constitution, are represented in the U.S. House. 
   If you believe in democracy, use the constitutional amendment process, use the retrocession process. If you have a quarrel with the Constitution, it is not because you don't like the position of the Republicans and the minority in this House. It is because your quarrel is with the Founding Fathers. 
   Hamilton tried to get this provision in the Constitution, representation for D.C. The Founding Fathers considered it and they rejected it. 
   So, again, we are for democracy within a constitutional republic status. We are not an unadulterated democracy. We are a constitutional republic.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank my colleague Mr. Melancon for shepherding this memorial to the floor today. With this resolution, the House of Representatives joins with all Americans to solemnly remember the loss of the space shuttle Challenger 22 years ago on January 28, 1986. 
   Many Americans remember where they were on that cold January morning when the shuttle Challenger leapt from its launch pad. After receiving the call ``Challenger go at throttle up,'' Challenger disintegrated in clear blue skies just 73 seconds into its flight. 
   We were stunned. One moment Challenger was flawlessly flying on a beautiful winter morning. Then, without warning, it was gone. 
   America turned to mourn its seven astronauts who gave the ultimate sacrifice for the advancement of exploration and discovery: Michael Smith; Dick Scobee; Judith Resnik; Ronald McNair; Ellison Onizuka; Gregory Jarvis; and Christa McAuliffe, a schoolteacher from Concord, New Hampshire, selected to be the first member of the teaching profession in a space project. 
   That evening, President Reagan spoke from the Oval Office to comfort a grieving Nation. Millions of children had watched the launch because Christa McAuliffe was to later teach science lessons from space. Instead, we were reminded of a deeper lesson. Reagan said:  
   ``I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.'' 
   Reagan concluded his address by saying this: 
   ``The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved good-bye and slipped the surly bonds of Earth to ``touch the face of God.' '' 
   Twenty-two years have passed. America has kept its word. We haven't forgotten the Challenger crew. Human space flight is mankind's most difficult endeavor. America has achieved so many successes, space flight seems routine; yet every generation unexpectedly bears witness to space flight's inherent dangers. 
   Before the Challenger disaster, the Apollo I crew was lost on Pad 34 on January 27, 1967, in an accident known simply as ``The Fire.'' After Challenger, we waited on February 1, 2003, at the Kennedy Space Center's landing strip for the voyagers of Columbia who never returned home. January and February are NASA's cruelest months. 
   On each occasion the people of NASA grieved terribly, but they learned from adversity, and then they rededicated themselves to their mission. America landed on the Moon after The Fire. After Challenger, the shuttle flew again to pursue scientific discovery and begin constructing the international space station. After Columbia, we returned to flight, and we will complete and use the international space station. Then we will turn our dreams to exploring beyond Earth's orbit by establishing outposts on the Moon and then going further beyond. 
   Exploration, journey, and bravery define the American people. Each of us comes from a heritage where someone with great courage took a passage to a new beginning, many times with disastrous endings. But the living stubbornly persevered, pushed back vast frontiers, and built a great and glorious Nation. Adversity, including the loss of the Challenger crew, can never extinguish this American spirit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this resolution honoring the brave and dedicated crew of Challenger. I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 943. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I'm honored to speak today in support of H. Res. 942, recognizing the significance of Black History Month, sponsored by my distinguished colleague from Texas (Mr. Al Green). 
   Just a few weeks ago, we celebrated the life and accomplishments of one great man, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and today we pay tribute to the contributions all African Americans have made to this great country. 
   Each February we express our appreciation of the struggles, determination, and perseverance of the African American community of the past and present. Nothing serves as a better example of this than the civil rights movement itself. 
   Rev. King would tell you that it was not the sole efforts of one man but the collective work of many that achieved so much. Without the civil rights movement, our Nation would not have the strong diversity of which it is so proud. 
   Beyond this, February is also a time to recognize the contributions of African Americans that have enriched our culture and our heritage. We must continue to learn the historical struggles of African American citizens in order to better understand the experiences that have shaped this Nation. 
   There have been great activists, politicians, artists, writers, poets, scientists, economists, athletes, entertainers, and musicians that have all bettered our way of life. The achievements of so many have encouraged today's youth to strive for a more equal and free country. 
   It is impossible to celebrate Black History Month without mentioning such noted leaders as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Thurgood Marshall, and, once again, Dr. King himself. Their historic efforts inspired a Nation and brought past injustices to light, bringing forth beginning to an end of racial inequality. 
   When Harvard scholar Dr. Carter G. Woodson had the idea to create a week-long celebration of black history back in 1926, his goal was to ``make the world see the Negro as a participant, rather than as a lay figure in history.'' 
   Over time, it has become the month-long commemoration that it is today, and it is with great pleasure that I speak today in support of H. Res. 942.

   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H. Res. 907, as amended, which recognizes and congratulates the forward-thinking X PRIZE Foundation on one of its latest contest endeavors, the Automotive X PRIZE. 
   There is a rich history in this country of prizes sponsored by private entities leading to innovations in science and technology. Starting with the Ansari X PRIZE, the privately funded X PRIZE Foundation has successfully been able to build on the concept of the 1927 Orteig Prize, which awarded $25,000 to the first person to be able to make a nonstop transatlantic flight. While the actual Orteig Prize name may not be well known, the recipient of this prize, Charles Lindbergh, certainly is. The benefits of the $400,000 of investment teams made in an effort to win this prize certainly have been realized, and the $250 billion aviation industry that took off shortly thereafter certainly continues to prosper. Likewise, the 2004 Ansari X PRIZE leveraged over $100 million in research by teams vying for a $10 million price for private spaceflight. Won by Mojave Aerospace Ventures, the Ansari X PRIZE changed the public's perception of personal spaceflight. 
   Now the Automotive X PRIZE is poised to produce similar results for the next generation of automobiles, viable, super-efficient vehicles. As the resolution states, our ``national security and economic prosperity demand that we move toward a sustainable future.'' This prize certainly helps us move in that direction. It will be awarded to the team that can design, build and sell super-efficient cars that achieve 100 miles per gallon and are not concept cars, but cars that people will want to buy. If successful, the end result in and of itself will be impressive, but the overall benefits to the Nation will be too numerable to measure. This prize, like those before it, will generate millions of privately funded research dollars producing research that may not in the end win the prize, but could spur additional technologies. Likewise, this prize will stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit of inventors and investors alike, both known entities and brilliant minds working in backyard garages. 
   I congratulate the X PRIZE Foundation's leadership in creating a private, independent competition designed to help move us closer to a sustainable energy future. I wish them much success, look forward to seeing the results it produces, and encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   With that, I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for this resolution designating February 17, 2008, as ``Race Day in America.'' 
   Next Sunday over 200,000 people from all 50 States and around the world will convene at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, for the 50th running of ``The Great American Race,'' the Daytona 500. 
   The most prestigious stock car race in the United States, the Daytona 500 is a 200-lap, 500-mile grand opening to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Boasting the largest purse and stock car racing's most coveted trophy, the Harley J. Earl Trophy, the Daytona 500 has become the ``Super Bowl of Stock Car Racing.'' 
   Each year millions of fans, both at home as well as those serving overseas, tune in to the race by television and radio. Since 1995, the television ratings for the Daytona 500 have been higher than any auto race, and in 2006 the race drew the sixth largest television audience of any sporting event that year. 
   For 50 years, the popularity of Daytona, and car racing in general, has grown throughout American society. I believe it is fitting that we celebrate this rising American tradition by passing this resolution in honor of the golden anniversary of its most prestigious event. I invite anybody who's free this Sunday to come to Daytona Beach and enjoy this great tradition with us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I would yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 287, offered by my friend and Space Subcommittee chairman, MARK UDALL, as well as Mr. Melancon, RALPH HALL and myself, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the launch of Explorer I, America's first satellite. With this launch, America became a spacefaring Nation. 
   Unlike the Soviets, who 4 months earlier had launched Sputnik I in secrecy, America's space program was carried on in full public view. Our first attempt to launch a satellite, Vanguard I, ended in failure. As a consequence, some suggested that our preeminence as a world power was jeopardized. 
   Explorer I proved otherwise. The successful launch came through a collaboration of brilliant and dedicated scientists and engineers led by Wernher von Braun, who designed the launch vehicle known as the Jupiter C; Dr. Charles Pickering, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who designed the satellite; and Dr. James Van Allen, who designed the main instrument carried aboard Explorer I. 
   On the night of January 31, 1958, Explorer I lifted off from Pad 26A at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Almost 2 hours passed before a ground station in California confirmed the satellite's successful orbit. America was now on a path to achieve space preeminence. 
   Unlike Sputnik I, Explorer I did more than demonstrate the ability to place an object into orbit. It had a valuable scientific purpose. Explorer I consisted of a Geiger counter that detected cosmic rays, temperature sensors, and a micrometeorite impact microphone. These instruments discovered radiation belts, now named after Dr. James Van Allen, that encircle the Earth. 
   Explorer I stopped transmitting data on May 23, 1958 when its batteries died. But it stayed in orbit until March 31, 1970 and completed about 58,000 orbits around the Earth. 
   Explorer I's legacy was far greater than anticipated. Few imagined how satellites could maintain our Nation's security and economy and extend man's reach to the far corners of the solar system. 
   Government and private enterprise, scientists and engineers, worked together to exploit and expand the capacities of space. Today, a vibrant and critical commercial industry builds and launches sophisticated satellites. 
   In Earth orbit, satellites forecast weather and measure surface winds and other climate variables. They monitor land-use patterns and remote sensing. They help farmers gauge the health of their crops; transmit data, radio and television signals into our homes and to businesses around the world; and they provide the infrastructure for the global positioning system, enabling the capability to accurately navigate to virtually any point on Earth. 
   Beyond Earth orbit, satellites have visited every planet in the solar system except for Pluto, although a mission is under way to visit this far-away planet in 2015. Satellites have carried rovers to the surface of Mars, they have captured samples of interstellar dust and returned them to Earth, photographed the heavens with exceptional clarity, measured background temperatures and radiation to high precision, and landed on a moon of Saturn. 
   Explorer I also led to our human spaceflight program under which America learned to orbit the Earth, explore the Moon, and live for extended periods aboard the international space station. 
   H. Con. Res. 287 commemorates the achievements of the Explorer I team, and acknowledges its role as the impetus for what has become a critical part of America's greatness. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this bill, along with my good friend and ranking Republican member of the Science and Technology Committee, RALPH HALL, and I urge all Members to support it.

   If you visit, you can tour the blockhouse from which the Explorer I was launched, see launch control equipment from that era and walk on the launch pad. Just a few hundred yards away is Launch Pad 5 where America's first astronaut, Alan Shepherd, was launched into space. Emily Perry serves as the museum's curator. Sixty volunteers, led by Gary Harris, guide these tours. Most of these volunteers are veterans of America's space program, including some from the Explorer I era. Their stories provide a window into this fascinating past. Tours begin from the Kennedy Space Center's Visitors Complex and operate 7 days a week. 
   We have talked about how Explorer I began America's journey as a spacefaring people. If you visit the Space and Missile Museum, you can see and touch where that journey began.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas, and I would say that people in my district, there are some people who are hurting right about now as there are around the country. There are some people, indeed, who are homeowners in very bad shape. Some, for example, were duped or lied to by people that loaned them money. Some, a few, have lost their jobs. Some bought homes at the high of the housing market, say $150,000, now to find that their house is more like $120,000 or $100,000. And we all feel very sympathetic for those people. 
   But I don't feel too terribly bad for speculators that went in search of ways to get higher returns and take higher risks as an exchange, and that's who is getting bailed out today. I also don't have complete sympathy when it comes to using taxpayer money to reimburse people that, for example, put zero money down. They didn't buy that home. They bought an option to buy the home. People that bought into a 3-percent teaser rate knowing that if the interest rate went to 7 percent, they would never be able to stay in that home. People that used no documentation to demonstrate that they ever had the chance to repay. They moved into a home with an option to continue buying it. They didn't make the type of commitment that most homeowners do  to put 10 or 20 or 30 percent down and to make sure that they have a mortgage and a loan that they can pay under virtually any circumstance except for a disaster. 
   Who does this bill help? Well, The Wall Street Journal made it very clear who this bill helps. This bill is a bailout from American taxpayers of speculators and imprudent borrowers. Less than 1 percent of borrowers whose homes, under this bill, would be eligible when all is said and done to be helped. 
   I come today to speak on behalf of the forgotten man. And that includes some 50 percent of Americans that either own their home or are renting. Every one of them watching today needs to know that they are bailing out irresponsible speculators and lenders and they will pay the price of this bill. I come here to speak for the 90-plus, 95 percent of homeowners that are making their payments on time, that took out responsible loans. They need to know that they are bailing out irresponsible speculators and people that went in search of higher profits. 
   Investors who take advantage of this program are basically getting a guaranteed gift from the government: 85 percent of a loan that they know is not likely to perform. We are bailing out people that will cherry-pick the very worst loans in their portfolio. 
   Who is here speaking on behalf of the forgotten man? Who is here speaking on behalf of 99 percent of Americans that did not behave irresponsibly, that did not behave foolishly, that ultimately will pay the price for this bill? Well, some of us in the minority are here speaking on behalf of the forgotten man, which is 99 percent of America. 
   And I would leave you with this: Chairman Frank and the CBO and others can estimate how much this bill will cost these forgotten men and women, 99 percent of Americans who were not irresponsible who will pay the price. The answer is we don't know. We don't have a crystal ball. If property prices around the country take off by another 50 percent and go up, there will be no cost. If they go down by 30 percent, the cost will be closer to $3 billion.

   Mr. FEENEY. I'm very grateful. This is very important. 
   As Congressman King just told you, we have a problem on our border most Congressmen and few Americans know about. 
   I'm a skeptical guy, even when a good patriot and friend of mine like Steve King tells me something. So I went down personally and inspected a machine gun nest 75 miles inside the Arizona border run by coyotes. It was the 13th in a list of machine gun nests where they were armed with surveillance techniques, where they were armed with radios, and they used these facilities inside our border to facilitate drug trafficking and illegal immigration. 
   I do not believe that our government is enforcing our own security. There's nothing more important we can do than to support symbolically the King amendment to send a message we want to take these machine gun nests out. 
   It was the Bureau of Land Management that took me up there. Why? Because they are cleaning up the mess that these coyotes leave behind them as they are smuggling poison drugs and illegals across our border. 
   I saw it with my own eyes, or I would not have believed it. Please support the King amendment, if nothing else than to send a message we want our borders secure and our laws enforced.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. I too want to thank Congressman Flake and the cosponsors of this amendment. Our friends on the Democratic side have two arguments. Number 1, they say this is a superfluous, it's a red herring because nobody's talking about it. But we've already had two of our colleagues on the Democratic side say that they like talking about and maybe rehabilitating the fairness doctrine, which is a bad misnomer. In fact, this is the leftist censorship doctrine, and we ought to refer to it as such. 
   The second argument that they give us is that Republicans ought to like the fairness doctrine because we're always complaining about liberal bias in the media. And to that I would say this: The difference is that Rush Limbaugh knows and admits he's a conservative.     
   Dan Rather and Katie Couric don't know and they don't admit that they are liberal. That is the difference. Rush will get regulated; the others will not. And I would tell you that the first amendment, freedom of speech, means nothing if it means the government can tell you what you must say or what you must publish. The freedom of speech inherently means the freedom not to say certain thoughts or certain words. 
   Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, no conservative, once said: ``Censorship reflects society's lack of confidence in itself. It is a hallmark of an authoritarian regime.'' 
   In China, North Korea, and elsewhere, they have their ``fairness doctrines.'' We don't need one.

   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, there couldn't be a more critical discussion to have this morning before we cast this critical vote. The chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I must say, I respectfully disagree with in terms of the devastating consequences his proposal would have. The Attorney General of the United States and the Director of National Intelligence have looked at this proposal, and here is what they have said about the majority's proposal: ``Requiring prior court approval to gather foreign intelligence from foreign targets located overseas: the reason Congress did not include such a requirement when it passed the original FISA statute and with good reason, these foreign targets have no right to any court review of such surveillance under our Constitution. We know from experience requiring prior court approval is a formula for delay. Thus, this framework would impede vital foreign intelligence collection and put the Nation at unnecessary and greater risk.'' 
   Ladies and gentlemen, assume that you are the head of a corporation or a business in America after America is attacked, thousands of lives and several cities attacked; assuming that there is imminent threats to dozens of other cities and millions of others; assuming the Attorney General or the President contacts you and say that you have access to information that will save millions of Americans. What would you do? I hope you would cooperate. 
   That is what many companies did, and now they are subject, in San Francisco, to over 50 lawsuits for tens of billions of dollars. The question is whether we ought to protect patriotic companies that for several hundred years have had a privilege to cooperate with government. It's true that technically they may have immunity. But here is what you haven't acknowledged: the immunity is useless to them because they cannot assert it. It would be a violation of Federal law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the gentleman from Pennsylvania's amendment. I can tell you that we dealt with this issue in committee on a bipartisan basis, and we decided that we wanted to take away the political operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.     
   We believe that you cannot serve two masters and do a good, faithful job to both masters. 
   One of the reasons that Fannie and Freddie got in accounting problems in the first place is because of a complacent board of directors that was populated with political employees. 
   We believe in a post-Enron era that it becomes very, very important that we take advantage of corporate governance standards that are second to none. Even those of us that have criticized certain portions of Sarbanes-Oxley like section 404 as being overzealous believe deeply that Sarbanes-Oxley had some good corporate governance and conflict of interest rules that has imposed. That is why we decided that the trustees should owe a duty to the shareholders and to good corporate governance, not to the political people that may have appointed them. 
   And I think Mr. Kanjorski has an understandable sympathy for having some public-oriented representatives, but the truth of the matter is you end up with members of the board of trustees that are going to have to decide between whether they owe loyalty to the person that appointed them, or to good, tough corporate governance and to the shareholders that are seeking their best wisdom. 
   I would ask that we strongly defer to the considered opinion on a bipartisan basis of the Financial Services Committee on this one, and that we reject the Kanjorski amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. FEENEY. (FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Chairman, picking up where we left off, we've had a considerable amount of debate about the affordable housing fund concerns that many of us in the minority party have about this fund. And I'm not going to put words in the chairman's mouth, as some people did. I promise not to do that to Chairman Frank. 
   But there has been an ongoing debate from about 5 o'clock on about whether or not the affordable housing fund amounts to a tax. The truth of the matter is, government only gets money one of three ways. It either prints money, and there's nothing in this bill that tells the Treasury Department or the Mint to print any money. It borrows money, as in Treasury bonds, and nothing in this bill suggests that anybody's going to be repaid the $3 billion that the GAO says this will cost over the next 5 years. Clearly, the only other way government gets money is a tax. Whether we are taxing the shareholders, whether we are taxing ultimately the consumers of low income, middle income mortgages, or a combination of both, this is a tax. 
   Now, the question is what to do with this tax money. A lot of us have concerns about the fact that we're going to dump this $3 billion into a fund that has not been created, does not have a specific mission, does not have guidelines and does not have any controlling organization or entity. It may turn out to be a wonderful way to spend $3 billion. But we are very concerned with what we see. 
   I have fashioned a compromise here because some of the amendments on the minority side get rid of the fund or don't fund the fund. I actually fully fund the fund with the Feeney amendment. And we fund it to deal with housing issues for people that are needy. We've heard a lot of talk about lack of compassion for the needy. 
   What my amendment does is to take the first year's $500 million plus and send it to the victims of Katrina. We heard passionately from the gentleman from Mississippi, from my friend from Louisiana about the needs in the aftermath of Katrina. We keep that funding in place in year one. 
   But beyond that, in the balance of the years, what we do is to fund necessary housing for disabled American veterans. We use a system to make sure that disabled American veterans who are homeless have access to an opportunity to have a home and a place to live through rental assistance. 
   I spoke to Secretary Nicholson today of the VA. He tells me that we estimate there are 195,000 homeless veterans. Many of those veterans are disabled, either mental disabilities that come from their battle scars, their battle wounds or physical disabilities. What better way to honor the commitment that the majority has made. We're going to deal with the truly needy in America. But also rest assured that we're going to be dealing with people that have earned the right to get housing assistance, than to suggest that after we take care of Katrina hurricane victims in year one, that we are going to take care of those veterans that are disabled, that are needy and that need a roof over their head. 
   Mr. Chairman, I commend this as a compromise between the majority's compassion for the needy and the minority's concern that the trust fund that has not been established and has no guidelines may go wayward with this $3 billion.

   Mr. Speaker, hate is an awful thing, but we cannot punish people for what is in their hearts. We cannot punish people and make it a crime for what people are thinking. We punish acts in this country. 
   Unfortunately, I think this bill is badly misnamed. This bill should not be called the hate crimes bill, this should be called the unequal protection bill, because what it does is to say that the dignity and the property and the person and the life of one person gets more protection than another American. That is just wrong. With respect to my friend from Illinois, who just said hate crimes can tear this country apart, that is what this bill does. It gives different people the protection of their life, their property, and their person based on their special status. 
   We need to treat all Americans equally. Justice ultimately must turn on the fundamental word of each and every human being as equal before God and before the law. This bill undermines both of those principles.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'm proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, along with Mr. Lampson, that Mr. Rohrabacher is the prime sponsor of, and it does a number of important things. 
   It congratulates the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and their test pilots. This was the successor agency to what we now know as NASA. It honors the bravery of Chuck Yeager and all of the many other test pilots that took on such risks, and it basically emphasizes a strong and robust aeronautics research program for America. 
   As both Mr. Lampson and Mr. Rohrabacher have pointed out, Mr. Yeager's historic flight on October 14, 1947, breaking the sound barrier was a very dangerous and precarious experiment. At that time, pilots routinely risked losing control of their aircraft or, sadly, lost their lives due to extreme forces on the airplane. 
   But it's not just that great flight that made Chuck Yeager such a great test pilot in America. Chuck Yeager was only 24 when he flew the Bell X-1 on the famous flight above the Muroc  Army Air Field in California. Two days prior to his record-breaking flight, Mr. Yeager broke two ribs after falling off a horse. Fearing that knowledge of this injury would disqualify him from the scheduled flight, he hid his injury from his superiors and, as a result, had to improvise a way to close the latch on his plane. 
   Having successfully broken the sound barrier, others soon followed in Mr. Yeager's footsteps, flying newly designed aircraft at higher and higher speeds to help scientists and engineers gain critical knowledge about transonic and supersonic flight. 
   Only 6 years later, Chuck Yeager flew another Bell-designed rocket plane at more than twice the speed of sound. 
   A veteran of the Second World War, General Yeager flew P-51 Mustangs in the European theater. He ended the war credited with 61 missions and 11.5 shootdowns of enemy aircraft, including five kills in just 1 day. He was himself shot down over France, and with the help of the French Resistance, was able to make his way back to England where he continued flying against the Axis powers. 
   In the years following his historic flight, General Yeager continued an illustrious career in the Air Force. Among other accomplishments, he was the first commanding officer of the Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School and a commander of fighter wings and squadrons in Germany and southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. He also continued to work for NASA as a consulting test pilot. 
   On the 50th anniversary of his supersonic flight in 1997, General Yeager, then 74, piloted an Air Force F-15 Eagle past mach 1. 
   General Yeager is a native of West Virginia and today resides in California. He's a gifted pilot who spent his career in service to his country, sometimes at extreme risk, defending our shores and advancing our understanding of aeronautics. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to be a cosponsor and supporter of H. Res. 736, commemorating the 60th anniversary of General Yeager's first flight exceeding the speed of sound. And with that, I would urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. FEENEY. (COMMENDING NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER ON ITS 90TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I would like to rise in support of H. Con. Resolution 222, commending NASA on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Langley Research Center, located in Hampton, Virginia. 
   This legislation was introduced by our friend and colleague, Representative Jo Ann Davis, just a week before she succumbed to cancer; and it is with mixed emotion that I stand here today to talk about this resolution. 
   Mrs. Davis was proud to represent the engineers and technicians at NASA Langley Research Center who have made the United States aeronautics research and testing the envy of the world for 90 years. 
   First established as the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in 1917, it was the Nation's first civil aeronautics research laboratory under the charter of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the precursor to modern-day NASA. It was created at a time when the United States was clearly lagging behind its European counterparts in the development of aircraft capable of controlled powered flight. 
   Our country's leaders well understood that the future economic and military well-being our country demanded development of advanced aeronautics capability, and Langley's founding was motivated in part by the evolution of aircraft used in the first World War and by our desire to match and exceed these capabilities. 
   The center is named after one of America's earliest aeronautical pioneers, Samuel Pierpont Langley, who began his research into aeronautical  machines in 1886. Perhaps inauspiciously, Samuel Langley's final crewed test flight ended in failure when his aircraft, launched from the top of a houseboat, immediately plummeted into the Potomac River. Just 9 days later, on December 17, 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright successfully achieved the first flight on the dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. 
   During the ensuing decades, Langley Research Center's research and development activities advanced the science of aeronautics from simple propelled-driven aircraft into the jet age. 
   Their accomplishments are too numerous to mention here, but it is no exaggeration to state that Langley was the nexus from which fundamental technological breakthroughs in propulsion, aerodynamics, materials, aircraft and wing designs propelled our Nation to become the world's preeminent designer and builder of high-performance military and civil aircraft. 
   In 1958, responding to the launch of Sputnik, Congress passed legislation creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and with it the Langley Research Center's mission was expanded to lead our Nation's earliest efforts in manned space flight. 
   Many of the initial planning, design, test, and development activities related to Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were conducted at Langley. Langley was the first of 10 research centers that now comprise NASA, and a number of highly talented engineers and scientists who began their careers at Langley eventually helped establish the other NASA centers. 
   Langley's role in space continues to this day, contributing its talents to testing the design of the new Ares One Launch Vehicle and the design testing of the Orion Launch Abort System. The Langley Research Center is home to 3,600 civil service and contractor employees, and it houses several of the world's most advanced wind tunnels and aeronautics laboratories. 
   Mr. Speaker, Langley's record of achievements in aeronautics and aerospace research is without comparison; and it is a testament to the creativity, dedication, hard work, and technical excellence of the men and women who contributed their talents to the agency's mission. 
   But as a word of caution, it bears mentioning that U.S. aeronautics research and testing programs are declining, no matter that countries in Europe and elsewhere are investing heavily in aeronautics research. The health of the U.S. aviation industry depends upon aeronautics research and development, especially long-term research that private industry cannot perform itself, in order to compete in the world market. NASA is the only Federal agency that supports research on civilian aircraft. Their researchers are working to make our planes and our skies safer, and Mrs. Davis believed that this is a worthwhile investment of taxpayers' money. 
   I am pleased to join with my colleagues to commemorate the Langley Research Center on its anniversary, and I urge members to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 225, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 225 honoring the 50th anniversary of the dawn of the Space Age and the ensuing 50 years of productive and peaceful space activities. 
   Fifty years ago, only 12 years after the end of World War II, America was enjoying the unprecedented peace and prosperity that characterized the 1950s. 
   But on October 4, 1957, America was shaken out of its technological complacency. The Soviet Union launched a beeping 180-pound aluminum satellite into orbit. Sputnik's capability was a wake-up call because it represented a threat to America's national security and technological preeminence. 
   Our early space program was born out of a clash of ideals between civilizations and systems of government, but it reinvigorated our interest in science and technology leading to increased investment in both research and in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. 
   These investments contributed to a technologically skilled generation of Americans that has led the world in innovation and accomplishments. 
   Our leadership over the last 50 years has encouraged international partnerships that allow us to harness the imaginations and technical talents of many nations for the benefit of all mankind. There is less direct competition and more cooperation. 
   Today, about 60 percent of NASA's science missions and 100 percent of its human spaceflight activities are done in partnership with other nations. In the growing world economy, developing countries are imitating many of the values and traits that have made America successful, and we are adopting policies that promote education and investment in research and technology.     
   They clearly understand the link between an educated workforce, technological innovation and economic preeminence. The new global competition for preeminence in science and technological innovation must be met with a renewed American commitment to research and to science, technology, engineering and mathematics education akin to that which followed the dawn of the space age 50 years ago. 
   Over the next 50 years, it will be more critical, and not less, that we remain world leaders. Our ability to shape our destiny and influence others will depend upon it. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we mark the 50th anniversary of the dawn of the space age, Congress recognizes the value of investing in America's space program and declares that it is in America's interests to continue to advance knowledge and to improve life on Earth through a sustained national commitment to space exploration in all of its forms, led by a new generation of well-educated scientists, engineers and explorers. 
   I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.

It shapes how we communicate, how we entertain, and how we work with one another. Computers route our phone calls, print our paychecks, constantly tune our Nation's power plants and transmission lines to meet our energy demands. The extent to which our Nation's infrastructure, economy and way of life depend on computers is simply astounding. 
   Unfortunately, this reliance on information technology has also left us vulnerable to cyberattacks, viruses and worms, as well as identity theft. The National Cyber Security Alliance is a public-private partnership whose mission is to improve the safety of our computer networks at home and at work against those threats. 
   Mr. Speaker, the NCSA has declared October National Cyber Security Awareness Month and is sponsoring events throughout the country to raise awareness of the significant cybersecurity issues that we face as a Nation. There are straightforward steps we can take as individuals on our personal computers to help protect ourselves. 
   The NCSA has a Web site to help consumers and small businesses to prevent or respond to cyberattacks at StaySafeOnline.org. It includes tips such as how to create strong passwords, how to protect your children online, and what to do if you think something goes wrong. As part of Cyber Security Awareness Month, we should all visit StaySafeOnline.org and consider how we can better protect ourselves, such as by ensuring antivirus applications are installed and up to date. 
   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the organizations and agencies involved in the National Cyber Security Awareness Month for their efforts to help us all become more responsible and safer computer users. With that, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Lampson).

   Simulation uses combinations of sound, sight and motion to make you feel that you are experiencing an actual event. Modeling involves the complex computer models used to create these artificial environments. 
   For training purposes, modeling and simulation places people in an artificial, but seemingly real, environment and puts them through their paces. Unlike live training, if you make a mistake, you get to live another day and learn valuable lessons. 
   In the latter part of the 20th century, the U.S. military revolutionized warfighting by emphasizing this high-fidelity training that simulates the stress and decision-making of actual combat. Servicemen and -women gain experience and judgment previously only earned on the actual battlefield, often through serious injury and death. 
   Substantial amounts of that simulation and training come from my congressional district where representatives of all service branches collaborate with the University of Central Florida and private contractors of all sizes to produce these training systems. As other speakers will note, other clusters of modeling and simulation excellence exist throughout the United States. 
   But such training expands beyond military uses. Commercial aviation's  enviable safety record is due in part to aircraft simulator training that prepares cockpit crews to handle complex and fast-paced emergencies. 
   In that vein, medical simulation is an especially promising and emerging field. By creating artificial, but seemingly real, environments, doctors and nurses can hone their skills in using sophisticated and invasive medical technology or in treating severely injured patients. 
   Beyond training, modeling and simulation replicates complex environments, allowing planners and designers to ask various ``what if'' questions. 
   Transportation planners simulate highway networks to determine how best to alleviate congestion. Emergency management experts simulate large-scale natural or manmade disasters to better improve coordinated emergency responses. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the need to better use modeling and simulation in order to protect life and property during such disasters. 
   Because of these growing numbers of uses, the modeling and simulation industry is rapidly growing and demands the best students with extensive math and science backgrounds including psychology, medicine, computer science, mathematics, engineering and physics. 
   In addition to the cluster in Central Florida, there's a great cluster of modeling and simulation in the Fourth Congressional District represented by Congressman RANDY FORBES, and I'd like to indulge my colleagues to paraphrase some important comments by Congressman Forbes and then would like to insert his comments, the original text, in the Record. 
   Representative Forbes points out that we can test a new airplane in a wind tunnel without risking human life and without building full scale airplanes. The benefits and applications of this technology are immediately obvious. We can learn a system in a more cost-effective, timely and safer manner. And, furthermore, we can simulate thousands of scenarios over and over again on a computer when it is too hazardous, expensive, or impossible to perform real world tests. 
   So, in short, modeling simulation tools allow us to understand complex interactions that would otherwise be impossible to comprehend using other means. If modeling and simulation sounds like it has the promise to dramatically change the way we apply science in our world, the fact is that it has already done so. 
   This resolution seeks to recognize the countless efforts of professionals who have taken this technology and applied it to make the United States a safer and more prosperous Nation. 
   The impact of modeling and simulation technology is felt in the private sector, academia, government, and across disciplines. Modeling and simulation tools have streamlined the design and manufacture of cars, homes, boats and airplanes, to name a few devices. 
   Modeling and simulation software designed in Illinois, for example, assists automotive engineers in designing engines that are more efficient, while reducing emissions that impact adversely our environment. Modeling and simulation analysis is also used in the engineering of major roads, bridges, harbors, railways and airports, all of which lead to increased transportation capacity and safety. 
   At the United States Joint Forces Command in the Fourth District of Virginia, represented by Congressman Forbes, modeling and simulation tools have accelerated the effectiveness of joint interagency exercises run by the command. One of their experimentation projects is to enhance our national security by running scenarios in an urban combat environment. The goal is to provide lessons learned for our troops in theater before they encounter the same situation on the ground. 
   Because of these kinds of valuable contributions, this resolution honors modeling and simulation by recognizing it as a national critical technology. National critical technology refers to those technologies essential to develop long-term national security and economic prosperity for our country. One example of the success historically of modeling and simulation is the famous Manhattan Project. It was early models and simulators that allowed scientists to develop an understanding of nuclear chain reactions that ultimately led to the end of World War II. 
   America's military have used simulators to train personnel for flying aircraft, ships, and we now use simulators to train soldiers and marines to detect roadside IEDs. 
   Additionally, in the past, medical malpractice insurance rates have included artificially high premiums because it was difficult to reduce the number of medical errors for certain medical procedures that were not routinely performed. Today, insurance discounts are being provided to anesthesiologists and obstetricians who include simulated procedures in their biennial training requirements. 
   Madam Speaker, the advantages that we have reaped from modeling and simulation go across all congressional districts and benefit all Americans in ways that are often unseen. I am thrilled to be a cosponsor of this resolution today. 
   I want to thank the chairman. The future is very bright and modeling, simulation and training will lead the way to make it a safer, brighter future for all Americans.  
   Central Florida represents one of the larger if not the largest Modeling and Simulation clusters in the United States. The Navy's NAVAIR Orlando and the Army's PEO-STRI are based in my District. Over 100 Modeling and Simulation companies directly employ over 6,000 people. Having reached a critical mass in Central Florida, the Modeling and Simulation industry continues to expand. 
   Central Florida achieved critical mass by leveraging relationships among military, academic, industry, and government entities. Locally, we refer to this rich and complex web of cooperation, collaboration, and partnerships as Team Orlando. 
   Over 50 years before ``jointness'' and ``transformation'' became favored concepts in the Department of Defense, the Navy and Army demonstrated these traits in Orlando by starting a partnership for the development of training systems. The Air Force and Marines joined as full partners during the 1990s. All military services use a common infrastructure of facilities, contracting, administration, and technology. 
   Collaboration with academia is demonstrated by the University of Central Florida and its Institute for Simulation and Training. 
   The private sector is represented by a portfolio of Modeling and Simulation companies. Recognized and established entities are present such as Lockheed Martin and SAIC. But Central Florida is also home to scores of innovative, entrepreneurial start-ups such as IDEAL Technologies and Vcom3D. 
   The lessons learned from Central Florida's experience can be applied nationally. Modeling and Simulation isn't a zero-sum game where success in one geographic area comes at the expense of another. This technology holds so much promise that everyone benefits from national cooperation and collaboration. 
   Today's resolution will help create a unified national identity for this technology. And it will raise this technology's profile within the Department of Defense, other government agencies, and the private sector. 
   Modeling and simulation allows us to better understand and control complex systems ranging from highway systems, manufacturing and processing facilities, and emergency management systems. Modeling and simulation also trains people to handle complex and fast-paced situations ranging from warfighting to emergency medical care. 
   So I urge support of this resolution recognizing modeling and simulation as a National Critical Technology.  
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FEENEY. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. I appreciate the gentlelady's amendment. And I suppose I can't argue that it does a great deal of harm under the bill, because what the bill essentially does is it takes millions of potential homebuyers and makes them ineligible, as a practical matter, for loans. And so all we're doing is taking those million people that can't get loans and saying one more type of loan they can't get is a loan with a prepayment penalty that lasts longer than 3 years built in. 
   Having said that, assuming some potential homebuyers escape the penalties under this bill and they actually do qualify to get a loan that puts them in a house that they like and that's affordable, what the gentlelady's amendment does is to make the marginal interest rate they may have to pay higher. 
   As the gentlelady said, lenders have demonstrated, I think conclusively, that there are lower interest rates available at times if you have a prepayment penalty built in because they know that that loan is going to be out there for 15, 20 or 30 years putting a stream of money into the pocket of the lender. That's why they do the more attractive long-term interest rate. 
   Now, I happen to not like prepayment penalties. Most Americans move a lot. But there are Americans, for example, on a fixed income that are retired and have a pension and they know they're going to be in a house for a long period of time and they don't mind a prepayment penalty. 
   What the gentlelady does is to take choices away from homeowners. By the way, I agree with the notion that we ought to have informed consent. There is nobody here arguing that we shouldn't inform consumers what the prepayment penalty is, what the consequences can be. What we are suggesting is that when you limit for 3 years the amount of the prepayment penalty, there are some homebuyers that otherwise would be able to get an attractive interest rate, buy the home of their dreams, stay in that home for 15 or 20 years and never pay the penalty that will never, ever get to move into that home because the gentlelady thought, in general, prepayment penalties are a bad idea for everybody. They are a bad idea for some people. If you move a lot, if you're going to have your circumstances changed, they can be a very bad idea. I negotiated a slightly higher interest rate because I do not have a prepayment penalty on my mortgage, but I think that individual free men and women, after they are informed, ought to be making these choices and not the Congress of the United States. 
   Again, I don't think this is a horrendous amendment because what the bill does is to say to millions of potential borrowers, as a practical matter, they will be ineligible going forward to get access to credit. But this makes a really bad bill marginally worse. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. I am grateful to my friend the ranking member and to the chairman, and I do oppose the manager's amendment and the bill. And I don't think there is any difference of  opinion about the crisis in the mortgage markets in America today. I think the difference is on the impact that this bill will have. 
   The problem in mortgage markets in America today is that for years we had lenders that were giving teaser rate loans, that were taking no paperwork requirements to prove that borrowers had the ability to buy the home and pay for it. And we had lenders making 100 percent, 110 percent, 120 percent loan-to-value loans. And, obviously, that worked fine when property values were increasing. When property values declined, you have got a crisis. 
   In essence, what has happened is that we have had this wild galloping horse in the credit markets of mortgages that has gotten loose. Now that horse has gotten very sick. There are none of these loans being made. As a matter of fact, credible buyers with paperwork, with 20 or 30 percent equity, can't get access to mortgage loans today in many instances. 
   What we are doing for this sick horse is to feed it strychnine. The markets having overreacted, we as Congress are going to pile on and kill the horse with poison. And the difference we have about this bill and this manager's amendment is on the impact it will have. 
   Does it help poor people, middle-income people that want to get access to homeownership? No.

   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the ranking member yielding on this. 
   Everybody deserves as much notice as possible when their obligations in life are going to change. Every mortgage describes the terms of how the note and the loan will change. 
   One of the problems I see with this bill is when you are required to give a borrower 6-months' notice on what their interest rate is going to be, my understanding is that some mortgages are triggered off dates that may be only 3 or 4 months in advance of the reset date. For example, does a lender have to guess high? Does a lender have to estimate 3 or 4 months out rates are going to go up so they are going to basically send the borrower notice 6 or 7 or 8 months ahead of time so they comply with this very burdensome notice regulation, and they are basically going to stick a borrower, perhaps, with a higher interest rate if the market actually lets interest rates come down than they would have otherwise been able to do.     
   I don't know whether you have to send a new notice or an adjusted notice also in terms of the alternatives that we have to describe. There are lots of alternatives if you are going to have trouble making your mortgage payment. You could hit the lottery, I suppose. You could hope that a rich uncle passes away and endows you. There are all sorts of potential alternatives. 
   Now, if we had a form list of three or four potential things that a borrower could do, that might make sense. But I think this is very subjective. 
   And speaking of the subjectivity, something I wanted to get to earlier, one of the big problems with this bill is that it has all sorts of subjective requirements, for example, that lenders cannot make loans that are not the most appropriate loans. Who knows, other than 20/20 hindsight, whether a loan was appropriate in specific circumstances? Supposing that a family gets divorced? A loan that might have been appropriate one day may be inappropriate. Suppose somebody loses their job or gets sick? 
   And the other huge subjective part of this entire bill is the net tangible benefits test. Supposing I go take out a loan for $100,000. I decide to go down and decide to play the ponies and I win a 10:1 payment, I become a millionaire. Well, that loan after the fact turned out to have huge net tangible benefits to me. 
   On the other hand, supposing I take out a $100,000 loan and put it in investments in the stock market and the market gets jittery because Congress is talking about all sorts of tax hikes. Supposing my stocks decrease from $100,000 to $50,000. Well, it turns out after the fact that my taking out that loan to put the money in the stock market did not have much net tangible benefit. 
   These subjective tests are a nightmare for people trying to provide credit in America.

   By the way, we are not renouncing everything that the Bush administration has done. Tax cuts and pro-growth issues, the fact that we have not had a terrorist strike since 9/11 are all a few things that we ought to recognize about the Bush administration. 
   But look, Congress messed up before Congressman Garrett and I got here. We are now outsourcing because of section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley America's 100-year lead in world capital markets. Like it or not, this was never debated in the House. It was added in the Senate; 264 words, section 404 was added. Nobody knew what the cost of this would be. 
   By the way, the Securities and Exchange Commission testified in the Senate that it would cost the average company $92,000 a year. It turns out to be more like 30 times that. Being off by 30 times is bad work even by government standards. It's amazing. 
   I will tell you that one study published by the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institute says that the drag on the American economy is equivalent to a $1.1 trillion regulatory tax on the U.S. economy. That is about an 8 percent tax on everything we do. It is unbelievable.

   If we want Shanghai and Hong Kong and London to be the leader in capital markets, so be it. But we are fiddling while the capital markets burn. I admire my chairman, Mr. Frank. I think it is too little too late to let the SEC fiddle while the capital markets of America burn to their death.

   The chairman is very sophisticated. He understands free markets more than anybody even though he doesn't always believe in free markets. But the truth of the matter is we have lost our capital market leadership for the first time in 100 years. There may be other variables, and I would agree with the chairman. But one of the variables is Sarbanes-Oxley is discouraging investment in America. By the way, American investors are sending their money overseas. 
   And I would ask the chairman very briefly: Do you agree or not agree that overtaxation, overregulation through Sarbanes-Oxley, and section 404, by the way, was never debated in the committee that you now chair. It was done in the Senate.

   Mr. FEENEY. I thank the gentlelady. I thank my good friend, Mr. Donnelly, and Chairman Frank. 
   Manufactured housing, as has been said, plays a vital role in meeting the needs of families to get affordable, attractive and safe housing throughout our country. There are some 18 million Americans that live in manufactured housing in America. And as the gentleman from Indiana just said, the quality and the attractions just get better every day. It is an important source of quality affordable housing, and it helps new entry-level buyers as well as retirees trying to downsize on both ends of the housing spectrum, whether getting in for the first time or they're living perhaps in the last home that they will own. 
   It is a responsible means of homeownership that can play a major role in the solution to America's affordable housing problem. The average price of today's manufactured housing hovers somewhere around $48,000, and in a challenging mortgage market where fewer and fewer people have access to credit, this is one way to solve the problem that many homeowners have. 
   There are lots of homeowners today throughout America that are losing their homes in foreclosure. And yet because of the affordable nature of manufactured housing, they have not seen a dramatic rise in most places as we have in some communities in the rate of foreclosure throughout the country. Manufactured housing is an important component of the solution for affordability and access to the American Dream for every American. 
   June is designated as the National Home Ownership Month. One of the great choices Americans have is for quality manufactured housing. Again, I thank the sponsor of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   I would suggest that the real math is that this amendment would still anticipate a $6.5 billion increase, yet it is being called a cut. 
   I had to come down from my office, because I heard that if you were an advocate for taxpayers, you are now part of the fringe of this Congress. If you are an advocate for fiscal responsibility, suddenly you are part of the fringe. Sadly, I would have to acknowledge, if you care about fiscal responsibility and taxpayers in this Congress, you are becoming part of the fringe. 
   Increasing the budget expenditures by 4.3 percent is somehow going to lead to the end of civilization and the death of all of the children out there and throwing people out of hospital beds. 
   I would remind all of my colleagues, we have a 10th amendment in this country. Over the years, we now have a $150 billion-plus annual budget to deal with things like labor, health care and education. It isn't a question of whether or not we are going to spend money in America on health care and education. It is a question of who does the spending and who gets to control it.  
   I would ask every American, as the Federal budget has skyrocketed and we have taken control and micromanaged their health care and education, has public education gotten cheaper? Has it gotten better? Has America's health care system, as we spend so much money on health care, gotten cheaper and gotten better? 
   Winston Churchill once famously said, there is nothing one government learns so readily from the last as how to spend other people's money, i.e., the taxpayers. 
   Sadly, this new majority did not learn the lesson that some of us learned in the last several Congresses: we are spending too much, we are abusing American taxpayers, and the notion is that if you care for children, if you care for people that need health care, you have to confiscate as much money out there from taxpayers and working people as possible and you have to micromanage the way it gets spent on so-called ``their behalf.'' 
   The bureaucrats are happy. The regulators are happy. The politicians in Washington are fat and happy. But the American taxpayer and the people that need real education services and need choices in health care are not happy. 
   With that, on behalf of the fringe that cares about taxpayers in this Congress, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from Texas for yielding. It is an enormous challenge to follow a distinguished gentleman, the dean of the House from Michigan, who comes and asks us to invest in America. Indeed, all of us feel passionately about the investors and, more importantly, the workers, not just in Michigan, but around the country, that are currently dependent on the automobile industry in America. 
   But, as the gentleman from Michigan pleaded we ought to invest in America, the truth of the matter is the reason we are here tonight is that nobody in their right mind is willing to invest their own money in a failed and antiquated model. So they are asking Congress to confiscate money from taxpayers to make an investment. 
   That is what this is about. It is a short-term bailout so we can get until March so that much, much more money will be spent bailing out these failed and antiquated industries. 
   There are people in Florida hurting, not just in the automobile industry. We have got automobile dealers and salespeople and parts manufacturers. Our real estate industry is devastated, our time share industry, our theme park industry, our hotels and motels and restaurants. 
   But the truth of the matter is, micromanaging a business from Washington is the supreme act of hubris. It will never work. No matter how much the administration, no matter how much the Congress wants to do the right thing, they will hurt us. 
   110 years ago, the United States Congress probably felt bad for people that manufactured buggy whips and horse carriages. We could have bailed them out. We could have created a buggy whip and horse carriage czar. It would not have helped America move towards prosperity and freedom. And, unfortunately, this is a terrible idea that will punish taxpayers and just prolong the agony. I ask us to vote for freedom and free markets and reject this bailout.

<DOCNO>Mr. FEENEY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the genuine American hero from Texas, Mr. Johnson, for leading us this afternoon. 
   I supported the use of military force to remove Saddam Hussein's regime because it was in America's interests. Afterwards, it should have been up to the Iraqi people, and not Americans, to determine their fate and how they govern themselves. President Bush has stated: The survival of our liberty depends on its expansion throughout the world and America must actively construct those institutions. Which, to me, seems like a Wilsonian view of America's role in the world. 
   In 2000, Candidate Bush rejected nation-building. A view held by the Founding Fathers who believed the exceptional calling of the American people was not to shape the world in our image, but to be a light that lightens the world. I prefer Candidate Bush's position. 
   Having said that, I cannot support Representative Skelton's resolution. Nothing better illustrates America's democratic institutions than this body having a full and open debate about this topic. 
   I hope the Commander in Chief will recognize the desires and concerns of the American people as expressed today through their elected Representatives. But America has only one, and not 535 commanders in chief. We cannot micromanage the conduct of a war. Representative Skelton's resolution sends horribly mixed signals to our troops who must solely focus on carrying out their assigned and dangerous mission. 
   Once a decision has been made and mission assigned, this body should support the troops and their one and only Commander in Chief, as Representative Johnson's resolution, had it been heard, would have been done. 
   Critics of tactics who resort to a congressional resolution tell our servicemen and women and their families, intentionally or not, that their mission is futile. When we undermine hope, we undermine resolve, and we reduce the likelihood of success. 
   As Senator Lieberman has stated, a resolution would, in quotes, ``give the enemy some encouragement, some clear expression that the American people are divided.'' Or, as Army Sergeant Daniel Dobson expressed, ``There is no honor in retreat, and there is no honor in what the Democrats have proposed.'' 
   Instead, the responsible thing for this Democratic-led Congress would have been to propose a new way forward, new tactics, new strategies, not just in Iraq but in the entire war on terror. Speaker Rayburn, a Democratic Speaker, once famously remarked, ``Any jackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a carpenter to build one.'' There are no carpenters at work with this resolution. 
   God bless our troops. God bless their Commander in Chief. God bless America.  
   Shortly after I entered Congress in 2003, America used military force to remove the Saddam Hussein regime. I supported that action because it was in America's interest. 
   The Hussein regime repeatedly defied the terms that ended the 1991 Gulf War--the transparent and verifiable dismantlement of the capability to produce weapons of mass destruction. Previously, that regime had used such weapons and wielded the potential of such weapons against its enemies. Rather than resorting to openness to demonstrate good faith compliance with its promises, the regime relied on Soviet-style deception and defiance. 
   In the face of such opaqueness, why are we surprised that the intelligence agencies of the United States and its Allies veered to a worst-case scenario? After all, the perceived ``missile gap'' that fueled the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union stemmed from Soviet deception about its actual nuclear weapon capabilities. The fault lies with those who deceive and not those searching for the truth. 
   The perceived threat extended beyond the Middle East and raised the specter of arming terrorists dedicated to harming the United States and the West. To those who scoff at this notion, I remind them about the dangers posed by ``loose nukes'' and how the West works everyday to counter this threat. 
   Furthermore, this brutal regime repeatedly attacked its neighbors--threatening the stability of America's allies and interests in this region. 
   So with some sturdy allies, America took action. The Hussein regime was toppled. Others took notice. Libya surrendered its weapons of mass destruction capabilities to the U.S. including materials related to its nuclear weapons program and ballistic missile capabilities. 
   Today's U.S. military is the finest in world history. 
   America can defeat any contemporary enemy by itself. But, we cannot win the peace alone. We need help--not just from loyal friends like the British, Poles, and Australians. To win a peace, we need less reliable allies like France, Germany, and Spain to help. And we need support, or at least not hostile opposition, from former adversaries we are trying to befriend, like Russia and China. In this case, we have had too little help to win the peace. 
   And instead of focusing on establishing a free and stable Iraq, America strayed from the wisdom of its Founding Fathers who warned us of the hazards of trying to shape the world in our image. As John Quincy Adams noted in his 1821 Fourth of July Speech: 
   ``America does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy.'' To do so would involve the United States ``beyond the power of extrication, in all wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition....... She might become the dictatress of the world. She would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.'' 
   The Founding Fathers believed that the exceptional calling of the American people was not to shape the world in our image but to be a light to lighten the world. Our exercise and preservation of liberty served as an example to other peoples. In today's world, we can see how our culture and international trade influence other peoples. But a critical difference  exists between being an example and trying to impose a set of beliefs.
