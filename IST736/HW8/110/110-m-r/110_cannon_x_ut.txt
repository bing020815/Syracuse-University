<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment that I offered on behalf of myself, Mr. Mark Udall, Mr. Rob Bishop, Mr. Matheson, Mr. Heller, Mr. Salazar, and Mrs. Musgrave. This bipartisan amendment will redirect roughly $20 million in departmental salaries and expenses to the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program to bring the total appropriation to nearly $253 million. 
   I am pleased to be working with this bipartisan group and thank my colleagues for their support. All of us have something in common. We represent some of the 1,900 counties spread across every State but Rhode Island that have public lands that rely on the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program to mitigate the impact of the lost tax revenue resulting from Federal land ownership. 
   The Federal Government owns nearly 650 million acres of land, mostly in the West. We have a map here that shows all the land owned or held in the trust by the government in red. It is important to see exactly how much of the land in the West is owned by the Federal Government. In fact, the amount of land owned by the Federal Government is amazing. 
   This is an amazing amount of Federal ownership and control by the Federal Government. That means that we do not tax those lands and that means that in the Western United States we pay less per child for education, but we tax our people more per family because we are supporting the Federal Government. In other words, we don't tax these lands; we tax ourselves more. 
   As the chairman of the Western Caucus, I know all too well that my fellow colleagues throughout the West are struggling with these issues, and also in many districts in the East, where there is a great deal of public lands. 
   It is only fair that we pay a reasonable amount in lieu of taxes to cover this shortfall. The Payment in Lieu of Taxes program was created in 1976 to provide payments to counties to make up for property taxes they were prevented from collecting on Federal lands located within their boundaries. 
   This year, the administration's budget proposal proposed to cut PILT by $34 million, to a paltry 56 percent of the authorized level. The past few years have seen Congress achieve historic levels of PILT funding. We are grateful to Chairman Dicks and Ranking Member Tiahrt for their efforts to restore PILT to the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. 
   While the appropriation currently in the bill is significantly above the administration's recommendation, it is far from what it should be, and our counties are bearing the brunt of it. While the Department's administrative budget has nearly doubled since 2001, PILT funding levels have not kept pace, and this is not acceptable.  
   It is imperative that we raise funding so that our rural counties won't have to continue to foot the bill for lands owned by the Federal Government. I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment to bring PILT funding levels to nearly 70 percent of the authorized amount and to support the counties that host public lands. 
   Although I will continue to fight for full funding for PILT, this amendment is a step in the right direction and adds a modest sum to the PILT program, a sum that is important to Americans who live in public lands communities, as well as to all the visitors who visit our public lands.

   Mr. CANNON. Madam Chairman, reclaiming my time, I very much appreciate the gentleman's point. The fact is, this is much higher than the President's proposal. I appreciate that. Our job here is to balance how we fund these various programs. The inequity that has been perpetrated on Western counties, where you see these massive amounts, including in your State, of public lands that are not adequately supported by a tax base is very important. 
   I thank the gentleman very much for his support thus far.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, it is essential that we keep the second amendment protections on BLM lands. This motion to recommit will prevent the NLCS from imposing a complete ban on the right to bear arms like the National Park Service. 
   In 2006 the National Park Service prevented visitors from protecting themselves, and 11 individuals were murdered, 35 were raped, and 16 were kidnapped. We cannot let the NLCS become an area where the public won't go because they can't protect themselves. 
   There's a crisis on our Federal lands, especially along the southern border, and a National Park Service second amendment restriction will ensure only the drug traffickers, rapists, and murderers will have guns. The ability to carry firearms on these lands for personal protection is a mere lawsuit and a sympathetic judge away from being denied. 
   The Altmire amendment already agreed to preserve certain rights, but the vague language of this legislation leaves second amendment rights woefully unprotected. The second amendment was never meant to provide cafeteria-style rights for legislators, for us to pick and choose. The second amendment is a constitutional right which you either support or oppose. This motion to recommit will unequivocally make sure that is the case. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (NATIONAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION SYSTEM ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that is necessary to refine the vague language contained within this bill. 
   The legislation requires the lands included in the National Landscape Conservation System be managed for values, without ever defining what the term values means. 
   As we all know, values have different meaning to different people. In the case of land management agencies, values can range from cultural and historic resources to things as nebulous as ``smell-scapes.'' 
   The loose definition of the underlying bill leaves the Federal Government open to litigation based on what someone may or may not determine to be consistent with what they believe are the values of lands included within the National Landscape Conservation System. 
   Our Federal land management agencies are currently overwhelmed with litigation which distracts from their primary mission of land management. 
   This amendment will prevent unnecessary and onerous litigation. 
   While the underlying legislation has a savings clause, it does not prevent the bringing of a lawsuit. We have been assured time and again that activities on these lands currently allowed will continue without a problem. However, the language does not include important and defined terms such as multiple use. 
   To illustrate the problem, in the event that multiple use activities such as grazing are currently accruing on lands within the NLCS system and an individual or group decides that grazing activities are not consistent with the values of NLCS lands, they can sue to stop the grazing activities. Consequently, a permitted activity is left open under this new regime to lawsuits based on the loose definition of values. 
   Most of the parameters by which management is to occur are clearly defined. Passage of the underlying bill would create standards which are not practical to administer. This will allow external groups of all kinds to challenge the BLM's management of NCLS lands based upon what the perceived values of these lands are. 
   My amendment merely will prohibit lawsuits against the Bureau of Land Management based on how they manage the lands under the NLCS system. 
   Given the huge cost that we are now suffering with litigation, preventing unnecessary litigation should be a goal of this body. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support getting dollars to the ground for management, rather than tying them up in legal proceedings. 
   I urge support for this amendment and reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (HONORING THE SACRIFICE AND COURAGE OF THOSE WHO WERE KILLED IN THE CRANDALL CANYON MINE DISASTER, AND RECOGNIZING THE RESCUE CREWS FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING EFFORTS -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank first of all my colleague, Rob Bishop, for yielding me time and my colleague, Jim Matheson, for bringing this resolution before us. We appreciate his introduction. This is an area that he represents. It is an area that I have represented in the past. It's an area which I expect to represent in the future if we get the fourth, if the Senate will act on giving a vote to the District of Columbia and a fourth seat to the State of Utah. 
   I rise in support of this resolution and in support of the thousands of miners throughout Utah and the rest of the United States and throughout the world who undertake this difficult and dangerous work. 
   After weeks of watching demonstrations, videos and explanations of the process, no American can doubt the courage and dedication of these brave men and women who work in darkness so that the rest of us can work with light. 
   John Wayne defined courage the way a miner would define it. ``Courage is being scared to death and saddling up anyway.'' The miners of Utah saddle up every day, and they deserve our thanks. 
   Miners Kerry Allred, Don Erickson, Juan Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips, Manuel Sanchez and Jose Luis Hernandez all ``saddled up'' in the best traditions of Utah and make us proud.     
   The tragedy on August 6 is indelibly imprinted on the hearts and minds of all Utahns. But as it always has in times of need, America's best responded. The rescue effort spared no expense and left no stone unturned in trying to reach the six sons of Utah trapped below. In the process three rescuers lost their lives and more were injured. 
   Americans should take heart to know that we have such men as Gary Jensen, Brandon Kimber, and Dale ``Bird'' Black who would risk their lives for others. The Bible tells us that greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for another. Imagine the love, dedication, and courage it takes to lay down one's life for a friend or stranger. 
   In moments such as these, politicians tend to try to do too much and accomplish too little. While there will be time to decide what, if anything, we need to do to ensure that such tragedies as these can be averted, now is the time for elected representatives for the people to thank those involved on behalf of the people. 
   Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ``The true test of civilization is not the census, nor the size of cities, nor the crops, no, but the kind of man the country turns out.'' Utah and America turn out the best, and for that we thank their families, our communities, and Almighty God.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. I would like to speak this evening about energy policy in America, and the sources of energy, and I expect to be joined here in this discussion with several other Members of Congress. Adrian Smith from Nebraska is going to be speaking to us, and I will yield to him very shortly about the Alaskan National Wildlife Reserve; John Peterson will be with us about natural gas and the need to develop that resource; Rob Bishop will join us I think shortly to talk about what it means in the human costs to not have the resources that we need. We expect to be joined by Phil Gingrey of Georgia and perhaps John Shimkus of Illinois as well.     
   Let me begin by just saying that the U.S. policy to use corn for ethanol and drive up the prices of grain worldwide and to not develop the resources that we have so richly in America are not morally neutral. They are profoundly wrong. So I hope that after some discussion about these issues tonight, our colleagues in Congress will begin to understand what the resources are and how we can use them. 
   Now I would like to yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith), and when he is finished talking about the ANWR issue, I would like to put that in perspective by talking about what other resources we have and how that fits. But drilling in ANWR is profoundly important. If we had done that some years ago, we would absolutely not have prices over $100 a barrel for oil. 
   I yield to Mr. Smith.

   Mr. CANNON. Thank you. They won't be hard. I might point out in Utah we had 76 billion tons of coal locked up by one monument that President Clinton made, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. That is the equivalent, the gentleman mentioned coal-to-liquid, that is the equivalent of 150 billion barrels of oil locked up in a monument. 
   But let me make sure I have these numbers right, because they are actually startling. The whole Alaska National Wildlife Reserve is 19.6 million, almost 20 million acres. That is bigger than most northeastern States.

And so we have about 1.5 million acres that were set aside by President Carter and the Congress when the refuge was established for oil development. Now we are talking about 2,000 acres of land to develop oil on. That is the proposal. That yields 10 billion barrels of oil.

   Mr. CANNON. Those speculators have virtually no downside. The upside is limited only by what they are willing to guess on in the future. So to bring that oil price down, I think we need to bring some new sources on or make it clear we are going to bring some new sources on. I think, like the gentleman, that would cause these prices to plummet.

It is obscene. If we had been thoughtful about ANWR, if we had acknowledged the desires of the people who live in ANWR, who care about the land in ANWR, we would be drilling there, having minimal effects, and producing a much, much lower price for gas. That is an obscenity that we ought to be rid of.

   Mr. CANNON. As you leave, I appreciate that. I drove to a new gas station the other day. I went to the pump and put my card in and got ready to pay for the gas, and as I did that, I reached over to get the gas hose and it said $4.39 a gallon. I was stunned. Then I looked. It was green and I realized that that pump had a diesel handle on it as well. The 15 or 20 percent better mileage you get doesn't cover the extra dollar that you pay, the 25 percent higher prices. So I sympathize with the gentleman. 
   But I would point out that oil shale is essentially diesel fuel and then can be used for that, and if we develop that, it should bring your prices down, Mr. Smith, significantly, and all the rest of the world's as well, which I think is the right thing to do. 
   Thank you very much for your time. We appreciate that. 
   We are now joined by Congressman Bishop from Utah, who agreed to join us despite the fact he is hosting a group of German members of the Bundestag. So I would like to turn some time over to him to talk about whatever he wishes, but probably the human costs of these horrible energy prices and policies that we have in America. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. CANNON. Would the gentleman be willing to enter into a colloquy? 
   We talked a little bit about innovation. I think that in the bill that we are proposing as the Western Caucus, we have some prizes in there for energy efficiency including what is under consideration, a prize for a motor or an engine or gasoline engine that would go say 100 miles per gallon. And the gentleman probably knows this, but the typical engine in America gets about 17 percent efficiency. In other words, you get about 17 percent of the energy out. The highest efficiency are diesel engines on long-haul trucks, which get about 35 percent; meaning 70, 65, or 83 percent is wasted in the process. 
   If innovation would support us in doubling the efficiency of engines, what would happen to the price of gasoline in America and diesel?

   Mr. CANNON. Heaven help us, from experts sitting in Washington who get paid to continue the problem instead of solve the problem. 
   Thank you, Mr. Bishop. Appreciate your time. 
   Let me just point out that production and conservation are both matters of innovation. We're going to talk tonight about new ways to innovate in production, and also in other areas of conservation. 
   A new motor would conserve a great deal, a new, more efficient motor would conserve a great deal of energy. And I think that if you doubled the efficiency of engines on the highway today, or if you had an engine that doubled the efficiency, the threat of that doubling of efficiency would almost immediately result in a plummeting of the price of oil overnight, without any additional production. 
   We're joined now by Congressman Peterson from Pennsylvania. And Mr. Peterson has been a great advocate of developing our natural gas resources with reasons why this is a critical part of what we're doing in the country. And I would yield to Mr. Peterson as much time as he may consume. And hopefully, at the end of your presentation, we can chat a little bit about what this means for America.

   Mr. CANNON. You know, looking at that chart is actually a little disturbing, because unless we produce a great deal more natural gas, our current reserves being diminished, or diminishing, we have to import a lot of natural gas. So if we're not going to do coal power plants, if that chart, instead of widening for coal, shrinks for coal, then you have to widen natural gas, which means you're going to have to import a great deal of natural gas.

   2. That means, instead of expanding, coal declines. Coal declines. Natural gas goes up. 
   So now all of sudden you just listed all the things that we use natural gas in. And I add those things all to be an inflationary environment where, in particular, food prices go up, or continue to go up, having doubled, in some cases tripled over the last couple of years.

You can't double or triple people's natural gas costs, their heating costs in their homes. You know, personally sometimes I drive in the wintertime even without a coat on. If I jumped out of my truck and went into that store, I'm not sure I would be comfortable, but that's one of the costs that we're imposing on people. 
   We cannot--the American people are not going to allow us to maintain these idiotic policies that lock up resources while people are actually going hungry in other parts of the world because we're using corn for ethanol and we are taking natural gas, and instead of turning it into fertilizer, we're bidding it off to the Japanese, the Chinese, and the Indians.

   And included in that mark-up we are going to have a vote on ANWR, and we will have other votes that I think will be profoundly important. 
   It was in the mark-up a year ago that the Democrats, over our objections and over our votes, insisted that BLM not be allowed to go forward with its regulatory scheme for oil shale. We're now a year behind on that. It was in the appropriations bill last year. The Democrats put a provision that prohibited the use of any money that BLM had for processing permits on BLM property. Thank heaven that we have school trust lands that can be developed for oil shale. But without that, we would be in real trouble.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Thank you, Mr. Peterson. We agree on that point. I think that for the first time in maybe our tenure in Congress, we're going to see a huge increase in the Natural Resources Committee markup of an energy bill to see if we're going to actually drill in ANWR, if we're going to drill in the Intercontinental Shelf and loosen up our drilling elsewhere around the country. 
   But that sort of begs the question, right now we're talking about various kinds of oil and gas. Let me put some context here. 
   In our conventional oil resources we have about 50 billion barrels that we know about. That includes 10 billion in ANWR. These are in the United States of America. We have some oil sands. Those are very difficult to develop in America. They're very different from the oil sands in Canada where each grain has a little molecule of water so the oil comes off the sand with just a little bit of heat. 
   We have about 100 million barrels of oil on the Outer Continental Shelf, and all of that adds up to about 200, 225 million barrels of oil that we have available to us today in the United States. 
   Think about that. 225 barrels of oil. We now have, and I'm going to pull up a chart here. We have in oil shale about 1.4, 1.3, let's see, that's ``trillion'' barrels of oil. I'm sorry. That's not ``billion'' barrels of oil, that's ``trillion'' barrels of oil in Colorado. In Utah, we have about 800 million barrels of oil and Wyoming about 500 million barrels of oil. Those are millions. We're not talking about a lousy 225 million barrels in all of our other resources. We're talking about 2.6 trillion barrels of oil that are available to America today in oil shale. 
   Now, let's pull up the map, if we can here. This is a map of Utah. Idaho is over in the corner, southeast Wyoming and northeast Colorado, and you can see the dark green are areas with more intense reserves of oil shale and that the lighter green are areas where you have not quite as dense oil shale. And these are the areas that have the oil that we were just talking about, 1.2 trillion barrels in Wyoming, 800 million barrels in Utah. These reserves are different, and the way to get them out, the way to get the oil out is going to differ between those. 
   Let's talk for just a moment about why we can be actually talking about producing oil out of shale today whereas it did not work in the past. 
   In the old days, and over here you see on the side it says ``past oil shale efforts,'' we used heat to convert kerogen. We broke the shale up and put it into a rotary kiln, and then heated it up. The problem is you needed enough heat in that rotary kiln to get the kerogen out, but at the same time, that was hot enough so that the rock melted into itself; and so you would have to shut the operation down occasionally and go in with sledge hammers, literally, and knock the rock out that had melted into itself. 
   Today you use chemistry and minimal heat to convert the kerogen to oil. 
   That's a profound difference, and there are about six different companies, four large companies and two small companies, that are using different kinds of technology to get with a smaller amount of heat to convert that kerogen to take it out of the shale. Kerogen, by the way, is a lot like diesel fuel and comes out of the system, very close to that. Needs to be cleaned up a little bit. It's like JP-8 diesel fuel. 
   In the old days, we mined this. We had a strip mine or room and pillar mining, and then we brought the shale to the surface to be processed. Today, the focus is on in situ recovery and conversion. 
   Back in the day, low-quality energy, intensive product, or low-quality energy, intensive product to refine; that is you had to put a lot of energy in it and it was hard to refine. And today you have high-quality value product with minimal cost to refine, and then we were focused on the resource back then, and now we're focused on balanced environmental, technical, and economically sustainable methods. 
   The fact is we've transformed the way we work technologically in the world today, and we can get these resources out of the ground much more cheaply. 
   Let's talk just for a moment about the reserves that we have--or what we use imported to the United States and the world's reserves. 
   The Saudi Arabians have about 264 billion barrels of reserves that we know about. Canada has about 179 million or billion barrels of oil, Iran has 138, Iraq, 115, and Kuwait 102. And the people that supply this oil are Mexico, and these are average barrels per day that we import. 
   So from Canada we import about 2.43 million barrels of oil, from Mexico 1.53, from Saudi Arabia 1.49, from Venezuela 1.36, and from Nigeria 1.13, and then we import a great deal more from other countries who export lesser amounts to us as we go. 
   These are not exactly the kind of people that we want to be relying on except with the exception of Canada perhaps and also to some degree Mexico, and that's improving. 
   And in the last couple minutes we have before we finish this, let me just say that this is complicated. The natural resources is complicated and the technology is complicated, but we've advanced dramatically in our knowledge and understanding of how to do that. We have now, today, for the first time in 30 years a commercial test going on here in eastern Utah of how to get oil shale out of--oil out of shale, and we think that test will be done about September 15, and the projection is we will be able to get oil out of shale for $30 a barrel. 
   Now consider this: Trillions of barrels of oil at about $30 a barrel. That's profound. I think that cost is going to actually go lower than $30 a barrel, and I'm about to introduce a bill that will allow the President to cut through the permitting processes and allow us to develop our oil shale at a reasonable time using reasonable understanding of the technology and the environmental impacts so that we can actually bring that shale to market, bring down the cost of oil, stop funding our enemies in Iran and Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and start producing oil in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (MANAGING PUBLIC LANDS -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. I thank the gentleman from Utah, my colleague, for recognizing me and organizing this event, and you've seen his blue chart. I grew up thinking that blue meant Republicans. We had this anomaly here recently, because red normally meant the Soviets. I have here a map of the United States, and when Ronald Reagan saw this map it was in red, that is, the public lands that you see mostly in the western part of the United States were in red. He looked at that and he compared that to a Soviet state, and he said he'd never seen so much government domination as is expressed by that since the Soviet Union. 
   So, not being partisan about these issues, which are really in fact not partisan, let me just suggest that there is something terrifically wrong with the Federal Government owning so much of these States. You can see that in Nevada, 93 percent of the State is owned by the Federal Government. In Utah, it's over 70 percent. In California, it's about 50 percent. This is a huge amount of public ownership of our lands. 
   As a result, you can see also that the ownership by the Federal Government is spread around the whole United States. In fact, there are about 19,000 counties in the United States that have public lands of some sort in them, and in those counties the Federal Government pays to those counties money that substitutes for the taxes that those counties would otherwise receive. We call this payment in lieu of taxes, and it's fair. 
   It's fair in the East where we have small amounts of land and the payments are substantial, but it's not fair in the West where we've taken a vast amount of public lands out of the system, and therefore, States can't actually have any kind of revenue stream from those public lands. 
   Now, the blue map that you saw that represented how much of the Western States is owned by the Federal Government is interesting, and Mr. Bishop I think is going to come back and talk about this startling fact, but it is clear that all of the people in the Western part of the country pay more in the way of taxes per family, per capita and otherwise, than in the eastern part of the country. 
   It's also clear that in the western part of the country, where we have this domination of Federal lands, that we pay less per pupil for schools than people in the East do. So we tax more and we pay less, and the reason we do that is because of the ownership of public lands by the Federal Government. 
   This leaves us in a difficult circumstance where it's just plain harder to grow in the West. Now, I've got to count my State, which is by many measures the best place in the country to do business, and I don't want to suggest there's a problem there. In fact, we love our public lands because people can go out and recreate, and that's why people who are high-tech and others want to come to Utah. It's a great place to live and to work and be. But you have to buy into the fact that if the Federal Government owns that property, you have to pay more in the way of taxes. 
   I have many friends who live in the Northeast who have said to me over time, these are America's lands. And if you look at the map, you have got a little bit of New Hampshire and Maine and there's a sprinkling around here in the eastern part of the country. But when they talk about America's lands, they're talking about the public lands in the West. 
   I spent some time at Disneyland one day with my wife and kids, and that can be very long and painful. We finally got into the ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' exhibit, and I thought as we got to the door that we were almost ready to get on the ride, but then we got through the door and we had a long, long, half-an-hour-long line to wait through to get into the exhibit.     
   I was uptight, irritated. They had to pass by people like me. They had pictures of America flashing on the walls, and I noticed a picture from my district. I thought, well, that's nice. Two pictures later there is another picture from my district. Three pictures later there was another. The fact is, we have beautiful, beautiful lands in the West, and we welcome everyone to come out and join us on those lands. 
   But if they are America's lands, then we have a responsibility as Americans to pay the costs of those lands. If we are not going to use them productively, if we are not going to tax them for productive use, then we have an obligation in America to pay for those lands.

   Mr. CANNON. Is that a handout or a hand in our pockets by the Federal Government? This is, in fact, not a handout at all. 
   Every county in the country taxes its public lands. Every county does. Every  State has a regime for taxing public lands. But we can't, because the Federal Government is sovereign, we can't tax lands that are owned by the Federal Government. 
   So if you want people to be there for search-and-rescue when you get lost in some of the beautiful parts of my county or my State, we expect to be paid for that. It's not an expectation that's vacuous or whiny, it's an expectation based upon what we are giving up in these western States and in Utah, in particular.

   Mr. CANNON. I thank the gentleman. In fact, I paid, I think, $3.09 the last time I bought gas. When I took my daughter, one of my daughters up to school about 5 years ago, there was a gas war. We had low prices. It may have been 6 years ago. I paid 75 cents a gallon for gas and of that 75 cents, 42 cents was tax. We are not paying 42 cents on a gallon of gas that is over $3. 
   These are amazing numbers. Why we are there? Well, we are there because we have had policies that have restricted the development of oil and gas. There are two things I want to comment on just quickly in response to that question. 
   The first is that we have 250 billion tons of coal in America representing about 6 or 800 billion barrels of gasoline if we did coal-to-liquids. A lot of people know that we are the Saudi Arabia of the world for coal, but very few people understand that we have more oil in our shale that's easily recoverable in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah than exists in all of Saudi Arabia. 
   If you look at the more difficult or more expensive to recover from shale, it's two or three times everything that you have in the Middle East. If we could just develop the oil that's in our shale, we would do remarkably well for America. 
   Let me just give you a sense of this. In other words, think of all the oil that comes out of Saudi Arabia, all the oil that comes out of Venezuela, all the oil that comes out of Mexico. We could easily replace that at a teeny fraction of the oil we have available in shale in this country. By the way, you asked the question, Mr. Bishop, is it possible to actually get the oil out of that shale? 
   Well, the Estonians have been doing it for 60 years. They have been producing oil out of shale for 60 years. The shale that we have in Utah is better, has much more oil, and, in fact, in 60 years, we have made massive progress technologically. The answer is unequivocal. We can do it. 
   The Federal Government owns the bulk of this shale. We need to assure that we can do it quickly without the kind of burdens. Let me just take a moment to tell you, we have a mine in Utah, it cost $330 million to develop that mine in 1977. The first thing I did when I came to Congress was to stop the BLM from spending $50 million to shut that mine up so it would be, as they said, safe. 
   We have now released that mine, but it has taken almost 2 years in a mine that's already developed to get to the point of licensing that so the people that lease the mine can produce. Their production is based on a very narrow, limited set of circumstances. We are in the way. The Federal Government is in the way of energy self-sufficiency for the United States. The people of America ought to say we want to get out of the way. 
   By the way, for the people of America, this body is actually an interesting place. People do what Americans want us to do. If you want cheaper oil, tell your Congressman to get with it and help us change the policies so we can develop our oil, particularly the oil and gas in the shale in the United States. 
   I know that Mr. Peterson is going to talk about oil and gas.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   On Tuesday, the life of an Alexandria, Virginia, police officer was spared because he was wearing a bulletproof vest when he was shot in the chest. The officer was shot during a traffic stop on Interstate 395 just outside of Washington, DC, by a man who later took his own life. Fortunately, the officer is expected to make a full recovery. 
   There are more than 900,000 State and local law enforcement officers who risk their lives every day to keep our community safe, yet we often lose sight of how quickly something as routine as a traffic stop can turn deadly for a police officer. Each year approximately 16,000 State and local officers are injured in the line of duty. In 2007, for instance, 55 police officers were killed by firearms in the line of duty. 
   Thankfully, many police officers and sheriff's deputies are saved each year by bulletproof vests. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership was created by the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 as a Department of Justice program to provide funding for bulletproof vests and other body armor to State and local law enforcement.     
   Since 1999, 40,000 State and local governments have participated in the Bulletproof Vest Program. The program, administered by the Office of Justice Programs, has awarded Federal grants to support the purchase of an estimated 1.5 million vests, including over 800 vests to law enforcement agencies in my home State of Utah, making my police and many police around the country safer. 
   H.R. 6045 reauthorizes the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program through fiscal year 2012. This legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support and endorsements from a number of law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police.  
   It is important that we reauthorize this simple and effective program to protect our men and women in law enforcement. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GRANT A POSTHUMOUS PARDON TO JOHN ARTHUR ``JACK'' JOHNSON -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The gentlewoman from California has eloquently set forth the facts, the simple facts that relate to why we are here today. This is a profoundly important piece of legislation because it transforms a wrong in American history. 
   I would just like to say that one of the profoundly important things in our time, one of the things that I am most proud of and most pleased with, in fact one of the things that gives me the greatest pleasure in life, is the fact that we are in a time when a person's ethnicity is less important than his or her capabilities. 
   I think it is time that we ask the President to pardon Jack Johnson, because he represents some of the difficulty in our past. I am impressed that he was killed in a car accident after he sped away from a restaurant that refused to serve him. Every American today is uncomfortable with that. It was a standard at one point in time. It is not the standard in America today, something that I think is wonderful in our country. 
   At a time with other crises going on around us, I am pleased to ask for our colleagues to support this bill and do something right, or recognize that some wrong was done in America and do something about that.  
   I support the passage of House Concurrent Resolution 214, which calls on the President to grant a posthumous pardon to Jack Johnson for a racially motivated conviction for violating the Mann Act. 
   Jack Johnson was the first African American boxer to become the heavyweight champion of the world. But the Mann Act conviction diminished Mr. Johnson's athletic, cultural, and historic significance and tarnished his reputation. 
   Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, TX, in 1878. The son of former slaves, Johnson grew up poor. He attended school only until the fifth grade and began boxing as a young teenager. 
   By 1902, Johnson had won at least 50 fights against both white and black opponents. However, his efforts to win the heavyweight title were thwarted as world champion Jim Jeffries refused to face him. In 1905, Jeffries retired from the sport rather than give Johnson a title fight. 
   In 1908, Johnson finally won the heavyweight title when he knocked out Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia. However, Johnson was not officially recognized as champion until 1910, when he bested Jim Jeffries who came out of retirement specifically for the fight. 
   Johnson went on to defend his title a number of times. But in 1913, at the height of his career, the boxer was convicted of violating the Mann Act--a law that outlawed the transportation of women across state lines for ``any immoral purpose.'' 
   After his conviction, Jack Johnson fled the country and spent several years abroad as a fugitive. In 1915, he lost his title to Jess Willard in Cuba. 
   Five years later, Johnson returned to the United States, surrendered to authorities, and served 1 year and 1 day in prison. He was never given another shot at the heavyweight title, and he never cleared his name. He died in a traffic accident in 1946 at age 68. He was furiously speeding away from a restaurant that refused to serve him. 
   In 2004, filmmaker Ken Burns initiated the movement for a pardon after producing a documentary about Jack Johnson's life. That year, the Senate approved Senate Resolution 447, an earlier version of today's resolution, by unanimous consent. 
   In 2005, a bipartisan group of Senators, led by Senator McCain, wrote a letter to the President to request a pardon. The letter stated that a pardon ``would be a strong and necessary symbol to the world of America's continuing resolve to live up to the noble ideals of freedom, opportunity and equal justice for all.'' 
   Although it has been over 90 years since Jack Johnson's conviction and over 50 years since his death, a Presidential pardon would be untimely but still just. 
   I join my colleagues in supporting this resolution and ask that the President grant a long-awaited pardon to Jack Johnson.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (EFFECTIVE CHILD PORNOGRAPHY PROSECUTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would just like to thank the gentlewoman from California for taking the lead here today on this issue. It is an important issue, and she has laid out the facts behind the need for this today. 
   We live in a world of very quickly transforming technology. The courts sometimes have difficulty keeping up with that, and we have to act to create the legal environment for the courts to appropriately act. This bill does that. I encourage my colleagues to support it when it comes to a vote.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4120, the Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act of 2007. The House passed this legislation in November of last year to combat the pervasiveness of child pornography on the Internet. 
   Child abuse and exploitation are among the most heinous crimes committed in this country. And in recent years, the Internet, with its virtually unregulated access to information and to people all over the world, has become a foul source for this type of criminal activity. However, in many instances, Federal prosecutors are prevented from seeking justice. 
   In a decision by the 10th Circuit United States Court of Appeals in United States v. Schafer, the Court ruled the transmission of  child pornography on the Internet did not satisfy the interstate requirement in child pornography laws. 
   H.R. 4120, the ``Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act of 2007,'' responds to that decision by expanding jurisdiction for prosecuting Internet child pornography crimes. 
   This bill allows the government to prosecute cases when child pornography or is transmitted ``using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce.'' This is the broadest assertion of interstate commerce power that Congress can make consistent with the Constitution. 
   H.R. 4120, as passed by the Senate, includes provisions similar to H.R. 4136, the ``Enhancing the Effective Prosecution of Child Pornography Act of 2007'' which also passed the House last November. 
   This language closes a loophole used by child pornographers to circumvent the law by expanding current child pornography statutes. 
   Current law prohibits the ``possession'' of child pornography. This law pre-dates the prevalence of the Internet in transmitting child pornography images. Today, a pedophile can access child pornography and view it but, under the current statute, may not be criminally liable for possessing it. This provision will prohibit accessing such content with the intent to view it and will no longer require an offender to actually download the material. 
   It is no longer sufficient to warn our children to not talk to strangers. With the expansion of the Internet and other technologies, we must now find new ways to protect our children from the dangers of the world. 
   H.R. 4120, the ``Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act of 2007,'' provides law enforcement important tools for combating these heinous crimes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, today, the House is presented with a unique opportunity to address two prevailing problems with representation in the House. 
   One relates to whether the District is entitled to a Representative and the other whether Utah is owed an additional seat in Congress because of the illegitimate counting of residents after the 2000 census. 
   Utah lost out on a 4th seat because of a census bureau decision to count, and to enumerate to their respective home States, government employees residing temporarily abroad, but not count similarly situated missionaries. 
   Had the Bureau either not counted any Americans residing temporarily abroad, or counted all such Americans and not just those employed by the Federal Government, Utah would have been awarded a fourth seat. 
   Although this legislation provides Utah the seat it deserves and was denied in the 2000 census, I do have concerns with the language in the bill which ties the hands of the Utah legislature. 
   The preemption language is offensive and demeans the historic role of States in the reapportionment process. 
   I offered an amendment that was rejected by the Rules Committee on a 7-4 vote that would have simply removed the language of the bill mandating the ``at large'' seat in Section 4 and left it to the State to decide. 
   The amendment would have changed ``shall'' to ``may'', and would not have prohibited an at large seat, but rather would have provided Utah the opportunity to choose whether to redistrict or not. 
   The intent of my amendment was to reaffirm the role of the State in the decisionmaking process, but the Democrats treated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution as words without meaning by rejecting my amendment. 
   Although I will vote in favor of this legislation, as this bill moves forward I will continue my efforts to push for inclusion of my amendment to protect the State's role in the process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I would ask the chairman of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, who has oversight of this matter and which committee I rank on, to remain on the floor so we could have a colloquy on this issue. 
   It appears that she has left the floor. That's unfortunate. Her response to my inquiry about yielding was that she didn't have enough time, and we are standing here today with very little time to debate an issue that is dramatically important. It's important for this institution, and, by the way, people on both sides of the aisle have said and the Speaker and majority leader have both made a point of how important this issue is to this body. It is vitally important to me that we retain the rights of this body as it relates to administration, whether that's a Republican administration or Democratic administration. 
   In his opening statements, Mr. Diaz-Balart gave a quote from former Attorney General Janet Reno in which she said there was no right to do what we're trying to do today. I would have loved to have asked the chairman on the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law if she thought that was the case or if she disagreed with what the scope of the right of the administration is to not appear. 
   Obviously, there is a sense in this case that we ought to get something done; and, in fact, we have done a great deal. We have had hundreds of hours of depositions, literally tens of thousands of pages, tens of thousands of e-mails. We have asked questions of everyone involved in the matter in the case. And what have we come up with? I wanted to ask the chairman what the evidence we are going to present to the U.S. Attorney is that he can take and say, I have a need to get this information from these people in the administration who won't show up to the House. I have a need to understand these facts which seem to be in confusion. I have a need to decide what between these two different stories is the truth. 
   But we haven't said that to him. We don't have evidence that we can give the U.S. Attorney. What we are giving to him is a desire to continue a witch hunt which has produced up to today zero, nothing, as far as I can tell; and I've been in every meeting, every hearing, and followed on every single deposition that we have had. There is nothing that indicates that anybody has lied or that there is a reason that the White House has been involved. And, therefore, there is no reason that I can understand, and I have asked many times on the record in committee hearings what those reasons are, what it is, what the discrepancies, what the problems are for which we need to subpoena people in the White House and create a showdown, a showdown between our institution and the White House. And I ask the gentleman, as the chairman of the committee has just risen to his feet, and I would love to yield to him if he is willing to answer that question: What are the discrepancies?

   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 1736. I would like to begin by thanking the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for her kind comments and background on this bill. 
   H.R. 1736 passed the House of Representatives last Congress, and I reintroduced this legislation earlier this year. This bill will benefit many of my constituents by allowing Juab County to become eligible for funding for conjunctive use under the Central Utah Project. Precious water resources in Utah are highly valued and maximizing existing water resources efficiently is imperative. 
   The Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project was planned to develop and export water from the high Uinta Mountains in the eastern part of the State and bring it to the populated Wasatch Front. 
   As originally planned, Juab County would have received a large amount of water. However, due to alterations in the original plan, much of that water is planned for use in the Wasatch, Utah, and Salt Lake Counties. While efforts will continue to identify and secure substantial additional water supplies for Juab, there are near-term steps that can be taken to help the county meet its current needs and growing demands. This legislation will facilitate one of those near-term steps. 
   H.R. 1736 will allow Juab County to become eligible for funding for studies and construction of conjunctive use projects by amending the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992. Allowing Juab County to be eligible to receive funds under the Central Utah Project Completion Act will allow the county to maximize surface water flows and groundwater sources by storing flows in existing aquifers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 341 which endorses the goals and ideals of American Eagle Day.  
   Two hundred and twenty-five years ago, the Second Continental Congress decided to use the image of the American bald eagle on the Great Seal of the United States. Since that time, the image of this majestic bird has graced American art, our culture, currency and stamps. It has been the subject of more than 2,500 books, making the bald eagle the most extensively studied bird in North America. 
   While there were nearly 500,000 on this continent prior to European settlement, this species was particularly devastated by various chemical compounds that caused widespread reproductive failure. In response, the Congress enacted the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the bird was listed on our Endangered Species Act. 
   From its all-time low of 417 nesting pairs in the continental United States in 1963, extraordinary conservation efforts have saved the bald eagle, and we have witnessed a significant population increase. Today, there are 9,789 breeding pairs, not including the more than 30,000 bald eagles living in Alaska. 
   By any objective standard, recovery of the bald eagle has been remarkable, but sadly, it is one of only a handful of species that have been recovered under the Endangered Species Act. While it is likely that the Secretary of the Interior will soon make a decision to remove the bald eagle from the Federal list of threatened and endangered species, there is no question that the bald eagle will continue to inspire millions of Americans because it symbolizes the fundamental values of this country of courage, freedom and patriotic spirit. 
   Under the terms of House Resolution 341, the people of the United States are encouraged to observe American Eagle Day on June 20 and to provide educational information on the value of conserving our Nation's wildlife resources. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote and want to compliment the author of this resolution, freshman Congressman David Davis of Tennessee, for his effective leadership in proposing this celebration of American Eagle Day.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT NATIONAL MUSEUM OF WILDLIFE ART BE DESIGNATED AS ``NATIONAL MUSEUM OF WILDLIFE ART OF THE UNITED STATES'' -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 116, and yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 116 has been adequately explained by the majority. The only thing I would add is I would like to commend Congresswoman Cubin for her work on this resolution to designate the National Museum of Wildlife Art of the United States in Jackson, Wyoming. This designation places the National Museum of Wildlife Art of the United States in a prestigious class of less than 20 museums to earn such a designation. 
   I urge adoption of the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVISTS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'm happy that the House is able to complete today the Congress' consideration of this bipartisan legislation. As we have stated at every turn, Republicans strongly support the mission and appreciate the sacrifice of our dedicated Reservists and Guardsmen. We continue to agree that Reservists and Guardsmen who are plunged into bankruptcy by the demands of their service should be given a helping hand under the Bankruptcy Code. 
   Earlier this session, Judiciary Committee Republicans labored long and hard to achieve a workable compromise that would help these willing warriors. The merger issue for us was simple--that the bill respond to bankruptcies attributable to a Reservist's or Guardsman's service. The Senate has returned a bill to us that preserves the balance that we struck. The Senate has added one amendment, but it is technical in nature and was sought by the Administrative Office of the United States courts. 
   I urge all Members to support the passage of this legislation, and I look forward to the bill's implementation as law. I also look forward to the results 2 years from now of the GAO study contained in the bill. This study will tell us for sure whether Reservists and Guardsmen are using the relief granted by the bill when it is their service that leads to bankruptcy--not other factors. With this study in hand, when the bill reaches its 3-year sunset, we will know for sure whether it's being abused in cases lacking the necessary link to service. If it is being abused, we will be able to address that abuse at the time that reauthorization is considered. 
   In light of these considerations, I'm pleased to support passage of the bill. 
   I would also like to thank others who have worked on this bill, in particular Congressman Rohrabacher from California. I made, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law that has oversight of the Bankruptcy Act, a promise that we would reconsider this bill that was done some years ago. Mr. Rohrabacher has done an amazing job, given leadership and determination to bring this bill to where it is today and, by doing so, has redeemed my promise and his and that of many other people. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CANNON. I thank the gentlelady. 
   The American people are enraged by this bailout, or rescue as we're now calling it, and I think justifiably so. And they ought to be enraged that the real cause here--or the real cause of what I think should be the rage is that this has been done in a way that has been mandated, directed, expected that we would respond without much involvement. The rage of the American people reminds me of a bull often goes after the cape rather than goring the toreador. And what we need to do here, I think--I hope the American people recognize the opportunity to demand a transparent government. 
   There was no reason why the administration couldn't have made its three-page proposal available not as a legislative demand but as an outline of what the discussions should have been. There is no reason why we here in Congress have not done an open rule and had a debate on this. We could easily have taken this measure, debated it openly, amended it, adjusted it, and done things that make some sense. 
   Now the problem as I see the bailout--and the gentlelady and I have talked about this at some length--is that it pumps liquidity into banks and takes paper. That paper we hope is good. We hope it will be more valuable than what we have spent on it.

   Mr. CANNON. I thank the gentlelady, and if she wishes to remain, perhaps we can have a colloquy at some point. 
   Let me make a couple of points. We have had a long and intense discussion about what we can do to help solve, not the problem of the banks with their toxic loans which we hope we will buy at a reasonable price in a reverse auction, but what we do on the other side of this problem, which is homeowners who can't afford the loans that they got on property that was often misappraised or appraised fraudulently and therefore left in a box without being able to pay, with mortgages that are resetting at higher interest rates, sometimes with higher balances because of the way the mortgages were arranged. 
   So how do we help Americans stay in their homes in a reasonable fashion? And we've talked about bankruptcy as one way to do that. 
   Now in the bill that we did not pass here in the House recently, the Secretary had wide authority. I'm expecting that authority to be continued; and what I would hope is that the Secretary will not just put $700 billion into paper which may or may not be useful, but also something like $50 billion or $100 billion into funds that are intended to help people stay in their homes by creating the opportunity to buy mortgages at a discount, then renegotiate those mortgages with the people who are in those homes or others, and thereby avoid the downward spiral of housing costs. 
   I don't know that we're going to be able to do much with bankruptcy if this bill that passed the Senate passes the House today, I don't know that we're going to be able to deal with it. But I think that we ought to demand as the House that the Secretary recognize that this is not just a matter of buying paper and saving banks, but it's rather a matter of keeping a downward spiral on housing prices from continuing so that Americans can maintain the value on their homes, can keep their homes, and we can get this economic crisis behind us and perhaps even save some money. 
   I recognize the gentlelady is standing there. I would be happy to yield to her.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentlelady. The nice thing about being clear in your principles is that it's possible to negotiate and come up with compromises that work. It's been a pleasure to work with the gentlelady and also the chairman of the full committee who is also here with us, Mr. Conyers. It's not possible to be farther apart on the political spectrum than I think Mr. Conyers and I are, but we have had a very pleasant, and I think profitable, working relationship on many issues where because of his clear principles, and I hope my clear principles, we've been able to reach compromise. 
   Going back to what the gentlelady was saying, I fervently hope that I will not be part of any further negotiations on bankruptcy. I hope that we solve this problem today or tomorrow, I suppose, and then make the American people more safe by us being out of town and then letting the next year's crop of people come back and deal with the issue. 
   Let me just reiterate a couple of things the gentlelady has said. $2.1 trillion of subprime and Alt-A loans are in trouble. If we don't do something about that, those loans, as they fail--to the degree that they fail, and many are likely to fail--are likely to draw down to create a suction that will pull down the prices of all the other houses in America, creating chaos in our market. 
   It's imperative that the Secretary recognize his authority under, I think, the current language, and make it clear that he intends to do something not just about the paper because, as the gentlelady has pointed out, we don't own all of the fractions of the interests in these mortgages, and therefore we don't have the ability, by pumping money into paper, to solve the underlying problem. You have to do that in another way. And certainly where you have a second or a third, there is no ability by the Treasury, under the current program, to deal with that suction on prices.     
   So I am hoping that the Secretary of the Treasury will today make it clear that he intends to use part of this bailout money for which he has I think the discretion. I think it is important that he be clear that he has that discretion, that he intends to use the money that way so we can create a floor not just under the banks but also under the prices of our homes. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   We're now at a point where we're going to be voting very quickly on this bill. I think you heard the colloquy between the gentlelady from California and myself. I'm wondering if the gentleman can be satisfied if the Secretary takes a position publicly that he is going to use some of this bailout money under the discretion that he's given in the bill to do what I suggested earlier, which is, to put money into funds that would buy mortgages and keep people in their homes. Is that the kind of thing that we can do--

   Mr. CANNON. The problem we're facing, or course, is the urgency of what's going on. And the gentleman has heard my concern with the failure of the administration to have this aired transparently; but that said, we do have some urgency. If the Secretary is very clear in what he says, can we move forward, as opposed to, say, amending the Senate's bill--which will come over to us--and then sending it back to the Senate for further votes. Personally, I don't think that that is likely to happen; it's your leadership that will control the Rules Committee. But I suspect that we're not going to get the perfect here with the good, that is, a commitment by the Secretary that is clear and open and patent. 
   Would that serve to resolve the gentleman's concerns?

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Kucinich, if you would like to continue, we don't disagree, and I think by having a further colloquy, I think we actually can come to an understanding. 
   As I understand your concern, the Secretary does not have the ability--or it would be difficult for him to buy up all the fractionated interests in any given mortgage, and therefore, he is incapable, in his current position--unless he does something remarkable and spends more money than we intend him to spend, he can't provide relief on individual mortgages. 
   What I'm suggesting the Secretary has the authority to do is to put money into private funds that can then go to the servicing agent of a nonperforming loan, where the person is in an anti-deficiency State, or otherwise can walk away from that loan without recourse to the bank. At that point, the servicing agent has the ability to sell a mortgage, or a package of mortgages. In that event, what I suggest is that if the Secretary will pump some significant resources into the private sector to buy mortgages from servicing agents, and from banks and others, in a market where we are having deterioration of prices, that would tend, dramatically, to solve the problem. It goes a long way toward, I think, the gentleman's concerns.

   Mr. CANNON. Reclaiming my time, let me just say the gentlelady is absolutely accurate in her portrayal of the problem. Let me just clarify one thing, because a lot of people listening to us today don't understand what a reset is. 
   You have mortgages that are at a fixed rate which will then pop up to a market rate in the future. It is that pop up that is a problem. If you have a mortgagee who is behind in his payments, he may be able to stay in the mortgage when it goes up, but he may not be able to afford it. If he's behind, he can't refinance. He's stuck in a world where he can't get out of that mortgage, and the market will drive him. And the bank that wants him to renegotiate can't do it because of the fractionated ownership of that mortgage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of S. 3641, a bill to authorize funding for the National Crime Victim Law Institute to provide support for victims of crime under Crime Victims Legal Assistance Programs as part of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. 
   In 2007, over 1.4 million Americans were victims of violent crime and nearly 10 million were victims of property crime. All too often, many of these victims are not given a voice in criminal proceedings. Many crime victim organizations around the country such as the National Crime Victim Law Institute work tirelessly every day to ensure that the interests and needs of crime victims are represented throughout the trial process. 
   The National Crime Victim Law Institute, housed at the Lewis and Clark Law School, was founded in 1997 as a resource for crime victims and crime victim lawyers to further the enforcement of crime victims' rights in criminal and civil proceedings. 
   The institute is a national network of pro bono legal clinics that represent victims of crime in State, Federal, and tribal courts as they assert and seek enforcement of their rights. Since 2004 the institute has successfully launched and provided ongoing assistance to these legal clinics. This network of clinics has provided legal counsel to over 1,000 crime victims in criminal cases, thereby ensuring victims' rights and voices are honored. 
   The institute ensures the success of the clinics through regular legal research and expert consultation on the clinics' cases and through rigorous training in victim law for each clinic and its partners.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Second Chance Act. This is an important bill not only to ex-offenders but to our communities and families. 
   This bill is a modest, commonsense response to the increasing number of offenders returning to our communities each year. 
   The Second Chance Act is a bipartisan approach to prisoner reentry that will better coordinate Federal agencies and policies on prisoner reentry with an eye towards less crime and taxpayer savings. 
   The Second Chance Act addresses important areas for offenders and communities, including: jobs, housing, substance abuse, mental health treatment, and support for families. 
   This legislation brings together State and local governments to work together on the problem of prisoner reentry. 
   A modest expenditure to help transition offenders back into their communities can save taxpayers millions of dollars in the long run because the cost of paying for inmates is a serious burden to our citizens. 
   The average cost to house a Federal inmate is over $25,000 a year. If we can reduce recidivism we can save taxpayers millions of dollars. 
   I supported the Second Chance Act when our former colleague Representative Rob Portman introduced the bill in 2004. He should be acknowledged for his diligent work on this important issue and paving the way for us to be here today. 
   After Mr. Portman left Congress, I took over as the primary sponsor and this Congress I cosponsored this legislation for the reasons I have stated. 
   I believe there are some fundamental ideas that we hold as Americans. 
   The first is that there is a God and that we will all at some point face divine judgment. 
   You don't have to believe in God to be an American, but most Americans, believers or not, when given a choice 
   will support limiting government to promote the welfare of their fellow man. 
   For believers like me, this legislation does that. 
   It is part of our Judeo-Christian ethics that we have a responsibility to care for widows, orphans and those less fortunate, including, always and explicitly, prisoners. 
   The issues addressed in the Second Chance Act are not only safety and cost savings but reflect a moral imperative. 
   The President laid out in his State of the Union Address in 2004 the need for this bill, stating, ``America is the land of second chance and when the gates of prison open, the path should lead to a better life.'' 
   This bill will give those released from prison a better chance to improve their circumstances by turning away from crime and turning into productive contributing citizens. 
   I want to thank Congressman DANNY DAVIS, Chairman CONYERS, Judiciary Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH and Congressman SENSENBRENNER, Congressman FORBES, and Congressman COBLE for their work and leadership on this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Second Chance Act of 2007.

   Congress has granted the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to grant temporary refuge to aliens from particular countries under temporary protected status. If there is an ongoing armed conflict in the country and the return of nationals would pose a serious threat to their security, if there has been a natural disaster in the country resulting in a substantial but temporary disruption of living conditions, or if there exists extraordinary temporary conditions in their country that prevent aliens from returning in safety, the Secretary can grant TPS status to the nationals for as long as 18 months. He can later extend the TPS period for additional periods of as long as 18 months. 
   Nationals of Liberia have been granted TPS because of civil unrest in Liberia; however, that status expires on October 1 of this year. This legislation would direct the Secretary to extend TPS to nationals of Liberia through September 30, 2008. I support this legislation.

   Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I am happy to support this bipartisan legislation. S. 975, which approves an interstate firefighting compact, is certain to accomplish great things for the States involved.     
   This compact would facilitate the rapid sharing of desperately needed firefighting resources between the States of South Dakota, North Dakota, Colorado, and Wyoming to combat wildfires that each State could not handle alone. 
   Those of us from Western States know all too well the menace to human lives, property, wildlife, and the grand natural beauty of our Nation that these wildfires present every year. This compact would help those States fight dangers without compromising any of these States' abilities to protect against fires at home and without impinging on any Federal firefighting authorities. 
   To facilitate coordination with the Federal authorities, this compact would allow representatives of the U.S. Forest Service to participate as observers of the compact's meetings. The compact is modeled on a similar compact for the Pacific Northwest, to which Congress consented in 1998. 
   I urge you to support this legislation so that we do not lose a single minute in helping these States to fight fires and benefit this compact's vital provisions. 
   I am pleased to present this legislation because interstate compacts is an area of the House Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction, and I would like to invigorate that. As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, which has jurisdiction over interstate compacts, I hope to see more interest in this area as a powerful tool for States to work together in a cooperative manner to deal effectively with the cross-jurisdictional policy issues that are arising in our country. I am sure that the subcommittee Chair, Linda S&#225;nchez, shares this desire; and I look forward to working with her more in this important area. 
   All around the country, there are many compacts addressing a myriad of issues, from the most cutting-edge climate change issues to the most mundane tax issues. These compacts must under the Constitution be presented to Congress for consent before the States may enter into them. I commend the States involved in this compact for doing things the right way in bringing this compact to Congress for consent. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and then to come to visit the natural wonders in these States that this compact is sure to help protect.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3564. I would like to, first of all, thank the gentlewoman from California for her leadership on this issue. I appreciate working with her. 
   I am delighted that H.R. 3564, which would reauthorize the Administrative Conference of the United States, is being considered on the floor today. I urge support of this measure. I also urge the Appropriations Committee to appropriate funds to ACUS so that this organization can once again become a living, breathing reality. 
   Madam Speaker, I am a believer in the adage that the government that governs best governs least; but when the government does govern, it must govern as its best. ACUS is just the organization to help us achieve that goal. Before its funding ceased some years ago, it laid down a decades-long track record of productive activity that was remarkable, unmistakable, and probably unparalleled. 
   Over the course of its 28-year existence, the conference issued more than 200 recommendations, some of which were governmentwide and others that were agency specific. It issued a series of recommendations eliminating a variety of technical impediments to the judicial review of agency action and encouraging less costly consensual alternatives to litigation. 
   The fruits of these efforts include the enactment of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990, which established a framework for the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution. In addition to this legislation, ACUS served as the key implementing agency for the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, the Congressional Accountability Act, and the Magnusson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act. The Conference also made recommendations regarding implementation of the Congressional Accountability Act and played a key role in the Clinton administration's National Performance Review with respect to improving regulatory systems. 
   Madam Speaker, time and again, ACUS took the small amount of taxpayer funds that we appropriated and produced enormous savings in the costs incurred and imposed by Federal regulatory agencies. That record is so clear that I can say with absolute confidence that, if we were not to authorize ACUS, we would effectively authorize waste in the rest of the Federal Government. I can say with equal confidence that if the Appropriations Committee were not to appropriate funds to ACUS after the Congress passes this bill, it would effectively appropriate waste by the Federal Government to the tune of millions upon millions of dollars. 
   Many of you may know my enthusiasm for ACUS, and it will not surprise you that hordes of experts, officials and stakeholders outside of these walls, share that same enthusiasm as well, including Justices Scalia and Breyer, both of whom worked with ACUS in an earlier part of their careers. 
   To quote just one legal luminary, ``If the conference didn't exist, it would have to be invented.'' Thankfully, we don't need to invent it. We did that long ago. We know it was a great invention. All we need to do is to reauthorize it today and to appropriate funds for it. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, regulations play a critical role in virtually every aspect of our daily lives, yet there is no independent, nonpartisan entity that Congress can utilize to scrutinize and approve the regulatory process. Accordingly, it is critical that we reauthorize the Administrative Conference of the United States as soon as possible so that it can fill this serious void. 
   I realize that this may not be the sexiest issue on the docket today, but I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 721, which recognizes the 60th anniversary of Mendez v. Westminster decision, which ended the segregation of Mexican and Mexican American students in California schools. 
   I would like to take a moment to thank the gentlewoman and chairman of the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee for her statement. She and her sister, who is also on the floor with us today, are remarkable people. They may have come to Congress under even different circumstances, but it is good for America that this impediment was removed from their lives and the lives of many other people of Mexican and Mexican American descent here in the United States. 
   All Americans should understand that, along with Brown v. Board of Education, many Federal court decisions signaled our country's shift away from the obnoxious principle of ``separate but equal.'' One such decision was Mendez v. Westminster in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a decision by the full court, held that the segregation of Mexican and Mexican American students into separate so-called ``Mexican schools'' was unconstitutional. 
   That decision in 1945 vindicated the rights of a group of children of Mexican American fathers, Thomas Estrada, William Guzman, Frank Palomino, Lorenzo Ramirez, led by Gonzalo Mendez, who challenged the practice of school segregation in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and began a journey that led Mexican Americans nationwide to greater equality. 
   Those courageous and loving fathers stood for themselves and for some 5,000 others, all citizens of the United States of Mexican descent. As the court held: ``By enforcing the segregation of school children of Mexican descent against their will and contrary to the laws of California, respondents have violated Federal law as provided in the 14th amendment to the Federal Constitution by depriving them of liberty and property without due process of law and by denying to them the equal protection of the laws.'' 
   Following that decision, in 1947 California Governor and future Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren signed into law a repeal of the last remaining school segregation statutes in the California Education Code. 
   Before those loving fathers brought the case of Mendez v. Westminster, there was a crack in the American melting pot. Their courageous actions repaired that crack, brought all Americans closer, and brought America closer to her most cherished ideals. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   We come from very, very different districts. About two-thirds of my State is public lands, very little of the gentleman's State is public lands. And so we differ. We have a different approach, and I think that's very appropriate, just as the gentleman pointed out with regard to Mr. Heller and his district. 
   So we have differences, and we come at these things differently. And in that context, I hope that the gentleman will consider accepting my amendment. On the other hand, our colleagues here today will recognize the importance of this amendment. 
   My amendment would strike section 517 of the bill before us. The amendment is necessary so common consumer products remain affordable. If section 517 is not stricken, Americans will see an increase in the cost of everyday products, such as glass, ceramics, paper, plastics, rubber, detergents, insulation, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, to name just a few. 
   Section 517 deals with common varieties of industrial minerals. Unfortunately, this provision would put industrial minerals that are clearly identifiable as unique, and thus ``locatable,'' under the mining law into this category despite existing law that has labeled them as locatable. 
   Industrial minerals have been classified as locatable since 1872 under the General Mining Law. These minerals were never intended to be included in the Mineral Materials Act. The Mineral Materials Act was designed to deal with bulk sales of common deposits of sand and gravel. Moving industrial minerals into the Mineral Materials Act would make it impossible for these operations to continue to extract these unique industrial minerals. 
   Industrial minerals should not be treated the same as rocks and sand and gravel that can be loaded in the back of a truck and hauled away. Yet section 517 would do just that. Under the Mineral Materials Act, minerals are disposed of by non-competitive processes for small quantities and by competitive bidding contracts for terms of 10 years or less. However, it can take 50 years to extract industrial minerals, and the investment for doing that tends to be in the 50 to $100 million range. 
   Competitive bidding contracts of a maximum term of 10 years will remove any incentive by industrial mineral companies to research and explore for new reserves. 
   After spending resources to discover reserves; and if also awarded the contract, the company will not be guaranteed the necessary time to actually extract the minerals and develop the resource. This will force our mining industry to move overseas and will result in the loss of thousands of high-paying jobs here in America. 
   Not only will section 517 create uncertainty for mine operators but will also impose a significant administrative burden on BLM. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of my time. 
   In the first place, I believe that what the gentleman was just talking about was metallurgical-grade silica and different from the summary we've just had. 
   I think, though, in response to his main argument, it is an amazing comment on the bulk of this bill that the producers of industrial minerals prefer to be under the new regime than to be under the uncertainty that would be created. They need certainty to develop minerals over 50 years instead of 10 years. And so while the gentleman's comment is well taken, I would suggest to him that the industry actually prefers my amendment, regardless of the fact that it incurs these other burdens. 
   And, finally, I would take exception to the reference of this as a scam. The fact that we don't have tax dollars coming to the Treasury based upon reserves that are being developed does not mean that Americans aren't better off because they have lower prices for paper, which requires kaolin, a locatable clay that makes paper cheaper. 
   So this is a matter of policy; it is not a matter of scams. And I urge my colleagues to recognize that, to recognize the burdens that this would create on very common products that we produce with these locatable minerals, and to vote in support of my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, Dr. Karl Carson, a father, musician and public servant, led an honorable life of community service. Over the years the tremendous contributions he made to the City of Fort Collins, Colorado, certainly merit the naming of a post office in his honor. 
   Dr. Karl Carson was born in 1915 in Wichita, Kansas. He was raised on a dairy farm and milked cows each day before leaving for school. While in high school, he met his wife Wilma Schull, with whom he had five children. Dr. Carson demonstrated a deep devotion to his family as a loving husband, father and grandfather. 
   He attended Fort Collins State University in Kansas on a music scholarship and paid for his education by singing at weddings and other social occasions. 
   After graduating, he served honorably in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II as a communications officer aboard the USS Strive. This service marked the beginning of a lifetime of serving his community and country. 
   After the conclusion of his military service, Dr. Carson received a doctorate degree in dental surgery from the University of Nebraska. In 1954, he moved to Fort Collins, Colorado, with his family and established his own dental practice. Dr. Carson enjoyed a successful 43-year long dental career. He was recognized for his excellence in dentistry by the Colorado Dental Association in 1991 with a Distinguished Service Award. 
   In 1965, Dr. Carson began his noteworthy career of public service as a member of the Fort Collins City Council. He was subsequently elected by the City Council to be mayor in 1968. 
   During his mayoral term, he initiated a program called Designing Tomorrow Today, which was the catalyst for building the downtown library, city hall and the Lincoln Center. Dr. Carson also regarded his support of adding fluoride to Fort Collins water supply as one of his greatest achievements. 
   Dr. Carson will be remembered for his legendary record of community service. Beyond serving as the director of downtown Fort Collins development, the Colorado League of Cities and President of the Colorado Municipal League, he was a member of the Kiwanis Club for over 60 years. 
   Regarded by many of the fathers of Fort Collins, Dr. Karl Carson undoubtedly left his mark on the Colorado community. Let us recognize his legacy of community service and devotion to family by naming this post office in his honor. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 2570.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, every year approximately 40,000 people in the United States die in road crashes. The number worldwide is even more devastating, over 1.2 million. These tragedies are overwhelming to the victims and their families and lead to numerous unintended physical, emotional and financial hardships. 
   H. Con. Res. 87 supports a world day of remembrance for road crash victims on the third Saturday of every November. According to the World Health Organization, 90 percent of motorist-related deaths occur in low and middle income countries. The countries are in need of improved road systems, increased prevention initiatives, and education programs for new drivers. 
   Too many of these road crash fatalities can be prevented through legislation, consistent enforcement and better education on the use of safety precautions such as seatbelts, child restraints and helmets. Drunk driving prevention programs and campaigns such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving are useful tools to bring awareness to such tragedies. 
   Communities and families worldwide must work together to prevent road crashes and related deaths. These traffic accidents injure or disable more than 50 million people. It is time we take these numbers into perspective to end dangerous and life-threatening vehicle crashes. 
   With that, I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 87.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Chairman, I urge you to support the Patent Reform Act of 2007, H.R. 1908. 
   Certain aspects of our patent system have not been amended since 1954, but our economy has changed dramatically since then and it's time our patent system caught up. 
   H.R. 1908 was introduced and is supported by the bipartisan leadership of the Judiciary Committee and was approved by the committee in a unanimous voice vote. 
   For the sake of our Nation's ability to innovate, grow and compete, we must pass this legislation. 
   The danger of not reforming our patent system is real and we are witnessing its effects today. 
   Patents of questionable validity are limiting competition and raising prices for consumers--a fact noted by the Federal Trade Commission in a 2003 report. 
   In addition, current interpretations of patent law by district and appellate courts have veered far from what Congress originally intended. 
   The result is that companies are diverting resources from R&D to pay for legal defense. 
   Because interpretations of patent law are so off-course, the U.S. Supreme Court has had to intervene in an unusually high number of patent cases in recent years. 
   In one case, the Court explicitly called for Congress to take action. 
   We have been debating patent reform for years. Such issues as post-grant review and damages apportionment have been components of various patent reform bills in the House and Senate over the course of the last several sessions and have been discussed at length in nearly every forum, from Congressional hearings to the media. 
   One issue that generated the most debate in previous Congresses--injunctions--was resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 in much the same way as proposed legislation would have done. 
   Yet despite predictions from some that reforming the standards for granting injunctions would grind innovation to a halt, patent holders still are granted injunctions today to protect their intellectual property. In fact, the patent system is healthier as a result. 
   H.R. 1908 will restore fairness and common sense to the standards for awarding reasonable damages. 
   Today, patent holders regularly are awarded damages based on the value of an entire product, even if the patent in question is one of literally thousands of other patented components comprising the product. 
   Additionally, H.R. 1908 will give trained patent examiners greater ability to review patents and enhance patent quality. 
   Innovation is indeed threatened not by changes to the system, but by the status quo. 
   After years of debate, it's time for action. 
   One area of particular interest to me is the language in the manager's amendment dealing with venue reform. 
   I am pleased the Chairman included venue reform language in the manager's amendment. 
   At the Judiciary Committee, Representative ZOE LOFGREN of California offered an amendment that I cosponsored that would inject sanity into the patent litigation system. 
   The venue reform language will create a real and substantial relationship between the parties and the acts of infringement by denying the ability to manufacture venue for hopes of gaming the judicial system. 
   During years of efforts on litigation reform, we have learned about what some have referred to as Judicial Hell Holes. 
   These locations are where judges apply laws and procedures in an unfair and unbalanced manner. 
   The underlying legislation's intent is to bring fairness and balance into the patent system. 
   And the venue language will bring fairness and balance to patent litigation. 
   This amendment will not close the court house door on any plaintiff. 
   But it will require legitimate nexus for where claims may be brought. 
   The nexus requirements of the amendment will prevent groups or entities from artificially manipulating presence in a judicial district just to game the system to file suit. 
   Swift passage of H.R. 1908 will stimulate innovation, competition and growth--great news for consumers, workers and our global economic leadership. 
   I urge support of H.R. 1908.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Chairman, my friend and colleague from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) has mentioned that there are 2 trillion barrels of oil. That is a conservative estimate. Estimates go way, way, way beyond that. The only way we are going to know how much oil there is is if we actually have the opportunity to unleash the creativity of the American genius to go after that oil and develop it. 
   Mr. Lamborn also said that we expect to have a large production by 2011, 4 or 5 years from now. The fact is, we could have big production out of shale much sooner than that if we continue on the path that we are on. If we delay, we will not have that opportunity. 
   I have an amendment that I am going to offer in a few minutes, and I will continue to talk about this point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would limit the effects of the amendment by my colleagues from Colorado to Colorado. 
   I am deeply troubled by my colleagues' zeal to stop oil shale leasing and development in the West. Oil shale is not a new idea. In fact, the lands in question were once part of a strategic reserve. Rather than limiting our energy resources, I am offering this amendment in an attempt to make sure that Americans have the opportunity to be energy independent and to create more American jobs. 
   Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming hold a conservative estimate of 2 trillion barrels of recoverable oil in the Green River Formation. We have one or two times the total crude oil reserves of the whole world and triple the amount of oil reserves in Saudi Arabia. Two trillion barrels of oil is enough to meet current U.S. demands for hundreds of years. 
   At a time when the price of consumer goods and services are soaring in large part because of the cost of energy resources, why would we intentionally hinder our ability to develop our most promising resource? It is no secret that the environmental community does not want shale development to succeed in this Nation, but we have environmental laws that are designed to protect our Federal lands. If those laws are not sufficient, let's talk about those issues as opposed to simply putting up roadblocks to this promising resource. Increased global demands, skyrocketing energy prices, geopolitical instability, concerns about peak oil production and supplies are all economic factors that we believe make oil shale an attractive natural resource to help solve our country's dependency problems.

   Mr. CANNON. I thank the gentleman for withdrawing his point of order and would point out, I understand that the Governor of Colorado, a Democrat, has decided that he doesn't want oil shale development in Colorado and my Democratic colleagues have opposed oil shale development in Colorado. It is true that in Colorado there are major projects that are underway and that have begun with some small-scale demonstration projects. That is fine for Colorado. It does not make sense for America to impose on Utah and Wyoming the same concerns that the Democratic leadership of Colorado wants to have in Colorado. And so I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The fact is I think, having looked at the industry, the likelihood of significant oil shale development, oil coming out of shale, is more likely to be from entrepreneurial sources that are not dependent upon these vast, vast projects that are being done in Colorado.

   Mr. CANNON. No, no. If the Udall amendment passes, then my amendment would become irrelevant. But I think under the rules of the body today, we were not able to do a second-degree amendment which is what I would have preferred. That being the case, the fact is Colorado has expressed itself I think pretty clearly here today that they don't want this development and, in fact, the case is different in Colorado than it is in Utah. I think that the opportunity for entrepreneurial development of oil shale should not be inhibited by frivolous government regulations. We have laws in place. In Utah,  we are not going to do things that don't make sense environmentally.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member.  
   I rise in opposition to this bill. A similar bill passed under suspension by about a vote of 410-11, and I was one of the people that voted for the bill at that time. The bill went over to the Senate. The Senate has amended the bill. 
   The underlying bill I think is actually a very good bill. It's a very important bill. We need to do something with it. But the bill that has come back is dramatically different from the bill that went over to the Senate. 
   My understanding is that the Senate has included in this bill the power for Federal law enforcement agencies to seize equipment that may be used in violation of the act. And what that means is, if you have got a kid who downloads music improperly, your computer may be seized. I'm not exactly sure what the scope of that seizure is, but that's in part because this is a gerrymandered piece of this bill that was added to an underlying bill that was coherent and integrated and would have worked very, very well. 
   As it is, I have to rise in opposition to this, what I think of as an extraordinary assertion of Federal authority over what we do with our personal lives and our computers and our equipment. 
   That is not to condone, by any stretch of the imagination, the improper use of copyrighting material, but to say, rather, that this bill, in its current form, has gone too far in that regard. 
   And so I oppose the bill, and I ask that my colleagues take a look at it and consider it and consider opposing this bill, along with me, because of the overreach that has happened here. 
   I might note this seems like this happened about 8 years ago where the Senate added a provision to one of the appropriations bills that would have allowed the recording industry to spike, that is, to put a virus on the computer of the user on which downloaded music resided.     
   That was inappropriate. We worked on this side to stop that, and I think we should stop that here with this bill now.

   Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7084, the Webcasters Settlement Act of 2008. 
   I want to thank my friend, Chairman Berman, for his tireless work on this issue, as well as Mr. Inslee, Ms. Zoe Lofgren and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Smith. 
   Since the CRB's ruling in March of 2007, the stakeholders, including the Digital Media Association, NPR and RIAA, have been negotiating for a lower rate to preserve the existence of Internet radio as we know it. 
   We know that the rates set by the CRB would have killed Internet radio, and today we stand on the cusp of a major breakthrough after months of difficult negotiations between the private parties. This bill does nothing to affect the scope of performance rights or make any other changes to the underlying copyright law. It clearly does not affect broadcasters. They will not be bound by any settlement, negotiated settlement or settlement agreement. 
   This bill simply clears the path for the private negotiations to continue while Congress is in recess. I have long opposed congressional mandates and other government impositions on private parties. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It simply gives the webcasters and copyright holders the freedom to continue the negotiation process. 
   Without this legislation, negotiation could not continue, and all parties would be bound by the CRB decision. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is likely to be the last time I address the House, at least for some time, and I would like to take a moment to thank the Judiciary Committee staff, and the majority staff, and minority staff, for their tireless work, and for the floor staff of both the majority and minority parties who have been amazingly good at keeping things moving here. 
   Finally, I would like to thank our wonderful clerical staff who keep things moving and have made this such a pleasant and wonderful place to do business. I think I should also like to add thanks to our security for the floor for the wonderful support they have been.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANNON. (HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Madam Chairman, the language included in Section 103 of HR 2316 entitled Additional Restrictions on Contractors is language I offered at the Judiciary Committee that closed a loophole in the revolving door provisions of the law. 
   This language was accepted by voice vote in the Judiciary Committee with the support of Committee Chairman JOHN CONYERS. My amendment would impose the same post employment restrictions currently in law to those attorneys and firms that are employed through a contract with the Congress. 
   Currently, the House Judiciary Committee Majority has agreed to a contract with a partner in a law firm at the same time that law firm is registered to lobby the Congress and in particular is registered to lobby for clients with particular legislative interest before the committee. It is a glaring loophole that a law firm would be able to send an individual to work on the hill at the same time the firm is lobbying the contract employee's colleagues on the committee and the contract employee can potentially lobby the committee where they worked because they are technically not an employee of the committee. 
   The contract the Judiciary Committee signed was with Irv Nathan of Arnold and Porter for $25,000 per month for up to $250,000 for a 10 month contract. An astonishing amount of money to be paid to a staffer, an amount any full time staffer or member would appreciate to be making. 
   It is my opinion the only way to comply with clause 14(b) of House Rule XXI, which states contract employees shall not be able to use one's official position for private gain and to conduct oneself at all times in a manner that reflects creditably on the House, is to include contract employees in the revolving door provisions. In an article from the Washington Post on January 16, 2007, Jeff Birnbaum writes:  
   The most jaw-dropping hire from K Street, though, is Matt Gelman. Gelman is senior adviser to House Democratic Whip James E. Clyburn (S.C.) and is, in effect, on loan from Microsoft, where he is director of federal government affairs. He's on unpaid leave for a few months from the software giant and will return after he helps build Clyburn's vote-counting operation.  
   Furthermore, in a January 27, 2007 story in McClatchy Newspapers Matt Stearns writes:  
   Clyburn spokeswoman Kristie Greco defended the hire, saying that Gelman is a veteran Capitol Hill aide with specialized knowledge ..... and that Microsoft is banned from lobbying Clyburn's personal and leadership offices while Gelman works there.  
   In essence, the language would codify the Clyburn precedent and extend the post-employment restrictions to contract employees and their firms. This language closes a loophole which is ripe for abuse. 
   I appreciate that the language was accepted and remains in the legislation that is being considered today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANNON. Madam Chairman, this amendment will undo an important provision of the Bankruptcy Code that was enacted just 2 years ago in the bipartisan Bankruptcy Abuse, Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. It will increase risk for student lending, risk that the lending market will respond to by restricting the availability of credit. 
   The bankruptcy law currently allows student loans to be discharged if the graduate is facing an undue hardship. This policy provides balance by protecting truly unfortunate graduates, while still preserving the integrity of student loans. 
   This amendment will eviscerate this policy by removing the undue hardship requirement for private sector student loans, allowing these loans to be discharged 5 years after graduation. Federally guaranteed loans can still be discharged only upon a showing of undue hardship. Accordingly, the private market, which is the most sensitive to risk, bears the burden of this change. Students looking for loans in the future will have a hard time finding them. Inevitably, students would encounter higher interest rates, shorter payment periods, and other more restrictive lending terms as lenders look to avoid potential losses in bankruptcy. 
   The amendment, in short, would damage, not advance, the cost of education. There is no free lunch and there is no free bankruptcy. We can do better for our students, and we can do better for our system of higher education. This amendment would undo an important provision of the Bankruptcy Code enacted just 2 years ago. If there is one thing that is important in commercial law, including bankruptcy law, it's stability. Lenders and investors must have confidence that Congress will not constantly change the rules of the game. 
   We will send the wrong message if a mere 2 years after BAPCPA's passage we begin to tinker with the provisions of the new bankruptcy law. Regrettably, the pattern is already beginning to emerge in this Congress. It can and should be stopped. 
   Capricious treatment of creditors in bankruptcy can have only one effect, the chilling of lending and investment. Changes in the Bankruptcy Code ought to receive the scrutiny of the Judiciary Committee. Since the Davis amendment is not being considered by the Judiciary Committee, the congressional experts on bankruptcy have had no opportunity to vet it through in regular order. This amendment will do more harm than good and will affect the availability of student loans in the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.
