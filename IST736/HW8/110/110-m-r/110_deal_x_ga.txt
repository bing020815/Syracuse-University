<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2851, which is commonly known as Michelle's Law. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Hodes from New Hampshire and Mr. Castle from Delaware for introducing this important legislation and also to thank Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Dingell, subcommittee Chairman PALLONE and Ranking Member Barton for their cooperative efforts in working in a bipartisan manner to move this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   The American people know we must focus our health care efforts on providing increased access to quality, personal health insurance plans that give more Americans control and ownership over their own health care. 
   As my colleagues are well aware, by increasing the number of Federal mandates on health insurance plans, we are inevitably making health insurance plans more expensive for more Americans and decreasing the number of Americans who can afford the quality personal health insurance plan that they want for their families. Without question, it is vital for Congress to avoid one-size-fits-all Federal mandates on health insurance if we're going to be able to increase the number of Americans with access to quality health insurance plans. 
   However, I think the bill before us today is a very narrowly tailored solution to an extremely rare problem that results from a very small number of bad actors. This legislation takes the needed step of ensuring that more college-aged Americans will be able to stay on their parents' health insurance coverage in the rare event that they become too sick to remain enrolled in school. 
   We know that by passing this legislation today, we can help assure American college students that their personal health insurance plan will be there for them giving them one less thing to worry about as they focus on their own illness and on earning their degrees. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their bipartisan support of this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today the House is set to pass legislation reauthorizing the Animal Drug User Fee Act, also known as ADUFA. This legislation represents a compromise between the parties, the administration, and the industry. 
   Development of animal drugs can take years and cost millions of dollars. A predictable review process is important to make sure that these products are approved in a timely way. Since the passage of ADUFA in 2003, the review times for new animal drugs went from 295 days in Fiscal Year 2004 to 180 days in Fiscal Year 2008. 
   We need to reauthorize this program before we leave for the August recess. If we fail to do so, the FDA may have to begin issuing reduction in force notices to its employees. The bill before us today will provide financial stability for the program and improve the health information infrastructure for drug review. It will also provide more user revenue for the program. 
   Along with ADUFA, for the first time, Congress is set to pass legislation which would create the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act, or AGDUFA. AGDUFA will allow the FDA to collect user fees, thereby improving the times necessary for generic drug approval. This will not only bring generics to the market more quickly, but will also lower costs for consumers. If AGDUFA is authorized, approval times could be reduced from 700 days in Fiscal Year 2009, to around 270 days in Fiscal Year 2013. 
   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the passage of both of these pieces of legislation in the bill that is before us today. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   I want to, first of all, thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman Pallone for working in a bipartisan fashion on this very important piece of legislation. 
   As we all know, the work of the FDA is vital to the health and safety of the citizens of this country, and especially legislation such as this that enhances their ability to deal with the questions of drug safety and the monitoring capabilities and the continuing programs that are so vital both to the drugs and to medical devices which require review and approval by the FDA. 
   The user fee programs that are being reauthorized by this legislation are very important to fulfilling their role in meeting their personnel needs to achieve a timely review of drugs and medical devices, and I believe that Congress should not and cannot afford to delay further action on this package. Certainly to do so would require FDA to begin to scale back their personnel, and none of us want to see that happen. 
   Moreover, patients demand and deserve to know that the medications they are taking are safe and effective, and that the FDA has adequate resources, both pre- and postmarket, in order to ensure that the safety of the Nation's drug supply is intact. 
   This legislation makes sensible bipartisan strides in that direction and balances the need to bring new life-saving medications to market, and at the same time provide the necessary protections for patient safety. 
   Like all compromises, there was a necessary give-and-take from all sides to bring this bill to the floor today. I think it is through the responsible work of the leadership of our committee of Energy and Commerce and through the processes that the committee has followed that we were able to accomplish that on this very significant piece of legislation. 
   I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill and hope that our colleagues across the rotunda would do likewise so that we can present a bill to the desk of the President for his signature which will keep this vital program and functions of FDA going forward and will not allow it to expire.

<DOCNO>Mr. DEAL of Georgia. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   We're debating the reauthorization of a bill that has been in place for 10 years. It would seem to me that, in doing so, we should learn from the mistakes that were made in the initial legislation and attempt to correct them. I believe the legislation before us tonight overlooks that opportunity. 
   We have seen the House version that passed here earlier, and we have now seen a Senate version; and the one before us tonight is very similar to the Senate version of this legislation. But it appears to me that we have some questions to ask about that. CBO says that there are 300,000 fewer uninsured low-income children who will be enrolled under the bill before us today than would have been enrolled under the original Senate bill, and yet the amount of money that is being spent is almost exactly the same, an additional $35 billion over the next 5 years. When you couple that $35 billion with the baseline budgeting and the amount of money that States will have to put into the program, we find that we're going to be spending about $60 billion over the next 5 years for a program that for the first 10 years was only a $40 billion program. And when you do include that State funding into the mix, it will be $200 billion over the next 10 years. 
   Now, who are we going to insure by putting this substantial amount of new money into the program? Once again, the Congressional Budget Office attempts to answer that question. They say that there will be an additional 800,000 children, currently SCHIP eligible, being enrolled in the program by the year 2012. And if that is truly the focus, which it should be the focus of the program, then what are we getting by spending an additional $60 billion? If you divide $60 billion by the additional 800,000 children, that means that this bill is going to require that we spend $74,000 per child. Now, I know the government can throw money away, but I believe that is certainly an excessive amount of money. 
   Now, who are these children that are going to be the new enrollees? Once again, CBO tells us that, of the additional children who are going to be potentially enrolled, that about half of them are children who already have private health insurance, a 50 percent crowd-out of the existing insurance market. 
   Now, they also tell us that we ought to be concerned about the fact that if there are potentially going to be as many as 2 million children who will have been moved out of their private insurance into this government-subsidized program, we're also told that Medicaid and also SCHIP generally pay less than the private insurance market pays, that means that the health care providers, the doctors and the hospitals, are going to have to absorb another 2 million patients who are going to be reimbursing them at a lower rate. Another error in the original program, it was for children, and yet we know that four States currently have more adults than children in their program. 
   Under this bill before us, CBO estimates that in the next 5 years there will still be 780,000 adults enrolled in the Children's Health Care Program. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DEAL of Georgia. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this legislation. It is unfortunate that the majority in the House refused to pursue a strategy that our colleagues in the other body found appropriate for this legislation. Legislating, as we know, means compromising, and our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol worked together to craft a consensus piece of mental health parity legislation.  
   As a supporter of the concept of mental health parity, it is disappointing to me that the House has instead decided to jeopardize the possibility of getting legislation on mental health parity this year by ignoring the broad consensus among Members and stakeholders which was developed in the Senate. 
   Mental illness affects tens of millions of Americans. According to the Surgeon General, approximately one in five Americans suffers adverse mental conditions during any given year. The impact from such illnesses on families can be devastating, and we must be doing more to improve access to mental health services. However, this bill before us today is not the correct approach. 
   At a time of climbing premiums and health insurance costs, it is strange to me that we would pursue a path which the CBO acknowledges will raise the price of health insurance. CBO also projected that H.R. 1424 would cause some to lose their health insurance benefits and some employers to terminate mental health benefits altogether. In the face of a growing uninsured population in this country, statements like these from CBO concern me. We must find a more balanced approach to this problem that protects access to health insurance and mental health benefits. 
   The bill's focus is also overly broad and includes coverage of some conditions that fall well short of diseases under most scientifically accepted definitions. Our legislation should focus on serious biologically based mental disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, not on jet lag and caffeine addiction, as this bill would include. Employers may be willing to provide coverage for serious mental disorders, but under this bill could decide to drop coverage of mental illness altogether because they cannot afford the scope of the DSM-IV, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Surely, this is an unintended consequence we should all want to avoid. 
   It is also important to note that under the bill, no executive or congressional action would intercede between the decisions of the American Psychiatric Association in the creation of the DSM and future legal requirements with which employers and insurers must comply under penalty of Federal law. I have always been concerned that this represents a likely constitutional conflict under the delegations doctrine. The bill appears to leave any update of what qualifies as mental health conditions and, therefore, coverage under the bill to the American Psychiatric Association. There are no criteria for judicial review, required notice and comment, or congressional review of future decisions made by a nongovernment entity. 
   I want to be clear that I am not questioning the value of the DSM or the practice of medicine, or the process by which the manual is developed. But I believe giving the future decisions of a nongovernmental body the force of law raises serious constitutional questions. I would support a more balanced approach to mental health parity along the lines of the Senate bill. 
   I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' today so that we can take up the Senate bill and avoid a possible stalemate in a House-Senate conference on an issue that should be signed into law this Congress. 
   I would reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DEAL of Georgia. (HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I have a speaker who will appear shortly. He was here just a second ago. 
   In the meantime, I would use the time to simply thank Mr. Green as the lead sponsor of this legislation. He's done an excellent job. He did work across party lines, and I thought we had a good product that came out of our Health Subcommittee and our entire committee and came from the floor of this House. I think it's important that we do that on bills of this nature. 
   I would like to also thank, in addition to Mr. Murphy who's spoken on the Volunteer Doctors provision, Ms. DeGette who was interested in that as well. Unfortunately, that provision, along with a provision that Congressman Burgess and Congressman Stupak had for some alternative ways of providing additional care under the community health center model, which we had included in our bill on the House side, was not agreed to by our colleagues across the way. 
   However, the legislation before us today does require three GAO studies to look at all of the issues which we had originally addressed in the legislation that came from the House. Hopefully those GAO studies will confirm the wisdom of the House of including those provisions in the initial bill, and I look forward to seeing the results of those studies and perhaps our ability to revisit this issue of community health centers because I, too, believe that one of the ways we can accomplish greater access is to provide volunteer doctors with Federal tort claims protections so that they can use their services and their talents in community health centers which have a very difficult time attracting doctors in many of the rural areas, in particular.  
   I rise today in support of H.R. 1343, the ``Health Centers Renewal Act,'' a critical piece  of legislation which will reauthorize Community Health Centers and the National Health Service Corps. Community Health Centers provide a fundamental element of our healthcare delivery system in our nation, providing much needed care for uninsured or under-insured individuals seeking very low cost healthcare services. These centers have, and continue to, impact communities across our country and provide a critical safety net for care for thousands of Americans every year. With nearly 47 million Americans living without health insurance, traditional pay-for services have become prohibitively expensive for many. With no remaining option for even the most basic healthcare services, our emergency rooms are being overwhelmed. Community Health Centers step in to fill that gap, relieving the strain on hospital emergency rooms which cost exorbitantly more to operate and are pressed beyond capacity. 
   H.R. 1343 reauthorizes Community Health Centers for five years while seeking to improve the access to, and quality of, services available under this program throughout the nation. This legislation requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct three studies, all of which will evaluate mechanisms through which the health center program can do more for our communities. First, GAO will evaluate the incorporation of integrated health systems as a model for improving the access to care for medically underserved populations. Second, GAO will also study the effects of implementing policies which would establish school-based health centers. Finally, this legislation will evaluate the potential benefits which could be achieved by extending federal liability protections to healthcare practitioners to encourage participation in Community Health Centers, both in their community as well as additional areas ravaged by hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, or other disaster situations. In light of the devastation in the Gulf Coast region just a few years ago, our healthcare delivery system was put to the ultimate test. Thousands upon thousands of victims were affected. While physicians and other healthcare professionals were ready and willing to answer the call to serve, concerns regarding medical liability turned them away from their call to service. This is an apparent problem an Congress must address this issue to avoid a repeat of this unfortunate situation in the future. 
   I believe this legislation represents a reasonable compromise, reflecting the priorities of the House, Senate, and healthcare industry, and provides much-needed reauthorization to this critical component of our nation's healthcare infrastructure. I would also like to express my appreciation to the National Association of Community Health Centers for working so well with House and Senate staff in order to craft this legislation before us today. Again, I am pleased to see this legislation on the floor today, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this critical reauthorization of Community Health Centers.  
   At this time, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Mississippi, who is a member of this committee, who also has worked on this legislation, for such time as he may consume, Mr. Pickering.

By removing the barriers which restrict cross-institutional information sharing, we will be able to bring America's best scientists together to collaborate and work together in pursuit of a cure. 
   The bill also increases the overall authorization of the NIH by $40 million to further aid their mission in this research.

   Mr. Speaker, I have the honor today to rise in support of the memory of Army Sergeant Jason Robert Harkins by dedicating the United States Post Office located in Cleveland, Georgia, as the Sgt. Jason Harkins Post Office Building. 
   I want to thank Mr. Davis and the committee for bringing this bill to the floor. It is, indeed, a sad but true honor to be able to recognize Sergeant Harkins. He was a member of the United States Army 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division of Fort Lewis, Washington. 
   While serving his second tour of duty in Iraq, 25-year-old Sergeant Harkins was killed by a roadside bomb along with five other members of his platoon during combat operations in Baqubah, Iraq. For his valiant service to our country, Sergeant Harkins' family was presented the Bronze Star award and the Purple Heart. 
   Born in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Sergeant Harkins was a 1999 graduate of Habersham Central High School in Georgia, served 3 years in the United States Army Reserves and was currently serving with the Stryker Brigade located at Fort Lewis when the attack occurred. 
   Sergeant Jason Harkins is survived by his wife, Emily Renee Cook Harkins of Tacoma, Washington, formerly of Gadsden, Alabama; mother and stepfather, Nancy and Allen Fritchey; father and stepmother, Bobby and April Harkins; brothers Matthew and Daniel Harkins; as well as stepsisters Katie, Clara, Nicole, Jennifer and Emily; stepbrother Scott; and several nieces and nephews.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 2900. I think this bill plays an important role in ensuring that patients have timely access to approved, safe, and effective medications and medical devices. This legislation creates an entirely new post-marketing drug safety program that will help address some of the troubling recent drug scares that we have all been aware of. 
   The Subcommittee on Health in our Energy and Commerce Committee held numerous hearings on the programs authorized in this bill, and I am pleased that members of the committee were able to come together to work out a bipartisan compromise that continues many important programs of the FDA. For instance, the Prescription Drug and User Fee Amendments and the Medical Device User Fee Amendments allow the FDA to continue important programs which provide the agency with resources for the expeditious review of life-saving drugs and devices. 
   One important addition in the prescription drug user fee amendments addresses direct-to-consumer advertisements. I share concern with many members on the committee about the drug advertisements being presented to patients, and I am glad the bill takes steps to provide for the FDA's review of these television ads while at the same time protecting freedom of speech. 
   However, our main concern is the FDA's increasing reliance on the regulated industry to fund its drug review activities, and hope that future appropriations will take advantage of the amendment I offered at the full committee to help reduce FDA's dependence on user fees by replacing them with appropriations. This amendment stated there should be a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the new user fee for every new dollar appropriated for post-market safety. The amendment was a step in the right direction, but I believe more should be done to restore the balance between user fees and appropriations for drug review. 
   The bill also continues important programs which encourage the study of medications in pediatric populations. Meeting the unique medical needs of children presents special challenges, and H.R. 2900 reauthorizes two programs which have effectively promoted the study of drugs in children. It also encourages the development of medical devices for use in pediatric populations. 
   This legislation also improves FDA drug safety authorities. Recent incidents have undermined consumer confidence in the FDA's ability to ensure that the medications they take on a regular basis are safe. H.R. 2900 provides the agency with new tools to better monitor products that might present greater risk to patients. I believe these reforms will help maintain the FDA's position as the world leader in protecting patient safety and access to safe medications. 
   In conclusion, I think this is a good compromise. Our committee worked hard on it. Both sides came together in an effort to try to present this House with a package that I hope will be approved today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill before us which extends Transitional Medical Assistance and the Title V Abstinence Education programs, and the Qualified Individuals programs, more commonly referred to as QI-1 program. I am pleased that the Congress can work together toward extending the funding for these particular programs. 
   I support the reauthorization of Title V Abstinence Education program, a program that provides resources to  educate our Nation's youth about the benefits of an abstinent lifestyle. I'm sure many of my colleagues have heard, as I have, from the numerous programs within my State that rely on this Federal funding. They believe in the program, and they hope to continue providing abstinence educational opportunities to local teens. 
   The QI-1 program provides money to States to pay the Medicare part B premiums of low-income beneficiaries ineligible for Medicaid. Without this relief, the low-income beneficiaries enrolled in this program would have to start paying for their part B premiums, which have risen over the past few years due to overspending in Medicare. 
   I am supportive of extending this program in order that we may continue to provide assistance for our low-income seniors and beneficiaries as we've done in such a bipartisan manner each year for the past several years. 
   This bill also corrects a provision that was included in a bill for money for our troops in Iraq passed earlier this year. There is a provision in that bill that denies payment for any Medicaid prescription that isn't written on a Secretary-approved, tamper-resistant drug pad. Since then, we've heard from doctors, nurses, pharmacists and State health officials across the Nation that the October 1 implementation deadline required by that bill is much too soon. I am pleased we are affording our Nation's health care providers the flexibility needed to properly implement this new requirement so as not to jeopardize access to care for our Medicaid beneficiaries. 
   In addition, this package includes $385 million in new funding for the Medicare Physician Assistance and Quality Initiative fund created by last year's tax relief bill. That fund provides bonus payments to physicians for reporting on quality measures this year, and includes over $1 billion set aside for bonus payments in 2008. I am pleased to see this fund extended into 2009 and beyond. 
   It is a bipartisan recognition that incentivizing physicians to provide quality, efficient and effective health care holds the promise of a better Medicare physician reimbursement system, one that reflects accountability for the type and volume of Medicare services. The Physician Assistance and Quality Initiative fund that we put in place last year takes an important first step in that direction, and I'm happy to see that the House Democrats agree with that position. 
   In closing, I would like to reiterate my support for the bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

   The second thing that it does is something that he really believed in as well, and that is overcoming bureaucratic red tape that made no common sense. And that is what this bill does. Pairing of donations for kidneys makes all of the common sense in the world. It will save lives and money. Certainly in the tradition of Charlie Norwood, it will perpetuate the importance of organ donations and do so in the memory and in the honor of a great Member of this body.

   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I realize it's late, and I'll be brief. 
   We've talked about a lot of things today. I'd like to talk about horses and mules for a few minutes. Under the current law, when a horse or a mule is deemed no longer fit for service in agencies such as the Border Patrol or Customs, the law requires that they either be turned out to pasture on Federal lands, where they usually are subject to predators, or that they be destroyed. This amendment would simply say that they would be allowed to be adopted by their handlers. 
   This is an animal equity amendment, Mr. Chairman. We do the same thing for dogs who have been in the service and are allowed to be adopted by their handlers. This would simply allow the handlers of horses and mules to do exactly the same thing. And I would urge the adoption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this is a program that started 10 years ago with a $40 billion Federal authorization of expenditures. The current bill before us would spend $128.7 billion over the next 10 years. When added with the State money, that is over $255 billion in taxpayer money over the next 10 years. That is over a quarter of a trillion dollars. And what do you get for it? 
   CBO says you will cover 600,000 more eligible children, 600,000 children. You would be better off to give each one of them $80,000 in cash, and they would probably get better results. 
   In 1996, we had an immigration bill that provided that if you wanted to bring somebody and sponsor somebody to come into this country legally, you would have to say they would not go on the public rolls of Medicaid and other programs for 5 years. This bill removes that. CBO says that alone will cost $2.2 billion, and we let sponsors off the hook and we put them on the public payroll. 
   If we have a bill like the Senate was considering that would make 20 million illegals legal, that cost alone would be $140 billion a year. What it does, too, is it says, in the area of immigration, we are going to spend $400 billion paying for translators, not just to serve people but to enroll them in the program. That is $400 million. 
   Now they can say this does not open it up to illegal immigrants just by saying that. CBO says it will cost $2 billion because they think that is the cost that it is. What they are saying is just sign an affidavit that says you are legally in this country. I have speeders who would just like to sign an affidavit saying they have a driver's license. I have taxpayers who would like on April 15 to sign an affidavit saying they didn't have any taxable income; just take my word for it. And if you believe just signing an affidavit is a deterrent to people illegally in the country, then you also believe we can just put a sign at the Mexican border saying, if you don't have permission, just don't come in. 
   This is a ridiculous piece of legislation. It will undermine the purposes of the original bill.

   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we've heard a lot of opinions today about the effects of this bill; and opinions are, of course, of different perspectives on the bill. But there is an agency that we all rely on, supposedly, to give us the facts, and that is the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Now, there has been an argument about whether or not this bill, in its reforms, will go back to a system that would allow illegal immigrants to be covered. Now, we can say that it doesn't, but CBO says that, by changing that provision back to the way it used to be, that over the next 5 years it will cost $800 million and over the next 10 years it will cost $1.9 billion. 
   Now, CBO is simply saying that if you make it easier for illegals to enter the program, that's the price tag. They wouldn't say that if they didn't have some basis for coming up with those numbers. They didn't just pull them out of the air. 
   The other part deals with legal immigrants. We have had a policy in this country that if someone wants to bring a family member, a friend, or sponsor somebody to come in and we give that person coming in legal status, that they are not eligible to participate in our social programs, such as Medicaid, for the first 5 years. Their sponsor signs an affidavit that they will be personally responsible for that. 
   This bill removes that waiting time. So when you bring someone in, they can immediately sign up for the Medicaid rolls. Now, CBO says that that will cost $900 million over the next 5 years and $2.2 billion over the next 10 years. Now, the truth of the matter is that this bill gives incentives to States to allow this to happen. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote.

   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this resolution, and I  readily admit that I don't know for sure what the best policy is in this fight against radical Islamic groups. With all due respect, I don't think any other Member of this body does either. Much of what we have heard this week are words based on emotions, and not facts. 
   In the midst of such uncertainty, I do believe there are certain opinions that are factually sound. Number one, the greatest weapon our enemy has is the loss of resolve on the part of the American people. Two, what this Congress does significantly affects that resolve of the American people. Three, this resolution is a major signal that America has lost its resolve. 
   If we succumb to an attitude of defeat, then defeat is what will occur. I will simply ask, if we don't want to engage radical Islam in Iraq, then where? If we don't want to engage radical Islam now, then when?     
   If we cannot answer these questions, be assured that our enemy will provide us with the answers. I am not willing to vote for a resolution that I believe does just that. It is true that the Iraqis must truly step forward and want to govern themselves. President Bush has set out markers by which they will be measured. We should hold them to these reasonable standards. 
   Tonight I stand with our troops, and I thank them and their families for their service.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes of time to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) and thank him for arranging for this resolution to be heard at this time today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we all know, we lost a true champion in the House of Representatives on yesterday: Charles Norwood from Georgia. Charlie, as he was known by most of us here, was truly a friend across party lines and across State lines. He was a true patriot. He served in the dental services in the U.S. Army in the combat zone of Vietnam. 
   He returned to a private dental practice in Georgia, and then in the election cycle of 1994 was elected to this House of Representatives. He came with a passion for many things. Health care was at the very top of his list. Education was very shortly thereafter. And he worked on both of those issues with all of his heart. 
   He inspired many people in this House because he was indeed passionate about everything that he did. If he was your friend, you knew he was your friend. If you were on the opposite side of an issue from him, he let you know that as well, but he was still your friend. 
   All of us watched as we observed what had been diagnosed in 1998 as an incurable disease. And following that diagnosis, he underwent lung transplant surgery. That was a process that most of us probably would have had great difficulty undergoing. But Charlie did it with courage. He rebounded with the same kind of determination  and willingness to go forward in spite of the inconveniences that that brought to him. 
   We saw him with his oxygen tank, and we saw him on his little scooter as he rode around the Capitol on his way over here and back and forth to votes. Throughout it all, he maintained his good humor, he maintained his zest for life. Charlie Norwood is someone who will truly be missed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, the State Children's Health Insurance Plan, there ought to be something that we can agree on. The first is that the program ought to be for children. And yet we are told that in the bill the President has rightfully vetoed, in 5 years there will be 780,000 adults still in a children's health program. 
   Secondly, this program ought to be, as its primary target was, for children below 200 percent of poverty. We know that in States that have gone above the 200 percent level, they have left behind up to a quarter of their children in their State that are below 200 percent of poverty, and there is nothing in this bill that requires them to go back and make sure that they enroll those children. In fact, this legislation repeals the outline that CMS had put out to require 95 percent saturation of children below 200 percent of poverty. So there is no effort to go back and do what the program was designed to do, and that is to help those between the 100 and 200 percent of poverty. 
   Madam Speaker, the third thing is that we all ought to agree that Medicaid and SCHIP ought to be for Americans, for American children. The change that this bill puts into place will allow people who are not qualified under our current law for Medicaid or SCHIP to become eligible. CBO says that the Federal cost of that alone is $3.7 billion. 
   I think the last thing we ought to agree on is that we should not take a major step toward socializing health care in this country. This bill does nothing to prevent States from having what is called ``income disregards.'' That is, if a State says, well, we just won't count what it costs for housing, we won't count what it costs for food, we won't count what is costs for transportation in computing your percent of poverty eligibility, then you can go up to 800 percent of poverty. And that certainly distorts the program. 
   Madam Speaker, lastly, we want to talk about time and the use of time. We knew 10 years ago that this bill was going to expire at the end of last month. This was a 10-year authorization bill. We knew in 1997 when it was put in place that it was going to expire at the end of September of this year. We knew 9 months ago when this Congress went into session that unless something was done, the legislation was going to expire the end of September. And yet only at the last minute was legislation presented in this House, with no legislative hearing, and then asked to be voted on, and not a single House Republican participated in the conference committee report that we are now being asked to sustain and to agree to at this point.

<DOCNO>Mr. DEAL of Georgia. (CONGRESSIONAL IMMIGRATION CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Bilbray. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we approach this topic of dealing with the ever-increasing problem of illegal immigration in this country, it is certainly one with many facets. But the one that I would like to address briefly tonight is the issue that relates to birthright citizenship. Let me define it, first of all. It is the extension of citizenship to any child born on American soil, regardless of the legal status of the parents of that child. 
   The United States does just that. But we are in an ever-increasing minority in the world community. Currently, there are approximately 141 nations that do not grant birthright citizenship.     
   And there are only about 35 countries that do, the United States being one of those. In fact, every country in Europe no longer grants birthright citizenship. Ireland was the last of those countries, and in 2004 by popular vote, they no longer grant birthright citizenship. Israel doesn't, Japan doesn't, virtually every country on the face of the earth with the exception of the United States have recognized that the right of citizenship is indeed one of the most precious rights, and it should not be extended to those who have broken our law and who are illegally in our country. 
   Just as the overall immigration issue has many facets, so does the issue of birthright citizenship. First of all, there is the question of, how do you solve the problem? The real difficulty comes from the fact that the current interpretation is based on an interpretation of the language of the 14th amendment. 
   Many legal scholars believe that the intention of the 14th amendment, which had as its primary purpose to settle the issue of citizenship for individuals who were formerly slaves, has been perverted to extend it to birthright citizenship for anyone born on American soil. There are certainly legitimate arguments that can be made on both sides of the issue. But the one that I think focuses most clearly on whether or not it was the intention of the writers of the 14th amendment to include this issue is demonstrated in the language that comes out of the debates that surrounded the adoption of that amendment. 
   The reality is, though, that many of the court cases upon which people rely today to say that we automatically extend citizenship to anyone born on our soil regardless of the legal status of their parents, comes from a day and a time when the United States did not have immigration laws in place, did not have in place laws that distinguished between those who were legally in our country and those who were not. We, of course, now live in a day and a time when those laws are in place, albeit they are not very well enforced most of the time. 
   But what is the cost of this issue of birthright citizenship? I think there is a legitimate argument that can be made to say that birthright citizenship is one of those magnets that contributes to illegal immigration in the first place. Consider the latest statistics from the Center for Immigration Studies in which they say that there are approximately 383,000 children born every year to illegal immigrants. That is, about 42 percent of the births to all immigrants in this country are to illegal immigrants to this country, and that births to illegal immigrants now account for one out of every ten births in the United States. One out of every ten children born in this country is being born to someone, a parent, who had no legal right to be here. 
   What are the financial costs associated with it? We all know that illegal immigration in and of itself places huge financial strains on local governments in providing education, in providing health care, and on State governments in the same way, and also on the Federal Government. 
   The Center for Immigration Studies found that the cost to United States taxpayers for the cost of illegal immigration is approximately $10.4 billion a year. And a large part of that cost is attributable to babies born to illegal immigrants. 
   In my State of Georgia, for example, I am told that a non-Caesarian section child delivery with no complications costs approximately $2,720. Now you multiply that figure, and probably my State's cost is less than the national average, but you multiply that by the 383,000-plus births every year, and you can instantly see that just in that initial health care delivery cost, it is a very significant sum. 
   But what does birthright citizenship then also do to our system? First of all, in 1996, when we passed the Immigration Reform Act, one of the things that many people have bragged about was a provision that said in general terms that if you are illegally in this country, you are not going to be entitled to any social benefits other than education at the elementary and secondary level and emergency medical care. 
   Now, we make a mockery of that by virtue of birthright citizenship because even though we say we are not going to extend those social services, by giving a child of an illegal immigrant citizenship status, you immediately have TANF, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, whatever term you call it in your community, those kinds of welfare social benefits flow through the child. There are also food stamps and housing subsidy benefits, and who are you going to deliver them to, a new child? Of course not. Those social benefits in the form of cash and other indicia of benefits flow through the hands of the illegal parents. 
   And are you going to deport the parents, an illegal immigrant who has given birth to a child who is a United States citizen? I say you probably are not, and the statistics bear me out. 
   So I would simply say, Mr. Speaker, if somebody is concerned about these issues, the next time they have to wait in line in the doctor's office or in the hospital or in the waiting room of the emergency clinic, or the next time that they are in the grocery checkout line and somebody is paying for food with food stamps and it is fairly apparent that they are not legally in this country and you want to know why, the why lies in birthright citizenship that is being granted to a child of that illegal immigrant. 
   Now, as I say, we are in the distinct minority in the world community of continuing to allow this practice to occur. I, along with Mr. Bilbray and Mr. King and many others in our conference, are authors of legislation that would attempt to correct this serious problem that we have. 
   Many who would dispute whether or not this is a part of the magnet that draws people into our country and to cross our borders illegally should take reference to a statement contained in one of the publications from the Department of Homeland Security. I would like to read from that publication. It says, ``An industry has developed around this practice,'' that is, crossing the border illegally specifically to give birth, ``with travel agents specializing in birth tours and clinics  providing post-natal care, which includes transportation services. For those seeking entry into this country, it is a small price to pay for legal entry and social benefits that accrue with citizenship.'' 
   So our own Department of Homeland Security acknowledges that it is indeed one of those magnets that causes us to have a problem with illegal immigration. 
   In 2002, it was reported by the Los Angeles Times in a study that they did looking at South Korea, and what they found was that since South Korea allows dual citizenship, that is both South Korea and United States citizenship, for a child born in the United States, they found that South Korea was hosting these so-called birth tours which were intended to bring pregnant women to the United States so they could deliver their child here and that child would be a United States citizen.     
   Now, they probably returned back to South Korea with that child. So what would be their motivation? Well, first of all, they would be entitled to the benefits of American citizenship, but another added advantage, since South Korea is a country that requires universal military service, it is a way of excluding that child from the requirements of South Korea that they be inducted into their military services. So it has consequences, not just to us, but to some of our allies such as South Korea. 
   So I would simply thank Mr. Bilbray for the time you have allotted me tonight to speak on this issue. Hopefully, we will see some action on this issue of birthright citizenship. It can stand alone, or it can travel as a part of a more comprehensive immigration reform package; but I submit that unless we address this problem, it is only going to get worse. It is going to only magnify the ever-increasing problem of illegal immigration, and I would urge my colleagues to join with me and you and Mr. King and others in sponsoring the legislation that we have tailored to try to address this problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, well, here we are again. When the bill came up the first time, we had not had a chance to mark it up in the committee. We were not allowed amendments on the floor. And the process has been a take-it-or-leave-it because it appears that the issue is let's talk about children going to emergency rooms rather than doing something about extending the SCHIP program. 
   And here we are again saying we don't want to do anything tonight; we want to reserve the time to talk about it in January. 
   Well, there is an old saying that we ought to mean what we say and say what we mean. 
   If the Democrats really want an SCHIP program, which I think they do, and Republicans do as well, then there ought to be some principles which have been on the table all along that should be able to be agreed to. One is that this is children's health insurance plan, and there ought not to be either a continuation of nor an expansion of the addition of adults into that program. And yet that continues to be one of the issues on which there is no agreement. 
   Another issue is that it was intended to be for children at the below 200 percent of poverty level. We have said we should have been a saturation below 200 percent of poverty at 90 or 95 percent of those children before States start moving up the ladder, not to the working poor, but in some cases by many States' standards to the very rich or at least the middle income when you get to 300 and 350 and 400 percent of poverty. There has never been an agreement to say let's saturate the low-income children and cover them first as a prerequisite. 
   And lastly, it is a program for American children and the continued efforts to create loopholes so that people who are not citizens, who are not legally in our country, who are not entitled to be covered under this plan which is for American citizens, they continue to insist that that loophole should not only be continued but also expanded. 
   I would urge us to go ahead and vote now. Let's don't just talk about it. Let's do and say what we mean.

   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Newborn screening can certainly identify children at risk for certain metabolic and genetic diseases for which there may be an effective treatment. If it is detected early it is certainly a cost-saving way of dealing with these problems that can lead to death, disability, mental retardation and many other serious conditions. 
   Currently, States have differing policies and procedures for doing newborn screening. Accurate screening ensures affected babies are identified and receive the proper care.     
   This legislation establishes a newborn screening education and outreach program at the Department of Health and Human Services in order to improve newborn screening. Many parents of newborns are not aware of the wide variety of screening tests that are available. Thus, the legislation would establish a clearinghouse of educational and family support and services information on newborn screening in order to provide resources for those families. 
   This legislation moved through our committee in a bipartisan process and the majority and the minority were able to reconcile a few differences on the legislation in that committee process. I would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.

   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I, too, rise in support of the Cytology Proficiency Improvement Act. I was a sponsor of legislation similar to this in the last Congress which passed the House, but unfortunately it was never signed into law. The bill revises national quality assurance standards of laboratories responsible for cytology services. 
   A few summers ago, I had the opportunity to visit a laboratory of a pathologist in my district, and I saw first hand the impact of this legislation. This bill is the result of actions taken in 2005 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to institute a proficiency testing program for individual pathologists.     
   Unfortunately, this program was based on regulations first issued in 1992 as a result of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. Thus the cytology proficiency program is now very outdated and based on regulations from nearly 15 years ago. 
   The legislation would provide for an orderly phase-out of the current program and transition into a new program where all individuals involved in screening and interpreting Pap tests would participate in a continuing medical education program in gynecologic cytology. This educational approach will present participants with complex cases to keep their skills on the cutting edge and will provide individuals an opportunity to test their skills. 
   I believe this legislation would be an important step in the right direction and would modernize the current regulatory framework while providing quality assurance, as was required in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Unlike last Congress, I hope we will be able to get this legislation signed into law in order to modernize an outdated proficiency testing program for pathologists.

It is, indeed, the only Federal program dedicated to improving emergency care for children. Since its inception in 1984, death rates due to pediatric injury have dropped some 40 percent. 
   The program provides grants to States to improve existing medical emergency services systems, and to evaluate pediatric emergency care data to improve future treatment efforts. Many emergency centers do not have all of the necessary supplies to treat pediatric emergencies, despite the fact that 18 percent of emergency department patients are children. 
   The legislation also increases the authorization for this program by 5 percent annually for the next 5 years starting at $25 million in FY 2009. The bill also extends by 1 year the period that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services may award grants under the program. The bill had broad bipartisan support in the committee, and I would urge its passage.

   Madam Speaker, I rise to join my colleague in support of S. 793, the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2008. This legislation reauthorizes important grant programs, which assist States, territories, and the District of Columbia in establishing and expanding coordinated services of community-based services and support for those with traumatic brain injuries. 
   Traumatic brain injuries, TBI, can happen to anyone, and occur when someone experiences brain damage from externally inflicted trauma to the head. While these injuries can impact children, teenagers and adults, TBI has been described as the signature wound of the war in Iraq. 
   This legislation, first authorized in 1996, was reauthorized in 2000. With the large number of troops returning from the battlefield afflicted by this injury, it is important that we continue the activities authorized by this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I do rise in support of H.R. 2063, the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2008. 
   Many children face life-threatening food allergies which dramatically impact their lifestyles and make an ordinarily safe place like a school cafeteria a place filled with potential dangers. However, despite this threat and the growing prevalence of these food allergies, many schools struggle to establish effective guidelines to protect the health and well-being of students with food allergies. 
   I had the occasion this past year to visit with neighbors and constituents of mine whose children have these kind of allergies, one of the children having a very severe food allergy problem. It is truly remarkable the degree of care that children and parents must take and the life-changing events that occur as a result of these food allergies. 
   This legislation seeks to address this problem by requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to establish voluntary guidelines and policies to manage the risks of food allergy in a school setting. This policy will take into account the important role played by parents and the individual needs of students with differing allergies. Hopefully, this legislation will provide important Federal guidelines, which, when implemented, will provide peace of mind for parents of children with food allergies when they send their children to school every day. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to join my colleague in supporting H.R. 1198, the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2008. 
   This legislation reauthorizes the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program, which was first enacted in 2000 to help States develop newborn hearing screening and early intervention programs. This program has successfully improved newborn screening for hearing loss, which allows many children to benefit from early detection. This provides enhanced opportunities for language and communication skill development. 
   Unfortunately, children experiencing hearing loss who are not identified early can have delays in speech, language, and cognitive development. Through grant programs, this legislation helps ensure infants with hearing losses are identified and receive appropriate follow-up care. The bill also establishes a post-doctoral fellowship program to improve early hearing detection research. 
   This legislation moved through our committee in a bipartisan fashion, and I would urge its adoption. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DEAL of Georgia. (GENERAL LEAVE -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I'm beginning to think the writers' strike in Hollywood has migrated to Washington, DC. It sounds like we're having reruns, and, in fact, we are; same speeches. But the truth of the matter is the facts themselves have not changed. 
   The bill that is being considered for an override of the President's veto, the fact remains that if we are talking about 10 million children being covered by SCHIP, 2 million of those will be in a crowd-out, currently having private insurance but being then forced or given the enticement, because it is a government program, to move to a government-run health care program rather than the private insurance that they currently have. 
   The fact does not change that the bill does not have stable funding. While it dramatically increases the funding for the first 5 years, it then falls off a cliff, and the funding is cut by two-thirds. 
   The fact remains that this bill fails to prioritize poor children. It would repeal the current requirement from CMS that 95 percent of children below 200 percent of poverty be covered before you move up the poverty scale. It repeals that and gives no priority to poor children. 
   It does not cap the income eligibility. While some proponents say that it caps it at 300 percent of poverty, States could still enroll children and families above that, using what is known as ``income disregards.'' And instead of focusing on children, which it is a children's program, childless adults could continue to remain in the SCHIP program under this bill through September 30 of 2009. And parents who are adults could also stay on until September 30 of 2012 in what is supposed to be a children's insurance program. 
   It provides excess, unnecessary funding. It does not give States the incentive to do as they currently are required to do to continue to maintain their participation. 
   You know, Democrats contend that we should put more money into SCHIP because of leaner times. It would seem to me that in leaner times we should give the priority to the children in the poor families, and this bill does not do that. 
   Ronald Reagan is quoted as saying, in talking about welfare, ``We should measure welfare success by how many people leave welfare, not by how many are added.'' I would suggest the same criteria could be used in SCHIP legislation. 
   With that, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the veto override.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of S. 2499. This vital legislation will help preserve Medicare beneficiaries' access to their physicians' services, in addition to providing States certainty as to their ability to cover their SCHIP children for the next 13 months and to continue to enroll eligible children in their programs. 
   While this bill does not contain the needed reform of the sustainable growth rate formula in Medicare, it averts a payment cut for physicians which, I fear, would have dramatically impacted physician participation in Medicare. Moving forward, I hope that we would work in a bipartisan way to reform this SGR system rather than continuing these short fix programs that we have seen for the last several years. The physicians who serve this Nation's elderly population should not be subject to this annual uncertainty, constantly wondering whether or not they will be able to afford to see their Medicare patients. 
   On the second subject, for months I have supported a long-term extension of the SCHIP program to ensure that children currently enrolled would continue to have health care services, and to allow States the certainty of funding so that they can continue to enroll eligible children. 
   In the coming months there should be ample opportunity for SCHIP legislation to move through a regular legislative process without the pressures created by last-minute expiration of the program. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this bill, which would help put and continue to put low-income children first, and continues the purpose of the original program: To serve the neediest children with health care. As a supporter of the program, it is unfortunate to me that we have not been able to reauthorize it for a longer period of time, but this extension should give us the opportunity to do so in a thoughtful and appropriate process. I would hope to work on these issues in a bipartisan fashion next year, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Army Private First Class Johnathon Miles Millican, dedicating the United States Post Office located in Lula, Georgia, as the ``Private Johnathon Millican Lula Post Office.'' 
   Twenty-year-old Private First Class Johnathon Millican, a Hall County, Georgia, native, was killed by insurgents in Iraq while conducting a dismounted operation in Karbala on January 20, 2007. Private First Class Millican was off duty in a communications room talking with his wife when the attackers fired several rounds into the room with an AK-47 and one of them tossed in a concussion grenade. Courageously, he covered the grenade with his body, attempting to protect his comrades from the enemy intrusion. Private First Class Johnathon Millican was later awarded the Silver Star Medal of Honor for his courage, valor, and dedication for his fellow soldiers. 
   Johnathon Millican had attended Lula Elementary, East Hall Middle School, and East Hall High school in my home County of Hall. While in high school, Johnathon was active in the community, working the concessions stand at the community ballpark and coaching a 5-year-old T-Ball team. After graduating from high school in 2005, he moved to Locust Grove, Alabama, before enlisting in the Army. Johnathon was a member of the 377th Parachute Field Artillery Regiment from Fort Richardson, Alaska. Johnathon Millican left behind his wife, Shannon; his parents, Mitchell and Angie Millican; and Mary and Ronald Lykins and sisters, Amber'le, Ashley, and Amanda. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to rise today to pay tribute to this courageous young man and to join my constituents  of Lula, Georgia, in naming the ``Private Johnathon Millican Post Office.'' This honor will serve as a lasting reminder of the true recognition that is deserving of a fallen hometown hero who sacrificed his life to save the lives of his fellow soldiers. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a copy of the letter from Mr. Milton Turner, the Mayor of the City of Lula, requesting that this post office be named the ``Private Johnathon Millican Lula Post Office.''

<DOCNO>Mr. DEAL of Georgia. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, today we are dealing with a bill that supposedly is a fix of the previous legislation that has been vetoed. We are all entitled to our opinion, but we should rely on a body that gives us the facts, and that is the Congressional Budget Office. I would like to look at some of those facts. 
   First of all, there is supposed to have been a fix on the issue of illegal immigration. CBO still estimates that there will be $3.7 billion of increased Federal spending and complementary State spending that will total some $6.5 billion of additional spending because of this change as it relates to the immigration issue over the next 10 years, and an additional 100,000 adults will gain eligibility because of this section. 
   The questions that ought to be asked are the two questions that were put to the staff of the Social Security Administration, because if we are going to allow Social Security numbers to be used as identification, these ought to be the questions. They were said to the staff. And the question is: Would the name and Social Security number verification system in this bill verify that the person submitting the name and the Social Security number is who they say they are? 
   The answer: No. 
   Second question: Would the name and Social Security verification system in this bill prevent an illegal alien  from fraudulently using another person's valid name and matching Social Security number to obtain Medicaid and SCHIP benefits? 
   The answer: No. 
   The authors of this bill also claim there is a fix on the issue of adults in SCHIP. The fact that CBO still projects that up to 10 percent of the enrollees in SCHIP will be adults, not children, in the next 5 years, and money for poor children shouldn't, in my opinion, go to cover adults. 
   The fix on the issue of crowd-out. The CBO still estimates there will be some 2 million people who will lose their private health insurance coverage and become enrolled in a government-run program. 
   Then the fix relating to the enrollment of higher income children. CBO estimates there will only be some 800,000 who are currently eligible for SCHIP who will be enrolled in the next 5 years, but an additional 1.1 million people with incomes that are not currently eligible for SCHIP will be enrolled in the program. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DEAL of Georgia. (HEALTH CENTERS RENEWAL ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1343, the Health Centers Renewal Act. I have been a long time supporter of the community health centers program because health centers provide quality health care services to people and communities which might not otherwise have access to such care. 
   Last Congress, I sponsored a 5-year health centers reauthorization measure which passed the House by large margins. But unfortunately, we were unable to finalize the legislation and see it signed into law. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Green for his leadership on the legislation this year and for the willingness of our subcommittee chairman, Mr. Pallone, and our full committee chairman, Mr. Dingell, who worked in a bipartisan way to improve this reauthorization measure. 
   We made important reforms to the program to encourage the participation of volunteer physicians at health centers. It is my understanding that many physicians would be more willing to volunteer their time at a health center if they knew they would have liability protection from frivolous lawsuits. This bill provides that assurance through the Federal Tort Claims Act. 
   Through our work in the committee, we also addressed a situation which developed following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita where some health center employees were not able to carry their liability protection out of their home facility to go work on the gulf coast. We made a common-sense change to address this situation to ensure that health centers can meet their staffing needs during times of emergency. This amendment mirrored the legislation introduced by the late Representative Paul Gilmore, and I am glad that we can honor him by including this in this measure. 
   Community health centers are an important component of our health care safety net. While many communities across the country enjoy the benefits of having a health center, there are still many areas which could benefit from continued expansion of the program. 
   I would urge my colleagues to support this measure and give medically underserved communities across this country greater access to health care  providers at a local community health center. 
   Madam Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I believe the majority is ready to close, and I will close at this point if he has no other speakers. 
   I believe that the importance of community health centers has certainly been underscored in a bipartisan fashion by the discussion we've had here on this floor. I would remind us all that this is an initiative that President Bush inaugurated several years ago when his goal was to expand the number of community health centers across this country, ultimately so that every county in this country would be served from one of these facilities. Certainly all of us recognize it is one of the better ways that we have available to us to be able to provide needed health care to communities that are underserved at the current time. 
   Once again, in closing, I would commend Mr. Green for his willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion on this reauthorization legislation. I believe that the amendments that were added to it before its reaching the floor today have considerably improved this bill. In particular, it now will allow physicians who are either retired or who want to volunteer a portion of their time to assist in one of these community health centers the ability to do so with some degree of limited liability protection. I think that will increase the number of physicians who are available in these facilities, and by doing that, it will increase the quality of care to those who are receiving services in community health centers. 
   With that, I would encourage passage of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DEAL of Georgia. (JOHN BURL HULSEY, SR. -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary American and a native of my congressional district, John Burl Hulsey, Sr., who was instrumental as a Navy pilot during World War II in the development of our Nation's first cruise missile. 
   While all of his friends are certainly aware of his service in the Navy, very few know that Lieutenant Commander Hulsey was one of the 48 Navy pilots hand-selected for this top secret mission. In fact, this project was so top secret that Lieutenant Commander Hulsey was prohibited from even discussing it with his wife, Mary Louise, until it was officially declassified in 1989. 
   During World War II, the United States Navy established two special squadrons which developed the Standoff Guided Missile Forces, an experimental program designed to direct unmanned drone aircraft loaded with explosives into enemy targets. Remote-controlled drones, pilotless planes with a video camera mounted on their noses, were loaded with 2,000 pound bombs and directed to their targets by a trailing aircraft located several miles from the site of impact. Using radar guidance and wireless video transmission, this technology was state-of-the-art, futuristic technology in the early 1940s. For the first time in history, naval aviators were able to accurately strike high-profile, heavily defended installations while remaining out of danger. 
   Also termed the American Kamikaze, this mission set forth a powerful blow to the enemy, using tactics never before seen in modern warfare, undoubtedly changing the scope and the outcome of World War II as well as various conflicts which have followed. 
   In 1938, Lieutenant Commander Hulsey enrolled at North Georgia College, then a 2-year institution, prior to transferring to the University of Georgia in Athens for completion of his studies. While at the University of Georgia, Lieutenant Commander Hulsey participated in the university's civilian pilot training program, where he began preparing for a career in aviation. Immediately prior to entering his senior year at the University of Georgia, Lieutenant Commander Hulsey decided to enlist in the Navy, and was ordered to report for service shortly thereafter. 
   In addition to being stationed for training at naval air stations in Chamblee, Georgia, Pensacola, Florida, and New Orleans, he and other members of what were called STAG I spent several years in Clinton, Oklahoma and Traverse City, Michigan, where they conducted extensive testing and development of the drone project prior to deployment to the Pacific theater. 
   Finally, in May 1944, Lieutenant Commander Hulsey and many of his fellow STAG I pilots departed for the Russell Islands in the Solomon Island Chain, about 25 miles from Guadalcanal, where the Navy prepared to carry out a critical series of attacks on enemy strongholds across the region. Anti-aircraft fire was heavy at times around his plane and the drones which he followed, but he was, fortunately, never struck. 
   On September 27, 1944, the very first TDR-1 assault drone attack in combat was successfully carried out, marking an historic moment in the development and implementation of cruise missiles in warfare. 
   Of the 47 total attacks carried out by STAG I during their brief mission in the Pacific, an unprecedented 22 targets resulted in direct hits, including island caves loaded with enemy ammunition and anti-aircraft installations in the Shortland Islands, Bougainville, and Rabaul. These attacks sustained a record 47 percent hit on intended targets, an incredible accomplishment in 1940's technology. The short mission ended as the war came to a close and U.S. forces began to extinguish their supplies of drones. 
   In a July of 1990 letter sent to members of STAG I and the Special Air Task Force, then Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett commended the brave men and women for their service to our Nation, honoring, and I quote, ``the vision, determination, and dedication with which they performed their secret duties during World War II, which laid the groundwork for today's modern cruise missile.'' 
   There is no question, Mr. Speaker, that the accomplishments of the men of STAG I laid the groundwork for the development of modern-day smart bombs, which has revolutionized American military strategy as well as that of our allies across the globe. Countless lives have been saved through this technology, and our ability to target enemy installations with precision has proven itself critical in defending our country from ever present threats. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am truly pleased to rise today in honor of Lieutenant Commander John Burl Hulsey, Sr. I would also like to thank him, his wife, Mary Louise, and members of his family who have joined me in the House gallery this evening to receive this special recognition. His service, while having occurred over 6 decades ago, continues to save the lives of those in the front lines of the war on terror. I thank Lieutenant Commander Hulsey, and will always share a deep respect for this hero's courage, valor, and dedication and service in the United States Navy. And I conclude by congratulating him on his 90th birthday.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   All of us would like to see an extension of the SCHIP program, and I think there are some very basic principles on which all of us should agree, principles that should be embodied in a bipartisan piece of legislation. I would suggest there are five. 
   First of all, we should put the poorest children at the front of the line. That means we should require States actually to enroll 90 percent of their SCHIP and Medicaid-eligible children under 200 percent of the poverty line before they start enrolling children at higher income levels. 
   Two, no families with incomes above 250 percent of the Federal poverty level should be eligible for Federal SCHIP funds. States that want to go above that should feel free to do so with their own funds; but hardworking, tax-paying families in the Midwest and the Southeast shouldn't be forced to subsidize the health care for children and families in the richer States who are making over $82,000 per year. 
   Third, no Federal SCHIP funds for adults other than pregnant women beginning in 2009. We should give the States a year to transition their low-income adults to Medicaid, which is where they belong, and stop taking away limited resources from needy children and giving them to childless adults. 
   Fourth, keep the existing Federal requirement that States actually document the citizenship and identity of all of the applicants for Medicaid and clearly state in the bill that illegal immigrants are prohibited from receiving Medicaid or SCHIP benefits. Being able to write down a Social Security number doesn't actually prove you're a United States citizen. Federal benefits should not go to illegal immigrants. 
   Fifth, no millionaires in SCHIP. We should simply put a $1 million net asset cap on eligibility for Federal SCHIP funds. If you have over $1 million in net assets, you should be able to afford to pay for your children's health insurance.

<DOCNO>Mr. DEAL of Georgia. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which spent hundreds of hours passing and dealing with hearings relating to this prescription drug benefit under Medicare part D, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4. I think it is hastily considered legislation that has been brought without the opportunity to evaluate several important ingredients, one being its impact on our local community pharmacists and their ability to provide access to citizens in our community. 
   One aspect of the current prohibition against the government negotiating is that it also prohibits the government from negotiating pharmacist fees. This reimbursement that they receive often comes in the form of dispensing fees which they use to help pay for their services in filling the prescriptions, of course. And I believe they are vital to the operation of local pharmacies because they help cover all of their costs associated with performing their duties.  
   Yet, this legislation provides no protection for the nearly 2,000 pharmacies in my State, or over 50,000 across the country. 
   The independent actuaries at CMS have already indicated that the Secretary will have limited ability to negotiate drug prices without the authority to establish formularies, an authority which is explicitly prohibited in this bill. Therefore, as the government seeks to fulfill the mandate of H.R. 4, to negotiate lower prices on drugs, I believe they will be forced to save in other areas, specifically cutting dispensing fees to pharmacists. 
   Without guaranteed dispensing fees for the pharmacists, many local pharmacists are going to have to leave the Medicare drug program, or the government's negotiations may lead to seniors being forced to fill some of their prescriptions by mail order and being unable to use their local pharmacist. At the least, these pharmacists will feel an unnecessary squeeze from this Democratic meddling into a successful program that has saved seniors millions of dollars and with which most of them are overwhelmingly happy. 
   I recognize that there are certain pharmacy groups that have supported this measure, but I believe that their letters of support do not address the real basic concern, and that is, the fact that dispensing fees may be the part that is in jeopardy. 
   For example, if the government has negotiated a set price for all programs, how is program A going to differentiate itself in premium from the program of company B? 
   I believe that it is going to squeeze the dispensing fee, and the pharmacist is the only one left in the middle to be squeezed. I would say, for the sake of our seniors and their access to their local pharmacists and for those pharmacists who want to stay in business and be a part of this program, I would urge support of the Republican motion to recommit which takes steps to protect the local pharmacist and receive a fair dispensing fee.

<DOCNO>Mr. DEAL of Georgia. (FIRST LIEUTENANT NOAH HARRIS ELLIJAY POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DEAL of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Duncan for yielding the time to me. And I thank Mr. Towns for the very kind words that he has spoken on behalf of this outstanding young man. 
   And I do rise today to honor the memory of First Lieutenant Noah Harris by dedicating the United States Post Office located in Ellijay, Georgia, and naming it the ``First Lieutenant Noah Harris Ellijay Post Office.'' 
   As Mr. Towns has indicated, Lieutenant Harris was killed at the age of 23, serving in Buritz, Iraq, and was returning from a successful mission when his Humvee was hit by two rocket-propelled grenades. 
   Many times we talk about individuals that we don't know. Tonight, I talk about a young man I did know. Noah Harris served as an intern in my office in the summer of 2002. He was a star athlete at Gilmer County High School, captain of his football team, captain of the wrestling team, State wrestling champion, and a star scholar. 
   When he graduated from high school, he went to the University of Georgia and he joined the football cheerleading squad. Now, at first you would think, as did his captain in Iraq, that if you're a cheerleader, you're not physically fit. Of course, if you watched college cheerleaders, you know when they lift somebody over their head and hold them, they are physically fit, as was Noah. And he became the captain of that cheerleading squad. 
   He was a student at the University of Georgia on September 11 of 2001. And when our country was attacked on that day, he made the decision that he wanted to join the ROTC unit and become an Army officer. The story goes that he went over to the ROTC Department and he said, I'd like to join the ROTC. And he was asked, well, what class level are you in? And he said, I'm a senior. And the response was, Well, you've just waited too late. You can't join the ROTC in your senior year. And he said, Is there no way that that can happen? And they said, Well, you would have to be an outstanding scholar and you would have to be an outstanding athlete in order to be able to put all the things together here in your senior year. It's told that Noah Harris sort of smiled and said, Well, I am a Presidential scholar, attending the University of Georgia on a Presidential scholar scholarship. And I am the captain of the football cheerleading squad. And needless to say, he met all of those requirements, he was commissioned, and he served our country in Iraq.     
   While he was serving in Iraq, he e-mailed me and he said this, ``Each day I patrol the street and stop and talk to the people. They are thankful that we're here and for what we are doing. Though the process is slow, each day, the Iraqi police and the Iraqi army are becoming better able to protect and defend the citizens of Iraq. Through the efforts and perseverance of both the United States and Iraq, peace will prevail. Please pass on my thanks to your staff and the rest of the individuals in Washington that support the cause of freedom for our Nation and the world.'' 
   I attended Noah Harris' funeral, one of the saddest and yet at the same time one of the greatest celebrations that I have ever attended. His life is a reminder that it really doesn't matter how long you live, it's how you live. Noah Harris is a role model for young people who follow behind him. He is an inspiration for all of us who knew him and for those who will learn about him as the story of his life has now been compiled in a book put together by his parents, Lucy and Rick Harris, and contains the remembrances of people who knew Noah Harris. He will also have a continuing legacy of hope, dedication and courage. A scholarship has been founded at the University of Georgia in his memory, and it will continue his tradition. 
   Madam Speaker, First Lieutenant Noah Harris was indeed a true American hero. I am proud today to rise and pay attribute to him and to have the honor of joining with the constituents from the community in which he grew up in naming the local post office the First Lieutenant Noah Harris Ellijay Post Office. 
   Madam Speaker, I include for the Record a copy of a letter from Mr. Jerry Farist, the chairman of the Gilmer County Board of Commissioners, supporting that this post office be named in honor of First Lieutenant Noah Harris. 
   I appreciate the time, and I think indeed these are the kind of moments that symbolize what makes our country great.
