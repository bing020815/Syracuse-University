<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (RELATING TO THE HOUSE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN SECTION 803 OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I have some prepared remarks, but I want to address a couple of things that have been said, because I think it's important for the House to understand. 
   Number one, the gentleman from Florida said that we have already solved this problem, and he is right in one sense. There was enough of a pay-for in the last Medicare bill that we passed, that had we couched it properly, we could have used as a pay-for to get us within the window required by MMA, but we didn't do that. We didn't go through the proper procedure. So to suggest that we now can just do away with the rule because in some other bill we created enough funding that would have worked had we followed the proper procedure, I think, is a very tenuous argument. 
   The whole purpose of the provision, and the second thing I want to address, is this notion that this was slipped in in the dead of night, and it was just totally a Republican effort to somehow kill Medicare. I would say to the House that this suggestion was first made by the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare that was chaired by Bill Thomas and John Breaux, a Republican and a Democrat. 
   So we didn't come up with this in the dead of night. It is something that had been circulating, and I thought it was a good idea then, I think it's a good idea now. It's regrettable that the House stands ready today to dispose of this very worthwhile rule. 
   All the rule was intended to do, it wasn't intended to kill Medicare. What it was intended to do is force us to face the problem every year, because we all know, those of us who are familiar with the program, familiar with the structure of the program and the financing of the program, know that more than 45 percent of general revenues are going to be used to pay the costs of this program very soon. Then it will be every year, and it will grow. 
   In fact, if we allow this program to go on autopilot, it will grow from about 2.7 percent of GDP this year to over 14 percent of GDP by the end of the 75-year CBO window, over 14 percent. We only take in in revenues, total revenues, between 18 and 19 percent of GDP. So if we allow this program to just go like it is now without discussion or debate or reform, we are going to have to do away with most spending for defense, education, roads, highways, unless, of course, we have a dramatic increase in taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to tell this House that the product would be irresponsible.  
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this irresponsible change in the rules of the House. 
   The resolution before us today would prevent the House from having to hold any debate about the looming financial crisis facing the Medicare program. Apparently, the Democrats don't want to talk about reforming a program that is slated to go bankrupt in 2019. 
   This rules change isn't about a specific proposal to change Medicare. What it would do is repeal a bipartisan provision that would force Congress to at least take note of Medicare's increasingly unsustainable financial situation and begin to consider solutions. 
   But instead of having an open discussion about how to address the out-of-control costs of this program, today's resolution allows the Congress to bury its head in the sand and kick the can down the road, letting a future Congress deal with this ever worsening problem. This is irresponsible. 
   The facts are clear. Medicare is facing bankruptcy. The combination of rising health care costs and an aging population have created a financial hurricane on the not-too-distant horizon. 
   Last year, Medicare spending totaled about 2.7 percent of our GDP. That figure will more than double by 2030 and hit 14.8 percent by the end of the CBO's 75-year budget window. Since total federal revenues, historically, have been between 18-19 percent, it is clear we cannot let Medicare spending increase on auto-pilot unless we are willing to substantially raise taxes or cut all other government spending. 
   The need for structural reform of Medicare is not just Republican rhetoric. In recent testimony before the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, the non-partisan Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC), which was created by Congress to advise us on Medicare payment issues, said that, ``The [Medicare] program's shaky financial outlook is a strong impetus for change.'' 
   Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim that this 45 percent trigger was created by Republicans as a way to privatize or block grant the Medicare program. Let me remind them that this policy was first suggested by a bipartisan Medicare task force that was chaired by Democratic Senator John Breaux. 
   And let me also point out that there are many ways that we could solve this problem. But ducking it is surely not on that list. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this rule change. This problem will not go away just because we ignore it. The longer we wait to address it, the more difficult the solution will be.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, we're here this afternoon to discuss a matter that the President, the Treasury Department, former officials of the Clinton administration, all agree is extremely important for the economic health of the country. 
   When we speak of the economic health, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about not only the rate of GDP growth,  not only the health of the financial markets, we're talking about the impact on real people of a decline in the country's economic health; that means job losses, that means financial hardship for individuals and families. So the leadership, Mr. Speaker, of the House, Democratic and Republican, have worked hand in hand with the White House, the Treasury Department, to craft a package that we can call an economic growth package, an economic stimulus package. It doesn't matter to me what we call it. 
   But it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that the weight of the evidence, if we listen to the opinions of respected economists, respected former officials of the Treasury Department, current members of the Treasury Department, the weight of the evidence indicates to me, at least, that the downside of this Congress doing nothing right now is much greater than any downside of our doing something around the level that is being proposed by the leadership in this House and the White House in this package that we're considering this afternoon. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I am eagerly awaiting passage of this. I hope that the other body follows suit in an expeditious manner, and that we can get this package to the White House for the President's signature. And we hope that this will have the intended effect, which is to avert a recession, and to reduce the downturn that everybody agrees is underway right now. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 2419, FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise to educate the House on a provision that was in the Senate version of the farm bill, and according to reports as being considered for inclusion in the conference report. I say ``reluctantly,'' Mr. Speaker, because my good friend, Mr. Baucus, is the sponsor of this provision in the Senate bill, and I certainly respect the right of any Member to try to bring Federal dollars to his district. But that is exactly what this is. And it ought to be exposed for that. It is not a tax provision really. It is a really more like an appropriation. 
   And my good friend on the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Pomeroy, said that, well, this is not really just for one entity, there will be lots of bondholders, so this money will be spread out among numerous bondholders. That's true. It will be. But that evades the point. The point is that the way the provision is written in the Senate bill would limit the application of these bonds to one specific piece of property in the United States. 
   Now I will read to you the criteria that lead us to that conclusion. First, ``some portion of the land must be adjacent to United States Forest Service land.'' Well there's lots of parcels of land like that around the United States. 
   But second, ``at least half of the land acquired must be transferred to the United States Forest Service at no net cost to the United States and not more than half of the land acquired may either remain with or be donated to a State.'' Again that's fine. Nothing wrong with that. 
   Third, and this is where it begins to tighten, ``the amount of acreage acquired must be at least 40,000 acres,'' a fairly large parcel. And then fourth, ``all of the land must be subject to a native fish habitat conservation plan approved by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.'' 
   So upon examination of all the parcels of land in the United States, only one meets this criteria. And it happens to be a large piece of land of which about 90 percent of it is in the State of Montana. And it is owned by one landowner in the State of Montana. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, even though, yes, there will be scores, hundreds, thousands maybe of bondholders, they're not going to be the ones getting $500 million for a piece of property. It is one landowner. And the taxpayers will be footing about $200 million of the bill. 
   Now that is like an appropriation. That is a $200 million appropriation basically to the Nature Conservancy which will buy the land and give the money to the current landowner. So let's call it what it is. It's an earmark. It's an appropriation disguised very cleverly as a forest tax credit bond. 
   Now, this provision could have been written to apply to any property in the United States so that anybody who wanted to set aside land could utilize these bonds. But it wasn't. It was restricted to this one piece of property. It's a rifle shot. It's an earmark. 
   And Mr. Cantor's intention, I believe, is to educate the House of this and to say, and I agree with him, that this has no place in the farm bill. It ought to be in an appropriations bill. It ought to be clearly defined as an earmark for the purchase of this piece of property. 
   Now I don't know if $500 million is an appropriate amount of money for this piece of property. I don't know what Nature Conservancy might have offered for this piece of property. But my guess is that when you have a $200 million subsidy from the taxpayers, it just might distort the market. It just might raise the value of land in that particular parcel and all around that parcel. 
   So I believe, Mr. Speaker, that the gentleman's motion to instruct conferees is well placed. This ought not be in the farm bill. And frankly this farm tax credit idea ought not be used to distort the market for real estate anywhere in the country, and certainly not on a piece of property this big in one location.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is the third time this year that I have stood before this body to debate a tax bill dealing with energy. Like the debates before, the bill before us today has more to do with politics than policy. It is indeed Orwellian logic to say that gas prices are too high; therefore, we ought to raise taxes on the oil and gas industry. Hmm. 
   The majority claims that American manufacturing jobs are important, but it is pursuing tax policies that will drive good-paying jobs in the oil and gas industry overseas. 
   The majority claims to be adhering to PAYGO; yet by clever sleight of hand, they have included an additional $900 million in tax relief for New York that falls just outside the budget window, thereby evading PAYGO. 
   And the majority, despite its stated concerns about tax earmarks, seems to have a massive one in here of a $500 million tax credit bond program that appears to benefit one single landowner. A rifle shot. 
   The bill, as has been discussed in the past, creates tax credit bonds that State and local governments can use with little accountability and without any assurances that funded projects will reduce fossil fuel consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. 
   On top of that, those tax credit bonds would be tradable, setting up a market for tax credits very similar to something that Congress tried back in 1981 and repealed the very next year because of the outcry of the public. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't expect this bill to make it through the process. I don't think it will get through the Senate. If it were to, the President would most certainly veto this bill, but maybe then we can go back to the drawing board on a bipartisan basis to craft an energy bill that actually produces energy and reduces costs and protects American jobs. Until then, I urge my colleagues to defeat what is an ill-conceived bill. We have wasted more energy today debating it than its passage would possibly create. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Barton be allowed to resume allocation of time for the minority.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the debate this evening should not be about who is for insurance for children and who is against health insurance for children. The fact is that all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, want SCHIP to be reauthorized. We will vote tomorrow, I believe, for a temporary extension of the program, and I predict that there will be a huge bipartisan vote in favor of extending the program to give this House more time to develop a true bipartisan reauthorization, long-term reauthorization of the SCHIP program. 
   I do expect, Mr. Speaker, this bill to pass tonight, but I also expect the President to veto this bill, and I expect his veto to be sustained by this House. At that point, I'm very hopeful that, for the first time in this process, the minority in this House will be included in discussions about how we should reauthorize the SCHIP program, because to this point, frankly, we have not been included at all. We have not been asked for our recommendations for a reauthorization; we were not even given a substitute when this matter came to the floor originally here in the House of Representatives. 
   So perhaps after the President vetoes and we sustain the veto, then maybe we will be brought into the room and we will have a chance to discuss with the majority what we think is the appropriate level of reauthorization for funding for this program and perhaps some of our ideas with respect to limiting those eligible for this program to the universe of people who were originally intended to be helped by the program, that is, low-income children whose family incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to buy a policy in the individual market outside of the workplace. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this evening I suggest that, rather than point fingers and say you're against kids and we're for kids, you're for tobacco, we're against tobacco, that we get through this debate and then get through the next step of the process, which I hope will be more bipartisan and more cooperative, to allow us to get a real reauthorization that we can all support as we did in the mid-1990s when we created this program.  
   Now, we only got this bill, this so-called compromise, last night, so we've been diligently going through it all night and all day today. We're not sure of everything that's in this bill, but I can enumerate a number of things that we believe to be facts and I think are important in this debate for this particular bill. 
   First of all is the matter of funding. This bill is not even close to being fully funded. Budget gimmicks are replete. The proposal assumes that funding will drop to about one-fourth of the funding in the year 2013, and then another $5 million cut after that. We all know that's not going to happen. But that was done, and I understand, just to make the budget numbers work; but Members ought to know what they're voting for. 
   Another thing that we're told by the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan arm of the House and the Senate, is that under this proposal 2 million children will move from private health insurance to government health insurance. Now, surely that's not what we want. We don't want the SCHIP program, do we, to move children from private insurance into government insurance? That wasn't the intent of this program when it started. 
   And on the tax side, on the pay-for side, this bill proposes that we pay for a program with clearly growing requirements, growing needs with a funding source that is going to be declining, depleting, the tobacco tax. As you raise the tax on tobacco, you exacerbate the trend that has been evident in this country for a number of years of declining use of tobacco. 
   So to propose funding a growing program with a declining revenue source is, I would submit, irresponsible fiscal policy. 
   I have a few other speakers who are going to talk about some of the other weaknesses in this legislation. 
   At this time, I would reserve the balance of my time.

   This bill provides a government healthcare program for that. We would much rather provide a private health insurance plan for that. I would submit that there is a vast difference in those approaches. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), a member of the Ways and Means Committee and ranking member of the Social Security Subcommittee.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I believe all of the controllers of time are ready to close. 
   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman that spoke right before me, the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said that this bill provides $35 billion for children. This bill actually provides a lot more than that. It's $35 billion in new, additional spending on top of the $25 billion that the program as currently structured spends. So we're more than doubling on paper the cost of this program. And when you consider that there's another, oh, approximately $30 billion that the tax increase in this bill does not cover, we're getting up to tripling, quadrupling the size of this program. 
   Now, the gentleman earlier said that no abuses such as illegal immigrants gaining benefits have ever been identified. Well, I would refer the gentleman to the 2005 HHS Inspector General report in which the Inspector General says that 47 States allowed self-declaration in the United States citizenship for Medicaid and he asked for those States to give him an audit. 
   Only one State did that, the State of Oregon. The Secretary of State provided an audit, and in that audit he found out of 812 individuals sampled, who were Medicaid beneficiaries in that State, 25 of them were noneligible noncitizens. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, under the provisions in this bill, which liberalize the current law treatment of qualification of individuals for this program, we indeed expect to see abuses of this. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of us to vote ``no'' on this so that we can sustain the President's veto if the bill passes and then get together for a true bipartisan compromise on this important program.

   Mr. MCCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3375, a bill to extend the Trade Adjust Assistance or TAA program for 3 months beyond its expiration on September 30th. 
   I want to acknowledge Mr. Herger, ranking member of the trade subcommittee, for anticipating the need for this extension to ensure there is sufficient time to carefully consider reforms to TAA as well as to our programs to help workers if they lose jobs for reasons other than trade. I also want to thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Levin for their support of this bill. 
   I look forward to seeing the two Chairmen's TAA reform proposal. My colleagues and I have been working on our own proposal too. I hope we can craft a bipartisan, cost-effective approach that helps get all dislocated workers--not just the few who lose their jobs due to trade--retrained and back to work sooner. It is our responsibility to make sure that all Americans have the opportunity to quickly obtain the skills they need to adapt to globalization. 
   Today, our Committee held a non-markup of the U.S.-Peru FTA and approved, by voice vote, the draft implementing legislation to it. I commend Chairman Rangel for his commitment to quickly move this FTA to passage. At the same time, we must implement the pending FTAs with Panama, Colombia, and Korea to enable our workers and their employers to benefit from the new opportunities created by these FTAs.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation before us. Besides increasing taxes, this bill would create an untargeted emergency extended unemployment benefits program that would add to the deficit and ultimately increase State payroll taxes. 
   Moreover, this provision is untargeted, meaning it would pay extended unemployment benefits in all States, regardless of the availability of jobs in those States. Today's national unemployment rate is 5.0 percent. In March, 32 States had unemployment rates below 5 percent. Congress has never created a temporary extended benefits program at such a low unemployment rate. The lowest prior unemployment rate when such a program was created was 5.7 percent. Especially given today's low unemployment rate nationwide, it just doesn't make sense to extend benefits in States where jobs are readily available. 
   While I do not support the legislation before us on this subject, Republicans know that laid off workers are hurting, especially in States with struggling economies where jobs are hard to find and unemployment rates are high. That is why, during committee consideration of this legislation, I supported targeting extended unemployment benefits so real help would be provided where it is needed most. Unfortunately, that effort was rebuffed in favor of the general untargeted proposal before us today. 
   This legislation also shows the sham that is PAYGO. The broad extended unemployment program is projected to cost $16 billion over the next 5 years and increase State payroll taxes by $1 billion over that time. And this is likely just the start. The typical temporary program in recent decades lasted about 30 months. If the program started under the legislation before us today follows that path, the ultimate cost will exceed $30 billion.

   Yet despite pledges in this House to adhere to the letter and spirit of PAYGO, this bill does neither. Our colleagues' argument is that today's economic conditions constitute an emergency. Only 20 percent of all months since 1970 had a lower unemployment rate than today. So if we're in an emergency now, when won't we be in an emergency? We may as well just have extended unemployment benefits 100 percent Federally paid for forever and ever. It doesn't make sense, and it's very costly.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lewis for yielding me this time. 
   In my almost 19 years in the United States House of Representatives, I have cast many difficult votes. And I have often spoken to groups of constituents over the years, and in the course of their asking me questions, inevitably one of the questions will be, What is the most difficult vote you have taken as a Member of the House? 
   And I am always quick to respond, even though there have been many difficult votes, clearly the most difficult vote I have had to make as a Member of the House is to vote to send our troops into war. 
   And certainly the vote that this House made to authorize the President to send our troops to Iraq this most recent time was a very difficult vote for all of us. Some of us, it seems, have changed our minds and wish we hadn't cast that vote. But the fact is we did cast that vote. We voted in the majority to start this war. 
   I believe, based on my reading of history, my studies of past engagements, military engagements, it would be a tremendous mistake for the Congress of the United States to attempt to micromanage this war and bring it to a conclusion through artificially constraining decisions on the battlefield. 
   I have spoken face to face with the President of the United States about this war. I know he is trying his best to bring this war to a conclusion. He is trying his best to make sure that the interests of the United States, as well as the interests of the people of Iraq, are served as he plans strategy and works with our military leaders to plot the best course for ending this war and preserving and serving the interests of the United States. 
   He has a new strategy in play. It seems to be working. We are getting favorable reports from the commanders in the field. 
   Let us give this Commander in Chief and his military leaders a chance to serve this country, to serve Iraq, and end this in the best possible way for the United States. Let us not try to micromanage from the Congress, with 435 in the House and 100 in the Senate, telling our leaders how to conduct this war and when to end it. That is the wrong course of action for this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, the portion of this bill under my committee's jurisdiction, the Ways and Means Committee, is somewhat complex; but the effect it would have is simple. These provisions raise taxes on our domestic energy industry. We should not mince words or use semantics; that is what those provisions do. They raise taxes on our home-grown domestic energy industry. 
   The result of that will be higher prices for gasoline, home heating oil, fewer manufacturing jobs and even more dependence on foreign oil. This legislation is in these respects the exact opposite of the energy policy that the United States needs. Anyone who is serious about energy security should oppose this bill. 
   There are two tax provisions in the legislation. The first deals with geological and geophysical expenses. These costs, referred to as G&G expenses, are amortized over several years, just like other business expenses. The Democrats' bill would increase the amortization period for costs associated with efforts to find new domestic oil and gas from 5 years to 7 years for the largest American oil companies. That would raise their taxes by about $100 million over 11 years. 
   But the far larger tax increase is a second provision, and this one is the one that is most unfair. It would eliminate the oil and gas industry, and only the oil and gas industry, from eligibility for the manufacturers' tax incentives, section 199 of the jobs bill. It increases taxes not just on Big Oil but on all oil and gas companies, big and small, that pay corporate taxes. That change will raise the industry's taxes by $7.6 billion over 11 years. This provision would not repeal any special tax break for Big Oil. It won't repeal any subsidy for Big Oil. Instead, it would single out oil and gas businesses for higher taxes than all other manufacturing businesses in the United States. 
   Worse, it would not place any additional cost on foreign producers of oil and gas. In effect, the legislation would give a new competitive advantage to foreign oil producers and refiners. Why should Congress vote to help Hugo Chavez's regime in Venezuela at the expense of our own domestic energy industry? 
   The heart of the Democrats' argument seems to be that somehow energy is not an American manufacturing industry. That conclusion is absurd. The United States energy industry employs 1.8 million Americans. These are precisely the sort of high-paying manufacturing jobs that Democrats constantly complain America is losing. The average pay for those workers is $19.34 an hour for workers for oil and gas extraction, $28.41 an hour for refinery workers, and of course they get good benefits in addition to that. 
   The new Speaker of the House has said, ``Manufacturing jobs are the engines that run the economy. These are  good jobs that give working families high standards of living.'' And I agree with her. 
   The new majority leader has said, ``Jobs still will be the number one issue next fall, and manufacturing job loss overseas is a subset of that. We're hearing that giant sucking sound that Perot warned about.'' 
   Well, given that prominent Democrats claim to be concerned about the loss of American manufacturing jobs, why are they now leading an effort to drive these jobs overseas? 
   We should also remember that these jobs are concentrated in the area of the country that was hardest hit by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. I know in my State of Louisiana, good-paying energy industry jobs are a key to our recovery. 
   In addition, as we saw in the wake of those storms, our domestic refining is already strained to full capacity. The sticker shock many of us faced at the pump after the hurricanes hit was not as a result of a shortage of crude oil, but a shortage of refined gasoline. There are now plans to substantially boost our refining capacity to avoid a repeat of that situation. But repealing section 199 for American oil and gas companies could change that and leave the United States economy even more vulnerable. 
   We should also remember during this debate that oil companies are not some sort of evil rapacious organization. Indeed, higher taxes on oil companies affect nearly every American with a retirement or pension account because those accounts now hold about 41 percent of the shares in American oil and gas companies. 
   Both of these new taxes would discourage new exploration for domestic energy resources and weaken our domestic energy industry, and the tax increases will be passed along to consumers. In addition, the effects will ripple throughout our economy, increasing the cost of nearly everything Americans buy and nearly every service they hire. 
   Increasing the cost of producing oil and gas in America, which this Democratic bill would do, will raise gasoline prices, ship manufacturing jobs overseas, and make America more dependent on foreign oil. 
   This bill certainly does not constitute a balanced energy policy for this country. What it does constitute is a purely political exercise that should be rejected by this House.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, the substance of this motion to recommit is basically to say, look, these matters are complex. My good friend on the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. McDermott, said that himself just a few minutes ago. And because of that complexity and because of the complexity of the issues, not only the tax issues in this legislation but the energy issues as well, this bill deserves regular order. It deserves to go through the relevant committees with full hearings, full ability of both the majority and the minority to offer amendments in committee, and then have some sort of rule on the floor which allows for different opinions to be voted on as either amendments or substitutes as the process goes forward. 
   As we all know by now, in this 100-hour exercise, which I think still has plenty of time left in it, frankly, we could even go back now and within the 100 hours have committee hearings and dispense with this bill in the regular order, and that is what this motion to recommit will do. 
   It simply says this is not a rejection of the bill, it is not a rejection of the substance of the bill, it is merely saying let's take this important piece of legislation through regular order, let's allow Members of this House the full rights of Members to talk about a bill, hear expert witnesses, delve into the particulars of the legislation, offer amendments, try to make it better, and then, finally, bring it to the floor for a vote. 
   The way that this bill has been rushed through, without regular process, without opportunity for amendment, or even a substitute, makes a mockery of the legislative process and certainly, I think, shortchanges the important subjects covered in this legislation. 
   I have talked about the tax consequences of the provisions in the bill which increase taxes on only one sector of American manufacturing, oil and gas. Again, it is not taking back a subsidy to oil and gas, it is not taking back a special tax break for oil and gas, it is singling out oil and gas for harsher treatment under the Tax Code than any other economic sector in this country. That is punishing oil and gas. That is punitive. 
   And that is not what this Congress should be engaged in, in my view. We should try to give a level playing field to all sectors of the American economy, give them all the same opportunities to succeed, to return value to its shareholders, to all those millions of pensioners that have pieces of shares of stock in these American oil and gas companies. They shouldn't be punished by this Congress. 
   We should be striking a balance between the need for, as my good friend from Washington says, new alternative and renewable sources of energy for the future, but also recognize the immediate needs of this country and for the foreseeable future, the 20 or 30 years the experts say we are going to be reliant on fossil fuels. So we ought to have a balanced approach. We ought to encourage, not discourage exploration and development of fossil fuels in this country, and also encourage research and development of new renewable sources of energy. 
   Unfortunately, the process that we have gone through on this bill didn't give us the opportunity to do that. This motion to recommit would give us that opportunity, and I urge its passage.

   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I ask to be heard on the point of order. 
   This bill should require a three-fifths majority for passage. Madam Speaker, it is important to point out that section 199(d)(6), the subject in this bill, incorporates by reference section 55 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 55 is specifically identified as a provision subject to the point of order found in clause 5(b) of House rule XXI. By amending section 199, the bill is increasing the applicable rate under section 55 as applied to oil and gas manufacturers. 
   Recognizing the connection between section 199 and section 55 is critical to the interpretation of House rule XXI. All of the sections identified in House rule XXI deal with the imposition of taxes, and those sections, in turn, are referenced throughout the Internal Revenue Code. 
   For example, Internal Revenue Code section 2(a)(1) defines the term ``surviving spouse'' for purposes of section 1 as a person whose spouse died up to 2 years before the current tax year. Amending section 2 of the Code to change the definition of a spouse to someone who died only 1 year ago would have the direct effect of increasing the tax rate on widows that is set by section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
   By way of further example, one computation method for farm income is found in section 1301 of the Internal Revenue Code. That section of the Code also explicitly references section 1. By changing the methods for computing farm income in section 1301, you can directly raise the tax rate of a farmer that is set by section 1. 
   Madam Speaker, here comes the denouement. Madam Speaker, certainly the intent of rule XXI is for the House to clear a higher hurdle, a three-fifths majority, before it increases taxes on farmers or widows. That intent would be just as relevant in this case where a bill effectively raises the tax rate on some American manufacturers.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I first want to endorse the remarks of my colleague, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel. 
   Indeed, had it not been for his efforts and Chairman Levin's efforts, we would not be here on the floor about to pass the Peru Free Trade Agreement. There is no reason why this country should not have a bipartisan trade policy that is endorsed by both the executive branch and the legislative branch of government. 
   For too long, for whatever reasons, we have avoided trying to create that agreement that a majority of both major political parties in this country could stand behind and promote breaking down barriers to trade around the world. 
   I am hopeful that through the chairman's work and through Chairman Levin's work with the administration, we have at least gotten to first base on creating a policy that will allow us to move forward as one Nation trying to create a freer flow of goods and services around the world for the betterment, not just of this country, but for all the world. 
   I want to echo the words of Chairman Rangel and say that I couldn't agree more with his words or his sentiment. 
   I also want to express my appreciation for the majority staff and the minority staff of the Trade Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee for lending their considerable talents to this effort. I think it's safe to say that without their efforts, without their cooperation, we wouldn't be here today. We wouldn't have the bipartisan framework that we announced back in May to allow us to get this far. I want to thank the staff for their hard work. 
   Needless to say, I rise in very strong support of this free trade agreement. I am glad we are here. I wish we had been here sooner, but we are here today, and it's a great day for that reason. 
   On May 10, precisely, Congress and the administration established that framework for advancing the four free trade agreements the United States has negotiated, Peru, Colombia, Panama and Korea. The Peru Free Trade Agreement is the first of those four trade agreements that Congress is considering. 
   As the Speaker said earlier, at least we have that framework in place that can allow us to look at free trade agreements that have been negotiated. Then each one, yes, of course, must be considered on its own merits. At least we have that framework in place, and that will allow us to, I am very hopeful, consider later in this Congress the Colombia FTA, the Panama FTA and the Korea FTA. 
   Trade is often blamed for the loss of jobs in this country, and certainly we know that there are losses of some jobs directly related to trade. But the truth is that trade creates a great many jobs in this country, and those jobs generally are high-paying jobs. 
   Trade also significantly increases the standard of living for Americans, as well as the peoples of other nations around the world by providing us with a wide variety of affordable goods, goods that are not only affordable but available. 
   Anybody who appreciates fresh produce in the winter or coffee with their breakfast should be a fan of free trade. Too often trade is portrayed as only having negative consequences for the United States' economy. But the facts are clear that today, more than ever, trade is the engine of economic growth in the United States. 
   As a senior economist at Goldman Sachs was saying last week, ``Trade is the only thing holding up manufacturing.'' This is why passing this legislation, and then, I hope, moving expeditiously to pass the free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and Korea is so critical to the economic well-being of the United States. 
   By the same token, we should also make sure that any workers adversely affected by trade have access to training and support. I am hopeful we will move in this Congress a bipartisan trade adjustment assistance reauthorization. 
   In light of the significance of trade to the United States' economy, Congress should promote our continued economic growth by passing the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. Today, virtually all imports from Peru come into the United States duty-free, while United States exports of goods and services to Peru face significant barriers, tariffs in Peru. It's a one-way street in favor of Peru today because of the trade preferences that are in effect. 
   This legislation before the House today will create a two-way street so that our goods and services can go to Peru with the same preferences, no tariffs, or very low tariffs that Peru goods and services come today to the United States. Not passing this agreement would perpetuate the competitive disadvantage faced by United States exporters into Peru. 
   Therefore, the impact of passing this bill should be crystal clear. This trade agreement will result in increased United States exports and an improvement in the United States trade balance with Peru. 
   I had the opportunity to travel to Peru recently with several of my colleagues and Secretary of Commerce Gutierrez earlier this fall. I saw firsthand how important this agreement is to Peru and to the entire region and how this agreement will strengthen an important ally of ours in that region.  
   Peru is resisting the efforts of Venezuela's authoritarian President Hugo Chavez to wage a war of words and ideas in Latin America against the United States. In fact, Chavez blatantly intervened in Peru's democratic elections, espousing sentiments against the United States and the principles for which America stands, democracy, free markets, liberty. On June 4, 2006, Peruvian voters decisively rejected Chavez's candidate in Peru and instead chose Alan Garcia to be their next president. The election was a sign of support from Peru that they reject Chavez's fiery populism and instead continue supporting Peru's current policies of economic engagement with the United States and market reform. 
   Congress should acknowledge the support of the people of Peru and pass this legislation by a strong margin. We should then turn to the remaining FTAs that have been negotiated. 
   I hope that the bipartisan spirit that resulted in the May 10 framework and the imminent passage of this legislation can help us make clear to all Americans that trade is a benefit for this country and that we must continue to pursue trade agreements that open markets for United States exports or risk letting our companies and workers being left behind in the global economy. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, the bill before us today, certainly the tax portion of the bill today, represents a compromise. These extensions of expiring provisions of the Tax Code have been bandied about here in the House back, over in the Senate, back and forth all year long, including the patch on the alternative minimum tax. I'm gratified that we were able to come together to present the tax extenders in this package because I believe very strongly in the overwhelming majority of those provisions. I think they're good, sound tax policy. Members of this House have voted for all of them many times over. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I encourage a ``yea'' vote on this bill, especially for the tax extenders.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (HEROES EARNINGS ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6081, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first I want to commend the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, for bringing this bill to the floor today. It's certainly a bill that has bipartisan support, bicameral support, and I will talk a little bit more about that in my remarks. 
   People watching this on C-SPAN may think they have gone into reruns. We haven't. This bill has been discussed on the floor of the House before and, in fact, passed through the House before. Unfortunately, though, we never could get the Senate version and the House version reconciled and get a bill to the President. So here we are again starting this process in the House, passing a bill today, hoping to get finally some agreement so that we can get this bill to the President and we can give some relief to our soldiers in the military. 
   This bill provides certain tax benefits to members of the military. It provides tax credits to housing projects for low-income families. But the specific thing that it fixes is, with respect to low-income housing and the eligibility for that, when testing to see if a family's income makes them eligible, current law excludes the value of a section 8 voucher provided by HUD. But a family's income does include the value of a base housing allowance provided to members of the Armed Forces. This bill, for whatever reason, doesn't address this issue. In the past other versions of this legislation have. Congressman Moran of Kansas and Senator Roberts of Kansas have tried to address this problem in legislation, and the other body has included it. And that's one of the things that led to last year's deadlock. I personally wish that this provision were included, and I hope before the end of the process, we can address that. 
   But there are many good things in the bill before the House today, including provisions to ensure that combat pay does not diminish the earned income credit. The bill also contains important language allowing active-duty Reservists to make penalty-free withdrawals from retirement plans and permits contributions of military death benefit gratuities into a Roth IRA or education savings account without regard to annual contribution limits. Other provisions in the bill amend the Supplemental Security Income program to expand eligibility for, and increase SSI benefit payments to, certain military families, veterans, and AmeriCorps participants. 
   This bill does contain one other change from the bill debated last year that merits mentioning today. It allows stimulus checks to be mailed to families in which one spouse is a member of the military and the other does not have a valid Social Security number. I understand the reasons for this provision, and I'm sure as this bill works its way through the process, we will have an opportunity to examine this provision further to make sure that it's administrable and workable. 
   Finally, one other provision deserves particular mention both because of its merits and because it's a great example of how one person's good idea brought to the attention of a Member of Congress can make its way to the forefront of a legislative agenda. Health care flexible spending accounts, known as FSAs, have a use-it-or-lose-it rule. If you don't use all the money by the end of the year, the money goes back to your employer. Funds deposited into an FSA are put there on a pretax basis, or a tax-free basis. So it's a very attractive benefit for employees. 
   This bill modifies the FSA program to allow a plan to return deposited funds to an employee at the end of the year if that amount remains unspent because the individual was called to active-duty military service. This is a very, I think, fair change to the underlying program. It's an issue that one of Mr. Barton's, Joe Barton's, constituents raised with him, and I applaud  him and his lead cosponsor, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher), for crafting a simple solution to this problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, I once again want to thank the chairman and the staff of the Ways and Means Committee for their work on this issue, and I urge passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I return the compliment to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for helping to create an atmosphere on our committee which has allowed us to make great progress in the area of trade, as evidenced by today's 39-0 vote in favor of advancing the Peru Free Trade Agreement. 
   The chairman and I have talked many times this year about the need to have a more viable assistance program or network of programs at the Federal level as well as in the private sector to assist workers in our country who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, who lose their jobs because of trade or because of globalization more generally. The chairman has been very good at listening to our suggestions from the minority and considering those. 
   Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the bill that is before the House today does not reflect any of our suggestions or proposals that we have shared with the majority; and that's unfortunate, although I have been assured by the chairman that as this bill works its way through the rest of the process, our ideas may yet receive consideration and perhaps inclusion. So I remain hopeful of that. 
   But the bill that is before us today does not contain those and it contains, I think, a number of weaknesses which compel me to not support the bill that is before the House today but instead to support a substitute which I will offer later in the debate. 
   In talking about the majority bill that's on the floor today as a threshold matter, and the chairman knows this because I have talked with him about it, I think we should be considering trade adjustment assistance, unemployment insurance, modification of those programs in the context of trade opportunities generally for United States workers, farmers and businesses. That is to say, I think we should be considering modifications to our assistance network in the context of the pending free trade agreements that are before the Congress and the expired trade promotion authority. Unfortunately, we are not doing that. We are considering TAA in isolation. 
   The alternative that I offer today would reauthorize trade adjustment assistance for 5 years. To help workers gain the skills needed to adapt to the changing global economy, our bill would restructure TAA from a predominantly income support program that offers training into a job retraining program that improves access to more flexible training and continues to provide income support, health care, and other benefits. 
   The contrasts between the substitute I will offer and H.R. 3920, the bill on the floor, are quite stark. For example, H.R. 3920 would pointlessly keep people in trade adjustment assistance longer. Our substitute would provide more flexible training options to get people back to work sooner, including by training before layoff and training part-time and giving people training scholarships to use over 4 years. 
   H.R. 3920 would increase TAA spending by billions of dollars, but would not require any further accountability on how program funds are spent. Our bill introduces some elements of accountability in that spending. 
   H.R. 3920 would greatly expand TAA and, I think, exacerbate the inefficiencies in the program today. Our bill would better integrate TAA and other Federal programs to make more services available to all workers. 
   H.R. 3920 would extend benefits to public sector workers and submit State and local officials to subpoenas and legal proceedings to comply. Our bill would maintain the focus of the program on private sector workers. 
   H.R. 3920 would greatly expand the health coverage tax credit, but then terminate that credit in 2 years. I don't know exactly why the majority chose to terminate this health care tax credit in 2 years. They have, in way of explanation, said that they think the current way the tax credit is structured may not be the best way to do it so they may use these 2 years to come up with another plan. That may be; but the fact is that the bill terminates the health care tax credit in 2 years. They also increase the credit from 65 percent to 85 percent which I believe is not warranted. Our substitute would increase the credit from 65 percent to 70 percent, and would continue that credit for the entire 5-year life of the bill. 
   There are other differences. One that we think is notable is the new markets tax credit that we would expand. We think that is a more efficient way to address communities that have been directly impacted by trade. The tax credit bonds in the majority bill we think are untested. They could be subject to abuse and uses that are not really related to impacts of trade. 
   I also want to express my clear opposition to how the majority pays for the $10 billion cost of their bill. First, they would delay interest allocation rules that this Congress enacted in 2004. We did that to address an unfairness for American companies that do business overseas. The effect of delaying the application of that change that we made would be to make United States companies less competitive. 
   Second, they would unnecessarily, in our view, increase Federal unemployment payroll taxes by extending the 0.2 percent FUTA surtax that is due to expire at the end of this year for another 3 years. 
   I regret that this bill does not reflect what I hoped to be our bipartisan approach to trade adjustment assistance or to our trade agenda beyond the Peru FTA, and I reluctantly will oppose it and support the substitute. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I understand how people can get emotional about some of the arguments with respect to these bills. My good friend from New Jersey is clearly agitated, and I understand that. But I would tell him that some very good lawyers have looked at the language in the bill, which is different from current law language with respect to providing benefits to illegal immigrants. And categories two and three, which the gentleman cited, ``lawfully present in the United States'' or ``permanently residing in the United States under color of law,'' do present problems. First, there are multiple definitions of what ``lawfully present'' means in current law and regulation. Even more fundamentally, literally millions of students and tourists and other ``nonimmigrants'' are ``lawfully present'' in the United States each year. The provision in the bill appears intended to make these groups eligible for TAA benefits despite their not being authorized to work in the United States in the first place. 
   And the category of ``permanently residing under color of law'' is still more problematic. Even though the welfare reform law sought to do away with this ambiguous category, it continues to be used in some programs. SAA regulations, for example, define PRUCOL, permanently residing in the United States under color of law, to include, among other categories, ``aliens living in the United States with the knowledge and permission of the INS/CIS and whose departure that agency does not contemplate enforcing.'' That is, those who are illegally present and who could be deported but are not. This category could include individuals who were originally authorized to work in the United States for a temporary period of time, lost that job, and under current law were supposed to leave the United States but remained despite the requirement that they leave. It could also include individuals who enter the United States illegally in the first place who are known to the government to be here but who are not being deported. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I understand how we can all get emotional about this, but the fact is, at least according to the lawyers that have looked at this information and advised us, the bill does loosen current law with respect to verifying that people who are here illegally are not due the benefits. As the gentleman said, it appears that the intent of the bill is not to qualify those people, but the language of the bill, unfortunately, according to some very good lawyers, might, indeed, allow qualification for those who are here illegally. 
   Mr. Speaker, I didn't intend to get into all of that. But the fact is that the bill that is before us, I believe, goes way too far in spending, way too far in increasing taxes, and, for those two things alone, should be rejected.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, the amendment I offer, along with Mr. McKeon, is a substitute for the bill that is before the House this afternoon. 
   Our amendment would reform and reauthorize for 5 years the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, and we believe our substitute would strengthen and improve not only TAA but the Workforce Investment Act program as well.     
   Our bill would better equip workers affected by trade, globalization, and other causes of job loss with the skills needed to adjust to changes in the global economy. 
   Our Republican alternative consists of four related pieces of legislation separately introduced this year. Some of these are under the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee; others are under the jurisdiction of the Education and Workforce Committee. 
   Among other things, our bill would provide more flexible training options to get people into training sooner and back to good jobs more quickly. For example, we've heard some discussion about the plant closing notice. The bill before the House this afternoon would expand the amount of time from 60 days to 90 days that a plant company would have to give notice to employees of either plant closure or a substantial layoff at that plant. 
   Under the current constriction of TAA, a worker in that plant wishing to, perhaps, go to job training at night after he gets off work, waiting for the expiration of the 60-day notice or the 90-day notice could not qualify for TAA training benefits. Our substitute would correct that and allow that worker to take advantage of trade adjustment assistance while he is still working in that plant that he knows is going to be closed and where he would lose his job. 
   Number two, our bill would continue the health coverage tax credit over our bill's 5-year life and increase the premium subsidy from 65 percent to 70 percent. Mr. Levin earlier talked about how the current 65-percent credit has not been enough to entice a high number of laid-off workers under TAA to claim that credit and get their health care, their health insurance through that method, and he is right. The take-up rate on this benefit has been lower than we expected, and so some adjustment is necessary. Whether that adjustment, the appropriate one to provide the right level of enticement, is 70 percent, or in their bill 85 percent, we don't know. We are willing to go up on that. We think it is appropriate to do that. We've included 70 percent in our bill. And the House should know that that means that a person who is laid off and who is eligible for trade adjustment assistance can get, under our substitute, 70 percent of the premium paid by the government. So, that laid-off worker would only have to come up with 30 percent of the premium to continue coverage under COBRA or to get some other qualified insurance plan. 
   Number three, our bill would convert the wage insurance pilot program for older workers into a transitional wage supplement for all TAA workers, regardless of their age. It would be allowed for any worker who became reemployed at low wages, low wages being defined as minimum wage plus $2.40 an hour, and allow them to obtain, at the same time they were getting this wage supplement, the health care tax credit and additional trade adjustment training, which right now, if a person goes back to work, under TAA he is not eligible for those benefits. So our bill would expand the availability of the health care tax credit and job training under TAA for people who go back to work and who are receiving a wage supplement. 
   Number four, our bill would require indicators of performance to evaluate the Trade Adjustment Assistance programs and their results. Currently, TAA programs have no measure of performance, no way for us to tell if these programs are being effective or if taxpayer dollars are being wasted. Our bill would put in place those indicators of performance to give us the idea of the efficiency of these programs. 
   Number five, in provisions affecting the unemployment insurance program, our bill would allow States to apply for cost-neutral waivers of current rules to operate wage insurance and other demonstration programs to better assist unemployed workers in returning to work. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I have heard some in opposition to the Republican substitute say that this would allow States to do away with their unemployment insurance benefits. We certainly didn't intend that in our substitute; we don't think that the language would allow that. But in any event, a State would have to get a waiver from the executive branch to take advantage of these provisions, and I doubt seriously if any executive branch under any President would allow a State to just do away with its unemployment insurance benefits. So, I don't really think that's a valid argument in opposition to this increased flexibility that could assist unemployed workers. 
   And number six, our bill also creates a new trade-related category for qualification under the new markets tax credit. Businesses and communities experiencing adverse economic effects due to trade would qualify for an additional $500 million of new markets tax credits. These tax credits, we believe, would bring significant amounts of private capital into these economically disadvantaged areas to create jobs to replace those that had been lost due to trade. 
   Mr. Speaker, we believe this substitute is a much more cost-effective approach than that contained in H.R. 3920 and would help all Americans, not just those who lose jobs to trade, get the skills needed to find productive new jobs. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for the substitute. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, before yielding to Mr. McKeon, I want to  point out that the underlying bill, as described by my friend from Washington, does, indeed, double, and then even later triples, the TAA training budget when nearly $300 million of the current budget lies unused. That's just an example of how we think the underlying bill that we oppose goes way too far in expanding this program needlessly. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee. I'm sorry, I've been calling it the Education and Workforce Committee. My apologies to the chairman and to the members of that committee. It is now the Education and Labor Committee, and Mr. McKeon is the ranking member.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Republican substitute before the House at this time does not eviscerate anything, much less the TAA program which is reauthorized in the substitute for 5 years exactly as it is. The benefits are the same. The amounts are the same. I don't know where the last speaker got his information, but the substitute certainly does not eviscerate the TAA program. It reauthorizes the existing program for 5 years. Then, in addition, we make some changes in the law that allow those benefits under the TAA to be used in instances where under current law they can't be used, and I have described one of those already in my earlier presentation. 
   So I hope this House doesn't get the wrong impression about this substitute. It certainly endorses the TAA program. We are for the TAA program. We think it is important. But we think our bill gives a lot more flexibility that is needed in the program and some accountability in the program that is needed. In addition to that, we do provide additional funds in our bill, and it is paid for under the PAYGO rules of the House. I just wanted to make that clear. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would point out that service workers today are entitled to unemployment insurance benefits, and that is the primary form of income support under TAA. But to expand to service workers all of the other array of benefits under the TAA may be premature. 
   In a bill that passed this Congress and was signed by the President earlier this year, there was a mandate for a study to look at service workers and the impact of trade on service workers. We don't yet have, obviously, the results of that study, so it may be premature to just willy-nilly offer all these benefits to service workers. 
   And while Mr. Moran spoke about some projection of losses of service worker jobs over the next 10 or so years, in an April 2007 paper, the Peterson Institute for International Economics evaluated data on the extent of the impact of off-shoring on service sector labor markets in the United States, and their review of the data concluded that just under 1 million American service workers lost their jobs from 2004 to 2005 due to mass layoffs of 50 or more employees, while 8 million service sector jobs were created during that time. And of those 1 million jobs lost, only about 4 percent could be attributed to off-shoring or offshore outsourcing. 
   So I think the question of the impact of trade on the service sector is certainly an open one, and the House may be well advised to wait for the results of the study that we mandated in previous legislation that passed this year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, in response to the remarks of my friend from Washington, I would point out that using Bureau of Labor statistics, the average cost of training under current law is only $3,000. So the $8,000 New Economy Scholarship in our substitute more than doubles the amount available. 
   In the case of remedial education, the scholarship amounts to an extra $1,000, nearly tripling the average cost of training. 
   The most common provider of occupational training is the local community or technical college. The limit of $8,000 over 2 years is significantly greater than the average cost of a 2-year program at a community college, and is similar to limits that apply to other Federal postsecondary assistance. 
   Under current law, Mr. Speaker, while there is no specific monetary limit, as there is in our substitute, the cost of training must be reasonable and that reasonableness is decided by the various States. So the amount that is available is subject to judgment and to uncertainty. Our substitute removes that uncertainty so that a person knows going in how much he is going to have to spend on training. 
   Our substitute significantly enhances access to training by removing additional eligibility criteria and allowing people who do get new jobs to use the training benefit unlike current law. So we expand current law in that regard with respect to training benefits. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope the gentleman from Washington has listened to my rebuttal and is convinced now that we don't gut the training benefits in TAA. If he is not, though, if he will vote for the substitute, I look forward to working with him to smooth out the complaints that he has. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   The information that we have, and we think it is reliable, is that no State ran out of training money, but obviously the majority has different information and at some point during the process we would love to sit down with them and examine their data and our information to see if there is some way to reconcile those and arrive at a conclusion that we both can embrace. We have not had that opportunity other than the limited debate we had in committee and now here on the floor, and we are hearing the same thing on the floor we heard in committee and so we haven't reconciled those differences. But clearly there are differences in the data that each of us thinks is reliable.

   Mr. McCRERY. Oh, well, thank you for the kind offer. I'm happy to close at this time, Mr. Speaker. 
   I think we've had a good debate today on the different approaches that the majority and minority have at this point on the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. We certainly understand the importance of providing an array of benefits to people in this country who lose their jobs because of trade, and certainly Chairman Rangel and I have talked and agreed that it's necessary for Congress to take action and to make sure that people in this country know that as we expand trade, that the benefits of trade expansion will be uneven. And there will be some in this country who will lose their jobs because of that expansion of trade, and we need to be prepared to assure those people that we will help them give them that helping hand to lift them up after they've lost that job and find training, education, whatever is necessary to get them a new job if they desire, and in the meantime give them benefits that will allow them to take care of themselves and their families. 
   So we agree on the importance of this program. I had hoped we would have had more give-and-take over the last couple of months with respect to crafting a bipartisan approach to reauthorizing the program, not only because the program was originally a bipartisan program, but also because we are trying, some of us on both sides of the aisle are trying to rebuild that bipartisan coalition for the expansion of trade around the world, knocking down trade barriers to our goods and services, to make the playing field more level for United States producers of products and services. And as we attempt to create or recreate that bipartisan coalition for the expansion of trade, we understand that one leg of that effort has got to be reauthorizing and strengthening not only TAA, but perhaps even going beyond the current universe of beneficiaries of a Trade Adjustment Assistance program and looking at enhancing the benefits of all workers who lose their jobs, not just because of trade but perhaps due to things that are more in the rubric of globalization but not specifically trade. 
   So I'm glad that we have this bill before the House today. I'm hopeful that we can reauthorize in some form this very important program before the end of this year. I regret that I cannot support the majority bill that's on the floor today. I think we have offered a reasonable substitute and I'm hopeful that the House will adopt our substitute, and then as the process moves through the Senate and to the President, we can perhaps refine that product some more and get a bipartisan agreement. 
   So with that, Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the substitute. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Chairman, unlike the budget put forward by the Democratic majority, the Republican alternative offered by Mr. Ryan avoids the largest tax increase in our Nation's history and begins to deal with the long-term problem of growing entitlements.  
   This chart here gives us an idea of the difference in the scenarios between the Republican budget, this line for tax revenues; and the Democratic budget, this top line for revenues. If you look at it in terms of the percentage of GDP consumed by Federal revenues, you should know that this year Federal revenues constitute about 18.6 percent of GDP. Under the Republican budget alternative, the bottom line, that stays about the same. About 10 years from now, it is approximately the same percent of GDP. But the Democratic budget, this top line, that figure is going to go up to over 20 percent of GDP, over 20 percent. Only once since 1962 has Federal revenues constituted that high a percentage of our GDP. Our economy is certain to drag under the weight of those kinds of tax increases. 
   And the worst will be yet to come, because the Democrats' budget ignores demographic reality and offers no reform of entitlements, no savings from entitlements. In 2009, the Social Security surplus will begin to decline. In 2017, we will have to pay out more money in Social Security benefits than we take in in taxes. The problem gets worse after that with more baby boomers in retirement, fewer workers to support them; and the difficulties facing Social Security are relatively manageable compared to those facing Medicare and Medicaid. 
   I shouldn't need to reiterate these facts. Everyone in this House should be familiar with them, but somehow the Democrats, budget ignores those facts completely. 
   The Republican budget would freeze nondefense discretionary and reform entitlements. Please reject the Democratic budget and support the Ryan budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say in response to the last speaker for the majority that the energy bill that he derided that we passed on a bipartisan basis in 2005 is basically included in this bill. You take the same tax provisions, for example, that we had in that bill and you just renew them. So the bill that we did in 2005 wasn't bad, evidently, because you have embraced it. It is just that it wasn't enough. 
   Now, finally, I think the country and people around the country understand the importance of not only preparing for the future, which admittedly we have to do, but in 2005 when we said ultimately that bill will lead to lower prices, we think it will, once we get alternative fuels on the market. But we have to develop those. We provided incentives in that bill, as you do in this bill, to generate activity in those alternative fuel sectors. But what we also need and what the country has come to embrace now I think is more domestic oil and gas production to bridge us to that future. 
   We are not there yet. This bill, unfortunately, doesn't provide that bridge. It is advertised as such, but I would submit that it is false advertising. 
   This legislation, produced unfortunately in secret by the majority and released just late last night, is a sham. It permanently locks up large portions of the Outer Continental Shelf, putting it off-limits to oil and gas producers, meaning that any claims that this bill will help promote energy security, certainly in the short-term, and by that I mean for the next 20 or 30 years, is just not the case. 
   Moreover, in what surely must go down as one of the biggest bait-and-switches in legislative history, the majority claims to open up some areas far offshore for production, but only if the States agree, only if the States opt in, and then it is only a few States. And to try to sour that deal, this bill removes the typical revenue sharing that would go to that State, in effect eliminating a major financial reason for States to allow drilling off their shores. 
   Because of this omission in the bill, even my senior Senator, who is a Democrat, sees the foolishness of this bill's approach. She is quoted in the New Orleans paper as saying in reference to this bill that is on the floor right now, ``It most certainly won't see the light of day in the Senate.'' That is because of the omission of the revenue sharing in this bill. What she means is it won't see the light of day in the Senate because they know on a bipartisan basis in the Senate that this bill won't produce any more offshore drilling because States won't opt in if there is no revenue sharing for this bill. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge this House to do an all-of-the-above bill on energy, and not a none-of-the-above bill, like this bill represents.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Thank you, Mr. McKeon, for allowing the Ways and Means Committee to control 30 minutes of the time in this debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   This debate today is important. It is obviously important to a lot of people around the country who are making minimum wage or who would seek an entry-level job in our country. It is also important, though, to many small businesses around our Nation who are struggling to stay in business, struggling to create jobs, and to face the competition often from much bigger establishments that have some advantages in the marketplace. It is those small businesses that the McKeon-McCrery alternative would address today. If we are given the chance today to modify the legislation before us to include some benefits for small businesses, in our view this would greatly improve the legislation before us regarding the minimum wage. 
   Let me just briefly explain what that alternative would be if Members of this House were given the opportunity to vote on it. 
   The minimum wage provisions would be the same as in the underlying legislation that is on the floor today. It would increase the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 over 2 years in three increments. But it would add to that a provision from the Education and Labor Committee regarding association health plans that would make it easier for small businesses to get health insurance for their employees, and three tax provisions designed to help small businesses cope with the burden that would be placed on them by an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Those three tax provisions are a 1-year extension of the higher small business expensing limits. As you will recall, we passed in the last few years legislation allowing small businesses to expense up to $100,000 of investment in their small business in the year of that investment. That provision currently is scheduled to expire at the end of 2009. This legislation, this alternative that we would like to present today, would extend that provision 1 year through 2010. 
   The next tax provision that would help small businesses is a 15-year depreciation period for new restaurant construction. 
   Now, that is important because current law allows a much shorter depreciation period, 15 years, for leasehold improvements, including restaurants, but it has to be improvements to an existing building. In the restaurant business, a lot of times to keep up with the competition and to keep market share, an owner will have to build a new facility. You can't just refurbish the old facility. You have got to build a new building to keep pace. 
   Under the current law though, he would have to depreciate that investment over 39 years. This provision would put him on an equal standing with those who just recently built a restaurant and are upgrading it with improvements. 
   So it would give a 15-year depreciation period, both to leasehold improvements for existing buildings, existing restaurants, but also a 15-year depreciation period for the construction of new restaurants. 
   Finally, the third tax provision that we would add to this legislation to help small businesses would be the FUTA surtax repeal, that is the unemployment payroll tax. Back in the 1970s, when we were having problems with our unemployment trust fund, and we were extending unemployment benefits across the Nation, we had to impose a surtax to bring money into the system to be able to pay the unemployment bills around the country. That debt though was paid off in the 1980s, and for whatever reason, Congress has decided to continually extend that unemployment surtax. 
   This bill would accelerate the expiration of that .2 percent unemployment surtax that employers have to pay today. It would accelerate it from the end of this year 2007 to April 1 of 2007. 
   As you know, that surtax, that .2 surtax is imposed only on the first $7,000 of wages, so it would most directly give relief to those employers who have those low-skilled, low-dollar employees, and would give them some immediate relief in that regard. 
   Mr. Speaker, our proposal is to increase the minimum wage, but also give help to those businesses that will be most adversely affected by the imposition of these increased costs for their businesses. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The gentleman from New Jersey talked about the experience in New Jersey of increasing the minimum wage, and he stated that no jobs were lost. He didn't cite any study to that effect. He just stated it. There are studies, though, that show that after the increase in minimum wage in the 1990s, there were, in fact, job losses. 146,000 jobs were cut from restaurant payrolls, and operators of restaurants signaled plans to postpone hiring an additional 106,000 new employees because of the raise of the minimum wage. And, also, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that following the increase in minimum wage, net increase in jobs were significantly reduced around the country. And whether that is a coincidence or not, we don't know, but certainly the evidence is fairly clear that there was an impact.

   Our point is that the businesses that will be most directly impacted by the increased mandated burden of costs need to be helped so that we minimize the job loss that we know will come as a result of that. 
   So I agree with the gentleman: There is a legitimate role, and we are not arguing that. In fact, our alternative does increase the minimum wage and gives help to those businesses that will most directly be impacted.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform my colleagues of the passing of Arthur ``Pete'' Singleton, former chief of staff of the Ways and Means Committee, who died this past Saturday. Pete was a great guy who served this country in a variety of ways, beginning with his Marine service and ending as the staff director of the majority Ways and Means Committee for Chairman Bill Archer. 
   Pete retired for the second time in 2000. Upon his retirement, Chairman Archer summarized Pete's contributions. He said, ``It was he who, in 1977, drafted the minority Social Security proposals, most of which later became law. Most recently, he oversaw the committee's intensive efforts during action on the historic 1997 Balanced Budget Act and Taxpayer Relief Act, as well as legislation to repeal the Social Security earnings limit.'' 
   Chairman Archer went on to describe the quality of Pete's service to the committee and to our country: ``Pete Singleton is one of the most loyal people I have ever known. His first thought has always been: How does this impact the committee? He is one of the hardest working staff persons I have known and has sacrificed much of his personal life for the committee. He possesses a sharp wit and a quick mind. He is a true gentleman in every sense and a wonderful human being.'' 
   It was my privilege to serve on the committee when Pete served as chief of staff. I came to rely on Pete as a steady and trusted leader and often utilized his counsel based on his vast expertise and experience. 
   On behalf of the current and former members of our committee, we commemorate Pete's outstanding contributions to the committee that he so loved and to our Nation. Our thoughts and prayers remain with his devoted wife, Libby, and all Pete's family, friends and colleagues.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform my colleagues of the passing of Arthur ``Pete'' Singleton, former Chief of Staff of the Committee on Ways and Means, who died this past Saturday. 
   Pete began his service to his country as a Marine in World War II. He joined the Republican Committee staff in 1970 as Deputy Staff Director, following two successful careers, one in journalism as a reporter and editor and one for the former U.S. Steel Company. 
   Pete soon became expert in the complex issue areas of Social Security and international trade. In 1981, Pete was appointed as Republican Staff Director. He served in that position until 1988, when he retired for the first time. 
   After spending time writing, along with serving on the Social Security Advisory Board, 8 years later Chairman Bill Archer of Texas asked Pete to return to the Committee on Ways and Means to serve as Majority Chief of Staff, a position which he held until his second retirement in October of 2000.

   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Chairman, the speakers from the majority side for the last 15 minutes or so are among the Members of the House that I have the most respect for, Mr. Cooper, Mr. Tanner, Mr. Boyd. I have watched them over the last few years show courage when it comes to fiscal discipline, when it comes to entitlement reform and suggesting a need for entitlement reform. So it was with some surprise that I heard them today endorse the majority's budget as crafted by the majority on the Budget Committee. 
   And the reason I say I was somewhat surprised is that I believe those gentlemen over the years have talked about the need to constrain spending at the Federal level, to restrain spending. That's the whole point of talking about entitlement reform. They know that the entitlement programs, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, are unsustainable as currently structured. And with some courage, they have talked over the last few years about the need to tackle those problems and get this spending under control. 
   And so when my friend, Mr. Tanner, talked about turning this ship, and it takes so many miles and so long to turn a ship and this budget starts the turn and that's a great thing, well, the minority budget does the same thing. It starts to turn that ship in the right direction, also, toward a balanced budget. The difference is the majority's budget turns that ship with the energy source of higher taxes, whereas our ship, the minority ship, is being turned with the energy source of restrained spending. 
   So I hope, Madam Chairman, that my good friends, for whom I have much respect, will see the light before the vote comes and join us in supporting a budget that does what they want to do, that gets the ship of state turned in the right direction, but does it through what they have advocated very soundly over the last few years, which is spending restraint, not increases in taxes.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in strong opposition to H.R. 2776. 
   It seems that many of my colleagues in the majority have developed a sort of schizophrenia when it comes to energy. Throughout last year, they held press conference after press conference saying that the Republicans weren't doing enough to lower the price of gasoline at the pump; yet, since the new Democratic majority was elected, the price of gasoline has jumped an average of nearly $1 a gallon across the country. Now that my colleagues have brought to the floor a bill which they call ``energy legislation,'' which includes substantial tax increases on the oil and gas industry, surely they don't believe this will do anything to bring down gasoline prices. 
   The majority will claim that this legislation is basically the same as H.R. 6, an energy tax increase bill passed by this House in January. That is not the case. This bill contains double the tax increase that that legislation did. This bill has over $15 billion worth of tax increases. Now, some of that is because the Joint Tax Committee reestimated the impact of one of the provisions in H.R. 6, but other provisions are new, including a massive tax increase on United States companies producing energy abroad. 
   And while overseas production of oil and gas might seem like a tempting target for a tax hike, the Statement of Administration Policy has rightly warned that this provision will ``disadvantage United States-based companies by reducing their ability to compete for investments and foreign energy-related projects.'' 
   At a time when worldwide energy demand is increasing, it defies logic why we would unilaterally raise taxes on American companies competing in an international market for future exploration and production deals. What logical reason could there be for using the tax code to help ensure more of the world's oil production is done by non-United States companies? And in addition to raising taxes by more than $15 billion on energy production, the majority has made, in my view, some poor decisions when they decided how to spend the tax increase. Their bill, for example, would allow several Republican-created incentives promoting conservation to expire, including incentives for individuals to buy hybrid cars, to install solar power and solar water heaters, and to make energy-efficiency upgrades to their homes. 
   Even worse, the bill before us would also authorize up to $6 billion in tax credit bonds for so-called ``green energy products.'' At our markup, we in the minority offered a variety of amendments to try to define or limit the allowable uses of these bond proceeds, and those amendments were repeatedly rejected by the majority. 
   During the debate today, we will hear about some of the possible uses of these bonds and our concern that they will amount to little more than green pork doled out to Governors, State legislatures, mayors and city councils to fund all manner of boondoggles and white elephants. The majority could have avoided this debate by accepting language requiring that these products reduce energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions, but they didn't. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, three facts about this legislation should be painfully obvious. 
   Number one, you don't lower prices at the pump by raising taxes on the companies that find, refine and transport gasoline. 
   Number two, you don't increase America's energy independence by raising taxes on our domestic energy industry, making American energy even more expensive compared with foreign sources. 
   And three, you certainly don't improve anything by shoveling money at Governors and big-city mayors with a vague mandate and zero oversight. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today's bill, Mr. Speaker, represents a clear difference between the two parties in the House when it comes to tax policy. Republicans believe that Congress should not raise taxes on one group of taxpayers in order to prevent a tax increase on another set of taxpayers. To say that another way, we don't believe we ought to have to raise taxes to preserve something that's already in the Tax Code. 
   Now, we are certainly for continuing to patch the alternative minimum tax. That's been the practice for the last several years. The President, in his budget for the last several years, has had an AMT patch in his budget without increasing taxes on somebody else. So we are certainly for that. But we are not for imposing a tax increase in a like amount on another set of taxpayers. That just doesn't make sense to us. 
   Without this patch, another 21 million families would come under the AMT, and their average tax increase would be about $2,400 per taxpayer. So we certainly want to prevent that. But in 2007, we had the patch in place; so we did not collect the AMT revenue from those 21 million taxpayers. And yet we collected, last year, in revenues to the Federal Government, about 18.7, 18.8 percent of gross domestic product. The historic average of revenues coming into the Federal Government for the last 40 years has been about 18.3 percent of GDP. So last year with the AMT patch in place, those 21 million taxpayers protected from the AMT, we brought in substantially more in revenues to the Federal Government than we have historically. 
   So why, then, should we be so intent on increasing taxes to prevent those 21 million taxpayers from paying $2,400 apiece more in taxes in 2008? The only explanation is somebody just wants to get more revenue into the Federal Government. Now, they may say, well, we want to do that because the deficit is really high and we want to get the deficit down. Well, I wonder, if we took a poll across America, how many Americans would say, ``Yes, I want to get the deficit down and I want to do it by raising taxes'' and how many Americans would say, ``Yes, I want to get the deficit down, but I want to do it by controlling spending''? My guess is more Americans would say, ``I want to get the deficit down by controlling spending.'' But the PAYGO rules that are in effect, while they give us the opportunity to reduce spending to ``pay for'' all of these things, not once have we seen a cut in spending being offered by the majority to pay for any of these items. It's always a tax increase. 
   So, yes, if you want to get the deficit down to zero, you can do it by increasing taxes, and under the PAYGO baseline, if we were to follow it, we would continue to increase the take of the Federal Government from American taxpayers until at the end of a 10-year window we'd be taking in 20.5 percent of GDP, an historic high, or pretty close to an historic high, and certainly only a couple times in our Nation's history have we even approached that level of revenues coming into the Federal Government. 
   Now, I think it's a legitimate question as to what is the appropriate level of GDP that we should bring in to the Federal Government, and Chairman Rangel alluded to that in his statement by saying that, I believe he said, the President hasn't offered a tax reform plan. That's true, I guess, he hasn't. But you know what? Under the Constitution, the President can't even introduce a bill, much less pass one. That's the job of the Congress. 
   So if we want to do tax reform, which I think is appropriate, we ought to have this discussion about what is the appropriate level of revenue that we should bring in? What is the appropriate take of the Federal Government of everything that Americans make? Is it 18.3 percent, the historic average? Is it 18.7 percent, what we took in last year? Or is it 20.5 percent? I don't know what the magic number is, but that's a legitimate debate, and we ought to have that debate in the context of writing a new tax system for the United States that is more modern, more efficient, and more competitive. So I hope that the chairman will, in his constitutional prerogative as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, undertake that task, have that debate, so that we can solve this problem once and for all of the AMT, the complexity of the code, and the continuing diminution of competitiveness that we enjoy with our tax system, vis-a-vis our competitors around the world. 
   This bill employs some pay-fors, some tax increases, that I believe would be onerous and would add to the lack of competitiveness in our Tax Code. For example, there is a provision that would, for the first time, ignore tax treaties that we have entered into in good faith with other countries around the world and would impose upon companies doing business, foreign companies doing business, through a United States subsidiary in this country, creating jobs in this country, a 30 percent tax, despite the fact that we have a tax treaty that says that company would get a deduction for that income and would not have to pay that 30 percent tax because they'd be paying taxes in the country where we have a tax treaty. 
   Now, yes, they say, well, but the ultimate parent is somewhere where there's not a tax treaty, but that still violates the spirit of the tax treaty that we have with the country where the immediate parent of the United States subsidiary resides. That change in our Tax Code would discourage at the margin that capital from coming to this country, being invested in this country, and creating jobs in this country. 
   Those companies that I'm talking about employ a substantial number of Americans; 5.3 million Americans are employed by those kinds of companies. Do we want to jeopardize those jobs? And 19 percent of all United States exports, helping us a little bit to get the balance of trade going our way, 19 percent of all exports come from companies like that. And just last year they reinvested nearly $71 billion back into their United States operations. That's capital, that's investment that we should want here and not discourage through tax changes like the one in this bill. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would say to the Members of this body that we ought to reject the majority's offering that they put forward today to save 21 million taxpayers from coming under the AMT because they would impose a like amount of tax increase on another set of taxpayers. Let's not increase taxes on any set of taxpayers, certainly not in this fragile economy. 
   We will later offer a motion to recommit that corrects the error, that strips the bill of the pay-fors, and it would allow this body to vote on a clean AMT patch to save those 21 million taxpayers from the increased tax burden but not increase taxes on somebody else.     
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   The majority's use of PAYGO has really twisted the logic of this bumper-sticker-turned-budget-tool into a pretzel. In the last 2 weeks, when PAYGO stood in the way of more government spending, it was ignored or openly waived. But, today, the majority insists on new permanent tax increases in exchange for a 1-year extension of needed tax relief. That is not a good deal for anybody--a permanent tax increase to pay for a temporary tax relief. 
   The motion that we have before us would save us from that fate. It would remove the tax increases in the bill, including the particularly misguided higher taxes on energy production that would discourage production here at home, that would further increase our energy insecurity, that would reduce our energy supplies, and that would increase prices. 
   Is that what we want to do? Do we want to increase the price of gasoline? That is what the effect of this would be. This is a tax increase on oil and gas companies--the companies that produce the oil, the gasoline that we buy. Do we think that, if we increase taxes on them, they are just going to absorb that? Of course not. They will pass it through to the consumer, which will mean higher gasoline prices. 
   This is a terribly misguided part of this bill. The motion to recommit would get rid of that ill-advised tax increase. So we get rid of all the pay-fors in the bill. That's the first thing that the motion to recommit does. 
   The second thing we do is we do provide some relief in this bill from high gasoline prices to volunteers who use their vehicles to help charities carry out their work. A lot of charities are telling us that they are losing volunteers because of the high price of gasoline. 
   Now, the IRS has some authority to modify the tax deduction that people can get from using gasoline in certain situations. So the IRS did, this week in fact, implement a midyear increase in the standard mileage deduction rates, increasing to 58 1/2 cents the allowable deduction for expenses incurred in operating a vehicle while carrying on a trade or business, and raising to 27 cents per mile the deduction for gasoline costs associated with transportation primarily for and essential to receiving medical care and for travel while moving. 
   But the IRS could not raise the deduction that can be claimed by individuals who use their car for charitable purposes, such as for delivering Meals on Wheels. That has to be done legislatively. So our motion to recommit would do just that. We would set the allowable deduction for gasoline expenses for charitable purposes at the same rate for medical care and for travel while moving, 27 cents per mile. 
   Meals on Wheels is one of those charities that has told us that they are losing volunteers because of gas prices. Nearly half indicated that increases in gas prices had forced them to eliminate meal delivery routes or to consolidate their meal services. 
   Mr. Speaker, these high gasoline prices are, in fact, having a very deleterious effect on charities and on Meals on Wheels in particular. I won't go into some of the details that we have been given by Meals on Wheels about the state of some of our seniors, but needless to say, it's not a pretty picture. 
   So this would give those charities some relief, Mr. Speaker, and it would allow them, we think, to get some of those volunteers back in active service to relieve some of these problems that we have. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, our motion to recommit does two things. It takes out the tax increases in this bill, leaving in place the AMT patch to give tax relief to those taxpayers who would otherwise be subjected to a $2,400-apiece increase in taxes, and number two, it increases the deduction, the mileage deduction, for vehicle use for charitable purposes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with regret that I rise to urge my colleagues to vote against the tax amendment to this bill. Let me be clear, however, in stating that my opposition to this section is not the result of a disagreement with my friend, Mr. Neal, or with the chairman of the committee, Mr. Rangel. We were able to work together so that the housing bill reported by the Ways and Means Committee enjoyed bipartisan support.  
   And while that package contains many provisions that do make sense, I think the House should have had the opportunity to consider at least one alternative. Unfortunately, the procedural straitjacket imposed by the majority for consideration of the housing bill today is something that I simply cannot ignore. For that reason, I will be voting against this amendment. 
   We all understand the severity of the housing crisis. Housing starts declined to 680,000 in March of 2008, the lowest level since January of 1991. Since hitting a peak in early 2006, housing starts have dropped by 62 percent. There is currently a 9 1/2 month supply of unsold homes, more than double the 10-year average. With those facts in mind, it is not surprising that home prices are falling, and the contraction in the residential real estate market is an anchor around our economy. 
   The Tax Code didn't get us into this mess, and there is only so much the Tax Code can do to get us out. The package approved by the Committee on Ways and Means contains many well-designed improvements, including improvements to make the low-income housing tax credit more efficient. I also think allowing those credits to be claimed against both the regular tax and the AMT is a step in the right direction. 
   The language expanding the Mortgage Revenue Bond program and allowing proceeds of the bonds to be used to refinance existing home mortgages, as suggested by the President, is certainly worth doing. And although I have some reservations about the design of the first-time homebuyer's tax credit, the recapture provision, if we include it, makes it more like a no-interest loan and not really a tax credit. 
   Still, I share the hope of the sponsors that this provision will help induce some home purchases this year and stabilize the market. We desire that because we recognize that potential homebuyers right now are reading the headlines every day, they're waiting on the sidelines to get to the bottom of the market. Well, as prices keep falling, more people who might think about buying a home decide to keep waiting, and so that creates a self-perpetuating cycle of declining home prices. Maybe, just maybe, this tax credit could induce some of those waiting on the sidelines to go ahead, jump in and buy a home. That's our desire. I think it could have been better, as I say, designed as a pure tax credit with no recapture provision, but still, I think it's better than nothing. 
   I understand the concern raised by some that an artificial temporary floor, so to speak, will not restore long-term stability to the housing market and could even result in further price declines when the temporary benefit lapses. But on balance, I think this provision holds some hope of helping us to reverse this slide in housing prices, or at least stop it for a while and give it a chance to recover. 
   At the same time, there are elements of this package that, frankly, I would prefer not be in here. Given the nature of the housing crisis, I think the House should follow the Senate's lead and waive PAYGO, for example. I think this is an emergency. We shouldn't be responding to this emergency situation with tax increases. 
   And there are specific items in here that if it were up to me might not have made the cut. But democracy is about compromise, and the bill produced by the Ways and Means Committee was something that I supported and would like to vote for again here on the House floor today. But the decision made by the majority leadership to debate this legislation as an amendment to a Senate-passed bill deprives the House of the chance to consider ways to improve it, even to the extent of denying the minority a motion to recommit. 
   Now, I recognize that tax bills traditionally come to the floor under restrictive rules, and I support that. But as I documented in a letter last year to the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee, in years when Republicans were in the majority, on one tax bill after another the Republican majority offered the Democratic minority not only a motion to recommit, but a substitute. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to insert the text of that letter to the chairwoman of the Rules Committee into the Congressional Record.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Chairman, Clause 5(a) of rule XXI states that, ``A bill or joint resolution carrying a tax or tariff measure may not be reported by a committee not having jurisdiction to report tax or tariff measures.'' 
   H.R. 2829 is a general appropriation bill, reported by the Appropriations Committee, which, of course, does not have jurisdiction over tax or tariff measures. 
   Precedent under Clause 5 of rule XXI found in the most recent edition of the House Rules and Manual states, ``A limitation on the use of funds contained in a general appropriation bill was held to violate this paragraph.'' 
   Further, the Manual refers to at least three rulings during consideration of a general appropriation bill where, ``It was shown that the imposition of the restriction on IRS funding for the fiscal year would effectively and inevitably preclude the IRS or the Customs Service from collecting revenues.'' 
   In other words, there is ample and clear precedent, Mr. Chairman, that a limitation on funding on the IRS is a revenue measure when it inevitably leads to a reduction in tax revenues, and is therefore subject to a point of order under Clause 5. 
   Congress authorized the Qualified Tax Collection Contracts Program found in Section 6306 of the Internal Revenue Code to give the IRS additional tools to collect specified amounts of tax, not debt, and the program is thus distinguishable from other debt collection programs in the Federal Government. 
   To quote from the Internal Revenue Code, Section 6306(b)(1)(B) defines a qualified tax collection contract as one in which the contractor requests a ``full payment from such taxpayer of an amount of Federal tax specified by the Secretary.'' 
   Legislative history of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 further bears this out. Citing the Joint Committee on Taxation's general explanation of tax legislation enacted in the 108th Congress, the provision's intent is to ``locate and contact taxpayers owing outstanding tax liabilities of any type and to arrange payment of those taxes by the taxpayers. There must be an assessment pursuant to Section 6201 in order for there to be an outstanding tax liability. An assessment is the formal recording the taxpayer's tax liability that fixes the amount payable.'' 
   When authorizing the program, the Congress was specifically attempting to address a category of uncollected taxes, taxes that Congress believed could be more efficiently collected through the use of qualified tax collection contracts. To put it simply, the Congress felt that the IRS's existing authority should be augmented in order to increase tax compliance and tax collection. 
   Current estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, direct correspondence in both writing and recent congressional testimony from the IRS, and even the CBO baseline, indicate that the program is succeeding in collecting additional tax revenues, just as Congress had anticipated, and in excess of the tax revenues collected prior to enactment of Section 6306 of the Internal Revenue Code. Empirical evidence is clear: Enactment of section 106 would inevitably lead to a reduction in the collection of taxes. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the IRS plans to spend $15 million to administer this program in 2007. This has already led to the collection of $20 million in tax revenue in this fiscal year. For fiscal year 2008, the IRS requested $7.35 million in discretionary appropriations to administer the program. In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury, by the authority granted in Section 6306 of the Internal Revenue Code, is allowed to retain 25 percent of the taxes collected under the qualified tax collection contract. In fiscal year 2008, the IRS expects to retain $15 million with this authority. 
   Clearly, if section 106 of this bill is enacted, the broad reference to ``any other Act'' will eliminate the Secretary's authority to retain the taxes collected by the program that are necessary to run the program and collect additional taxes. In addition, a more than 95 percent decrease in funding would occur as a result of the limitation in section 106, and that would have the same effect as reducing the funding to zero. The CBO estimates that it expects the program to collect $80 million in fiscal year 2008, and the Joint Committee on Taxation expects section 106 to reduce revenues in 2008 by $69 million. 
   To substantiate this point and to illustrate that section 106 of H.R. 2829 restricts the ability of the IRS to collect taxes, I refer to a letter I received from the Joint Committee on Taxation: ``Section 6306 of the Internal Revenue Code enacted in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, authorizes the IRS to enter into qualified tax collection contracts with private debt collection companies to locate and contact taxpayers owing outstanding tax liabilities and to arrange for the payment of those tax liabilities.'' 
   The letter goes on to say, ``Under section 106 of H.R. 2829, not more than $1 million of the funds made available in this or any other Act may be used to enter into, renew, extend, administer, implement, enforce, provide oversight of or make any payment related to any qualified tax collection contract. We interpreted this language as a broad restriction on the use of any funds available to the IRS for administering the private debt collection program, including not only appropriated funds but also funds the IRS is permitted to retain under Section 6306. 
   ``Because section 106 of H.R. 2829 prohibits the IRS from using any more than $1 million to operate the private debt collection program, which is significantly less than the projected amount of expenditures required by the IRS to operate the program, we expect that operation of the program would cease if the provision were enacted.'' 
   The Joint Committee goes on to provide a revenue estimate that details the annual loss of revenue to the Treasury. They estimate that H.R. 2829 would reduce revenues by $69 million in 2008, $507 million over the fiscal years 2008 through 2012, and by $1.086 billion over the fiscal years 2008 through 2017. 
   Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against Section 106 of this bill.

   Jim Nussle is a passionate man. He strongly believes that we are sent to Washington to be good stewards for taxpayers, and he was one of their best advocates. Under Jim's leadership of the Budget Committee, and for the first time in nearly a decade, we took a first step in reforming our mandatory, or entitlement, spending, the largest and least sustainable part of our budget, saving taxpayers nearly $40 billion over the next years. 
   Jim also worked to reform the budget process itself and reached across the aisle to develop a bipartisan solution. He coauthored the Comprehensive Budget Process Reform Act in 1988 with Representative Ben Cardin. He has also supported the legislative line item veto and earmark reform. 
   Given his experience, knowledge and commitment to public service, it is fitting that the President has selected Jim as his nominee for Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said earlier this afternoon, we in the minority want to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. Our motion to recommit, which we will offer later today, will do that.  
   SCHIP should be about a bipartisan program. We think it should focus on low-income children. That was the concept when both parties agreed to create this program back in 1997. But the bill that is on the floor today loses sight of that focus, and, therefore, we cannot support it. 
   We could support it with significant changes. Unfortunately, the Rules Committee did not allow us the opportunity to offer amendments to change the bill, so we are left to our only device as the minority, and that is a motion to recommit. So that motion will act as kind of a sum of our amendments that we would have offered and hoped to have passed, to put the bill in a form that we hope will pass in a bipartisan manner. 
   The bill that is before us today, though, without amendment raises taxes by at least $54 billion. We believe it raises those taxes to fund a massive expansion of government-controlled health care. This is not just about helping low-income children. This bill today seems to be spending government funds to lower middle-class, upper middle-class, even wealthy, perhaps, families to opt out of private health coverage and go to government health coverage. 
   I regret that we have not been able to work together in a bipartisan fashion on this issue. Perhaps when this motion to recommit comes up, we will have enough converts to adopt it, bring it right back to the floor of the House, and we will have a bipartisan bill. Or perhaps if this bill passes and something like it comes back to us in the form of a conference report and the President vetoes it and we sustain the veto, then we will have a chance to operate on a bipartisan basis and reauthorize this program in a timely manner. I hope so. 
   But this bill before us today, in addition to having a substantial increase on the tobacco tax, they try to hide, at least it appeared that the majority tried to hide, a secret tax increase on health insurance plans. 
   When it came before the Ways and Means Committee, we did have a markup. We did have the opportunity to explore this bill, at least the part that was in the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. We discovered this tax increase. It wasn't in the Joint Tax score of the bill. It wasn't listed as a revenue raiser in their report. We asked CBO. They couldn't tell us about it, but we discovered it in the fine print. It is a tax on health insurance policies. 
   Well, what is that going to do? It is going to raise the cost of private health insurance. Maybe that is what the majority wants, to raise the cost of private health insurance, to drive even more people from private insurance into government health care. 
   This new tax is going to generate money sufficient to accumulate to about a $3 billion pot of money over the next 10 years. That is a substantial sum of money. And, as we have seen from past experience, a tax like this, while it may not be big at first, it is awfully hard to get rid of, and it is awfully easy to increase. 
   This legislation also cuts Medicare funding by about $200 billion. It effectively eliminates the Medicare Advantage program. Now, I know the majority is going to say no, no, no, it doesn't cut Medicare by $20 billion. We add back some Medicare benefits, so the net is not nearly that much. 
   But for the people whose programs are going to be cut, they see it as a cut. They don't understand this ``net'' thing. Medicare Advantage is going to be cut substantially, and Medicare Advantage programs will go away in most rural parts of this country and in a great many inner-city areas serving low-income populations. This bill would effectively eliminate options for millions of seniors who have depended on Medicare Advantage to get better benefits and lower costs for their health care. 
   In addition, the bill cuts $7.2 billion in home health care benefits and $6.5 billion in nursing home care benefits. These are cuts that are real. They are going to be felt by people utilizing those services. 
   These cuts are not necessary. I want to stress, these cuts are not necessary to cover needy children. The majority has deliberately chosen to reduce Medicare funding for some of our neediest seniors in order to expand SCHIP to cover anyone up to the age of 21, including, I have heard here today, people up to 300 percent of poverty, 400 percent of poverty. 
   I would tell my colleagues that have said that, they are wrong. This bill doesn't say you can go up to 300 percent or 400 percent of poverty. It says you can go anywhere you want to. You can cover anybody. If a State chooses under this bill, they can not only choose to cover people of unlimited income, $100,000, $150,000, $200,000. They are entitled to the money. 
   There is also a bonus program in this bill that says if you get a new enrollee, a new child, maybe he comes from having private insurance, maybe he doesn't, but if he is new to this program, you are going to get a bonus, which means you are going to get an even higher Federal share to fund that new enrollee. 
   The State can waive the income eligibility as high as they want. So we create a new entitlement program that guarantees States they can get as much money as they want to cover anybody they want under their government health care program. That is what this bill is all about. That is why the minority is intent on stopping its passage today and getting a better alternative for reauthorization for low-income children. 
   This bill is about expanding government health care. Nothing more, nothing less. The minority's motion to recommit will reauthorize the SCHIP program in its bipartisan form. I urge all of us to wait until that motion comes up, vote for that, and then we will truly have a good program for low-income children in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Perhaps if we had had a hearing on this bill, we could have discovered what the truth is about this discussion of waivers and State plan amendments. 
   But our appreciation of the law is that this is not a waiver. I'm not talking about a waiver so it does not have to be approved by the administration. I am talking about a State plan amendment that is simply presented to the administration and it can contain what is known as an income disregard. The attorneys with CMS tell us that the administration does not have the discretion to turn down an income disregard that is presented by a State. 
   What an income disregard means, in essence, is a State can cover kids from families as rich as they want. And that is our understanding of the law. It is too bad we didn't have, or at least the Energy and Commerce Committee didn't have, a full-blown hearing on this provision or other provisions of the bill so we could have explored that.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, in a continuing dialogue with the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, at least in the manager's amendment presented to the Ways and Means Committee during markup on page 10, this is under section 101 of our bill, it states: if a State's expenditures, under this title, exceed the total amount with allotments available, and if the average number of children enrolled under the State plan exceeds its target average number of such enrollees, the allotment under this section shall be increased. Not may, shall. That is an entitlement to the States for as much money as they want for this program. It is no wonder, I would say to my good friend from Illinois, that the Governors are for this. Duh. 
   And with that, I yield 2 1/2 minutes to a distinguished member of the committee, Mr. Cantor.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, before I recognize our next speaker, I want to point out two things. Number one, there has been a couple of references to this child who died because of a tooth problem. According to the Washington Post story, I don't know this, but according to the Washington Post story, this child was actually on Medicaid. He was covered by Medicaid. But because so few dentists in that State accepted Medicaid patients because of the poor quality of the Medicaid program, this child didn't get access. But he was covered. 
   I don't see how it's relevant to the discussion we are having on SCHIP. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to a distinguished member of the Ways and Means committee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I think this has been a good debate today. It has been a good debate in part because I believe a number of Members on both sides of the aisle have learned things about this legislation that they didn't know before this debate. I think there are enough questions that were raised today about exactly what is and is not in this bill to warrant this House taking more time to get it right. 
   The motion to recommit that we will offer in just a few minutes will give this House that opportunity because we in the motion to recommit ask the committee to report back forthwith, which means that this House can today pass what is in our motion to recommit. And in that motion to recommit we will reauthorize the current SCHIP program for 1 year, and we will do a fix for the doctors' reimbursement for 1 year. That will allow this House to give the appropriate amount of time to discover what is and what is not in this legislation that the majority has presented us today and figure out, perhaps in a bipartisan way, the best manner in which to proceed on a long-term basis with the SCHIP program. 
   I would ask those fiscal conservatives in the majority, some of whom have in good conscience complained about some of the actions of the former majority, there are signs in the hall talking about the national debt, and I ask those Members to think before they vote for this bill. Do they really want to establish a new entitlement program that is open-ended in this country, that is not properly funded? It is funded with a tobacco tax. That is going to be a decreasing source of revenue for this country, not increasing. It is funded with changes to the Medicare program, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. That is not going to have long-  lasting consequences? So, really, I want those people who are concerned about the deficit and concerned about the debt to think before they vote for this bill. 
   We are giving you an opportunity in the motion to recommit to sustain the SCHIP program, do what you've talked about doing, fix the doctors' reimbursement for a year, and give us more time to talk back and forth a little bit and explore the consequences of some of the provisions that are in this bill that we think would do injury to the fitness of this country, and we think that we can work together to provide a better way for insuring children in this country, not the way that is in this bill. 
   I believe that this bill is fiscally irresponsible. It is too bad we didn't have fuller hearings and fuller opportunities in committees, in both the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, to explore some of the particulars that the majority decided to put into this bill and just informed the House about within the last 24 hours or so. 
   Had we had that opportunity, I believe Members with goodwill on both sides of the aisle could have worked out what I believe would have been a much, much better bill than what I perceive to be a hastily put together bill that is before us today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I am only going to make one point during my brief remarks, and then I am going to ask unanimous consent to turn over the time for allocation of time to Mr. Camp. 
   The point that I want to make is that the President's veto will be sustained, and that should allow the opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to sit down in this House and listen to each other as far as how we can reach a compromise on this important legislation. 
   I was a Member of the House back in 1996 when we passed welfare reform for the third time. We had a Republican majority and a Democratic President. The Democratic President vetoed welfare reform twice. Basically, he told us, the majority Republicans, Look, I want Democrats to be at the table to try to get a compromise on this important legislation. That is what ultimately occurred. The President signed welfare reform on the third try. Then, in 1997, we had the Balanced Budget Act. There were considerable Medicare reforms in that act. President Clinton said the same thing. He said, Look, I want Democrats at the table. We allowed them to the table. I was in the room when Democrats, Republicans and a member of the Clinton administration sat down together to hash out the details, very nitty-gritty details, of the Medicare portion of the BBA. 
   That is what should happen now with SCHIP. SCHIP was passed in 1997, as part of that 1997 effort, as a bipartisan effort. It should remain a bipartisan initiative. Unfortunately, the minority in this House and in the House of Representatives was excluded from the outset from discussions regarding the SCHIP legislation. The Senate, yes, had more of a bipartisan discussion. We were never included in that discussion, either. So we think we deserve, and I think the President thinks we deserve, a seat at the table to discuss this very important issue. I hope that is what finally emerges from this veto. 
   I don't know why the majority wants to postpone the override vote for over 2 weeks. It just doesn't make sense to me if you want to get this done in a rational, reasonable manner this calendar year. It seems to me you would want to have the override vote immediately so we could get right on with the business of trying to compromise and give the President something that he could sign. I don't know why they are not doing that. But, in any event, at the end of this road when we sustain the veto, I am very hopeful that the majority now will act as the majority back in 1996 and 1997 did and give us all a seat at the table so we can work this out. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I would ask unanimous consent that Mr. Camp be allowed to allocate the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to address a couple of issues that have been mentioned here today a number of times. 
   The first is this issue of subsidies. Several speakers have said we need to end this subsidy to the oil and gas industry. Well, the so-called subsidy that's being ended in this bill is the section 199 provision that applies to all manufacturers in the United States. It was designed to make American manufacturers more competitive and to create jobs here in this country. What this bill does is it excepts from all manufacturers only the oil and gas industry, so it's punitive to the oil and gas industry. It's not removing some special subsidy. It's taking away from only the oil and gas a general deduction for all manufacturers in the United States. So much for these special subsidies that we keep hearing about. 
   The next thing I would like to talk about is the issue of profits. My good friend, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, earlier in this debate said, at the beginning of the Bush administration, profits of the five biggest oil companies in America were $30 billion; at the end of the Bush administration, the profits are $100 billion. 
   Well, guess what? At the beginning of the Bush administration, the biggest five oil companies in this country, American oil companies, invested in exploration, research, and development, trying to find sources of energy for this country, about $40 billion, more than the profits that they had in that year. And that investment, over the term of the Bush administration, has grown to this last year almost $100 billion. So you can say, ladies and gentlemen, that the profits that have been so denigrated here by some today moved pretty much in parallel with the level of investment of our American companies to find new sources of energy to help us meet our energy needs in this country. That's reality. 
   All this hocus-pocus about renewable fuels and sun, that's swell, but it is a drop in the bucket of what we need to operate this country today and for the foreseeable future. 
   So if you want a reasonable, well-balanced energy policy, this bill is certainly not the answer. This bill is part of the answer because it pretty much continues the bill that we passed several years ago when we were in control of this Chamber, but it makes a bad mistake when it punishes. It doesn't remove some special subsidy. It punishes just the oil and gas industry for only American companies. That is wrongheaded. It will result in higher prices at the gasoline pump. It's spiteful and it's wrong. And we ought not to pass this bill and get busy passing a true comprehensive energy policy for this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I'm pleased that the chairman and I have forged a good working relationship. That relationship has allowed us to work together on several important issues, including trade and some tax bills. Just last week, for example, I stood on the floor and joined with the vast majority of Members on both sides of the aisle to approve a bill helping relieve homeowners of the tax burden that comes with having a mortgage written down or foreclosed. 
   But the chairman and I know that there are times when we will not agree, and today is just such an occasion. The central feature of this bill is a repeal of a program at the Internal Revenue Service that allows the service to contract with private collection agencies, known as PCAs, to secure payment of unpaid taxes from individuals who have admitted they owe the government money, but simply have not actually paid the money. 
   It's true, as the majority likes to argue, that the IRS's own taxpayer advocate has urged Congress to repeal the PCA program. But some of her reasons are a bit suspect. For example, her report criticized the use of private collection agencies because, by doing so, ``the IRS has separated taxpayers from its world class customer service.'' 
   And while I agree that IRS employees are competent, hardworking public servants, and I commend them for the job they do, surely the person who wrote that did so with tongue firmly planted in cheek. After all, how many of us, in conversations with our constituents, have heard from them that the IRS is known for their customer service? 
   More importantly, though, IRS reviews of the PCA program show that customer service satisfaction with those PCA programs is, in fact, very high. In their comments on the taxpayer advocate's report, the IRS noted that ``of the nearly 19,000 cases assigned to PCAs, only 108 taxpayers have requested that their accounts be handled by the IRS. There have been 31 reported contractual complaints, all of which have been reviewed in depth. There have been no instances of fraud or misuse of taxpayer information.'' 
   That record is not surprising, considering the extensive training PCA employees receive and the limited information they are provided. That, I should point out, stands in sharp contrast to the many documented lapses of the IRS in protecting confidential taxpayer information. 
   Program opponents often suggest that there is something intrinsic about tax collection that should preclude it being contracted out to the private sector. This argument is hard to reconcile with a few basic facts. 
   First, the PCAs are not adjudicating tax liability. They are merely helping to ensure the government receives the amounts the individuals have already admitted they owe in taxes but have not paid. 
   Second, PCAs are used throughout the Federal Government to collect unpaid obligations. According to the IRS, since 1982, PCAs have been used by various branches of the Federal Government, collecting nearly $700 million in fiscal year 2005 alone. 
   Third, of the 43 States with a personal income tax, the vast majority of those use private agencies to help collect from delinquent taxpayers. 
   A hearing on this issue showed the members of the committee the skill and patience PCA employees use to avoid disclosing any confidential taxpayer information.     
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, I would urge the PCA program be modified to provide these contractors with additional tools that will both improve their recovery rate and reduce the possibility of taxpayer confusion about the purpose of calls and letters from the PCAs. 
   Even though these agencies lack many of the tools of the IRS, such as lien and levy, they are successfully collecting millions of dollars in unpaid taxes that the IRS has not and very likely would not ever get around to collecting. 
   The majority will no doubt argue that the cost to the taxpayers would be even less if the IRS went after these obligations. But the fact is they are not, and any such comparisons are apples to oranges. The IRS is currently ill-equipped to engage in the massive outbound call operation the PCAs use to collect these obligations. 
   In the first year of the program's operation, more than 90,000 cases have been placed with the PCAs. More than 7,300 have resulted in full payment, and more than 2,600 taxpayers have entered into installment agreements. The PCAs have already collected $32 million in gross revenue that would not have been collected otherwise, making this a tax-gap closing program with a proven track record. The Joint Tax Committee estimates that killing this program will result in the loss of over $1 billion in revenue over the coming decade. 
   Considering the difficulty of meeting the terms of PAYGO, it's rather disappointing that the majority would actually find it necessary to raise taxes elsewhere in order to terminate a program that is helping to close the tax gap. In fact, during committee markup, members of the Ways and Means Committee suggested a number of ways to use the money that the majority is spending today by killing this program, including delaying the implementation of a withholding rule on Federal contractors or providing penalty relief to taxpayers who are underwithholding their 2007 taxes because they are unaware of the coming hit of the AMT, which the majority has yet to pass, but I'm sure that we will get around to that. Unfortunately, those amendments were rejected on party-line votes in the committee, and, of course, we are not being given a chance to vote on those today in this House. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Brady and ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control that time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the bill before us today, just as I did the last time this bill was on the floor. It is not exactly the same, but basically it is a bill that would patch, so to speak, the AMT, and then increase other taxes to the same amount as the baseline says the patch costs. 
   Let me make one thing clear. Republicans are for patching the AMT, a 1-year patch on the AMT. We are for, in other words, freezing the AMT in place just as it is today or just as it was for the last tax year. Where we differ with the majority, at least so far, is over the question of whether we need to, quote, pay for the patch by raising other taxes. We have had this debate before on this floor. We know where this debate is headed. 
   The President's budget, by the way, includes a 1-year patch on the AMT without a pay-for. So that should be made clear to everyone, and that is what we have been proposing for quite some time. That is what the Senate passed by a rather large vote very recently. In fact, 88-5 I believe was the vote that the Senate passed a 1-year patch without tax increases. I applaud that action of the Senate. It does what the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and I as the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, and the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee wrote in a letter to the President several weeks ago saying that we promised to pass a 1-year patch on the AMT in a manner that the President would sign. The Senate bill represents that promise. This President has said he will sign that bill. The President has said he won't sign the bill that is before us today. In fact, the distinguished majority leader of the Senate is so intent on not paying for the AMT that he is refusing to send the bill to the House right now so as not to give the majority here another opportunity to load it up with doomed tax increases. Yet our friends on the majority are once again pulling on their helmets and fastening their chin straps, ready to run into the brick wall of using tax hikes to prevent other tax increases. The whole thing would be comical if the implications were not so serious. 
   In recent weeks, the Treasury Secretary, the Acting Commissioner of the IRS, and the chairman of the IRS oversight board have all written to Congress to urge prompt action on the AMT and warned that continued delay on the patch will result in delayed refunds, confusion, and higher costs to the Treasury. In a recent letter, Secretary Paulson cautioned that ``enactment of a patch in mid to late December could delay issuance of approximately $75 billion in refunds to taxpayers who are likely to file their returns before March 31, 2008. Millions of taxpayers filing returns after that date may also have their refunds delayed.'' Well, here we are now in mid-December and, unfortunately, the majority in the House continues to play a dangerous game of chicken with the American taxpayer and the clock is winding down. 
   When the House debated H.R. 3996 last month, Republicans argued against applying PAYGO to the AMT patch. We pointed out that if Congress has to increase taxes to prevent a tax increase, then the majority's baseline has baked in trillions of dollars of tax increases over the next decade as the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts reach their current expiration dates at the end of 2010. 
   The majority's logic seems to go like this: To prevent a tax increase, we must enact a tax increase. Either way it's a tax increase, unless you do as we're suggesting, which is to prevent the tax increase by just patching and freezing the AMT in place as we did last year and the year before. 
   The House Democrats' version of PAYGO forces Congress to decide whether we will let those tax increases take place or replace them with other tax hikes. But no matter how Congress chooses to raise taxes, if we follow that, we will face the largest tax increase in American history both in nominal and real terms. Moreover, in many ways PAYGO has shown itself to be a farce. 
   In January, when the new majority instituted PAYGO, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that revenues in fiscal year 2007 would total $2.542 trillion. Actual revenues for 2007 turned out to be $26 billion higher than that. Does the majority plan to return these excess receipts to the taxpayer? No. It's just soaked up by more spending. 
   Similarly, in January of 2007, the CBO estimated that revenues in fiscal  year 2008 would be $2.72 trillion but recently revised that figure upwards by just over $50 billion, almost exactly the same amount that this ``AMT'' costs. Does the majority plan to return this money to the taxpayers, or maybe even credit that against the higher revenues envisioned by the baseline? No. How about crediting it to the AMT patch? No. They are going to pay for it all over again.     
   As Monday's Wall Street Journal editorial points out, ``PAYGO has been nothing but a confidence game from the very start. PAYGO doesn't apply to domestic discretionary spending. It doesn't restrain spending increases under current law in entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid. Its main goals are to make tax cutting all but impossible while letting Democrats pretend to favor fiscal discipline. The 2003 tax cuts expire in 2010 and PAYGO will make them all but impossible to extend.'' 
   The President and the Senate have made clear that they do not intend to raise taxes to prevent a tax increase. The bill we are considering today only further delays final resolution of this issue, increasing cost to the treasury and increasing confusion for taxpayers and the IRS. I urge defeat of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, several of the speakers on the majority side have said that this bill provides tax relief for 23 million middle-class taxpayers. That is simply not correct, at least not in the common sense of that term. 
   If you ask somebody on the street, a taxpayer, if you pay the same amount in taxes this year as you paid last year, is that tax relief? No. They're paying the same in taxes. That's all this bill does. Doesn't give them any relief. If you ask that person on the street, if you pay more in taxes this year than you paid last year, is that a tax increase? Yes. We're trying to prevent 23 million taxpayers from getting a tax increase. We're not giving them tax relief. We're preventing a tax increase. 
   So why on Earth, to prevent that tax increase, should we increase taxes on somebody else? It just doesn't make sense, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time, to further elucidate that point and others, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, some of the Members of the majority who seem to be so sincere about not borrowing any more money are the same people that are voting for appropriations bills that exceed what we spent last year plus inflation. So they don't seem to be worried about borrowing more money to spend on goodness knows what. And they're not suggesting yet that we just wipe out all the deficit and thereby prevent any more borrowing by raising taxes totally to do away with the deficit. So we're just talking about a degree of  adding to the debt, little here, little there. If we do it by spending, it's okay. If we let a tax increase take place to get the deficit down, that's okay. 
   Well, I think that pretty well defines one of the differences between the two parties in this House. We don't want to increase taxes to balance the budget. We'd rather reduce spending. We'd rather hold the line on spending, nondefense discretionary at least and nonhomeland security discretionary. We don't want to solve the deficit by increasing taxes; whereas, the majority is content to raise spending to increase the debt, and then the only way they want to address the debt is to increase taxes. 
   That's a pretty clear demarcation, Mr. Speaker, of the philosophies of the two parties, and it's become quite apparent as this year has progressed. 
   Fortunately, the majority, which was then the minority, voted with us the last time we had a freestanding AMT patch, with no pay-for. The now-majority who was there then voted overwhelming with us to do exactly what we're suggesting we now do and what the other body has already passed. 
   Mr. Speaker, that's the clear resolution of this problem. I beg the majority, let's don't delay this anymore. Don't cost the taxpayers anymore. Don't make the IRS send another set of forms to the printer. Don't delay the refunds of millions, maybe as many as 50 million taxpayers. That wouldn't be right for our inaction. 
   So let's get this off the floor. I don't have any more speakers. Let's vote, get this done, and then we can get on to really solving the problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Oregon bringing up the fact that President Clinton vetoed the repeal of the AMT back in 1999 when we were in the majority. We did indeed repeal the AMT, only to have that vetoed by President Clinton. 
   However, the gentleman went on to say that for the last few years we did nothing and accepted all the revenues. That's simply not the case. We put a patch on the AMT every year, just like we're proposing to do this year. The President's budget does not assume the revenues from the AMT increase in this fiscal year.

   Reclaiming my time, yes, this legislation deals with tax year 2007. If we do nothing, the AMT goes into effect for tax year 2007. The President's budget says for tax year 2007 there should be a patch, a freeze on the AMT so that it doesn't affect additional taxpayers, and he does not call for the revenues in his budget.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The gentleman on the Ways and Means Committee who just spoke claimed that I was being disingenuous. I'm sorry if my remarks were interpreted as being disingenuous. I don't mean to be. I was simply trying to stick to the substance of the legislation before us, which deals with the AMT as it applies to tax year 2007. And with respect to that tax year, the President's budget simply does not, as has been suggested by some Members on the other side, assume revenues from an increase in the AMT. It simply doesn't. 
   Now, the gentleman is correct, and I would love to debate this at the appropriate time, but the gentleman from  New Jersey is certainly correct that from 2008 to 2017, the President's budget does, indeed, assume revenues from an increase in the AMT. However, the President's budget also assumes making permanent the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. So you have to weigh all that together, and when you do, you get a fairly level percent of GDP, around 18.5 percent of GDP, coming into the government in the form of revenues. Under the majority's PAYGO rules, if continued to be applied, and I hope they're not, we would see revenues as a percent of GDP rise by 2017 to 20.1 percent of GDP. So there's a big difference between the PAYGO rules of the majority and what the President has proposed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I do not believe it is the intent of clause 10 of rule XXI to require tax increases to pay for preventing scheduled tax increases. That is precisely what we are debating on this point of order. 
   If the Chair determines that this motion violates rule XXI and the House sustains this ruling, then the House is endorsing more than $3 trillion of tax increases over the next 10 years. 
   PAYGO, as a budget enforcement law between 1990 and 2002, as the majority leader referred to, required automatic spending reductions across the government when budget targets were not met. Rule XXI, should it apply to this motion, is a very, very different PAYGO. It would prevent any Member from offering an amendment that prevents a tax increase without another tax increase. I would understand, and even strongly support, an interpretation of rule XXI that had the effect of requiring spending reductions to offset increases in spending. 
   Further, while I would not necessarily endorse it, I could understand a PAYGO interpretation that requires a spending cut or tax increase to offset any reduction in current tax rates, or an increase in any current tax deductions or credits; but that is not what we're dealing with here today, Mr. Speaker. Today, with my motion, we are simply maintaining the Federal Government's current take, so to speak, from the people. 
   Current individual tax rates and policies have largely been in place as they are since 2003 and have led to sustained increases in revenue to the Federal Government. In fact, the annualized increases over the last 3 years have been 14.6 percent, 11.7 percent and 6.7 percent. 
   Even if my motion passes and is eventually enacted, we will again see increased revenue, it is projected, to the Federal Government next year. Those who wish to apply PAYGO to my  motion, those who wish to object to my motion, are advocating very clearly that they want to lock in not only the largest revenue take in history, but also the largest tax increase in history. These tax increases will lead the government to collect more than 20 percent of GDP from its citizens by the end of the decade, and far higher in the years that follow. These tax increases will be of such a dramatic magnitude that they threaten to bring our economy to its knees and render it uncompetitive in the global marketplace. 
   The motion I have offered contains no new spending, no new tax cuts. Instead, it simply prevents a tax increase. That, I submit, is not what rule XXI was designed to prevent. And I urge the speaker to reject the point of order.

   Mr. McCRERY.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan bill that has been crafted in the Ways and Means Committee, and I want to commend the chairman and his staff for working with me and our staff on the minority side of the committee to craft a bill that really does effectively target tax relief to those businesses who will be most impacted by an increase in the minimum wage. 
   This bill I think does a much better job of focusing that relief on those businesses than the other body came up with in their version of this legislation. 
   It is apparent to me, Mr. Speaker, that the Congress will increase the minimum wage sometime this year. And with that in mind, I did my best to work with Chairman Rangel and his staff to create a soft landing for those businesses that are going to be impacted by that increase in the minimum wage immediately. Mainly, we are talking about restaurant owners, small businesses, those people who have more minimum wage workers on the premises than other businesses. So the provisions in this bill get right to those particular businesses, these provisions do. 
   The tip credit, for example. The FICA tip credit, Mr. Speaker, provision in this bill is very important for a couple reasons. Number one, if we don't pass a provision like that and the minimum wage is increased, these employers will automatically be mandated to pay an increase in wages. That will be number one. That will hit them right away. But, number two, they will lose a tip credit for FICA taxes paid on the amount between the current minimum wage and the new minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25. So it will be a double whammy on these small businesses that have these employees that depend on tips for part of their income. 
   And that is why, Mr. Speaker, if you look at the joint tax scoring sheet on this, it says no revenue effect; because, taken in isolation, this provision has no impact. But if you join the minimum wage increase with this bill, which we all know is going to be done, then this ``no revenue effect'' becomes approximately a $500 million tax cut. So the effect of this bill would be a net tax reduction for businesses. 
   Now, when we go to conference, if we get to conference and we get a bill, and we know that this impact is going to be there, then under the rules of the House we will have come up with a way to pay for that tax cut. But as it is right now, the net effect of this bill would be a $500 million tax cut. 
   The other provisions, the work opportunity tax credit is not only extended but it is also expanded to apply to veterans. We think that is a very good expansion of what is already a good provision in the Tax Code to encourage people to hire people who have been on welfare, who have been disabled, and now veterans. 
   And the other provisions, Mr. Speaker, extended expensing for small businesses. We increase that to $125,000, we increase the phaseout from $400,000 to $500,000. That is going to help small businesses immediately, because some of those have reached the cap for their expensing. But when this passes, they will get an expansion of that amount. So they will get an immediate tax benefit this year. 
   In addition, we for the first time allow taxpayers to claim these credits against the AMT, so that the AMT doesn't take back what we are giving them in this legislation. 
   So all in all, Mr. Speaker, these are very effectively crafted provisions to help small businesses who are going to be negatively impacted by an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (SMALL BUSINESS LENDING IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, the motion to recommit that I am offering makes an important point about how we treat small businesses, the engine that drives much of our economy and creates many of our jobs in this country. 
   The underlying bill makes permanent the Community Express Program, which provides loans up to $250,000 to businesses which are owned by certain favored groups such as women, minorities, veterans, or socially or economically disadvantaged individuals. The measure does not define what it means for a business owner to be ``economically disadvantaged.'' 
   This would require that the Small Business Administration would consider as economically disadvantaged those business owners that can demonstrate that they have been adversely impacted by an increase in the Federal minimum wage. 
   The importance of this motion is clear in the face of the failure of this House and the conferees on the supplemental appropriations bill that will be considered later tonight to adequately provide tax relief to those small businesses most impacted by an increase in the minimum wage. 
   The agreement reached by the majority and inserted into the supplemental does provide a larger dollar figure for relief than was passed by the House earlier this year, but almost none of the added tax revenues will provide relief to the small businesses most in need of assistance because of the increase in the minimum wage. 
   For example, more than 53 percent of the tax relief is in the form of a 44-month extension of the work opportunity tax credit. While extending the work opportunity tax credit may be good policy, and I happen to like that credit, more than 90 percent of the credits are claimed by firms with gross receipts over $50 million, hardly small businesses. 
   Other provisions, while well intentioned, will have little or no impact on small businesses. The S-Corp reforms, which costs almost $1 billion, have no direct relation to firms impacted by the minimum wage. 
   I support the changes in the package to the low income housing tax credit, but that $237 million in tax relief, again, does nothing towards satisfying the stated purpose of helping small businesses cope with the increase in the minimum wage. 
   While the work opportunity tax credit was expanded and was given a longer extension than in the House-passed package, provisions to help small businesses by increasing expensing were not given similar treatment. Other depreciation changes included in the Senate-passed bill that could have helped small businesses were completely left out of the conference agreement. In fact, barely $1 billion of the total almost $5 billion package provides relief to small businesses; and almost half of that, $457 million of it, exists solely to protect restaurant owners from the tax increase they would otherwise face from a minimum wage increase. Thus, only about one-eighth of the new benefits are targeted at small businesses. 
   That minimal relief for small businesses looks even smaller when compared against the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that the increase in the minimum wage will impose more than $16 billion in costs on the private sector over the next 5 years. 
   It should come as no surprise to anyone to learn that the National Federation of Independent Business, a small business association, released a statement today criticizing Congress for failing to deliver meaningful tax relief to the American small business community in the face of a mandated Federal minimum wage hike. 
   I submit for printing in the Record the entire statement of NFIB. 
   Tax Package Tied to Minimum Wage Hike Fails To Deliver Relief for Small Business  
   Washington, D.C., April 25, 2007--Dan Danner, executive vice president of the National Federation of Independent Business, today made the following statement in reaction to the reduced small-business tax-relief package contained in the federal minimum wage increase legislation, now attached to the Iraq spending bill. 
   It's truly disheartening that during National Small Business Week Congress has decided to renege on their promise to deliver meaningful tax relief to the American small-business community in the face of a mandated federal minimum wage hike. 
   While small businesses appreciate the increased and extended expensing limit, the tax package as a whole simply does not offer enough growth-oriented tax relief to allow small businesses to invest and stay competitive. NFIB is disappointed to see that the reduced tax package falls short of truly offsetting the costs small businesses will be forced to absorb as a result of a minimum wage increase. 
   Small-business owners have always opposed mandated wage levels because it leaves them with fewer choices in how they compensate their employees. But in the face of an inevitable wage hike, the small-business community was pleased to hear that Congress was planning to offer a tax package aimed at helping small businesses cope with additional labor costs. 
   From the beginning of this debate, the accompanying tax package was supposed to be about helping the country's small businesses. Instead, Congress has spent more time catering to big business demands than providing real tax relief to those who need it most--American small-business owners. 
   As this debate continues, NFIB will continue its efforts to educate members of Congress about why small businesses need and deserve meaningful tax relief.  
   Last week my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, indicated that the tax package on the supplemental was the final deal. I suppose he meant the final deal on taxes associated with the minimum wage increase. And I guess he meant that, even if the supplemental is vetoed, that we don't go back to square one, that there will still be no renegotiation of the tax package. That is unfortunate, and that is what brings us here today. 
   The majority has said it is unwilling to reconsider ways to ensure that we provide tax relief to the businesses most in need and to examine the shortcomings of the tax package. Thus, we must find other ways to help small businesses continue to be the engines of job creation in our economy. By making small businesses adversely affected by a minimum wage increase eligible for the community express program, Madam Speaker, we are offering the House an opportunity, a chance, to make good on the promise to help those businesses impacted by an increase of the minimum wage. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the motion.     
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I withdraw my point of order against the motion, and I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (EXPAND OIL PRODUCTION -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I was driving my 14-year-old son to school this morning, listening to the radio, and it mentioned that the price of oil had increased to over $130 a barrel. My son said, Dad, why don't we just tell OPEC to produce more oil? I thought about it and I said, Well, son, as a matter of fact, President Bush was over in Saudi Arabia the other day and asked if Saudi Arabia would increase its output. 
   But I suspect that the leaders of OPEC might turn that question around on the United States and say, Why doesn't the United States increase its output of oil? 
   The answer is Democrats have blocked every commonsense effort to expand production in this country for years now, and it's time for that opposition to stop and face reality. We need a balanced energy program in this country, one that recognizes that for the immediate future we are going to need oil and gas, and, yes, we need to develop alternative fuel sources as well. But you can't do just one. You have to do both.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the legislation before us today and urge all of my colleagues to vote against it today. 
   Most critically, the bill claims to be a package of tax extenders, but fails to deal with the biggest and most pressing extender in the code, the AMT patch, the alternative minimum tax patch. This is a missed opportunity. We should have included that in this bill of other expiring provisions in the code. 
   The majority's failure to extend this patch for 2008 would mean an additional 21 million--mostly middle class--individuals and families would be ensnared by the alternative minimum tax. As a result, affected families will pay an additional $61.5 billion in taxes for this year. This oversight--this neglect, I think--is the single largest flaw in the bill. 
   The majority, I'm sure, will claim during today's debate, just as they did during committee markup, that they will address the AMT before adjourning this year, just not now. Surely our experience from 2007, when the AMT patch wasn't enacted until the day after Christmas, suggests that maybe we ought to begin acting on this now and not just run down the shot clock. Mr. Speaker, it simply does not make sense to vote to extend dozens of tax provisions, some for several years, without also dealing with the biggest and most far-reaching expiring provision, the AMT patch. 
   The bill also clings to the mistaken view that the House's PAYGO rules require us to raise taxes in order to prevent tax increases. I was pleased last year that, when the House finally did pass the AMT patch, we recognized the foolishness of applying PAYGO to expiring tax provisions, and I'm disappointed that that bipartisan approach is not being followed here today. 
   Simply put, we shouldn't have to pay to extend current law. This is not paying for a new tax cut in the main. Most of this bill is extending current law. 
   As we stare at the prospect of a more than $3.5 trillion tax increase baked into the budget by the majority's misguided PAYGO rules, I think it will become even more obvious in the years to come why Congress should not have to raise taxes to prevent a tax increase. 
   If the majority was ever willing to offset tax provisions with spending cuts, I might view this a little differently. But this bill shows once again that the only tool the majority has to meet its PAYGO requirements is the hammer of tax increases. It's little wonder, then, that to them every problem looks like a nail. 
   As I documented many times last year and during our committee markup last week, Washington doesn't have a revenue problem. We're getting enough revenues. We're already collecting more in taxes as a percent of our GDP than the historical average of revenues coming into Washington. That's not the problem. The problem is spending. So how many times have we had PAYGO rules be adopted and followed in this House using spending cuts to pay for extending current tax law? Zero. 
   Mr. Speaker, the continued use of tax increases to pay for extending current law is unacceptable to this ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, and I hope will be objectionable to a majority of the Members of this House. In fact, this bill not only contains tax cuts, it actually does increase spending. There are items in this bill that score as spending--expanding refundable tax credits, the New York Liberty Zone project. Those score as spending. So we're increasing spending in this bill, and we're paying for that with tax increases. 
   In addition to those two provisions, the bill contains numerous other new temporary and permanent provisions, undermining the claim that the bill is merely extending current law. Some of the new provisions might be meritorious, but a few of those I think deserve closer examination. 
   For example, some of my colleagues may be surprised to know that there is a nearly $1.6 billion special tax break for trial lawyers in this bill. The provision overrides developing case law and lets lawyers using certain types of contingency fee arrangements to deduct sooner their expenses. CBO's Joint Tax Committee scores this as costing the taxpayers $1.6 billion over the next 10 years. Now, this provision was not the subject, that I'm aware of, of any hearings or examination by the committee, and yet it's in this bill today. 
   I would hope that before we make such a significant change in tax law costing taxpayers $1.6 billion, all going to one very narrow set of people in this country, trial lawyers, that we would want to have a hearing on that and flesh it out to see if maybe it could be crafted better, or whether, in fact, it's of any value at all to the country. 
   This bill also revisits the ``green pork'' tax credit bonds that were much discussed during the energy debate in 2007. These are the same bond proceeds, remember, that could be used for all sorts of dubious projects, maybe hybrid snowmobiles in Aspen, or maybe a new Wal-Mart with a couple of solar panels out front. 
   State and local governments using the bond proceeds don't even have to certify that the projects will reduce fossil fuel consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, the majority rejected a sensible fix for this oversight when this was offered last year. 
   We know how this is all going to end. It will end with the passage of an AMT patch without offsets, like last year, and probably many extenders being approved without tax increases. More than 40 Senators have signed a letter pledging to oppose a package such as the one before the House today. And even if it somehow squeaks by the Senate, the President has indicated he would veto this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's unfortunate that the majority has chosen against moving a bill on expiring provisions that could have had bipartisan support and instead have opted for the measure before us. 
   Given that its fate has already been sealed--it won't become law--I am comforted to know that we will have another chance to consider this legislation this year. I hope it's sooner rather than later so that we're not here in December once again scrambling to deal with these issues.  
   We can do better than what's before us today. Let's get rid of this, start over, and bring a good bill back. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, let me close today by simply saying that we don't object to the main body of the bill, the extensions of the expiring provisions of the Tax Code. After all, those were provisions that we put in the Tax Code when we were in the majority. That is not the point. 
   The point is that if we follow the PAYGO rules that require these existing provisions of law to be paid for if they are extended just amounts to a built-in tax increase. If we are already bringing in to the Federal Government more money as a percent of GDP than we historically have with all these provisions in place, what sense does it make to raise taxes just to keep them in place? It doesn't make sense, unless you simply want to raise more revenue for the central government in this country, grow the government even more. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to those who have spoken so eloquently on the merits of the expiring tax provisions, I agree with that. But to hold to the PAYGO provisions that require the offsets in this bill would lead us to a huge tax increase over the next 10 years.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward motion that offers Members of this House a simple choice. Are you in favor of long-term extensions of these expiring tax provisions and extending the all-important AMT patch, without raising taxes? 
   As we have discussed at length here today, the majority's bill unwisely adheres to their ill-advised PAYGO rules. Thus, they have once again found themselves boxed in a corner, scouring the Tax Code for ways to fuel their agenda. Whether that agenda involves additional spending, new tax incentives, or even just extensions of the low-tax policies that Republicans originally enacted during our time in the majority, the Democrat solution seems to always be the same: tax, tax, tax. 
   Today's bill is no different. While there is virtually no disagreement in this House that the expiring tax reductions contained in the underlying legislation need to be renewed, the two parties seem to have a major disagreement about whether revenue-raisers should be necessary to pay for them. The majority's bill represents a clear choice in favor of higher taxes. Our motion to recommit, on the other hand, represents a clear choice in favor of extending current tax relief, without offsetting tax increases. 
   Unlike the bill brought forward today by the majority, Mr. Speaker, which contains $55.5 billion in revenue-raisers, our motion contains no--repeat, no--tax increases. Democrats were wrong to propose these sorts of offsetting tax hikes last year, and they're wrong again today. If they stick with their misguided PAYGO rules, they'll be wrong again in 2010 as well, when a huge number of critically important tax policies, ranging from the expanded $1,000 child credit to the lower rates on dividends and capital gains and lower individual rates will expire. And the majority's PAYGO logic will then require more than a $3.5 trillion tax increase simply to maintain current law. But that's where PAYGO will take us. 
   This motion to recommit offers us a different path, Mr. Speaker. Not only does our motion reject the majority's tax hikes, it extends the bill's positive provisions for considerably longer than the underlying bill does. Indeed, our motion extends the package of expiring provisions, including all the expiring energy tax provisions, through 2013. 
   So if you support the deduction for State and local sales taxes, here's your chance to extend it for 6 years, not just 1. If you support the research and development tax credit, here's your chance to extend it for 6 years, not just 1. 
   In short, if you want to extend all of the important low-tax policies that expired last year--as well as the energy extenders that are set to expire just months from now--on a long-term basis, here's your chance. 
   This motion also gives Members the opportunity to extend one final crucial provision that has gone completely unaddressed by the majority: the AMT patch. As we've highlighted throughout today's debate, the majority's legislation is deafeningly silent on the urgently needed AMT patch. Their bill's failure to patch the AMT for 2008 means that more than 25 million middle class individuals and families are in line for a $61.5 billion tax hike next April, an average tax increase for those families of more than $2,400 per taxpayer. 
   Our motion does what everyone knows must be done. It patches the AMT for 2008, and it does so early in the year to help ensure that we avoid a repeat performance of the legislative meltdown engineered by the majority last year, which prevented the 2007 patch from being enacted until the day after Christmas. We need to patch the AMT and we need to patch it now. This motion gives us that opportunity.  
   I will close, Mr. Speaker, with just a word about process. I suspect that we'll hear from our friends on the other side that this motion will kill the bill. Well, Mr. Speaker, I would submit to you that you can't kill a bill that's already dead. This bill is dead on arrival in the other body, Mr. Speaker. Forty-one Senators signed a letter last month pledging to oppose tax bills that contain revenue-raising offsets. 
   On the very same day that our committee, the Ways and Means Committee, reported out this bill last week, our colleagues across the Capitol passed a motion on the Senate floor instructing Senate conferees on the budget resolution to reject the House's plan to raise $110 billion in taxes in order to pay for the extension of expiring provisions, including the AMT patch. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, even if this legislation somehow got through the Senate, the President has indicated he would veto the bill. 
   You can't kill a bill that's already dead, Mr. Speaker. So let's use this motion to recommit to revive this bill, send it back to committee so that we can do our work in a bipartisan way, and get a bill passed and to the President that he will sign.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   It is a privilege today to rise in strong support of the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008. I must say at the outset, however, that the real privilege was to have had the opportunity to serve in this House for almost 21 years with Tom Lantos. His passing is an immeasurable loss for his family, for this Chamber, and for the people across the world for whom he tirelessly fought. 
   Since December, when the House and Senate passed different bills to strengthen and broaden sanctions against the repressive Burmese regime, we have worked across the aisle, across jurisdictional lines and across the Capitol to finalize a bill to pass into law. This bill has benefited enormously from the collaborative and bipartisan efforts of the House Foreign Affairs, Senate Foreign Relations, Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees. Our collective efforts have produced a sanctions bill that takes a tough position against the Burmese regime, while maximizing compliance with United States international obligations. 
   Among other things, the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act promises to eliminate trade in jewelry containing Burmese rubies and jadeite, even if the jewelry was made in and exported from a third country. These sales finance the Burmese regime, and if we want to pressure them to provide for their impoverished people, we must eliminate trade in all Burmese rubies and jadeite, not just if those products are exported directly from Burma itself. 
   We must also structure our import sanctions in a way that encourages and facilitates multilateral pressure. We believe the Ways and Means Committee contributions to this legislation do just that, as well as pave the way toward building a multilateral consensus at the United Nations and World Trade Organization to prevent trade in Burmese rubies and jadeite. Modeled after the successful conflict diamonds legislation, the provisions our committee added are proven and administrable. 
   I would also note that this bill is an improvement over the original House-passed bill because it no longer targets a single United States company for unfavorable tax treatment. 
   Lastly, I would like to thank Chairman Rangel for the improvements he is responsible for in this bill, particularly his agreement to eliminate the  problematic provisions relating to the generalized system of preferences that were in the original House-passed bill. 
   For all these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H. Res. 1341.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm glad that you admonished Members to not improperly invoke the President's name. I don't think Chairman Rangel really thought through what he said there at first about the President being mean-spirited with this veto. I disagree with the policy in this bill, but I don't think Mr. Stark or Mr. Dingell or any of my colleagues were mean-spirited in putting together flawed policy. And I think the more that we recognize that we're all here, including the President, for the same reason, and that's to make this country a better place, the quicker we will get on to solving the bigger problems of the country on a bipartisan basis. So I appreciate the Speaker's admonition. 
   As I say, I don't agree with the policy that's in the bill, but I do commend those who worked on solving at least the immediate problem of the pending cut to physicians. It is an intractable problem, very, very difficult for us to deal with, both substantively and politically. So I recognize that this was a tough process, a very difficult process to bring legislation to the floor that at least solved the immediate problem. But I think this bill represents missed opportunities. I think it is premised on false choices, and surely does nothing to protect the long-term solvency of the Medicare program, which we are going to have to tackle eventually in the Congress. 
   I support reversing the physician pay cuts that are scheduled under current law, but there is a right way to do it and a wrong way. I think this bill represents the wrong way. According to CBO, more than 2 million seniors will lose the Medicare health plan that they have today if this bill becomes law. 
   Now, as these provisions are fully implemented, I believe Members of Congress will begin hearing from seniors around the country, angry, confused, wanting to know why we passed a bill that has taken away their health care plan. The last time we made changes that negatively impacted these kinds of plans, we certainly heard from seniors in our offices, and they were not happy. 
   Now, maybe if in this bill we permanently fix the problems of the flawed Sustainable Growth Formula, then we might be willing to make that trade to put up with a few angry seniors because we really did something the right way, we permanently fixed the problem. But this bill doesn't do that; it is another just-kick-the-can-down-the-road. And, in effect, we make the problem worse because, as my colleague from Texas said earlier, the next time Congress has to address this in just a year from now, the physicians will be facing a 20 percent cut in reimbursement. That's what this bill puts in place. That's what this bill sets up the Congress for in about a year. 
   So I don't believe that the policy that is used in this bill to pay for this temporary fix is the appropriate policy. And I believe seniors will not be happy with us for having just used their health care plans to kick this can down the road. 
   Now, I'm retiring, Madam Speaker, at the end of this Congress; I won't be here next year. But I am hopeful that sooner, and not later, Members of the House and Senate, on a bipartisan basis, will decide that year-to-year rentals of this patch no longer make sense and roll up their sleeves in a concerted effort to develop a long-term solution to ensure that the Medicare program will be able to serve seniors for generations to come. I don't hold any hope that we're going to do that this year, but I do believe that this legislation, if there is a silver lining, by creating this even higher cliff for physicians, will probably get Congress closer to that bipartisan cooperation to solve the problem. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I want to talk about two things quickly in closing. There has not been much said during this debate about part of the President's veto message that I think is important. So I am going to read that section from the veto message. It concerns the prescription drug program. The President says, ``The bill would constrain market forces and undermine the success that the Medicare Prescription Drug Program has achieved in providing beneficiaries with robust, high-value coverage--including comprehensive formularies and access to network pharmacies--at lower-than-expected costs. In particular, the provisions that would enable the expansion of ``protected classes'' of drugs would effectively end meaningful price negotiations between Medicare prescription drug plans and pharmaceutical manufacturers for drugs in those classes. If, as is likely, implementation of this provision results in an increase in a number of protected drug classes, it will lead to increased beneficiary premiums and copayments, higher drug prices, and lower drug rebates. These new requirements, together with provisions that interfere with the contractual relationships between part D plans and pharmacies, are expected to increase Medicare spending and have a negative impact on the value and choice that beneficiaries have come to enjoy in the program.'' 
   I think that is an important consideration as we decide whether to sustain or override the President's veto. 
   Just one other item, and that's this question of paying the insurance companies more than the regular Medicare reimbursement. That has been often stated but still is not the case. By law, the margin over the regular Medicare payments have to go in these plans to beneficiary services or reduction of premiums or go back to the trust fund. That extra margin does not go to the insurance companies. 
   In fact, GAO did a study of the margins of profit of these insurance plans and Medicare Advantage and found that the average margin of profit was 5 percent, a margin that is considerably lower, I might add, than some other sectors of Medicare services. I just wanted to clear that up and urge all of my colleagues to consider this vote very carefully and urge them to sustain the President's veto. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this free trade agreement.  
   Madam Speaker, I would like to close by making several points about the value of our free trade agreements and the value of this agreement with Peru in particular. 
   First, free trade agreements implemented under Trade Promotion Authority have been a tremendous success story in expanding U.S. exports and reducing the U.S. trade deficit. Let me point to a very telling statistic: the U.S. trade balance with the 12 countries for which FTAs have been implemented under TPA improved by an overwhelming 162 percent between 2001 and 2006, going from a trade deficit to a trade surplus of $13.9 billion with these countries. Our free trade agreements work. 
   Second, our free trade agreements create jobs. Let me give you an example. Whirlpool, a company responsible for thousands of jobs in places like Iowa and Ohio, estimates that once the Peru agreement is implemented, its sales to Peru will increase by 400 percent. Current high Peruvian tariffs hamstring Whirlpool's ability to supply its stores in Peru with U.S.-made goods. Instead, Whirlpool primarily supplies stores in Peru with goods made in its manufacturing facility in Brazil to escape those high duties. This agreement will eliminate Peruvian tariffs for U.S. products and will allow Whirlpool to increase exports of its U.S.-made products at the expense of Brazilian goods. That means more jobs in the United States, not Brazil. 
   Here's another example: Our FTAs, including the Peru agreement, increase opportunities for express delivery services, both because there are more packages to ship and also because such U.S. services providers will enjoy liberalized access to their markets. UPS reports that for every 40 new packages that it ships per day, it must hire a new U.S. worker. That new worker will almost certainly be a union employee, as UPS is the largest employer of Teamsters. 
   Third, our free trade agreements support small and medium sized businesses. There are over 19,000 small and medium sized U.S. businesses currently exporting to the three Latin countries with whom we have pending FTAs. Nearly 81 percent of the U.S. companies that exported merchandise to Peru in 2005 were small and medium-sized businesses. These companies, which will see reduced tariffs when they export goods under these agreements, are the engine of our economy and are powerful job creators. 
   Finally, the Peru agreement will end one-way trade and will finally give U.S. companies equal access. Today, without agreement, Peru has almost complete duty-free access to the U.S. market, as it has since 1991, when Congress gave such access through Andean preferences--and which this Congress extended last June with 365 Members voting in favor. 
   For all of these reasons, in my view, if you are concerned about trade deficits or american jobs, you must support this agreement. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to reiterate my comments from last night: I am delighted that Chairman RANGEL and I are able to stand together today as partners in strong support of this agreement. If it weren't for his leadership, we would not be here today. I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye.''  
   At this time, Madam Speaker, for closing for our side, I would recognize the distinguished minority leader, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner).

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I compliment the majority on bringing this bill to the floor today to stop the alternative minimum tax from creeping further into middle-income families. 
   The effect of this legislation that we are considering today will basically freeze the AMT where it is. In other words, under the 2006 tax year, there were 4 million taxpayers that had to pay their taxes under the alternative minimum tax. This legislation will ensure that only those 4 million taxpayers, basically, will be paying taxes under the AMT and not an additional 23 million or so taxpayers at an average of about $2,000 per taxpayer. This is good news for those taxpayers. It is good news for the economy. At a time when many economists are worried about our economy going into a recession, now would be the wrong time for this Congress to endorse a tax increase, which is what would have happened had we done nothing. 
   So I compliment the majority in bringing this bill forward today and allowing the House an up-or-down vote on freezing the alternative minimum tax where it is.  
   Madam Speaker, anyone who has listened to the debate on this issue during the House's two previous considerations of an Alternative Minimum Tax ``patch'' for 2007 knows that this debate is about much more than just the alternative tax structure created in 1969. As has been repeatedly said by Members on both sides of the aisle, the Alternative Minimum Tax is a flawed tax, a mistake, unfair, and ripe for repeal. 
   I am pleased today that Congress is again limiting its impact, for the 7th year in a row, to only 4 million taxpayers. But, far more important than enacting the patch or preventing the reach of the shortcomings of the Alternative Minimum Tax, is the victory we have achieved today over a flawed fiscal policy. 
   The bill before us today is titled the ``Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007.'' It is properly named, as its enactment will prevent 21 million taxpayers from an average tax increase of $2,000 this year. But, this tax increase prevention pales in comparison to the tax increase that all federal income taxpayers, well over 100 million Americans, will face under the next President. 
   The debate over the past several months has been a warm-up act, a pre-game show, the ``undercard,'' for the debate over the fiscal fork in the road the country will come to in 2010. On one side, clearly demonstrated by the initial vote on H.R. 3996, and the vote on H.R. 4351 last week, are those who believe the federal government needs more tax revenue. On the other side, mostly this side of the aisle, are those who believe the federal government already collects enough taxes from its people. 
   I hope this philosophical difference is understood as we move forward with debate on tax legislation next year, prepare for a great national debate during the 2008 elections, and engage during the 111th Congress over the largest tax increase in the history of civilization. 
   In those debates, proponents of the ``paygo'' rules that were successfully cast aside earlier today will cloak their arguments in terms of fiscal responsibility. They'll argue in moral absolutes and in righteous terms that the House's paygo system is sound budget policy. I beg to differ. Taken to its logical end, it is a recipe for economic disaster. 
   Over the past few months, the goal of the proponents of ``paygo philosophy'' has been simple--to increase taxes. If we had not been successful in defeating their efforts here, consider where the debate would go next. The next Congress and the next President will be debating a tax increase on married couples, a tax increase on families with children, a tax increase on death, a tax increase on investment, and a tax increase on savings. Every current federal income taxpayer, and even millions of Americans who currently pay no federal income taxes, faces a substantial tax Increase. 
   Let's be clear, the goal of paygo's advocates is to succeed in allowing all those taxes to increase, or to find other tax increases to replace them. At the end of the day, if you believe the federal government needs trillions more in tax revenue, you should oppose this bill, you should recommit yourself to ``paygo,'' and you should be utterly disappointed that the House overwhelmingly rejected it today. As for me, I hope that Members will vote to support this legislation, and bury ``paygo'' in the graveyard of failed economic philosophies.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SCHIP EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I agree with some of the comments that have been made by the majority today, not all of them, of course, but some of them. 
   I think it is a shame that we were not able to reach a bipartisan agreement on a longer term extension of the SCHIP program. As Ranking Member Barton has pointed out on more than one occasion, though, this process was pretty much doomed from the start because the majority failed to include the minority at all in the early stages of putting together legislation for this important program. 
   And I understand, it is difficult being in the majority for the first time in 12 years and not really knowing how to get things done. It's tough to govern. It's tough to have the responsibility to actually pass legislation and make law. We did it for 12 years, and we had some troubles ourselves in the first year or  so that we were in the majority. So I understand. But I hope the majority will learn from this experience. 
   We have two choices, the majority has two choices, really, insofar as dealing with the SCHIP program. And that is, number one, next year they could do as Ranking Member Barton suggested and have hearings on the SCHIP program and work with the minority hand in hand to try to come up with a reasonable extension reauthorization of this important program. 
   Number two, they could try the same thing next year that they did this year and get the same result, and then just wait until after the elections and hope that they would have a Democratic President, a Democratic majority, and can do what they want, maybe. 
   I would submit that the better course is the former, and that is to work with the minority next year. We certainly made that offer this calendar year. I would extend it, at least from my committee's standpoint, that invitation again for next year. And I am hopeful that we can do that. 
   This bill before us today covers a lot of other things besides the SCHIP program. As Chairman Stark said, we do have in here kind of a stalling of the cliff that physicians find themselves looking over as far as Medicare reimbursement. We only do that for 6 months. We do several other things for 6 months, including therapy caps which I think are very important. So we are under the gun, this Congress is under the gun, and I would submit that means both the majority and the minority early next year to get some things done in the Medicare field. 
   Again, I certainly want to extend my hand to the majority and offer to work together to get these very important things that are only extended or only dealt with for 6 months in this bill, a more certain future with legislation next year. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (MORTGAGE FORGIVENESS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, though not without some reservations. I share the concern of my chairman and my colleagues about the subprime mortgage crisis. 
   While we are all ultimately responsible for the contracts we sign, there were clearly failures in the market that led people to buy homes larger or more expensive than they could really afford, or to accept mortgage terms that might quickly become unsustainable. 
   The result has been a growing number of foreclosures, which, in turn, puts downward pressure on other home prices. Moreover, when a bank forgives some or all of the mortgage, that cancelled debt is treated as income and is subject to tax. Too many people are learning the hard way about this ``kick-'em-when-they're-down'' feature of the tax code. 
   In August, President Bush recognized the seriousness of this crisis and proposed a temporary provision exempting from tax the income that individuals receive when a bank reduces or eliminates the mortgage on a primary residence. 
   I think that his proposal, a temporary solution to a temporary crisis, is appropriate, and asked the Rules Committee to make in order a substitute which did just that. As my colleagues know, however, we were not given that opportunity, and so we are not debating such a proposal. 
   Nevertheless, there are good policy arguments for making this provision permanent, just as there are for making it temporary. But the important thing is that we do something to help. I am glad the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee decided to move a bill dealing with this crisis. 
   The bill does, however, contain revenue offsets that I do find troubling. Generally, I continue to oppose PAYGO rules that require us to raise taxes in one place in order to provide tax relief in another. Nonetheless, those are the rules that this House has adopted, so I understand the majority's need to include an offset in the bill. 
   The offset being used today will deny part of the capital gains exemption to families who sell a second home which was not always their primary residence. During committee markup, I expressed concerns that the proposal could undercut housing prices in areas of the country where second-home purchases form a large share of the housing market. I understand the chairman's desire to identify an offset within the housing market, and that certainly constrained our choices. 
   I also appreciate the chairman's efforts to include transition relief to limit the effect of this provision on families who may already own more than one home. As has been noted already and will surely be noted again, the bill, including this offset, has been endorsed by several leading real estate  groups, and that calms, although it doesn't eliminate, my concerns about the impact the offset may have. 
   Thus, while I do support the positive tax relief in this bill for those with cancellation of indebtedness income, I would prefer to do so without this objectionable offset. It is my hope that as this legislation moves forward, as I believe it should today, we will have an opportunity to reconsider the revenue raises attached to it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time and request unanimous consent that the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Lewis), who coauthored the original legislation similar to the bill before us today with Mr. Andrews, be allowed to allocate the remainder of the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I've been an avid supporter of Andean preferences, and today I voice my support for this short-term extension of the preferences. And I want to thank Chairman Rangel for working with me and others to effect what we believe should pass on the floor today under suspension of the rules. 
   Our country's relationship with the Andean countries of Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia is vitally important, and preferences have helped enormously with their economic development and with stability in the region. 
   At the same time, however, I believe it is time to move to a more substantial, mature and reciprocal relationship through free trade agreements. The unilateral preferences provide duty-free treatment to products from the region, but very limited value to United States interests in return. The FTAs, the free trade agreements, provide reciprocal market access benefits, creating new opportunity for United States producers, farmers and exporters. 
   I might add that our FTAs also create greater obligations on our trading partners than preferences by requiring them to abide by fundamental labor rights and certain multilateral environmental agreements. 
   Right now we have an immediate opportunity to implement the FTAs with Peru and Colombia, with the possibility of future FTAs with Ecuador and Bolivia. We should seize this opportunity now. Both Peru and Colombia have already passed the pending FTAs, and they are expected soon to pass amendments to them reflecting the recently concluded bipartisan trade deal on labor and the environment. 
   It's time for our Congress here in the United States to move these FTAs, too. Preferences are a stopgap measure. Our trading partners and United States interests deserve more than that. Every day we wait is a lost opportunity to gain the advantages of those more mature agreements. 
   With respect to Ecuador and Bolivia, I remain very concerned with the treatment of United States investors there. This 8-month extension gives us time to evaluate how these countries are abiding by the preference program requirements with respect to United States investment. We will be watching developments very carefully. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support this short-term extension of preferences for 8 months, which will give us the time we need to implement our outstanding free trade agreements in the region. The first step will be to complete congressional action on the Peru agreement, I hope, before the August recess. The time is now to solidify our relationship, instead of perpetuating what I believe is an unsatisfactory status quo. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill on the floor today. I have some prepared remarks that I am going to submit for the Record, but rather than reiterate the problems that we have with the process that brought this bill to the floor, let me say my good friend Mr. Stark has been talking with us all along about this problem. We have all been aware of it. And, frankly, it was our understanding in talking with the distinguished chairman of the Health Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee that we were going to try to let the Senate, our colleagues in the Senate, work out a bipartisan solution to this take that we could then embrace and bring to the floor. 
   They were not able to do that at first in the Senate, so we frankly were kind of scrambling to figure out what we were going to do. But now we are told that our friends in the Senate have indeed reached a bipartisan compromise on this issue. They hope to bring it to the floor within the next day or two.  At that time, we could take that bill on a bipartisan basis in the House and embrace it and pass it and get this problem behind us. So why are we doing this today? I am not really sure. It baffles me. 
   This is a bill that does not have bipartisan support. It did not get 60 votes in the Senate. It couldn't even come up on the floor for a vote. The President would veto it. It is clear this bill is not going to become law. 
   So I think we are wasting our time here today, to be frank. We ought to be joining arms and hoping that the Senate gets that bill to us, the new compromise bipartisan bill, in a timely fashion so we can get it done this week and avert the drastic cut to reimbursements for physicians, as well as the other things that will occur with caps on services to seniors and the like. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge us to defeat this bill today on a bipartisan basis, and then get about the serious business of passing a bipartisan bill later this week that can become law.  
   I rise in opposition to H.R. 6331. 
   The Majority notified us at 10 o'clock this morning that they have made a number of changes to the bill that they told us would be on the floor. Members have had just one hour to review this 278-page bill, which moves tens of billions of dollars around in the Medicare program. The limited time for review of such an important measure should give every Member pause. 
   For six months now, the Democratic Majority in the House has known that physicians face a looming 10.6 percent cut to their Medicare payments. 
   Now with just six days left before this cut is scheduled to take effect, they are bringing a bill to the floor that we all know will never be signed into law. The Senate considered a similar bill 2 weeks ago and they could not even get the 60 votes necessary to be able to debate the bill. We also know that the President would veto this bill, because of the changes it makes to the Medicare Advantage program. 
   Yet here we are, playing games with less than a week before physicians' Medicare reimbursements are scheduled to be cut, therapy services for some seniors will be ended, and billions of dollars that assist rural physicians and hospitals will be terminated. Once this bill fails today, we'll still be faced with the same expiring Medicare policies, but we will have one less day to fix them. 
   If anyone actually believes that this bill is a serious effort to fix these problems, they need only look to page 253 of the bill. Here you'll find a ``Sense of the Senate'' provision. Mr. Speaker, the last time I checked, this is the House of Representatives. This raises the question of whether, in their rush to bring this bill up for a vote, the Majority even read their own 278-page bill, which they introduced an hour ago, or if they simply copied the failed Senate bill word for word. 
   Well, my staff has read the bill, and here's what else they found. The bill cuts approximately $50 billion from Medicare Advantage. CBO predicts that more than 2 million seniors would lose access to their Medicare Advantage plan if this bill were enacted. The President has said repeatedly that he would veto any bill that contained these reductions. Thankfully, he won't have to, because the Senate already rejected these cuts two weeks ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the Majority was really serious about helping Medicare beneficiaries and providers, we would take up the compromise bill that Senators Baucus and Grassley have worked out. That bill will eliminate the physician payment cuts in 2008 and 2009, extend rural payment add-ons and the existing exceptions process for therapy services and fully pay for these changes without changing the rules governing private fee for service plans. I believe that bill will pass the Senate, and then we in the House will have an opportunity, on a bipartisan basis, to protect physicians from the looming drastic cut in their reimbursement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker, the gentleman from Texas, talked about a memo from  Treasury 5 years ago. The fact is, since that memo was sent out, or since that study was done, Treasury has undertaken a very aggressive policy of amending tax treaties with countries to solve the problem that was mentioned in that study. Also, in the jobs bill that we passed just a couple of years ago, we legislatively attacked the problem that was mentioned in that study. So steps have been taken, both legislatively and regulatorily, to solve that problem. 
   The President's budget, the gentleman himself said it raises $2 billion, approximately. His provision raises twice that. So it is apples and oranges, and obviously his provision is much broader than what the President's budget contemplated. 
   But, you know, I was just sitting there listening to this debate, and Americans out in the country watching this must be shaking their heads. You have got Democrats who are saying one thing and Republicans who are saying just the opposite. Republicans: It is a tax increase. Democrats: It is not a tax increase, it is a loophole closure. It is like they have been brainwashed by somebody and we have been brainwashed by somebody. 
   Mr. Speaker, we could have avoided this, I believe, if the majority had followed regular order; if they had allowed the Ways and Means Committee, the committee of jurisdiction over the Tax Code, to hold a hearing on this provision, to flesh it out, to hear experts on both sides, or all sides, and then let us discuss it and ask questions, probe. 
   Mr. Doggett is one of the smartest Members of our committee, and he knows a lot about the Tax Code, and especially the treatment of international companies doing business here in the United States, and I give him that. But, dadgummit, we should have had a chance to honestly debate this, and not have the majority just throw it in overnight on a farm bill, without even sending it through the Ways and Means Committee. That is wrong. That is a lousy way to legislate. It is wrong. 
   That is why Members on both sides of the aisle should vote no on this rule, to give this House the opportunity to act responsibly and to give the Ways and Means Committee back some of its honor. It is getting gutted by actions like this week after week after week. I am tired of it, and I ask the House, not Republicans or Democrats, Members of this proud House, to go back to doing things properly, and then maybe we will figure out something in between that we can all support.

<DOCNO>Mr. MCCRERY. (HUBBARD ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MCCRERY. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6580 and commend my colleague from California, Mr. NUNES, for his tireless efforts to secure passage of this important legislation addressing the concerns of ``sole survivors'' such as his constituent, Jason Hubbard. I also wish to thank the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, whose support was critical to consideration of this bill.  
   The ``sole-survivor'' policy of the Armed Forces was designed with the best of intentions but has yielded some unfortunate, unintended consequences. Currently, there are no standard benefits available to those who separate from the Armed Forces under this policy, whether or not their service obligation is completed. 
   This legislation puts the House firmly on record that sole survivors should qualify for a standard set of Federal benefits that are generally available to other veterans, including education benefits, transitional healthcare, and the ability to keep any enlistment bonus paid to them. Given the exigencies of the situation, the retroactive action being taken here today to protect sole survivors who have been honorably discharged from the military since September 11, 2001 is the right thing to do. 
   Let me take a moment to comment on the bill's other provision, Section 9 of today's legislation, which would repeal the dollar limitations on contributions to funeral trusts. This revenue provision, authored by the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Kind, has been included to offset the additional spending associated with the bill's sole survivor provisions. 
   As my colleagues know, I have complained often during the 110th Congress that the Committee on Ways and Means has been used repeatedly as a piggy-bank by other panels looking to offset the cost of new spending proposals. I certainly would have preferred to have the sole survivor provisions in today's legislation funded by suitable spending reductions identified by the committees of jurisdiction, rather than by a revenue enhancement. 
   But that option, having been fully explored, was not available to us on this bill. Under the circumstances, the path chosen today by the Majority is an appropriate one for several reasons. 
   First, given the urgency of acting on this legislation, we do not have time to wait. We understand that some of these sole survivors have had recent paychecks withheld or have recently received bills from the military demanding repayment of their enlistment bonuses. Families like the Hubbards are facing pressing financial deadlines, and we do not have the luxury of waiting to address this issue on their behalf. 
   Second, unlike numerous other examples from the 110th Congress, the higher revenues derived from this funeral trust provision are not being used to substantially expand eligibility for an entitlement program to classes of people for whom it was not originally intended, or to provide existing enrollees new benefits not already in law. Instead, this bill uses the small amount of revenue raised to correct a narrow, but serious, flaw in current law. That is an important difference. 
   Third, I would note that this provision is fully voluntary--it would only affect those Americans who voluntarily opt to make larger contributions to a pre-paid funeral trust. 
   Finally, unlike prior revenue raisers proposed by the Majority that would impose unwelcome tax increases on unsuspecting Americans, this particular revenue offset is actually strongly supported by those who would pay the additional tax. In other cases where the Majority has sought higher revenues to pay for new spending, our friends across the aisle have typically targeted either politically disfavored taxpayers, such as smokers or ``the rich,'' or groups, such as late-filing taxpayers, who would almost certainly be unaware of the tax increase until they had to write a bigger check to Uncle Sam. By contrast, the tax provision here is the rare bird in Washington: a proposed revenue enhancement that has generated no discernible opposition and that has actually been endorsed by the leading industry group representing affected taxpayers,The National Funeral Directors Association. 
   As I noted, I generally would prefer that we not use the tax code to raise revenue to pay for higher spending. But this legislation presents unique facts and circumstances that justify the action being taken today, and I hope my colleagues in the other body will act quickly to get this important bill to the President's desk.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, makes a number of points in support of the PAYGO rule, which forms the basis of the requirement in this bill to raise taxes on one set of taxpayers in order to prevent a tax increase on another set of taxpayers. I just want to talk about why this rule, I believe, has been treated in a way that nobody who ever came up with the idea of PAYGO meant for it to be treated. 
   If we were to go out on the street, Mr. Speaker, and pull aside an average person on the street and say, we're thinking about instituting in Congress a PAYGO rule. And what that means is, if we cut taxes somewhere, we have to pay for that by increasing taxes somewhere else or decreasing spending somewhere else. 
   Okay. That sounds reasonable. 
   Well, it also means that if we increase spending in some program, or if we create a new spending program, we either have to decrease spending somewhere else or raise taxes to pay for that increased spending. 
   Oh, well, yeah, that sounds reasonable. 
   But, then if you tell that person, and, oh, by the way, we're going to assume that we have more revenue next year, and that revenue is going to be produced by this set of taxpayers. They're not paying it now, but we're going to assume that next year they will pay it. And in order to relieve them of that assumption that they're going to pay for in taxes, we're going to increase taxes on this group of taxpayers over here. How's that sound? 
   The average person, Mr. Speaker, I would submit, would say that doesn't make much sense. And it doesn't make much sense. In fact, Mr. Speaker, it puts this House and this Congress in a fiscal straitjacket with respect to tax policy and fiscal policy. 
   Now, the chairman has said himself, this AMT thing is crazy. It was never meant to apply to middle-class taxpayers. It was a mistake. Well, why don't we just admit the mistake and get rid of it? If it was our mistake, let's correct the mistake by getting rid of it. We never meant to collect this level of revenues that are anticipated in the CBO baseline. 
   I don't want to talk about the CBO baseline because folks in America don't understand the CBO baseline. But that's the genesis of all this tax raising that the majority is about to undertake here. And we ought to stop it today. This is the first step. 
   I feel like the little boy in Holland sticking his thumb in the dike. If I'm not here today to stick my thumb in the dike and stop this bill from passing and expose the flaws of this PAYGO system, we're going to have a torrent, a flood of tax increases over the next 10 years. 
   In fact, the CBO, with the assistance of the Joint Tax Committee, has determined that if this PAYGO rule that governs this bill today stays in place, we're going to increase taxes on the American people over the next 10 years $3.5 trillion. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is the largest tax increase in either nominal terms or real terms in the history of this country. Now, is that what the Democratic majority wants for this country? 
   Do they want to take a chance on increasing taxes to that extent on the American people at a time when we have a housing crisis, when the dollar's value is dropping? I hope not. 
   Today is the day we expose this very flawed and dangerous PAYGO policy by defeating this bill today, Mr. Speaker.  
   Mr. Speaker, although I cannot support this bill, I strongly support extension of the AMT patch and most of the provisions of current law extended in this bill. Congress should protect the 19 million Americans who are at risk of paying the AMT this year. Congress should also extend individual and business tax incentives important to the Nation's economy. 
   Unfortunately, at its core, this bill is not about the AMT or extenders. It is about the elevation of form over substance and the decision of the Congress to bind itself to the mast of Paygo, wherever it may lead. 
   While there may be valid reasons to apply the principles of Paygo to spending changes, we think the calculus is far different in the case of tax policy. 
   As we amply documented during the Ways and Means mark-up of this bill, the majority's budget assumes that the Federal Government will generate revenue from allowing the AMT to continue to plague taxpayers and from allowing the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to sunset. These budget assumptions will have the effect of raising taxes on the Americans people by $3.5 trillion over the next decade. Paygo forces Congress to decide whether to let those tax increases take place or replace them with other tax hikes. 
   It is true that under the current iteration of Paygo, tax cuts could be ``paid for'' by spending cuts, but we have seen no appetite of the current majority for such as sensible approach. For bills both small and large, the Ways and Means Committee has become an ATM for other committees, spitting out tax increases of whatever shape or size is deemed necessary to meet the new majority's appetite for additional spending. Indeed, this House  has already passed over $100 billion in tax increases this year alone. 
   What Paygo has become, as embodied in this bill, is far more breathtaking. Here, it is being invoked as a reason for Congress to raise taxes in order to prevent a tax increase. 
   Let me say that again, the majority has created a rule under which Congress must raise taxes in order to prevent a tax increase. Let me give an example utilizing the context of this bill. 
   If Congress does not enact this legislation, Americans will pay about $70 billion more in taxes next year. If we pass this bill, Americans will pay about $70 billion more in taxes next year. What's wrong with this picture? Either way it's a tax increase. 
   And let us keep in mind that this bill imposes mostly permanent tax increases to pay for temporary tax cuts. Even if this bill passes, we will be back here again next year struggling to find another $70-plus billion in tax increases to ``rent'' one more year of expiring provisions. 
   Unfortunately, this is just a baby step. Under the next President, we seem likely to face large tax increases in order to ``prevent'' a tax increase on families with children, tax increases on marriage, marginal tax rate increases, or tax increases on estates. And that's before we are asked to enact other tax increases to pay for new tax incentives or new spending programs. 
   Raising taxes to prevent a tax increase shows the danger of turning a bumper sticker into a budget rule. 
   According to estimates the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Committee, Federal revenues in fiscal year 2007 totaled about 18.6 percent of our economy, well above the historical average of 18.2 percent. 
   The Joint Tax Committee estimates that over the next decade if we continue to operate in this Paygo straitjacket, revenues will reach 20.1 percent of GDP in 2017, a level seen only once since 1962. Think about it--this bill is the first step in endorsing what will be, in both nominal and real terms, the largest tax increase in the history of the United States. 
   We may well pass this bill today, but what happens next is anyone's guess. The Senate has given us strong and repeated signals that they intend to reject offsets to pay for an AMT patch and the administration has issued a veto threat. This all suggests we will spend more days debating this issue, even as the continued delay threatens to make the coming tax filing season chaotic. 
   As the Secretary of the Treasury warned us last month, ``enactment of a patch in mid-to-late December could delay issuance of approximately $75 billion in refunds to some 50 million taxpayers who are likely to file their returns before March 31, 2008.'' That would be on top of the confusion it will cause taxpayers and the added costs the Federal Government will pay to print new forms and provide assistance to perplexed taxpayers. 
   Simply put, we should stop this charade and recognize that we need to promptly pass a patch and extenders package that the Senate can pass and that the President can sign. If we fail to do so today, the cost of delay and inaction on the AMT patch will continue to mount. 
   I urge defeat of the bill so that the Ways and Means Committee can promptly put together a package that has a chance of making it to the President.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman's enthusiasm for his point of view doesn't make his point of view correct. In fact, Republicans time and time again protected taxpayers, middle-class taxpayers, from the application of the AMT. That is why there's a patch in place today; that is why last year those 21 million taxpayers didn't pay the AMT. In 1999, I would tell the Speaker to inform the gentleman, the Republican Congress repealed the AMT and, unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed that repeal. So I would take issue  with the gentleman's characterization of the Republican Congress's actions with respect to this issue.

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   There has been a lot said here on the floor today and a lot of it is one person or one party's spin on the facts or on history. The distinguished majority leader put his spin on history. I would just like to point out to the House that for the last 6 years of the Clinton administration, which was bragged about so by the majority leader, there was a Republican-controlled Congress. Under the Constitution, the Congress controls the purse strings of the country and develops fiscal policy. And under our fiscal policy, we balanced the budget and created a surplus. 
   Then when President Bush came into office, he inherited a recession, a short-lived recession, admittedly, but still a recession. And then we had 9/11 which was a shock to the economy and then we had war. Every time in this Nation's history that we have had either a recession or a war, we have had a deficit. This time is no different. But, under our policies, we are producing this year 18.6 percent of GDP for Federal revenues and that is above the historic average. Why do we need more, Mr. Speaker? This bill would add to that. We don't need to.

   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   First, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Michigan, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, for requesting unanimous consent that every Member may have 5 days to revise and extend his remarks. The reason I say that is we on the minority side just got this bill at 8 p.m. last night, so it is going to take a few days to understand the changes that have been made, and so we may want to revise and extend our remarks when this debate is over today. 
   This is the third time we have debated a measure like this along these lines. I am probably going to repeat some of the things I have said earlier because, in our cursory examination of the bill at least, it doesn't appear to have changed very much. 
   The bill does nothing, for example, to address the cliff in the funding of SCHIP, so a future Congress will still face a choice of throwing off the SCHIP rolls 6.5 million kids or raising taxes by about $40 billion. 
   It still relies on a declining revenue source, tobacco taxes, to fund a growing program which is likely to exacerbate the funding cliff issue. In short, the legislation remains fiscally irresponsible. 
   Further, despite some window dressing on this, it appears illegal immigrants will be able to use fraudulent Social Security numbers and still be able to get SCHIP and Medicaid benefits. 
   It still allows States to enroll higher income children at least through 2010 and continues to allow States to use a system of so-called income disregards to set just about any income limit they please. 
   I support SCHIP. I want SCHIP to be extended, but this so-called new legislation seems to do absolutely nothing to address the serious flaws in the previous proposals. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Ten years ago, Republicans and Democrats came together to create an SCHIP program with a stable funding source. It was a truly paid-for program. Throughout the process this year, we've been talking about the fact that this SCHIP reauthorization that's before the House today is not paid for. It's paid for only if you accept the budget gimmick that is used to make it appear on paper over the 10-year budget window that the program is paid for. 
   But I don't think any of us realized just how steep that cliff in the bill is until today, because last night my staff received from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office new numbers that show very clearly that under the bill that's before us today, total enrollment in SCHIP is expected to drop by 6.5 million children in the second five years of the program. Does anybody believe that is going to happen? Of course not. But the way the bill is designed, that's what would happen. We know that's not going to be reality. 
   Under this bill, the way it's designed, Democrats would have people believe that SCHIP enrollment, kids enrolled in this program, will drop to only 1.3 million by 2017. 
   Under a realistic expansion of the program, which the President has proposed and we support, there would be 2.9 million kids enrolled in the program in 2017. So under this bill that's before us today, you'd have 1.6 million fewer kids enrolled in SCHIP than you would under the President's budget. That's not realistic. We know that's not going to happen. 
   So how does that problem get fixed after 5 years? Massive tax increases. That's how it gets fixed. This House will be back here having to finance the real costs of the then-existent SCHIP program over the next 5 years, which CBO estimates will require about another $40 billion in revenues over and above the new $35 billion that this bill would impose on the American taxpayers. 
   So there is a better way. It's the way we created for this program in the first place, a bipartisan, fiscally responsible, truly fiscally responsible program to help kids in need. 
   I hope that the majority will be willing to join with us, all of us, to create that bipartisan program again when this veto is sustained. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I have with me, I am going to submit this for inclusion in the Record, a page from a report from the Congressional Budget Office that we received last night. This one page puts the lie to the assertion that this bill is paid for, at least in any terms that a reasonable person would agree that the bill is actually paid for. What this sheet says, in 2012, under the March 2007 baseline, CBO estimated 3.3 million people, not just children, 3.3 million people would be covered. Under the President's proposal, in his budget, CBO estimated 4 million people would be covered in 2012. If the current program with all the exceptions and waivers were continued, CBO says that in 2012, 5.3 million children will be covered. CBO says under the bill on the floor in 2012, 7.8 million people would be covered. But then they say, in 2017, 5 years later, under the President's budget, 2.9 million people would be covered. Under the current program, with all the exceptions and waivers, 5.6, and  under this bill, 1.3 million people. So you go down from 7.8 million to 1.3 million over 5 years, and you are telling me that that is going to take place? It is not. You know it. And you are going to have to pay for it to the tune, the CBO says, of $40 billion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to begin my remarks by saying that we are hearing today a lot of claims from colleagues on the other side of this issue. They quote various  studies that they say prove this will help reduce prices to seniors and help reduce costs to the government. And as everybody in Washington knows, you can generally find a study to say just about whatever you want it to say. But if you listen carefully, you will notice that no one today, and no one will later today, dispute one fact: The nonpartisan official budget scorekeeper for Congress, the analysts that Congress is required by law to follow, the Congressional Budget Office, says that this bill before us will not save one dime. The bill will not save seniors money; it will not save taxpayers money; and it will not save the government money. 
   Now, in case you are thinking, oh, yeah, yeah, but that is old news. That is the old Congressional Budget Office when Republicans controlled it. Well, that is what the old Congressional Budget Office said when Republicans controlled it. But, guess what? In a letter dated just a couple of days ago from the new Congressional Budget Office that Democrats control, it says the same thing exactly. 
   Now, why won't this bill save any money? Simply because the private sector is doing an excellent job already negotiating lower prices for our seniors. And without tools that some have said today they do not want the Secretary to have, and even the language of the bill states the Secretary shall not provide formularies for part D, but without those tools, the CBO says, you can't save any money. 
   So you can't have it both ways. You can't say, oh, we want lower drug prices for seniors; but then at the same time say, yeah, but we don't want those formularies. We don't want to restrict access to any drugs, like Lipitor, which is not on the VA formulary. 
   The Secretary of Health and Human Services cannot do a better job of negotiating than the private sector is already doing. The Secretary says so. CMS says so, and CBO says so. The only way the Secretary will be able to further reduce it is by weakening the drug benefit by restricting access. 
   So why is the Democratic leadership trying to rush this major legislation through the House without a single congressional hearing, without input from the committees of jurisdiction? I fear this is an example of bumper sticker politics. I am afraid they are looking for a good sound bite, not good policy. 
   While H.R. 4 won't produce savings, it certainly has the potential to disrupt or even destroy one of the most popular programs in our history. Today, roughly 90 percent of America's seniors and people with disabilities have prescription drug coverage. Four out of every five seniors enrolled in a Medicare drug plan say they are satisfied with the new drug coverage and would recommend it to their friends. 
   Medicare drug plans are negotiating significantly lower prices for our seniors. The average senior last year saved $1,200. Initial estimates indicate that Medicare prescription drug plans saved seniors last year a total of about $30 billion. Competition has resulted in a program that is expected to cost $373 billion less over the next 10 years than was projected just 1 1/2 years ago. 
   Clearly, the current drug benefit, which allows for competition rather than government price controls, is working. H.R. 4 could bring this success to a screeching halt. If the Secretary of HHS is forced to find the savings suggested by the proponents of this poorly drafted legislation, it seems certain that some seniors will lose access to the prescription drugs they need. 
   Currently, Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a drug plan have access to drugs to treat cancer, mental illness, HIV/AIDS, Lou Gehrig's disease and Alzheimer's, to name a few. They are guaranteed that. H.R. 4 does not guarantee that. 
   Here is what patient groups have to say about the bill that is before us today. The association representing patients afflicted with Lou Gehrig's disease says, ``This shortsighted and inappropriately cost-driven bill will have particularly cruel consequences for people with ALS. If Congress makes this change, they will undo what the Medicare Modernization Act sought to ensure: access to needed prescription drugs.'' The National Alliance on Mental Illness says much the same thing; the Kidney Cancer Association much the same thing. 
   The Republican motion to recommit, which we will soon offer, ensures that access to these important drugs continues. 
   H.R. 4 will also hurt our community pharmacies, denying seniors access to those local pharmacists that they depend on. Seniors like to go to the drugstore to talk to their pharmacists to get advice. If, to hear some of the proponents, we go to something like the VA, for example, they won't have that opportunity because the VA is a closed system, and 80 percent of drugs delivered under the VA are delivered by mail order, not local pharmacies. 
   Now, let us talk about veterans for just a minute. The American Legion, representing our veterans, says H.R. 4 is ``not in the best interest of America's veterans and their families. The American Legion, which represents nearly 3 million members, strongly urges Congress to seriously consider the collateral damage that would result from H.R. 4 because `each time the Federal Government has enacted pharmaceutical price control legislation, the VA has experienced significant increases in its pharmaceutical costs.' '' 
   H.R. 4 will not save money. It is opposed by groups representing victims of disease and opposed by our veterans. H.R. 4 will likely restrict seniors' access to the drugs they need and to the pharmacies they depend upon. H.R. 4 will certainly disrupt a popular program that, despite being just 1 year old, has done a remarkable job. 
   That is why we all ought to vote against H.R. 4, but first, vote for the Republican motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, before I yield to my colleague from Missouri, I just want to challenge anybody on the other side of this issue today, anybody that is in support of H.R. 4, to explain to this House how the Secretary, using the authority under the bill before us, is going to get prices lower. What are the tools that he is going to have to negotiate if he doesn't have the power to assure pharmaceutical manufacturers market share in the program, if he can't use formularies to do the negotiating?

   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I don't believe, based on the evidence, that the Democrats' plan can reduce prescription drug prices without reducing seniors' prescription drug choices, or without devastating local pharmacies, or without raising drug prices for our veterans. 
   Now, they claim that won't happen. They claim they can reduce prices without doing all those things. Well, the motion to recommit gives them a  chance to put their vote where their mouth is. 
   One of the things we should be most proud about in the part D program is that it mandates that drugs for certain terrible illnesses be available. Our motion is simple. It would require that whatever government-negotiated plan emerges from this Democratic legislation must also ensure continued access to medications for those illnesses. 
   The Republican motion says that for cancer, HIV/AIDS, mental illness, Alzheimer's, ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, you have got to have those drugs in those plans. You can't restrict them. 
   The second part of our motion deals with community pharmacies. In the VA system, 80 percent of prescriptions are filled by mail, and the rest of them are gotten at VA centers, veterans hospitals and the like. How many people in this Chamber are willing to ask seniors to give up talking to their pharmacists?     
   If you aren't, and I suspect most of you aren't, then vote for the Republican motion to recommit. We guarantee that they will be able to talk to their local pharmacists. 
   Third part of our motion seeks to protect America's veterans. This motion would ensure that requiring the HHS Secretary to negotiate Medicare prescription drug prices would not directly result in increasing drug prices for veterans, because as we have seen in the past, when the government gets involved in setting prices in other areas, prices to veterans go up. This motion to recommit won't allow that to happen with prescription drug prices for veterans. 
   So if those things are what you believe, and what you want, just vote for the Republican motion to recommit, and you will ensure that those guarantees are in the legislation.

   I will also begin my remarks by thanking the leadership on both sides of the aisle, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Boehner, for their efforts on a bipartisan basis to respond in a very efficient and quick manner to the needs of the country, the needs of our economy, by putting together and supporting a stimulus package that we hope, combined with the efforts of the Fed, will indeed avert a recession in this country and will contribute to a higher level of economic growth this year than we otherwise would have had. 
   Their efforts surely should be taken note of by every Member in this House, indeed of the Congress, and by people across this country. It demonstrates that when we, in this body, want to work together and accomplish something for the country, we can do it. And we certainly have done it in this piece of legislation. 
   It is a compromise, no question about it. There are things that we would have  liked to have had in this bill that are not in there. There are things that the majority would have liked to have in here that are not in here. But the fact that we were able to come together and get this done and in this very short amount of time is clearly a victory for the American people and I believe a victory for this Congress. 
   I also want to thank my colleague, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel. He has really reached out to the minority throughout his tenure as chairman, and in this instance, his staff worked very closely with the minority staff and with leadership staff to put this product together. So I want to thank him for his continued gentlemanly conduct of the committee and cooperation with the minority when it's possible. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill before us today does have a few changes from the House bill that passed just a few days ago. 
   The changes basically allow Social Security benefits and disabled veterans benefits to count as earned income for purposes of satisfying the $3,000 requirement for earned income to get the prebates: $300 per person, $600 per couple, and even the $300 child credit, if applicable. 
   So I think certainly that is an improvement to the bill in the sense that we will get more money into the hands of people who will more than likely spend that money very quickly and get that money working in the economy. 
   The Senate also made some changes with respect to making sure that illegal immigrants are not able to take advantage of this prebate, these checks that are being sent out, and certainly that is a positive development. 
   Madam Speaker, all in all, I think the product before us this evening is an excellent work of the two bodies on a bipartisan basis and, of course, with the support of the Bush administration. And I hope that all Members in this body will tonight enthusiastically support this product and get this to the President for his signature, to the IRS for their administration, and get the checks in the hands of people and allow businesses to begin to get a bonus depreciation for investment. We think that will help speed investment into this year and create jobs. And that is the best way to fight an economic downturn is to create jobs and get money circulating in the economy with paychecks. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to recognize for closing on our side the distinguished minority leader, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner), who clearly was instrumental in getting this product developed through the floor and through the process. He has been lauded by a number of our colleagues here tonight, and rightfully so. So I am very pleased at this time to yield the balance of my time to Mr. Boehner.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, the tax proposal in the farm bill is directly aimed at international companies that invest in the United States, where they support more than 5 million jobs. These are well-known and well-respected companies: Honda, Bridgestone, Toyota, BASF, Panasonic. They're not tax dodgers. The jobs they create here are good, high-paying jobs. By raising taxes on these businesses by more than $7 billion over the next decade, we will make America a less attractive place for them to invest. 
   The majority keeps asserting that the Treasury Department supported this provision back in 2002. I want to set the record straight on that. It is true that Treasury wrote a report then that income-stripping and earning-stripping is a potential problem, but since that 2000 report, the Treasury has worked to update our tax treaties, inserting strong ``limitation of benefits'' language that prevents abuse by denying treaty benefits to companies headquartered elsewhere but who establish a shell company in the treaty country. 
   The Treasury has never, never embraced the sort of ham-handed policy that the majority is proposing in this bill. And Secretary Paulson made that clear to me yesterday in a letter me sent to me. 
   Another contention is that, ``Oh, the President's own budget contained this proposal.'' Wrong. The President's budget contained a targeted proposal that would raise over 10 years $2.6 billion. 
   Mr. Doggett's proposal, which is in the farm bill, raises $7 billion over 10 years. Is that the same proposal? Of course not. It's more than double. It's huge. It's broad. It's ham-handed. It will discourage investment in the United States, and we ought to reject it in this bill. It's bad policy; never should have been added to the farm bill; should have come through the Ways and Means Committee, where it's supposed to come, so we could have a good hearing and Mr. Doggett and I could debate it. But that didn't happen. We should vote against this bill. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6532. 
   I would say to my good friend, the chairman of the Transportation Committee, that I agree with him that the current financing structure for our transportation needs is inadequate. The bill before us today, though, I think just puts off the day that we will finally come to grips with the inadequacy of that financing structure and deal with it. And we should be dealing with the fundamental problem here and not just putting a patch, a temporary band-aid on it, such as this $8 billion transfer will do. 
   So while I'm in agreement with the underlying, I suppose, motive for this bill, I think it is ill-advised because of the precedent that is sets. And it puts off to another day--which is easy for us to do--grappling with the real serious problem of fundamental inadequate funding of our transportation system through the trust fund. 
   So with that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Madam Speaker, I have already talked here this morning about what I believe would be a bad precedent for budget policy that this bill represents. But even more regrettable, Madam Speaker, is I think this bill today represents another missed opportunity, and that missed opportunity has helped bring us to this point today. 
   The majority's absolute refusal to address record-high gasoline prices by increasing domestic energy production is something that has contributed to the reason we are here today. 
   I have argued on this floor many times in the past, not just in the context of the gasoline tax and the highway trust fund, but many times, that the way to bring sanity to our energy policy, and yes, the way to bring gasoline prices down, is to adopt a balanced energy policy for our country. 
   Think of a balanced energy price as a three-legged stool. The first leg, conservation; the second leg, alternative fuel development and production; and the third leg, just as important as the other two for the stool to stand, would be to increase the supply of traditional fossil fuels by allowing more drilling here in our own country and stop depending on drilling in other countries. 
   Let's develop our own resources. That would be a balanced policy that I think would contribute to bringing the price of oil down which would bring the price of gasoline down which would get more people on the highways driving more and add revenues to the highway trust fund. 
   But we have so far not been able to get that passed in this Democratically led Congress. The sooner we do that, the sooner we will have some relief of the strain on the highway trust fund. And we still have to address the long-term inadequacies of the financing structure for the highway system in this country. As I have said, I believe we ought to be doing that today. And I support that. 
   But, Madam Speaker, today I believe we are merely putting a Band-Aid on the problem. We are contributing to deteriorating, bad budget policy. The precedent of this bill shifting moneys from the general fund to the highway trust fund is a very dangerous one. It is a slippery slope, and we ought not do it. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this bill today, give us another chance to go back to the drawing board and come up with a much better solution to this problem and give us a chance to adopt a meaningful, structured energy policy for this country that will bring gasoline prices down and get more people on our highways. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, challenging times make for difficult choices, and these are certainly challenging times. We all understand the severity of the housing crisis. Single-family housing starts to decline to 647,000 in June of 2008, down nearly two-thirds since early 2006 and are now near their lowest level in a generation. There is currently a 10 1/2 -month supply of unsold homes, double the 10-year average. Home prices have been falling, defaults on foreclosures have been on the rise, and this contraction in the residential real estate market has become an anchor on our economy. 
   In the most critical recent development, the financial health of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has deteriorated markedly over the past 2 weeks, raising the prospect that these two companies, which own or guarantee nearly half of all United States mortgages, could fail. We must not let that happen. The stakes are simply too high and the risk of an even broader, more expensive financial bailout down the road is too great. And for that reason, I will, with great reluctance, support the legislation before us today--notwithstanding its numerous flaws--as it includes the plan developed by Secretary Paulson to provide a temporary Federal backstop in order to protect taxpayers from potentially enormous future exposure and our economy from perhaps unprecedented harm. 
   Having said that, I deeply regret that the majority has viewed Secretary Paulson's urgent request for legislation on Fannie and Freddie as an opportunity to push through a number of unrelated, highly controversial provisions as part of the broader package before us today. 
   While there are several tax proposals in this package that I do find worthwhile--such as the increase in the mortgage revenue bond allowance and a provision allowing low-income housing tax credits to be used against the AMT--the bill's tax title contains several objectionable provisions. 
   For example, the bill would provide an additional standard deduction for property taxes, which will effectively serve as a new form of revenue sharing for the States encouraging higher taxes on the State level. The bill would also restrict the capital gains exclusion on the sale of certain homes at a particularly precarious or sensitive time for our housing markets and the economy at large. I don't think that's well advised. 
   It also recycles a proposal to delay for 2 years the implementation of more favorable worldwide interest allocation rules that are designed to enhance the competitiveness of United States companies. And finally, it provides an extremely short time line for credit card companies to come into compliance with new and complex reporting rules. 
   Today's bill also contains a number of non-tax provisions beyond the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee that I oppose, including the affordable housing trust fund and a proposed $4 billion spending increase on Community Development Block Grants. 
   With respect to the latter provision, I would note that yet again the Ways and Means Committee is being used as the piggy bank to fund another committee's spending request. Curiously, while the majority is insisting on higher taxes to cover the cost of this increased CDBG spending, the majority has once again waived its own PAYGO rules on the overall bill itself, including with respect to the estimated $25 billion cost of Secretary Paulson's proposal on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While it is certainly not surprising to see the majority abandon its PAYGO principles yet again, it is worth noting that our friends on the other side of the aisle seem to cling to their increasingly empty PAYGO rhetoric only when it comes to extending expired tax provisions. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to express my disappointment with the procedural straitjacket imposed upon the minority in today's bill. Not only has the majority packaged Secretary Paulson's proposal on Fannie and Freddie together with a laundry list of objectionable provisions in a single take-it-or-leave-it bill with very little time for review, the minority has not been permitted to offer a single amendment, not a substitute, not even a motion to recommit. I don't think that this House is well served by the rules governing today's debate. 
   With all of that being said, Mr. Speaker, I will reluctantly support this package because of the urgent need to prevent Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and potentially our broader economy, from collapsing under the current strains in the housing market.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCRERY. With that, Mr. Speaker, let me just say I have heard some of my colleagues on my side of the aisle talk about the problems in this bill. 
   I certainly agree with many of their assessments of some provisions in this bill. One conclusion, though, that I disagree with is that a vote for this bill is irresponsible. I think, in fact, just the opposite. I think the responsible vote is to vote for this bill. 
   I think it is important that this bill pass today, not next week or in a special session in August, but today. I think timeliness is important, and the responsible vote, unfortunately, because there is a lot of things I disagree with in this bill, but the responsible vote, Mr. Speaker, is an ``aye'' vote today for this bill. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus).

<DOCNO>Mr. McCRERY. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this extraordinary, unprecedented, and, I believe, dangerous change to the House Rules. 
   Congress first gave trade promotion authority to the President in 1974, in order to allow him to engage directly with our competitors around the world to level the playing field, eliminate barriers to American exports and create jobs for American workers. 
   Passing this rule would undermine that authority and damage United States credibility abroad because our trading partners could rightfully question the commitments of our government in negotiating trade agreements. I have heard it said that this rule will allow us to consider this agreement this year after the election, but what this rule would do is to eliminate the uncertainty under TPA that Congress will vote on this agreement. 
   It doesn't guarantee a vote by any time certain. It doesn't push the vote off until after the election. It simply turns off the clock entirely. 
   Even postponing congressional consideration of this agreement does tremendous damage to America's competitiveness. Right now Canada, the European Union, are completing trade agreements with Colombia. As a result, they will gain a competitive advantage over American products.     
   Colombia will buy tractors, mining equipment and fertilizer from Canada, France, and Germany, instead of from Illinois, Georgia, and Texas. 
   Chairman Rangel, my good friend, said nobody is talking about the economic benefits, they are all talking about Hugo Chavez. Well, my good friend knows that is not the case. And besides, the reason we are not talking about it all that much is because it is a no-brainer from an economic standpoint. I am mystified as to why any Member would oppose this agreement when all it does is level the playing field for American workers. 
   Today, American workers compete against imports from Colombia that enter our country virtually duty free, while our exports going to Colombia face high tariffs. This agreement eliminates those obstacles to our goods and services and supports American jobs. 
   I agree with Chairman Rangel's assessment last month that denying a vote on this agreement wouldn't help address the concerns about labor violence in Colombia. In fact, this agreement would help Colombian labor unions. The agreement includes robust, enforceable international labor organization core labor standards, standards included with the strong support of the Democratic leadership to require Colombia to continue the tremendous progress it has made to improve labor rights. 
   I plead with my colleagues today: Do not make a vote which will undermine the credibility of the United States, making it more difficult for any future administration to eliminate barriers to the sale of products made by us. Vote ``no'' on this rule.
