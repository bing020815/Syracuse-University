<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde Global AIDS bill. As Congresswoman Barbara Lee just eloquently stated, it is poignant to those of us who knew these two great legislators to see the important expansion of this legislation occur after both of them have gone home to be with the Lord. But I can think of no better tribute to these men of character and vision and compassion than this legislation. 
   I commend Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their strong leadership. I also want to commend my colleague, Chris Smith, for his yeoman's work in preserving a delicate balance of this bill. Also Mr. Speaker, let me publicly acknowledge the work of our President, George W. Bush. Mr. President, because of your moral leadership and compassion, Africa will never be the same, and history will record your work. 
   The Bible tells us, ``To whom much is given much is expected.'' I believe the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in confronting the pandemic of HIV/AIDS. 
   The dimensions of this crisis are truly staggering. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has infected more than 60 million people worldwide, killed more than 25 million, a number that grows grievously every day by nearly 9,000. HIV/AIDS has orphaned some 14 million children. And today, 70 percent of the people in the world with HIV/AIDS reside in Africa. More startling, if current infection rates continue, new epicenters for the disease are likely to arise out of India, China and eastern Europe. 
   The threat this pandemic poses to our security is real. If not addressed, this plague will continue to undermine the stability of nations throughout the third world, leaving behind collapsing economies, tragedy, and desperation, which we all know is a breeding ground for extremist violence and terrorism. This is truly a global crisis. And because the United States of America can render timely assistance, I believe we must. 
   You know, every so often in this place we have the opportunity to do something, not just for the American people, but for humanity, and this is such a time. And this global AIDS bill seeks to address this crisis not only by providing medicine and health care to those in need, but also by providing funding resources for evidence-based programs that have been successful in preventing infection. 
   It's imperative, I believe, that we not only send our resources, but that we send them in a manner that is consistent with our values. We cannot send billions of dollars to Africa without sending values-based safeguards and techniques that work to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS by changing behavior, and this current version of the global AIDS bill includes those safeguards. 
   It was essential that we preserve these prevention methods that focus on behavioral change, and that we continue to work with faith-based, nongovernmental organizations that promote programs, including the ABC model, which has produced such undeniable results. 
   But as a conservative let me say, as we tend to the suffering abroad, we also have to figure out how to pay for it. The Federal budget, I believe, is filled with opportunities to responsibly fund this program, and I look forward to finding the right priorities to do just that.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5501, the ``Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde Global AIDS Bill.'' 
   The Bible tells us, `to whom much is given, much is expected,'' and I believe the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in confronting the pandemic of HIV/AIDS. 
   The dimensions of this crisis are truly staggering. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has infected more than 60 million people worldwide. It has killed more than 25 million, a number which grows grievously every day by more than  8,500. HIV/AIDS has orphaned some 14 million children. And today, 70 percent of the people in the world with HIV/AIDS reside in Africa. Within that continent there are entire countries where more than one-third of the adult population is infected. 
   More startling, if current infection rates continue, new epicenters for the disease are likely to arise out of India, China and Eastern Europe, with numbers that could surpass Africa in a few short years. 
   And the threat that this pandemic poses to our security is also real. If not addressed, this plague will continue to undermine the stability of nations throughout the third world, leaving behind collapsing economies and tragedy and desperation--a breeding ground for extremist violence and terrorism. 
   This is truly a global crisis and because the United States can render timely assistance, I believe we must. 
   You know, every so often in this place, we have the opportunity to do something for humanity and serve the American people--and this is such a time. 
   I thank Chairman BERMAN and Ranking Member ROS-LEHTINEN for their strong leadership. I commend my colleague, Mr. CHRIS SMITH, in particular for his yeoman's work on carefully preserving the delicate balance of this legislation. 
   And I'd also like to publicly acknowledge the work of our President, George W. Bush. Mr. President, because of your moral leadership and compassion, Africa will never be the same, and history will record your work. 
   And this Global AIDS bill seeks to address the crisis, not only by providing medicine and health care to those in need, but also by providing funding resources for evidence-based programs that have been successful in preventing infection. It is imperative, I believe, that we not only send our resources but also that we send them in a manner that is consistent with our values. We cannot send billions of dollars to Africa without sending values-based safeguards and techniques that work to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS by changing behavior. 
   Within the current version the Global AIDS bill that the Senate recently passed, these pivotal provisions exist in the form of a requirement to provide `balanced funding for prevention activities for sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS,' and to ensure that abstinence and faithfulness programs `are implemented and funded in a meaningful and equitable way.' This is enforced by requiring the Global AIDS Coordinator to report to the appropriate Congressional committee if funding for abstinence, delay of sexual debut, monogamy, or fidelity programs drops below 50 percent of the total sexual prevention program funding. 
   It was essential that we preserve prevention methods that focus on behavioral change, and that we work with faith-based and non-governmental organizations at the local level, in particular through the ABC Model, which has produced undeniable results. 
   As we tend to the suffering, through, we always have to figure out how we're going to pay for it. 
   The federal budget, I believe, is packed with wasteful and bloated programs, which could supply more than enough opportunities to cover the cost of the Lantos/Hyde Global AIDS bill. 
   When it comes time to fund this program in the appropriations process, I believe Congress should make the hard choices necessary to ensure that this global health crisis does not become a crisis of debt for our children and grandchildren. 
   I believe it is possible to be both responsible to our fiscal constraints while being obedient to our moral calling. The greatest of all human rights is the right to live. America is a nation of great wealth--wealth of resources, but more importantly, a wealth of compassion. The history of the world is filled with telling moments regarding the character of a people. Sometimes we are witness to mankind's great inhumanities. Other times we marvel at the beauty of mankind's selfless acts of compassion, when we rise above politics and raise up those in dire need. Let this be such a day. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   One year into the liberal Democrat majority in Congress, the economy is struggling. In the wake of more government spending, threats of tax increases, and energy legislation that did nothing to expand our access to domestic reserves, this massive American economy is slowing down. The time has come for Congress to act to stimulate the economy and stave off the possibility of a Democrat recession. This stimulus bill that will come to the floor today, while welcome, will not do enough to stimulate this economy.  Congress must do more. The Recovery, Rebate and Economic Stimulus Act is a shot in the arm for a patient in need of major surgery. 
   I will support this bill because I believe the American people are overtaxed. Putting money in the pockets of American families is a good thing. I never met a tax cut I didn't like. But this one comes close. Showering the landscape with government rebates is no way to truly strengthen the foundations of a free market economy. If we are serious about bolstering this economy and helping America's working families, we must make the President's tax cuts permanent and implement other tax reform focused on capital formation. 
   Congress should do more. But this is a small move in the right direction. For families struggling to make a mortgage payment or meet a college loan, for families ready to invest in a new car or a home, or for families simply fighting to keep food on the table, this relief is needed and welcomed. With this rebate, the American consumer will do their part to revive this economy, but I challenge Congress and all of our colleagues in both parties to do our part and demand that this legislation ultimately include tax relief for the wage payer as well as for the wage earner.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (THE TIME FOR EARMARK REFORM HAS ARRIVED -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the American people are tired of spending-as-usual here in Washington, DC, especially when it comes to earmarking. Now, earmarking, for the uninitiated, is a process in Congress which has expanded greatly over the last 15 years under Republican control of Congress and, as we saw last year, under Democrat control of Congress. It is where Members of Congress oftentimes, for perfectly meritorious and honorable reasons, request specific projects for their districts. But the American people know that something has gone wrong with the Federal budget process system, and the time for earmark reform has arrived. 
   This past weekend I'm pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, that House Republicans gathered in West Virginia and came together around a bipartisan challenge. We called on Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats to join us in a timeout on earmarking in Washington, DC. 
   House Republicans united behind a challenge for an earmark moratorium and the establishment of a new select committee that would engage in the kind of thoughtful analysis and hearings where we could truly change the way we spend the people's money. 
   When you are flying an airplane and the gauges start to tell you something is wrong with the engines, the first thing you do, Mr. Speaker, is put the airplane on the ground. Then you get under the hood and you figure out what is wrong. 
   Well, I have to tell you that the explosion of earmarks under Republican control in the past years and the inclusion of hundreds of unexamined earmarks in last year's omnibus bill, dropped in at the last minute under the color of darkness, are evidence that the gauge lights are going off. 
   We need to call a timeout, have a moratorium on earmark spending here in the Congress while we can come together, men and women, Republicans and Democrats, and figure out how we restore public confidence in the way we spend the people's money. 
   By challenging Speaker Pelosi and the House majority to join us in ending earmarks as usual in Washington, DC, House Republicans have thrown down the gauntlet of reform. 
   And I believe that while I still think our side should embrace an immediate moratorium on earmarks and lead by example, I applaud my colleagues for finding that common ground among Republicans wherein we can challenge, in a spirit of bipartisanship, our colleagues to join us. 
   Now, I still maintain nothing short of a full moratorium followed by public hearings and reform will be sufficient to restore public confidence in congressional appropriations. 
   But as those debates have gone on, it is amazing to me, Mr. Speaker, to look at the morning headlines here in Washington, DC. It shows you the difference between the Muncie Star Press and newspapers out here. Earmarks are page 1, the focus on the ``President's sudden severity is drawing bipartisan criticism.'' Roll Call says, ``Earmarks Still Roil GOP,'' and the Politico, not to be outdone, repeats the exact same headline: ``Earmark Debate Roils GOP Ranks.'' 
   It is only in Washington, DC, where one party engages in a vigorous debate about how we restore public confidence in the Federal budget process that the focus then is on the debate of the party that wants to bring about change because the sound of silence from the Democrat majority is deafening. 
   Now, while Republicans are having a vigorous debate, and I'm still one of the people that believes that our party should even go farther, that we should embrace a 1-year moratorium, I have advocated that among my colleagues and will continue to. But nevertheless, it is remarkable to me that the Washington press corps is more interested in discussions among Republicans who  have arrived at a consensus challenging the governing majority to join us in an earmark moratorium than they are interested in the response of the majority who hold the reins of power. 
   I mean, headlines attest to a vigorous debate among the minority and dead silence among the majority. 
   And I must tell you, it has to be frustrating, Mr. Speaker, to millions of Americans who long for a Congress that will put integrity and the restoration of public confidence in the Federal budget above partisan differences. 
   So I say to my colleagues on the other side, what is your response to our challenge for an immediate moratorium on all earmark spending? What will Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats decide at their conference retreat this week? 
   My hope is as our challenge sits now on the table and is met with stark silence from the Democrats, that as your party meets, Mr. Speaker, as you consider how we can restore public confidence, that Democrats will join Republicans in an immediate earmark moratorium so we can put our fiscal house in order and restore public confidence.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (CALLING ON CHINA TO END HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES PRIOR TO THE OLYMPICS -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding; thank him for his strong moral leadership on this issue. And I want to commend the ranking member and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee for having the moral courage to bring this resolution to the House before Congress adjourns. 
   It is important that we speak truth to power. And with the 2008 Olympics in Beijing about to begin, it is important that the people of the United States be heard on our ideals, as athletes from around the globe and global media descend on China. 
   It is important that we say, as the late Tom Lantos, chairman of this committee, said in a hearing last year, a few months before his death, ``China is a police state.'' 
   I personally believe that the selection of China as the site of the 2008 Olympic Games was a historic error. The Olympics is a symbol of the human spirit, and in that regard, a symbol of human freedom. And this police state, therefore, is precisely the wrong venue for a celebration of human dignity and the human spirit. 
   And so I commend to my colleagues support for H. Res. 1370. I am particularly grateful for the call on the government of the People's Republic of China to end abuses of human rights, to release those imprisoned for political and religious expression, and also challenging China to honor its commitment to freedom of the press of foreign reporters. 
   But I must say, while there is much talk in the media today about the crowd of smog hanging over Beijing as these games approach, let me say from my heart, the real cloud over the Beijing Olympics is the horror of forced abortion. And therefore, I am especially grateful to Congressman CHRIS SMITH, from whom we just heard, for adding an important amendment to this resolution noting that, whereas the Chinese government limits most women to having one child and strictly controls the reproductive lives of Chinese citizens by systematic means that include mandatory monitoring of women's reproductive cycles, mandatory sterilization and contraception, mandatory birth permits, coercive fines for failure to comply and the like, that this legislation will call on Congress to--excuse me--call on the People's Republic of China to immediately end the practice of forced abortion. 
   And make no mistake about it, China's policy requires that unpermitted babies be aborted. Article 25 of the Henan Province Population and Family Planning Regulations reads: ``Under any of the following conditions, necessary remedial measures shall be taken and pregnancy terminated under the guidance of family planning technical service workers: Pregnancy out of wedlock, pregnancy without a certificate, or where the party already has one child.'' 
   In the committee, Madam Speaker, we heard the most horrific stories of these so-called family planning technical service workers literally breaking into homes, dragging women in their ninth month of pregnancies off to clinics, forcing abortions on them and, in one case after another, going to horrific means to ensure that the newly born child's life had been completely snuffed out. There is not time in this debate to recount those instances, but they are legion in China, and they are the result of heartbreak among tens of millions of that country of good and decent people. 
   And so I commend the chairman of this committee, Mr. Berman, for his leadership. I commend Mr. Chabot for his leadership, and especially the gentleman from New Jersey, a leading voice for the sanctity of life in the United States of America, for ensuring that this legislation, this resolution comes before the Olympics, that we speak truth to power to the People's Republic of China; that here in the United States of America, the people of this country will say, with one voice, we believe in freedom and we believe in life, and we reject the policy of forced abortion in China, and urge them to do likewise at this time.

   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, the American people deserve more access to American oil. And now that the President has lifted the ban on offshore drilling, Congress must not adjourn until the American people get a vote on more domestic drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   In a day when some in this body say it is their duty to ``save the planet,'' I prefer the words of Daniel Webster that are chiseled on the wall behind me. He said a century ago, ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers.'' And so I add to my colleagues, let us develop the resources of our land. Let us give the American people more access to American oil. 
   Americans won't get a vacation from high gas prices, so Congress should not take a vacation until we vote to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Madam Speaker, do not adjourn this Congress until we give the bipartisan, pro-drilling majority a vote on more access to our oil reserves.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, in 1998 the Republican Congress enacted the State Children's Health Insurance Program to help children of families near poverty. 
   But now, true to their big government agenda, the Democrat Congress has sent the President a massive increase in the SCHIP program that will usher in a new era of socialized medicine in America. This bill will take a program designed to help children near the poverty level and expand it to include families with incomes of up to $83,000 a year, and Democrats would pay for this middle-class entitlement with a 61 cent per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. 
   Let's provide health insurance for children of the poor and the near poor, but let's reject a liberal Democratic Congress's attempt to create middle-class entitlements on the backs of American smokers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule and, more to the point, in opposition to the housing omnibus package, $300 billion bailout, corporate welfare in this country. 
   It is extraordinary, after having endured the first three terms of my career in Congress and oftentimes being castigated for those aspects of the Republican agenda to try and promote business and try and encourage corporate investment in this country, how many times I and my colleagues were chastised for corporate welfare on the floor of this Congress, and yet we come here today with this extraordinary bailout for Wall Street, disguised as housing assistance for hurting Americans. 
   Now, let me say, I have great sympathy for those affected by the current housing crisis. I'd like to see our housing markets and our neighborhoods stabilized, but a $300 billion taxpayer bailout to lenders and speculators who made poor decisions is not the answer, and it's not fair to millions upon millions of Americans who have sat down month after month at the kitchen table and figured out how to make those mortgage payments, who have taken on a second job and sometimes a third job to make the mortgage payment. And it's not fair to nearly one-third of the American public that rents. 
   When my wife and I first got started out, I remember we rented our first place. We saved our pennies to be able to make that down payment, to get that FHA loan and to get our dream started. Now along comes Congress with this enormous handout, which, as the gentleman from Texas said, says to lenders, if you'll take a 15 percent haircut, a 15 percent hit, we'll move your liability on to the taxpayers, on to taxpayers who have rented, who have saved, who have scrimped. 
   They ought not to be required to pay this bailout for Americans. There are alternatives that we should support.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (IT'S TIME TO PASS A FEDERAL MEDIA SHIELD LAW -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, the Constitution of the United States provides that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. These two rights form the bedrock of our democracy by ensuring the free flow of information to the American people. 
   Sadly, today, the free and independent press in America is under fire. In recent years, more than 40 journalists have been subpoenaed, questioned or held in contempt for failure to reveal their confidential sources. 
   For a journalist, maintaining an assurance of confidentiality to a source is sometimes the only way to bring forward news of great consequence to the Nation. Being forced to reveal a source chills reporting of the news, and, thereby, restricts the free flow of information to the public. 
   Now, not long ago, a reporter's assurance of confidentiality was unquestioned. That assurance led to sources that willingly provided information to journalists who brought forward news of enormous consequence to the Nation. One thinks of Watergate, recent stories of misfeasance at Walter Reed Army medical center, and even the abuse of steroids in major league baseball. 
   All of these stories never would have come to the light, stories great and small, were it not for confidential sources and the dogged persistence of a free and independent press. As a conservative who believes in a limited government, I believe the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press. 
   A free press ensures the flow of information to the public, and in this time of scandals and rumors of scandals and corruption in high places, such information is needed now more than ever to hold those in power to account. In order to maintain our free and independent press, I authored the Free Flow of Information Act with Congressman RICK BOUCHER of Virginia several years ago. This bill is also known as a Federal media shield statute. It provides a qualified privilege of confidentiality to journalists, which enables them to shield sources from disclosure in certain situations. 
   Now, the bill is not about protecting reporters, it's about protecting the public's right to know. We introduced the bill in May of 2007, and on October 16 of last year, it passed in this House of Representatives by an overwhelming and bipartisan margin of 398-21. I was especially pleased to earn the support of Republican and Democratic leadership, the chairman and ranking members of the Intelligence and Armed Services Committee, and many other leaders throughout the House of Representatives. 
   The bill received wide bipartisan support because of measures we added to specifically address very real and legitimate concerns about how a privilege for journalists could impact national security. The Federal Government, as we know, is tasked with a tremendous responsibility of protecting the Nation. We must always put national security in the forefront of our consideration. 
   The Free Flow of Information Act does just that. Well, with news that the United States Senate may be taking up a version of this legislation as soon as next week, I wanted to rise to speak about the bill and what some of its critics may say. 
   Critics of the bill will point always to concerns about national security. But our version of the bill only provides a qualified privilege, meaning that disclosure of a source's identity may be required in certain situations. The foremost of those situations, of course, is when the Nation's security is placed at risk. The bill permits compelled disclosure to prevent or identify the perpetrator of an act of terrorism against the United States or its allies, to prevent significant or specified harm to national security, or, in cases that involved the unauthorized disclosure of classified information that caused or will cause significant or articulable harm to national security. In such cases, a judge will be able to determine whether the public interest, in compelling disclosure of a source, outweighs the public interest in gathering or disseminating news or information. 
   Overall, I sincerely believe the bill strikes a reasonable balance between the public's right to know and the fair administration of justice. In striking that balance, the version of the legislation that passed this House puts national security first. 
   Long ago Thomas Jefferson warned, ``Our liberty cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that limited without danger of losing it.'' Jefferson's words hold true today. 
   The passage of the Free Flow of Information Act in this Congress is necessary not only to explicitly and fully provide for the freedom and press of our Nation, but also to protect our liberty for future generations of Americans. With the extraordinary bipartisan support of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, and support in the United States Senate, which includes both major party candidates for President of the United States, it is my hope that the United States Senate will take up the Free Flow of Information Act and report it next week with a strong bipartisan affirmation.

   Mr. PENCE. As many Democrats make plans to cut or restrict funding to our troops in Iraq, yesterday before the Foreign Affairs Committee a dissenting voice came from a surprising place. Richard Holbrook was the former Assistant Secretary of State for the Clinton administration and has worked in diplomatic roles for every Democratic President since Lyndon Johnson. 
   Yesterday, Ambassador Holbrook appeared before our committee and I asked him directly, Do you oppose efforts to eliminate or reduce funding to our troops on the ground in Iraq? Ambassador Holbrook responded: ``I do, I oppose it.'' When I asked him to elaborate, he went on to say: ``I think that if the Commander in Chief has deployed the troops, the ultimate weapon of denying them the resources to carry out their mission only puts them in harm's way, greater harm's way. I would remind you that we cannot cut the troop funding.'' 
   I commend Ambassador Holbrook for his storied career in American foreign affairs and his willingness to speak truth to power, even the power of many in his own political party. 
   As Ambassador Holbrook said yesterday before the Foreign Affairs Committee: ``We cannot cut off funding for our troops.''

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the element of the rules package that we will consider today, but I do so conflicted; conflicted, because as a long-time advocate of earmark reform and fiscal discipline, I am in large measure encouraged by the efforts of my colleagues in the new Democratic majority to step forward in good faith and open the process whereby we spend the people's money to greater transparency, particularly in the area of earmarks. 
   I say from the heart that I appreciate the substantive reforms and transparency and accountability that my Democratic colleagues will bring forward today on earmark reform. That being said, I will oppose this element of the rules package having to do with the pay-as-you-go provisions, which, while they sound in a common sense way attractive, this particular version I believe is lacking for three reasons: 
   Number one, I believe it is a weak and watered down version of PAYGO proposals of the past, including Democrat party PAYGO proposals of the past. 
   Number two, it doesn't reduce current spending levels or require a reduction of current spending levels. 
   Number three, it is, as so many of my colleagues have said, a means of justifying tax increases on working families, small businesses and family farms. In a very real sense, the American people ought to know that this proposal translates to you-pay-as-Congress-goes on spending. 
   In the category of a watered down provision, other PAYGO versions were enforced by across-the-board spending cuts. That is what created the incentive to control spending. But the Democrats PAYGO proposal is only enforced by a point of order, which can be waived fairly easily, as we all know.  
   Secondly, it only applies to new spending. Mr. Speaker, I say with some pain, having been a part of the former majority, but we currently don't pay for what goes out the door now. The 2007 budget right now is projected at $286 billion in deficit. This does nothing to require us to address our current deficits. 
   Lastly, as others have argued, I truly believe that by assuming that the 2001 and 2003 tax relief will automatically expire, this Democrat PAYGO provision will cause a substantial tax increase for working families, small businesses and family farms. 
   The American people just simply need to know, however well-intentioned, and I assume good intentions by my colleagues in the newly-minted majority, however well intentioned, I believe this PAYGO provision comes up short. It is, in a very real sense, the American people pay, as Congress goes on spending

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this SCHIP proposal. I see this as a bad deal for America, which is not to say that I oppose a reauthorization of this program or its essential elements. And in the continuing resolution this week, we will see to it that this program does not lapse as a virtue of my vote. 
   But beyond the budget gimmickry, beyond increasing taxpayer liability for illegal immigrants, this compromise is no deal the American people should accept. 
   It is interesting that a health insurance program for poor kids doesn't require your kids to be poor. Families with incomes of up to $83,000 a year could be entitled to assistance in health insurance in this program. Also, a State program to provide health insurance for children doesn't require families to have children to participate. This program allows childless adults to continue to receive SCHIP through 2012. 
   Also, it pays for all of this by raising taxes 61 cents per pack and more on cigars. The headline ought to read, ``Smokers in America to pay for middle class welfare.'' 
   Congress should reject this SCHIP program, continue this program, and reject all of the bad elements of this bad deal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. I also thank the ranking member and the distinguished chairman of this committee for their extraordinary and visionary work in bringing H.R. 1400 to the floor of this Congress to enhance United States diplomatic efforts with respect to Iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against Iran. 
   As the ranking member and my other senior colleagues have described, this legislation would continue an expanding effort to confront Iran's rhetoric and reality in a manner both diplomatic and economic. And the reasons to do so are legion. Iran, for instance, denies the Holocaust and hosted a Holocaust-denying conference which aired on Arab television across the region. 
   President Ahmadinejad, as I will describe in a moment, has repeatedly advocated ``wiping Israel off the map.'' Their headlong and reckless pursuit of a nuclear weapons program ominously would enable them to do that in a matter of minutes when combined with their missile technology. 
   Iran supplies and trains insurgents fighting U.S. forces and Iraqi forces in Iraq, as General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker and the physical evidence and the incarceration of Iranian intelligence personnel now in Baghdad attest. Iran supports Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist organizations. 
   But I want to speak specifically, Mr. Speaker, to yesterday and today's events involving the Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who arrived yesterday for a forum in Columbia University and an address at the United Nations today. Let me be clear: If my colleagues have no other reason to support H.R. 1400, we can look to the rhetoric and the statements in the past 48 hours of President Ahmadinejad. He is a destabilizing force leading a threatening country and gave evidence of that repeatedly in statements on American television, Columbia University, and I expect at the U.N. today. 
   Ahmadinejad veers regularly between the deadly and the bizarre. He is perhaps best known for the menacing statements about advocating the elimination of the State of Israel. But at last year's address to the U.N. General Assembly, President Ahmadinejad told an Iranian cleric that he had felt the hand of God entrancing world leaders as he addressed that body. All of these various threats and outrages are delivered with a trademark eery grin, which would be easy to dismiss as the rantings of a madman were he not vested with the power of a head of state. Yet his musings are as clear and as threatening as those musings written in a prison cell in the 1930s entitled ``Mein Kampf.'' 
   This is a man who is on a misguided mission; he is a dangerous and deluded leader. We ignore his intents at our peril. While his speech at Columbia University yesterday was described as a rambling speech by the New York Times that meandered from science to religion to the creation of human beings, it was his claim that he was a ``peaceful'' man, that Iran possessed, as he made some reference to, a thriving Jewish community, and his claim that Iran was a country where no homosexuals lived. For me, I cannot decide which of those statements was more Orwellian or more offensive to reality or to western respect for individual liberty. But they do give us a window into the mindset of a leader. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I believe no terrorist despot deserves an Ivy League forum, and have said so. On ``60 Minutes'' Sunday night, Ahmadinejad refused to address what we all know to be true: his forces and weaponry, as I said before, are directly implicated in the deaths of American forces in Iraq, and that would have been reason enough to deny him a podium. 
   Now, we are occasionally told, and maybe some will hesitate to support this legislation today because Ahmadinejad is not in charge, that some believe a relatively moderate group of clerics are the real power in Iran. But in a military parade just Saturday, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, allegedly a moderate in some versions, had a banner displayed alongside him that read: ``The Iranian Nation is ready to bring any oppressive power to its knees.'' Clearly, this threatening posture is deep-seated; it is not focused on one man. 
   But I think as we argue today for H.R. 1400 to bring additional economic sanctions against Iran, we should look at the man who is the leader of the country. H.R. 1400, sponsored by our distinguished chairman and ranking minority member, does the reasonable step of imposing additional economic sanctions against Iran. 
   But let me say I believe it is imperative that we must continue to use every tool in our power to pressure and isolate this dangerous and threatening regime. And the people of the United States of America, the U.N. Security Council, our neighbors and allies in the region also need to be prepared to keep all options on the table as we confront this regime. It is my hope H.R. 1400, with its diplomatic and economic initiative, will prevail and bring Iran back from the nuclear brink, and that would be my prayer. But we must remain committed to the notion that this nation and this leader in Iran must not be permitted to come into possession of a usable nuclear weapon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, it is said that if a picture is worth 1,000 words, this picture tells the tale of the worst series of storms to strike southern Indiana in 100 years. 
   I rise today to commend and recognize the extraordinary contributions, though, of emergency management, disaster response, elected officials, community leaders and everyday Hoosiers in my district during this last week of devastating weather. I particularly want to honor EMA directors, sheriffs, mayors and county officials in Rush, Johnson and Bartholomew counties, Indiana. 
   They suffered greatly from tornados, heavy rains, flooding, creating a catastrophe that awaits additional presidential response, but this catastrophe did not await the response by these public servants. They went above and beyond the call of duty, showing great poise, saving lives and serving the people of their communities. 
   Hoosier communities and families are hurting and need to know that more help is on the way. As I rise to commend these government officials and everyday Hoosiers for their response, I urge this administration again to declare an expedited major disaster for all 44 counties of Indiana affected by these historic storms.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, unlike the previous speaker from Illinois, whom I greatly respect, I support the war in Iraq. I have supported it from the beginning. I support providing the resources to our soldiers who are in the fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. I pray for some 3,000 Indiana soldiers who are on the ground in Operation Iraqi Freedom every day. But though I support providing our soldiers with the resources they need to get the job done and come home safe, I cannot support this war supplemental bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the American people need to know what is going on here. I mean, this is a backroom deal for $250 billion that includes $72 billion in domestic spending that has nothing whatsoever to do with our soldiers and the war on terror. It also will increase taxes on working families by $51 billion. Higher taxes and higher domestic spending put on the backs of our soldiers is indecent, Mr. Speaker.  
   When my colleague from Illinois speaks about decency, it is indecent to come to this floor and play politics with our troops during a time of war. This Congress should bring a clean supplemental bill to this floor that provides our soldiers with the resources they need to get the job done and come home safe, not billions of dollars in domestic spending and higher taxes. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation to reject playing politics with our troops in the field.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, today Congress is once again poised to pass legislation that authorizes the use of Federal tax dollars to fund the destruction of human embryos for scientific research, and I oppose it. 
   I believe that life begins at conception. A human embryo is a human life, and therefore I do think it is morally wrong to create human life to destroy it for research. 
   But while supporters of this bill will argue this debate is a battle between science and ideology, that really misses the point. The debate today is not about whether we should do embryonic stem cell research. It is legal in all 50 States of this country. The debate today is about who pays for it. 
   It is simply morally wrong to take the taxpayer dollars of millions of pro-life Americans who believe that life is sacred and use it to fund the destruction of human embryos for research. 
   The debate today is not really about what an embryo is. The debate is about who we are as a Nation and whether we will respect the deeply held moral views of more than half of our citizenry. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Having been here before, I expect its passage. On behalf of millions of pro-life Americans, I say, Mr. President, veto this bill again.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his strong and clarion remarks on this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule and rise to oppose the underlying bill as well. 
   I must tell you, as I listened to the gentlelady from Ohio bring her remarks to the floor, I want to say, there they go again. There they go again, telling the American people that this is a debate between science and ideology when, in fact, destructive embryonic stem cell research, despite my strong moral objections, is completely legal in the United States of America. 
   The debate today is not about whether embryonic stem cell research, research that destroys a human embryo for scientific research, should take place. This is just about who pays for it. 
   I can understand why Members of the majority want to focus on this false choice between science and ideology.  The language like America becoming a hostile environment for medical research is amusing me, because destructive embryonic stem cell research, and I say this with a heavy heart, is legal in all 50 States in America. It is simply that liberals in this country are not content to simply have research that destroys human embryos for unproven human science, but they want me to pay for it. They want tens of millions of Americans who, like I do, believe that life begins at conception to see their taxpayer dollars used to fund research that they find morally objectionable. That's really the issue. 
   The debate is not about whether we should do embryonic stem cell research, would that it was, would that we were here on the floor actually debating along the fault lines of science and morality. I am ready for that debate. Forty-eight years and nine months ago today, I was an embryo. I am ready to have the debate about the sanctity and the value of human life. But we are not having that debate today. 
   America since Roe v. Wade has moved past the issue that was framed so eloquently by the late President Ronald Reagan. He said, we cannot diminish the value of one category of one human life without diminishing the value of all human life.     
   But our Supreme Court made a decision decades ago that we would put choice above life. But I will stay in that moral debate. But, again, it's not what we're about today. And any one of my colleagues here on the floor and anyone listening in, let's at least be honest about what we're talking about. And that is, this debate is not about whether we should do embryonic stem cell research. And I know we've heard from wonderful scientists on our side of the aisle who've reminded us, inconvenient for the majority, that 100 percent of the scientific breakthroughs that have taken place in stem cell research have taken place in adult stem cell research. There's not been a single therapy developed from embryonic stem cell research, and there are scientific reasons why we can expect that there never will be, given the instability of nascent human life at that stage. But I'm not an expert in that area. 
   You know, I'm a guy; I come from south of Highway 40 in Indiana. I keep things real simple. This is just a debate about who pays for research that destroys human embryos. And I simply want to say again, this debate is not really about what an embryo is. This debate is about who we are as a Nation; whether or not Congress will, as they did before, send legislation to the President of the United States that will take the taxpayer dollars of millions of pro-life Americans and use it to fund research that they find morally objectionable. But I can count, Mr. Speaker. I expect this legislation will pass again. But I thank God that we have a President in the White House who will, I have every confidence, veto this legislation just as he did before, and that we have a tenacious pro-life minority in this House that will defend the President's veto. 
   Let me say, again, I believe that life begins at conception. And I believe it's morally wrong to create human life to destroy it for scientific research. But that is not what this debate is about. This debate is not about whether we should do embryonic stem cell research; it's about who pays for it. And liberals in this Congress are not content simply to have embryonic stem cell research legal in all 50 States. They want pro-life Americans like me to get our wallets out and finance it, and I'm not having that, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (CONGRATULATING THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS FOR WINNING SUPER BOWL XLI -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in this bipartisan gathering with thanks to the leadership of Congresswoman Julia Carson to congratulate the world champion Indianapolis Colts. I congratulate the gentlewoman from Indianapolis for her leadership on this resolution and its eloquent drafting. 
   As others of my colleagues have suggested, the Colts' victory was not just a demonstration of athletic prowess, but it was a moment where I think the world got to see a little bit of Indiana on the world stage. They got to see the kind of serious work ethic, humility, commitment to getting the job done without a lot of flash and a lot of fanfare that really characterizes the people of Indiana. 
   As Congressman Burton said, I also had the privilege, along with my wife Karen, of witnessing some history, not only the first world championship to come to Indianapolis, but also I saw the first African American coach lead a team to the Super Bowl, and to see two great teams led by two African American coaches shatter that glass ceiling, that for reasons of culture and habit had somehow been long established, in that stadium for that great championship game. 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, it is said that attitude reflects leadership, and I believe that Coach Tony Dungy really personifies just the type of leadership that deserves rewarding in the NFL and is heralded in the State of Indiana. 
   Let me say that Coach Dungy should be admired not only for that calm, steady leadership on the sidelines, but also his career off the field is equally impressive. Since his time in Tampa Bay, he brought his commitment to Christian values to young people through the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He launched Mentors for Life, a program that provided tickets to young people for home games and their mentors. And I was there about a year ago when Coach Dungy, one of many such occasions around the country, spoke in Anderson, Indiana, to a stadium full of young people about his profound faith in Christ and about his belief in the relationship of character to success. 
   But we also celebrate Peyton Manning, the man awarded with Most Valuable Player in the Super Bowl, and of course now a man who others have said has minted his reputation as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. He personifies a humility and a work ethic that I believe are rightly celebrated. 
   Let me close by saying, as Peyton Manning remarked on being selected MVP, he said, ``I am excited, but I am proud to be on this team.'' 
   I would like to close my remarks today by asking unanimous consent to add to the Congressional Record the names of all of the members of the Colts' offense, defense, substitutions and the coaching staff, because this truly was a team effort. It was men and women in the head offices, and on the fields, on the training staff, and the catching staff that brought this world championship home to our capital city. 
   They have our praise, our congratulations.  
   Offense: Reggie Wayne--Wide Receiver, Tarik Glenn--Offensive Tackle, Ryan Lilja--Offensive Guard, Jeff Saturday--Center, Jake Scott--Offensive Guard, Ryan Diem--  Offensive Tackle, Dallas Clark--Tight End, Marvin Harrison--Wide Receiver, Peyton Manning--Quarterback, Joseph Addai--Running Back, and Ben Utecht--Tight End.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support as an original cosponsor of House Resolution 912, condemning the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and reaffirming the commitment of the United States to assist the people of Pakistan in combating terrorist activity and promoting a free and democratic Pakistan. 
   Let me begin by commending the chairman of the subcommittee, on which I serve as ranking member, for taking his usual efforts with speed and sensitivity and professionalism to bring this resolution to the floor forthwith. I also want to commend Chairman Lantos. And I would take note of the presence of the Speaker of the House on the floor. This is an important resolution for this Congress to embrace, and it is important in the wake of this tragedy that it be the first thing this Congress do in this year. 
   All of us, as we were enjoying time with our families in the immediate aftermath for many of us of a memorable Christmas, we were struck by the extraordinary and tragic events of 27 December 2007. As my colleague, Mr. Kennedy, just said, some of us were closer to those events at the time than others, but they were events that shattered the hopes of the entire world for a move in the midst of our critical ally, Pakistan, from a military dictatorship to democracy. 
   And while there is always second-guessing about decisions that were made and policies that were made, let  me say squarely, as does this resolution, the blame for this outrage, the blame for this tragedy lies squarely with the assassins. They alone are responsible for the horrific death of Benazir Bhutto. In fact, an al Qaeda commander and spokesman, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, gloated to the Italian news agency that they had ``terminated the most precious American asset which vowed to defeat the mujahadeen.'' 
   And, of course what makes this tragedy so moving and this congressional action so timely is that the former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto knew the stakes. She knew precisely the dangers into which she was entering. In a late November interview even with Parade magazine here in the States, she said, ``It is only now that America has awakened to what we are already fighting, namely, Islamic jihadists.'' 
   As the ranking member of the full committee said moments ago, eloquently, Secretary of State Rice called Benazir Bhutto ``a woman of great courage.'' And courage is a word we throw around a lot in political life, it seems, but it was in this moment that I was struck with the reality of courage. Courage is not the absence of fear; courage is action on one's principles in the midst of fear. One has to know that this 54-year-old Harvard and Oxford graduate, giving up a life of luxury in exile, knew the dangers that faced her and the mortal peril in which she was walking on behalf of a free and democratic Pakistan. One cannot fail but be moved by that. If there was any doubt, then the immediate attack upon her on 18 October 2007, which left some 145 of her supporters dead, relieved all doubt of the danger in which she was entering. And yet Benazir Bhutto, the first woman elected to lead a Muslim country, went forward, continued to take the risk, continued to advocate freedom, and paid the ultimate sacrifice. 
   I will say that while I want to acknowledge her unapologetically secular approach to leadership in government, I can't help, when I look at Benazir Bhutto, to think that she will long be remembered with a verse that comes out of a Christian tradition, which is, that greater love has no man or, if I may, woman, than this than to lay down their life for their friends. 
   Benazir Bhutto showed a love for the people of Pakistan. She showed a love for freedom. And in this resolution, the United States of America by its Congress will reaffirm to the people of Pakistan our commitment to justice in this instance, and our commitment to see stability and democracy reign in that critical ally. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to rise again to express my strong support of this resolution and urge as near a unanimous adoption of this resolution as this Congress can muster. 
   I want to commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman) for his swift and sympathetic and thoughtful legislative workmanship on this measure. As I said before, I think, given the tragic events of 27 December 2007, it is important that this Congress be heard on a resolution condemning this assassination, and it is important that it be the first substantive measure that this Congress takes up. And I commend Mr. Ackerman, the chairman of the committee Mr. Lantos, and Speaker Pelosi for facilitating that, as I do my colleagues on the committee in the minority. 
   This resolution condemns in the strongest possible terms the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. It supports efforts by Pakistan to bring to justice those who have perpetrated this cruel and cowardly act. It welcomes the provision of assistance by the government of the United Kingdom, and it commends the government of Pakistan for accepting such assistance. 
   In addition, it urges the people and the government of Pakistan to be relentless in their pursuit of a democratically elected government, including the holding of free and fair elections at the earliest possible opportunity. It urges support for a free media. 
   And perhaps in the seventh paragraph, as I close, Madam Speaker, it, this resolution, which I hope and trust will be unanimously adopted today, reaffirms the commitment of the United States to assist the people of Pakistan in combating terrorist activity and promoting a free and democratic Pakistan. 
   I quote again the words of the late and, no one would argue, great Benazir Bhutto who said just this fall in an American magazine, ``It's only now that America has awakened to what we were already fighting, Islamic jihadists.'' 
   I believe the greatest legacy that Benazir Bhutto could leave is not only a legacy of a democratically elected government in her country, but it would be a legacy of a further awakening in the world to the threat that free societies and those that seek to be free face from radical Islamic jihadists. If her legacy can be not only progress for her people toward democracy, but progress in the free world to renewing our determination to confront those who oppose our way of life with violence, both in support of the Pakistani Government and in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, if I might add, then that would be a powerful and meritorious legacy indeed. 
   I urge support of all of my colleagues for this important resolution. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this motion to recommit with instructions. Part of my responsibilities here in the Congress are that I serve as the ranking Republican member on the Middle East Subcommittee on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. As such, I have been intimately involved in the development of the underlying legislation and am strongly supportive of it. 
   But I think it is also imperative that we adopt this motion to recommit and add language that addresses an issue of great concern to the United States of America, to Afghanistan, and to the free world. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are receiving numerous reports that Iranian-made arms are being shipped to Afghanistan and transferred to the Taliban and other radical Islamic forces that seek to kill U.S. troops and Afghan forces.     
   This past April, General Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed that, ``We have intercepted weapons in Afghanistan headed for the Taliban that were made in Iran.'' 
   This past Monday, on a visit to Kabul, Defense Secretary Robert Gates noted that the weapons are flowing not only to the Taliban but to drug traffickers as well. ``There have been indications over the past few months of weapons coming in from Iran. Some weapons,'' he said, ``are coming into Afghanistan destined for the Taliban, but perhaps also for criminal elements involved in the drug trafficking coming from Iran.'' 
   The arms transferred reportedly include mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, C-4 explosives, surface-to-air missiles reportedly supplied by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and rockets with a 30-mile range. 
   Most disturbingly, an explosively formed projectile, an EFP, similar in characteristics to the Iranian-made ones that have killed our soldiers in Iraq, were recently discovered in Kabul. 
   Given Iran's unceasingly hostile rhetoric and actions in opposition to the United States, our interests and our allies, and given that these weapons were made in Iran, it is very reasonable to draw the conclusion that the Iranian regime transferred these arms to the Taliban. 
   We cannot allow Iran to undermine U.S. efforts and kill our soldiers in Afghanistan or to return that country to the status of a failed State and pave the way for increased terrorism against the West. 
   What we must do, simply, is to confront and respond to any efforts to subvert our efforts and kill our troops in Afghanistan. 
   As General Pace noted, ``I think we should continue to be aggressive inside of Iraq, and aggressive inside of Afghanistan, in attacking any element that's attacking U.S. and coalition forces, regardless of where they come from.'' 
   If we are to be vigilant in protecting the lives of our soldiers and our allies' soldiers and security forces, we cannot tie the hands of our President and our commanders in the field. They need to have every option at their disposal and opportunity to combat an insidious threat from Iran that appears to be supplying weapons to our enemies. 
   Accordingly, we offer this motion to recommit which explicitly states that the Afghanistan Freedom and Security  Support Act does not limit America's ability to respond to attacks that Iran supports or facilitates against our forces or interests in Afghanistan. 
   As the United States begins to engage Iran diplomatically, we must also make it clear that we will defend our allies and our interests in Afghanistan with all the means at our disposal. 
   Mr. Speaker, our relationship with Iran should be described as follows: one hand extended in diplomatic negotiation and another hand resting lightly on the holster of the arsenal of democracy. 
   Mr. Speaker, in support of our troops, in support of freedom and stability in Afghanistan, I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strongly support this motion to recommit.

   American people should know, Madam Speaker, we're at a unique moment in the history of this legislation. The overwhelming bipartisan House passage of the Free Flow of Information Act has now been joined with Senate action that includes the leadership of Senator RICHARD LUGAR, Senator ARLEN SPECTER, Senator PATRICK LEAHY and others. Senator BARACK OBAMA and Senator HILLARY CLINTON add themselves as cosponsors of the bill this week, and I heartily welcome the strong endorsement of Senator JOHN MCCAIN of this legislation. 
   I believe there's now a bipartisan majority in both the House and the Senate to support this vital legislation and ensure the vitality of a free and independent press for generations to come. 
   We just need one vote in the other body. And I believe we'll put a stitch in this tear in the first amendment freedom of the press.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (THE DEMOCRAT ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I will be joined this evening on the floor by a number of distinguished colleagues, and we're going to take the opportunity on what we believe, Mr. Speaker, is the eve of a historic debate on energy legislation in the House of Representatives, to talk about the issue that is most bearing upon the American family. It is most bearing upon American business. It is most bearing upon our schools and our seniors and our standard of living, and that is, the high cost of fuel and gasoline. 
   The American people are hurting, and Republicans here on the House floor are delighted that this Congress is back in session, that the lights are back on and the cameras are back on because, all through the month of August, while the House Democrats took a 5-week paid vacation, Republicans stayed here because we simply believe that there's no issue of greater import to working Americans, small business owners or family farmers than the cost of gasoline and the high price of oil. 
   I will say to you that the disappointing economic news in August, Mr. Speaker, can be explained with one phrase: The high cost of energy is costing American jobs, and the American people know this. 
   As I traveled the four corners of my eastern Indiana district this past weekend, I did not hear about the bowling scores of Presidential candidates. I didn't even hear about lipstick very much. But I heard one Hoosier after another saying to me, please, get Congress to do something real about lessening our dependence on foreign oil and lowering the price of gasoline at the pump. And that's why we're here tonight, to talk about this issue. 
   It's an issue on the front page of my hometown newspaper, the largest newspaper in my district, I should say, the Muncie Star Press. After Ike hit shore, gasoline prices went to $4.29 a gallon. In parts of my district, they were reported to be well over $5 a gallon in the Midwest. 
   The headline tells the tale: Hoosiers are helpless. Millions of American people are helpless, Mr. Speaker, as they see a Congress that has over the last two years of this Democrat majority twiddled its thumbs while gasoline prices rose and rose and rose, and then they took their 5-week paid vacation. 
   But as I said, Republicans never left. As newspapers reported and radio reported all throughout the course of this summer, we stayed on this floor even though the lights were dimmed and the microphones were off, and we kept demanding that Speaker  Nancy Pelosi would bring this Congress back into session and would bring a bill to the floor of this House that would give the American people more access to our own domestic reserves through drilling and include all of the other strategies long-term energy independence, more conservation, more fuel efficiency, solar, wind, nuclear. 
   A lot of people are looking at Congress this week with the word that we're going to be debating an energy bill that newspapers are reporting includes drilling and they're saying,  Mike, what's your problem? It seems to me you were one of those people arguing in the dimmed lights of the House Chamber for the whole month of August, demanding that Congress come back. They came back. Demanding that they bring an energy bill to the floor with drilling. And it looks like they are. 
   Well, I want to say, Mr. Speaker, to you and anyone looking in, it only looks that way. The energy legislation that will be brought to this floor, according to the best information we have, will do virtually nothing to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. If they have their way and take them at their word, it will still leave more than 80 percent of our domestic reserves forever off limits. 
   Now, we are going to gather tonight with some of the most distinguished and eloquent voices in the House Republican caucus to talk about this bill, to talk about the Democrat energy bill. 
   But I want to frame this debate, because as near as we can tell, Mr. Speaker, the Democrat majority's going to file a bill tonight with this 21st century energy crisis underway that sounds like they're going to debate for a whole day, maybe a day and a half, and then we're being told we'll be voting by the middle of the week. 
   Now, I don't want to get lost in the weeds of boring the American people who are looking on tonight with talking about subcommittees and committees and things we call markups, but the American people deserve to know that this bill, if it's filed tonight, we're being told the Democratic energy bill hasn't been written in any committee by people elected by the people of the United States of America. It hasn't been written in any normal process. It's been written in the back rooms of the 
   Speaker's office. 
   Ironically, in the middle of August this year, as many of us were clamoring on this House floor with the lights dimmed, calling on the Democrat majority to come back and debate energy, we learned that an environmental group known as the Sierra Club had endorsed their bill. Well, we'd never seen the bill. In fact, we still haven't seen the bill. But it's coming. 
   And so what we are going to do tonight is we're going to do our level best to use the franchises that we have on this floor to inform the American people about what's going on here, and I'm going to use, Mr. Speaker, the Whip Pack that's put out by the office of the distinguished majority whip, the Honorable JAMES E. CLYBURN, and it's about five or six pages of, you know, what people in the political business call talking points about the Democrat legislation. 
   And let me be clear, I know I and the distinguished legislators on the floor tonight, we would love to be debating the bill but we don't have it. The Democrat majority is about to bring an energy bill that they're calling the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act, and the title of the bill is all I really know at this point. It will likely be hundreds, if not thousands, of pages long, but we'll talk about the talking points tonight. 
   But I want to make two points before I yield to my colleagues. Number one, the American people deserve to know that the Democrats have made rhetorical progress in this battle. The truth is that Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco liberal Democrat and a distinguished Member of this body, who I respect as a person, has been accurately described in the media as a zealous opponent of offshore drilling since the 1980s. 
   Speaker  Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco has, like many liberals in California, been an ardent opponent of offshore drilling throughout her public career and was an ardent opponent of even taking a vote on offshore drilling until I think last week. 
   Let me give you the tale of the tape here. As recently as July 11, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi told the New York Times, ``This call for drilling in areas that are protected is a hoax.'' She said, ``It's an absolute hoax.'' This is this last July. Speaker of the House said, and I quote her with respect, ``It's an absolute hoax on the part of the Republicans and this Bush administration.'' 
   In an interview on July 17 on CNN, an interview with Wolf Blitzer, he said, ``So let me get--will you allow the issue, offshore oil drilling, to come up for a vote on the floor of the House?'' 
   Speaker Pelosi, ``We're going to exhaust other remedies in terms of increasing supply in America .....'' 
   Wolf Blitzer, ``So the answer is no?'' 
   Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, ``I have no plans to do so.'' 
   In fact, many of us remember on August 3, a couple of days after that Congress adjourned for a 5-week paid vacation, a memorable and, in my opinion, a workmanlike journalistic job by George Stephanopoulos on ABC's ``This Week'' Sunday morning program where he must have asked Speaker Pelosi five different times whether she would ever allow a vote on drilling. And she said no about as we say south of highway 46, different ways from Sunday, no, no, no, no. 
   In other settings, Speaker Pelosi, has said, and I quote that she's, quote, trying to save the planet, presuming that allowing the American people to environmentally, responsibly take advantage of our own natural resources on the Outer Continental Shelf in the gulf or in Alaska would endanger the earth. 
   And let me say, that's entirely her right to hold that view. It's just not the view of the overwhelming majority of the American people, and it is certainly not the view of the majority of the Members elected to Congress. All the Republicans and many Democrats are prepared today to vote to lift the moratorium on offshore drilling that's been in place for decades. 
   So I guess that my first point to make today, Mr. Speaker, to you and those looking on is, is first and foremost, let's understand our context here, that throughout the course of this newly minted Democrat majority, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi has made it crystal clear until very recently that she was categorically opposed to this Congress ever voting on drilling. I think we ought to evaluate the Democratic proposal in the context of her sincerely held views up to a week ago.     
   And I would say with that, allowing for a belief in the sincerity of all of my colleagues, I think we ought to trust, but verify. I think we ought to look at the detail. Someone who has been, throughout her public career, a vociferous opponent of offshore drilling now allowing what we're being told is a bill that would allow offshore drilling, you know, we probably ought to read the fine print. And that's what we're going to try to do tonight. I can assure my countrymen who may be looking on, we will be trying to do that in the whole day we will be debating this energy proposal. A day. 
   You know, I worked on legislation that passed the House this year by 398 votes, a bipartisan measure; I have currently been working on it for 4 years. It has been debated through committees, it has been debated through the House, it has been considered in the Senate. And that's pretty typical in legislation. But this bill is going to be introduced tonight, and we may debate it for a day.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (THE DEMOCRAT ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Reclaiming my time, and I thank the gentleman from Arizona and the gentleman from Georgia. And in the few minutes that I'm going to take before I yield to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, if anyone senses a bit of incredulity in our voices, it is borne of profound frustration, the profound frustration that the American people are hurting. And they don't want backroom deals coming to the floor of this Congress; they want a fair and open debate that lets the Congress work its will and develop a bipartisan strategy that achieves energy independence in the 21st century. We cannot do that in 24 hours. We cannot do that with backroom deals that are done in the dead of night with no amendments allowed on the floor, one-size-fits-all. That smacks more of politics than the kind of bipartisan accomplishment that the American people expect from the people's House. 
   Now let me give a few details about what we know about the bill that has not yet even been filed in the Congress and could be voted on the day after tomorrow. 
   The Democrat energy bill. Let me just give you 10 ways the Democrat energy bill fails the American people. 
   The Democrats' energy bill, number one, permanently locks up 80 percent of American oil reserves on the Outer Continental Shelf; 80 percent. If it passes intact, 80 percent of our reserves will be off limits forever. 
   Number two, the Democrats' ``no energy'' bill, as we know it now, permanently locks up more than a trillion barrels of oil from oil shale in the inner mountain West. 
   Number three, the Democrats' ``no energy'' bill permanently locks up more than 10 billion barrels of oil on Alaska's remote North Slope, an area where energy production and wildlife have been safely coexisting for decades. 
   Number four, the Democrats' ``no energy'' bill blocks more nuclear power production, efficient, less costly production than nations like France have been using for decades. 
   Number five, the Democrats' ``no energy'' bill does nothing to construct new clean coal energy production. 
   Six, there is an enormous tax increase in the Democrat energy bill, something they've been talking about ever since they took over the Congress, raising taxes on oil companies. Well, after the holocaust that struck with Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav and Katrina a few years hence, the American people know we need more refineries in this country. 
   Congress passed tax breaks for oil companies to encourage the construction of more refineries, and they want to repeal those breaks and now raise taxes more. I've got to tell you, the biggest laugh line I have in eastern Indiana is when I look at people at town hall meetings and at town squares and I say, who among you thinks that by raising taxes on oil companies you will lessen the price of gasoline at the pump? It's a laugh-out-loud line, but it's what passes for the Democrats' energy policy. 
   Quickly then. The Democrats' ``no energy'' bill, as we know it, permanently prevents Federal agencies from using alternative sources of fuel. It increases electricity costs on families, seniors and small businesses through new heavy-handed electricity mandates. It includes plans for exactly zero new refineries as I mentioned before. And it ultimately defies the will of the American people who want this Congress to work together, who want this Congress to take an up-or-down vote on lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling, who want this Congress to bring all-of-the-above strategies--wind, solar, nuclear--and vote them up or down. But instead, we get a backroom deal, brought, soon to be, I assume, in the dead of night with no opportunity or meaningful opportunity for debate or amendment. 
   With that, I'm pleased to yield to the Policy chairman of the Republican Conference. THADDEUS MCCOTTER of Michigan is a colleague who spent more time on this floor during the August recess than any single Member of Congress. And I yield to him to speak about this legislation and its flaws.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the Policy Committee chairman for his remarks. 
   I am informed, Mr. Speaker, that I stand corrected; that the legislation that I said had not been filed was filed during my opening remarks. And so anyone looking in should be aware that at 9:45 p.m. Eastern tonight, or thereabouts, the Democrat majority's plan for achieving energy independence in the 21st century was filed. We do not know the contents of the bill; we do not know the length of the bill. We are attempting to receive a copy of it and will attempt to report on that as much as we can before we adjourn tonight.

   Mr. PENCE. Thank you, Congressman Carter. 
   The gentleman from Texas just made reference to what I have in my hand, which is the bill, Mr. Speaker. It was filed just a few short moments ago. We will be debating it tomorrow because what is known as the Rules Committee is meeting tonight to outline the parameters of debate. And it looks like some of us are going to be up late. It's 290 pages. And for those who might be looking in, you're looking realtime at what passes for legislating in the Democrat majority in Congress. It's 290 pages filed tonight. And we're voting on it tomorrow. And I assume the committee is meeting tonight and can move quickly because there will be apparently no, if any, amendments allowed. 
   Now let me say before I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Arizona on this issue, when I said earlier that this legislation locks off permanently 80 percent of our domestic oil and natural gas reserves on the Outer Continental Shelf, let me explain that to you because I have confirmed it now in the bill. This bill permits leasing and drilling for oil between 50 and 100 miles if States opt in. Of course it offers absolutely no revenues to the States for opting in the way that current law does with States along the gulf coast and the way that the Republican bill offers States, I think 39 percent of revenues go to States. And 10 percent goes to the Federal Government in the Republican bill, and then 50 percent of the revenue goes into developing new alternative energy strategies. But when I say that it permanently locks it off, there is no drilling here permitted between the current 3-mile threshold and 50 miles. None whatsoever. It's banned permanently. 
   And to give you an idea of what kind of resources we're talking about, eastern seaboard 3.8 billion barrels estimated, 3.7 billion in the eastern gulf of Mexico, 11 billion barrels in the Pacific coast. And most experts say most of it's between 3 and 50 miles. The Speaker of the House called plans to drill a hoax. And I'm not in the name-calling business, but the American people should know that this so-called energy bill which includes so-called drilling actually bans the American people from the overwhelming majority of our domestic reserves on the Outer Continental Shelf forever. 
   Let me yield to the gentleman from Arizona, JOHN SHADEGG, for 5 minutes.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his extraordinary insight on this issue. It really does beg the question, Mr. Speaker, for anybody looking in. This is the Democrat energy bill. It was filed we think about 30 minutes ago. It is 290 pages long, so I can't speak with authority about what is in it, because I haven't had a chance to read it. 
   But what we know is not in it is any expedited litigation reform that would prevent environmental organizations or radical, leftist groups from tying up our domestic oil reserves in the courts,  as they are doing in existing leasing areas. Also what is not in it is any revenues at all to drill in that 50 miles out to 100 miles out. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you think we are suggesting that that is more important than it really is, I would quote to you Democrat Senator Mary Landrieu, who in her hometown newspaper this weekend urged House Democrats to oppose the House Democrat bill. Democrat Senator Mary Landrieu said because the bill offered the States no money to drill off their shores, that it was ``dead on arrival in the Senate.'' She said, ``It most certainly won't see the light of day in the Senate.'' 
   So as I prepare to yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Minnesota, no one wants to see a bipartisan compromise on comprehensive energy legislation more than me. 
   I spent a good chunk of my August recess talking in a darkened chamber. I would love to see the Congress come together this week and figure it out and share all the credit. But it has to be a serious effort to say yes to solar, yes to wind, yes to nuclear, yes to conservation, and it has to be a serious effort to say yes to giving the American people more access to American oil. And when one hears the gentleman from Arizona and one hears people like the Democrat Senator from Louisiana, one comes to the conclusion this is not a serious effort to give the American people more access to American oil. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota, Michele Bachmann.

   If I can yield to each of our last two speakers, then we will be able to clear the baffles. I think those that might be looking in, Mr. Speaker, can sense the frustration, not of the opposite political party, not of a frustrated minority, but what you are hearing here is the frustration of public men and women that know the American people are hurting. Seniors, small business owners, family farmers, school systems are struggling under the weight of record gasoline and diesel prices, and we ought not to be on this floor playing politics with this issue. We ought to be compromising. We ought to throw open the windows, open the blinds, have the debate, take the votes and let the cards fall where they may. That is mostly certainly not what is happening this week.

   I just say from my heart, and I have been passionate on the floor tonight, but it's a passion that is borne of a desire to solve this problem. 
   But seeing a bill 290 pages long dropped on to the floor of this Congress less than 24 hours before it is to be debated does not represent a serious effort to bring about bipartisan compromise in this Congress. My colleagues of goodwill know this. 
   The truth is the American people want this Congress to come together in an open, fair debate and take and develop a comprehensive energy strategy that says yes to conservation, yes to solar, yes to wind, yes to nuclear, yes to greater fuel efficiently standards, and takes a bipartisan vote to lift the moratorium and let the American people have access to our vast domestic reserves on the Outer Continental Shelf and in Alaska. 
   Wherever those votes fall, let the cards fall where they may. But that's the process the American people want to see happen, and that is the basis upon which we can build a long-term strategy to achieve American energy independence. We have just begun this battle. It will continue tomorrow.

   Mr. PENCE. As we've heard this morning, Madam Speaker, 4 years ago today, aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, President Bush gave a speech. Now, it has been characterized by Members of Congress this morning that the President ``announced `mission accomplished.' '' And one other speaker said that the President ``declared `mission accomplished.' '' Actually, here's what the President said, and I am quoting: ``We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We're bringing order to parts of the country that remain dangerous.'' But he added, ``our mission continues. Al Qaeda is wounded, not destroyed. The enemies of freedom are not idle and neither are we, and we will continue to hunt down the enemy before he can strike.'' 
   The President said, ``the battle of Iraq is one victory in a war of terror that began September 11 and still goes on.'' 
   As the President said 4 years ago, Madam Speaker, ``our mission is not accomplished in Iraq or in the war on terror.'' So now is not the time to tie the funding for our troops to deadlines and defeat. Now is not the time for politicians in Washington, D.C. to micromanage and make decisions for our commanders in the field.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for the compliment. 
   Today the House is considering the Water Quality Financing Act introduced by the gentleman from Minnesota. And I wish to commend him for his ongoing leadership in this area of the law and the infrastructure needs of the American people. 
   The bill does do many good and important things, and I believe it is well intended. But I want to urge my colleagues to oppose this bill because I have great concerns about the cost, but also, most especially, about the expansion of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirement to construction projects funded under this bill. 
   H.R. 720 authorizes $16 billion in discretionary spending over 5 years, new programs that contain a significant expansion of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. And therein applies the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage law. 
   Since 1995, the Davis-Bacon requirement was not applied to construction projects funded through these revolving funds; however, this bill would reinstitute this requirement. Many of the primary taxpayer watchdog organizations in America are opposing this bill on this basis alone, National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, just to name a few. 
   The Davis-Bacon law was signed into law in 1931 during the Great Depression in order to inflate labor rates for workers on government projects. But, Madam Chair, the Great Depression is over and the time for expanding the prevailing wage for projects like these is gone. An honest day's work should be met with an honest day's pay, not an artificial government-mandated  wage rate. Let's say yes to the sacred right of contract. Let's say yes to the best deal for the American people on public projects. Let's say no to the expansion of Davis-Bacon and to the projects under this legislation. I urge a ``no'' vote among my colleagues for that reason.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (CONGRESS MUST NOT INTRUDE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVINCE OF THE PRESIDENT AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, it has been quite a week here on Capitol Hill with the unveiling by the Democratic majority of their new plan for a fully funded withdrawal from our presence in Iraq. 
   The contrast that took place yesterday also was quite striking. General Petraeus, our new commander on the ground in Baghdad, had his first meeting this Thursday with the media in Baghdad, describing what our military leaders were doing in the midst of that war-torn country. And at the same time, on the other side of the world, many would-be generals here in Congress were describing their plans for the war in Iraq. 
   Democratic leaders, according to press releases from the House Appropriations Committee, outlined a plan for veterans' funding in the so-called war supplemental but also a plan that would set a timeline for bringing United States participation in Iraq's war to an end. 
   Setting very, very specific dates, the leadership, at least at this point, as we know, has outlined a proposal that establishes a timeline that would end U.S. participation in Iraq's civil war by July 1, 2007. If the President does not certify that the troops have met certain specific criteria that has been released to the media, the troops must  begin at that point an immediate redeployment of their involvement in the Iraq War which must be completed by December of 2007. Other dates, October 1, also are being discussed and other dates, including March 1, 2008. It was a startling contrast, to say the least. 
   On Thursday of this week, our generals in Baghdad and our ``generals'' here in Congress were describing their plans for the war in Iraq. 
   But I must say that history teaches that we have but one commander in chief, Madam Speaker. In fact, if you study the minutes of the Constitutional Convention in that balmy summer of 1787, you will find more agreement on no other point than that our Founders believed in the unified chain of command, that there would be one commander in chief and that that power, under article II of the Constitution, would be vested in the President of the United States. 
   We have a role in this Chamber. Under article I, Congress has the exclusive authority to declare war and to make decisions which will be a part of the aforementioned legislation to determine whether and to what degree we will fund war. 
   But the conduct of the war on the ground, including the setting of benchmarks, the execution of timetables on the ground and the like, fall within the purview of the commanders and specifically the commander in chief. And I would argue, as something of a student of American history, during the Revolutionary period, that our Founders rejected this because of painful experiences during the Revolutionary War. Our first commander in chief, George Washington, actually would spend every night writing letters in his tent to Congress to ask permission for military maneuvers and almost failed as a result of that micromanagement. 
   Congress must not intrude on the constitutional province of the President of the United States to lead us as Commander in Chief. Napoleon said it best. He said, ``I would rather face 20 brilliant generals than one mediocre one.'' 
   We must, as we move into this debate, carry before the American people a very simple principle: We must support our troops in the field, provide them with the resources they need to get the job done and come home safe. But in the midst of this debate, with civility, let us also take the case to the American people of whether or not they want one commander in chief or whether they want 435 commanders in chief elected to this article I body of the Congress. I say we have one leader of our military who leads our commanders on the ground. The Constitution says it; I will stand by it.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (NO NEW TAXES -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about an issue that is not so much on our agenda in these first 100 hours, but I believe it will encompass much of our focus during the course of the 110th Congress. It has to do with the how and why that we will achieve fundamental entitlement reform. 
   President Bush and many leaders in the new majority in the House and Senate have spoken of the priority of reforming Social Security and dealing with the extraordinary unfunded obligations of our mandates in future years. The President, to his credit, 2 years ago raised the prospect of fundamental Social Security reform. But the American people rejected the President's call. 
   And I rise today to speak about what I believe the parameters of that debate should be from the perspective of a conservative in the minority who believes in the principles of limited government. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that the American people did not reject the Social Security reform or the personal retirement accounts that the President advanced. I think they rejected the entire debate and how it unfolded. I think they rejected the notion that the predominant goal of Social Security reform was to make the numbers add up or, in the language of the wonks, to achieve solvency in Social Security. Such a yardstick expresses no opinion on how to fix an increasingly bankrupt system, and I believe that as a result it invariably blesses benefit cuts or tax increases as a result. 
   And while President Bush has spoken to his opposition to tax increases, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has repeatedly said, in conversations with Members of the House and Senate, that ``everything is on the table,'' raising the specter of the possibility of raising taxes to achieve Social Security reform. And even the President's own Press Secretary, when asked directly whether the White House was ruling out a tax increase to achieve Social Security reform with this newly minted  Democrat majority in Congress, the Press Secretary said, ``No, I'm not.'' 
   I believe, Mr. Speaker, this is all code for a willingness within the Bush administration to consider raising taxes in exchange for achieving Social Security reform. Such a tax increase would likely come from lifting or eliminating the cap on the amount of salary and wages subject to the payroll tax. The current income that is subject to the payroll tax is $94,200. 
   But raising payroll taxes, I would offer, would prove devastating to working Americans, small businesses and the economy as a whole and, worse, if we eliminated the cap on income subject to payroll taxes for Social Security, would only add a brief 7 years to Social Security's financial solvency. 
   According to the Heritage Foundation, eliminating the cap will increase taxes by $484 billion over the first 5 years. This 12.4 percentage point marginal tax rate increase would hit middle income families struggling to make ends meet, pay for college and save for retirement, and much of the increase would be borne by the 3 million small business owners who pay both the employer and employee portion of the tax hike. These entrepreneurs are the driving force of our economy, Mr. Speaker. And as a result, a tax increase of this nature would result in a 2 to 3 percent reduction in economic growth, causing massive layoffs across the country. And, again, eliminating the cap on income subjected to Social Security payroll tax would only extend the life of Social Security for 7 years. 
   Now, there are many, even on my side of the aisle, that are flirting with the notion of raising taxes. But, Mr. Speaker, we have been down this road before. It was 1990, when I was a candidate for Congress, when another President Bush teamed up with a Democrat majority in Congress and headed to Andrews Air Force Base all in the name of entitlement reform and deficit reduction, brought the American people the promise of reform in the future, and the largest tax increase in American history. 
   We must not go down the road of compromise again. I think the administration needs to be clear that any Social Security compromise must reject tax increases of any kind. That means no increase in the payroll tax rate and no change in the cap apart from the current indexing that happens under the law. 
   I would say, respectfully, to my colleagues and to the President of the United States, we should say to our good friends in the new majority, ``Read our lips. No new taxes.'' 
   It is imperative that we bring reforms like personal savings accounts to this new deal program. I think it is imperative that we make the new deal a better deal for younger Americans, but raising taxes on small business owners and family farmers in the manner of lifting the cap or raising the rate is an idea whose time should never come.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the ranking member for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the concurrent resolution for the House, and I do so from a position of a humble public servant, one who has not served in Iraq in uniform, as our previous speaker did, and others have who are in this Chamber at my side, but as one who has been there. I rise as one who is charged with public responsibility as the ranking member of the Middle East Subcommittee. 
   While this resolution before the Congress today and this week, while this resolution expresses support for our troops in Iraq, the heart of the resolution is a statement of disapproval of the President's so-called surge of troops in Iraq, and I cannot support it. 
   I see Iraq, as others have eloquently stated, as the central front in the war on terror. I rise today in opposition to this resolution out of a fundamental sense that we have a moral obligation to finish what we started, to confront the enemies of our way of life, and to support our duly elected Commander in Chief as he makes those decisions that he deems necessary and appropriate to achieve those ends. 
   Let me say from the heart, for a moment, my reasons for supporting this troop surge. A few days before President Bush addressed the Nation, he invited a handful of Members of Congress down to the West Wing of the White House. I must tell you that I had my doubts about this troop surge. In all four of my trips to Iraq, I had heard consistently from our military commanders over the past several years that a large American footprint in Iraq was actually counterproductive to our goals.     
   But August and the aftermath of 2006 changed all of that. All of that advice predated an extraordinary increase in violence that commenced in the late summer of last year, when it became clear to all of us in this body, and to freedom-loving people around the world, that our strategy and tactics on the ground in Iraq were not working. 
   Now, I took that skepticism and that counsel into the Cabinet room of the West Wing, and there I heard the President describe a new strategy and new tactics. For all of the world to have read the newspaper accounts, Mr. Speaker, I would have assumed the President was simply sending more troops for more troops' sake. But that was not the case. 
   Despite what the previous speaker on this floor suggested, this is a new strategy. It is a new way forward. It is an effort on the part of the President to embrace an increase in troop strengths in Baghdad that was initially recommended by the Iraq Study Group, and more on that in a moment. 
   But let me say that I believe this new way forward, this new approach ought to be given a chance to work. I believe to oppose the President's new strategy in Iraq is to accept the status quo. And the headlines of the last 24 hours should tell every man and woman of good will in this Congress that the status quo in Iraq is not acceptable. 
   Now, earlier I mentioned that the approach of a troop surge in Baghdad was first recommended by the Iraq Study Group. I am quite struck, Mr. Speaker,  that the previous speaker who is a freshman Member of Congress from Pennsylvania spoke, as many have in the Democrat majority, quite glowingly of the report of the Iraq Study Group. And I admire this work product greatly. 
   A bipartisan work authorized during the last Congress, James A. Baker, III, former Secretary of State, Lee Hamilton of Indiana, a former chairman of the House International Relations Committee bringing together a bipartisan group of wise counselors developed the Iraq Study Group report. 
   While I do not agree with every aspect of it, particularly those that talk about having a dialogue with terrorist states in the region, there is much that recommends the American people to the Iraq Study Group. And again I site in evidence the gentleman from Pennsylvania's glowing reference to that report just moments ago. 
   Now, let's look, if we can, at what the Iraq Study Group has to say about the idea of a troop surge in Iraq. I would offer very humbly, and maybe startling to some who are looking in, Mr. Speaker, that the very words ``troop surge'' comes from the Iraq Study Group's recommendations. 
   Allow me to quote from page 73 of the book that is available in book stores all over America. The Iraq Study Group said: ``We could, however, support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the training and equipping mission if the U.S. Commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be effective.'' 
   Let me emphasize that again. The Iraq Study Group that the gentleman from Pennsylvania and many in the majority have heralded as an important work that provides us with a vision for going forward says: ``We could, however, support a short-term redeployment of surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what President Bush called for in January. And it is precisely that which Congress this week is poised to reject in a nonbinding resolution. I submit to you today that if the Iraq Study Group is to be cited again and again by the majority as source authority, and a fount of wisdom, and I believe it is, then let's be clear about the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. 
   It is not to say, Mr. Speaker, that a short-term redeployment or surge of combat forces in Baghdad will solve the present crisis and impasse that we face. It simply is a strategy to quell violence with Iraqis in the lead, to create the conditions of stability whereby a long-term political solution can be achieved. 
   Now let me say, Mr. Speaker, it was my great hope that the resolution before us today would have come to the floor under procedural rules that allowed for amendments. For my part I spent much of last evening offering an amendment, along with others, that would state that it is the sense of Congress that we should not take any action that would result in the elimination or reduction of funds for our troops. 
   I rise today not to complain about procedure, but to say, Mr. Speaker, I regret that this newly minted majority could not do as the Democrat chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee appears prepared to act. 
   My amendment that was offered, similar to others, has nearly identical language to a resolution being offered by the distinguished Senator Levin, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. And both of us agree that Congress should affirmatively state that it will not cut funding to the troops. 
   I deeply regret that we were not able to make that declarative statement today. And let me say with great respect to the chairman of this Armed Services Committee, who needs not to hear from me about the deep respect I have for him, that I have to believe that somewhere in his heart of hearts, knowing his extraordinary record of service to this country, that he may well have hoped for a stronger statement as well. 
   While the Democrat resolution before us expresses the hope that Congress and all Americans will continue to support and protect our brave men and women serving in Iraq, it does not take the next step to show tangible support for our troops in the nature of funding. And let me say this with great sincerity: there is a fundamental difference between pledging to support and protect our troops and pledging not to cut off the funding for our war in Iraq. 
   It is a specious distinction, and one that is not lost on our colleagues in the Senate. I would submit to you that words have consequences, and ``support'' and ``protect'' do not assure the American people that we will continue to fund our troops in the field. 
   I believe the American people understand this point, Mr. Speaker. A poll cited this morning in USA Today shows that even though a majority of Americans are opposed to the surge of troops in Baghdad, a majority also oppose cutting off funding for the troops. 
   The American people do not want Congress to defund this war in the majority, even if they are concerned about the course and direction the war is taking. And Congress should tell the troops and the American people that it will never use the power of the purse to accomplish policy ends in the field of battle. 
   With this I close. Listening to this debate today and to the opposition to the surge being espoused by the Democrat majority, I have begun to wonder a very simple question: What if it works? I have made it clear that I support the surge and the President's new strategy. 
   My good friends on the Democrat side of the aisle and, as has been said, some Republicans have made it clear that they oppose the surge of forces in Iraq. And that is their right, and if it is in their heart, it is their duty. And at this moment, it appears that a majority of Americans are with the majority in this Congress. 
   But what if? What if they are wrong? What if you are wrong? What if the surge and the new leadership of General Petraeus and the courage and bravery of American men and women in uniform and the sacrifices of Iraqis in uniform succeed in the coming months? 
   You know, it is a snow day back in Indiana today, Mr. Speaker. And my kids are even home watching this on TV. I give my kids some pretty basic advice sometimes. One of the pieces of advice I give my kids when they are facing challenges, I say to them, you know, people don't like losers, but they like quitters even less. 
   And I think we ought to reflect on that old maxim as we come upon this decision today. If this new strategy in Iraq succeeds in the coming months, what will those who vote for this resolution say? The truth is, we must fight and win a victory for freedom in Iraq. The truth is we have no option but victory. 
   In their hearts the American people know this, and the American people are willing to make the hard choices to choose victory. Courage. Courage is the key in this moment. 
   C.S. Lewis wrote that courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point. Courage then is the answer, not recrimination and retreat. We are at a moment when the American people and the Members of this body will take a stand. This is a moment for courage. Our brave men and women in Iraq exhibit courage and uncommon valor every day. 
   It is my hope and prayer that we in this House might follow their lead and show them that such courage resides here as well. Let's vote down this resolution and find it within ourselves to lead the American people by bringing forward the resources and the support necessary to see freedom within Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I must admit that I was somewhat encouraged in December when the newly minted Democrat majority announced that they were considering a bill that would simply finish this year's budget work with what is known as a continuing resolution, funding the government at current levels and leaving the debate over the budget for the ordinary process of the constitutional system of the legislature. I was particularly enamored with the idea that they would move this so-named continuing resolution without earmarks, and I am pleased to have supported bipartisan earmark reform. 
   But what will come to the floor tomorrow, to my disappointment, is not a bill that simply continues the funding of the government. It is a new Federal budget: $463 billion in spending, 137 pages. Madam Speaker, it will take 300 pages to read the CBO score. What we see is not a continuation of government spending. We see, rather, the death of deliberation. The Congress is witnessing in the first hours of this new session the death of a long-term process whereby our budgets and our legislation are considered. It is the death of deliberation that must be put to an end.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, let me say from my heart that I am honored to cosponsor this important resolution. It represents an important cultural step in American life. That we would shatter the color barrier and ceiling that for reasons unknown to this Hoosier seem to have prevented the matriculation of an African American head coach to the Super Bowl, that we would shatter it in a way that both teams arrive with distinguished head coaches of African descent is enormously important. I think it sends an extremely important message particularly to African American youth, and I rejoice in that. 
   Now, as to whether or not the coach of the Bears deserves a raise and a ring, let me say with great respect to Lovie Smith, I rise in particular admiration  of head coach Tony Dungy in his fifth season with the Indianapolis Colts. Under his leadership, the Colts have had a record of 60-20, five playoff appearances, four AFC South titles, two AFC championship games, and as the world watched in wonder a week ago Sunday, an AFC championship. 
   But as Mr. Burton attested, it is his career in Indiana off the field that I find more impressive than his career on the field. Since his time in Tampa Bay, he has brought his commitment to Christian values to young people through the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He launched Mentors for Life, a program that provided tickets to Buccaneers home games to area youth and their mentors. And I was there about a year ago when Coach Dungy welcomed thousands of young people to the arena known as the Wigwam in Anderson, Indiana, and there he shared about his faith and the importance of faith and character and values to the young men and women who gathered there. 
   Whoever it is that walks away with the ring, and I remain adamantly confident that the horseshoe will leave Miami with the ring, let me say that Tony Dungy has earned a ring and earned our praise as Lovie Smith has. Our admiration to two great men, two great leaders.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, enshrined in the first amendment of the Constitution are these words: ``Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.'' 
   Nevertheless, in the last two decades, we have seen a troubling increase in the number of occasions where reporters have faced threats of subpoena, subpoenas and even jail time for refusing to reveal confidential sources. 
   Mr. Speaker, compelling reporters to testify and compelling them to reveal the identity of their confidential sources is a detriment to the public interest. And last week, my colleague, Congressman Rick Boucher of Virginia, along with a distinguished bipartisan group of original cosponsors, introduced the Free Flow of Information Act, which would protect a reporter's right to keep confidential sources confidential. 
   As a conservative who believes in limited government, I believe the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to give due consideration to this bipartisan legislation. Let us put a stitch in this tear in the first amendment freedom of the press. I urge cosponsorship of the Free Flow of Information Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CONGRESSWOMAN JULIA CARSON -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentlewoman for calling this Special Order, and I am very humbled to be able to stand on behalf of the people of eastern Indiana and express my deepest sympathies to the family and colleagues of my friend, the late JULIA CARSON. 
   The Bible tells us to mourn with those who mourn and to grieve with those who grieve. Tonight on the floor of Congress, we gather to do just that. To mourn with the many tens of thousands of grateful constituents who are remembering JULIA CARSON this week and who owe a debt of gratitude to her for 30 years of service to the people of Indianapolis that they know in their hearts they will never be able to repay. 
   I grieve the passing of JULIA CARSON for a variety of reasons. First, for her service. She will be remembered as a pioneering leader in the State of Indiana. As the first woman and the first African American elected to Congress from Indianapolis, she will be long remembered in Indiana public life. 
   I will remember her throughout my own years in politics in trying to get into politics, seeming to see her contribute first as a State legislator, then as a legendary Center Township Trustee in Indianapolis, and later elected to the United States Congress. She was, and I say with affection, a fierce political competitor and succeeded at everything she tried to do, in politics and public service. 
   The gentle demeanor that we are remembering tonight belied a freight train of effectiveness that was JULIA CARSON. And I experienced that effectiveness, usually on the losing side of an argument. But what I would always find in JULIA CARSON is, while she was a fierce advocate here on the floor of the Congress for what she understood to be the needs of her district and the obligations of the law and of justice, that walking back to our offices after the fact, I would never fail to be moved by her gentleness and her kindness and her decency, which leads me to the other piece of JULIA that I will always treasure, and that was her profound Christian faith. 
   I must tell you as a cheerful conservative Republican elected to Congress having observed her career from afar, I would have told anyone in Indiana that the last person I expected to be friends with in Congress was JULIA CARSON. She was tough. She was effective. She was liberal. But when I arrived in Congress as a new freshman, she reached out to me, and she reached out to me on the basis of our shared Christian faith. And it was on that foundation that we built a friendship. 
   And we, on occasion, found ways to work together. Working with her to pass legislation authored by another colleague in the Chamber today, the Second Chance Act, it would be JULIA CARSON that would appeal to this House conservative about the needs of breaking the cycle of recidivism and crime that beset so many families in the underserved community, but it would be her heart on that matter that would reach me with the wisdom of the Second Chance Act. And part of her legacy here today will be the success that we have seen that legislation experience this year and, I trust, in the future. 
   Every time I would ask her in her infirmity in the last year and a half how she was doing, I don't know how she would answer the rest of the Members here, Madam Speaker, but whenever I would quietly say, ``JULIA, really, how are you doing?'' she would smile in that infirmity and say, ``I am blessed by the best.'' No complaints, no grumbling. ``Blessed by the best'' will be her legacy in my heart. To know that as I have the privilege of serving here, whatever the condition in which I serve, I will understand He who placed me here.  
   I think of that great verse. I don't know what the pastor will say at Eastern Star Saturday. My wife Karen and I will be there, as I know most of this Chamber would wish to be there at her funeral. I don't know what the pastor of that great church will say, but when I think of JULIA CARSON, I think of that mandate that we are called to do justice, love kindness, and to walk humbly with our God. 
   The JULIA CARSON I remember tonight and will always remember throughout my years in public service did justice as she understood it. She loved kindness even to those with whom she differed, and every day she was here, she walked humbly in the service of the people of Indiana. For that, we, as a State and as a Nation, will be eternally grateful.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. At 3,500 pages, 34 pounds, members of the minority had roughly 1 day to review its contents. Mr. Speaker, here comes the bus. But the American people don't want this Congress to get on. Last night, the House passed a massive omnibus spending bill that gives deafening evidence that this government is broken. This budget process is broken. 
   I want to commend men and women of good will in this Congress who improved this bill along the margins, but $515 billion without a penny for Iraq is wrong and evidence that the budget process is broken. $515 billion with $10 billion in budget gimmicks and hundreds of unexamined earmarks gives evidence that this budget process is broken. 
   President Reagan said it 20 years ago from this podium. He said: ``The budget process is broken down; it needs a drastic overhaul. With each ensuing year, the spectacle before the American people is the same as it was this Christmas.'' He added: ``Budget deadlines delayed or missed completely, hundreds of billions worth of spending packed into one bill, and a Federal Government on the brink of default.'' 
   The more things change in Congress, the more they stay the same. Say ``no'' to the ominous omnibus bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (ABORTION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it. I believe that the sanctity of life is a central axiom of Western civilization. 
   Let me say, as we gather this evening under the leadership of the chairman of the Pro-Life Caucus here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, we are not really gathered this evening to debate the sanctity of life. We're really gathered tonight to shed light on a fact about Federal funding that, I think, escapes most Americans, and that is this simple fact: 
   That the largest abortion provider in America is the largest recipient of Federal funding under title X. 
   You know, when I'm walking down the street in Anderson, Indiana or in Muncie, Indiana, people know about my work on this particular issue. With the legislation I authored last summer during the appropriations process that received 189 votes to defund Planned Parenthood, one person after another will grab me by the elbow and will say,  ``Mike, I did not know. I did not know that we gave a penny to the largest abortion provider in America, let alone the fact that the largest abortion provider in America, namely Planned Parenthood, is the largest recipient of Federal funding under title X.'' 
   I mean the truth is that there has been much debate since 1973 and the decision of Roe v. Wade about the sanctity of life and the fault lines of the law and life, but where there has been national consensus since the very early days of this debate when a Congressman from Illinois named Henry Hyde conceived of the Hyde Amendment, there has been a national consensus behind the notion that, whatever your view of abortion, it is simply morally wrong to take the taxpayer dollars of millions of Americans who believe abortion is morally wrong and use it to pay for or to subsidize the performance of or the promotion of abortion. 
   The Hyde Amendment gave birth to what has been the dominant philosophy in our foreign aid funding. It's called the Mexico City Policy. It essentially says that no U.S. foreign aid can go to any organization that performs or that promotes abortion as a means of birth control. 
   You know, Madam Speaker, I really think many Americans think that that's the law here at home, too, that because the overwhelming majority of Americans think that pro-life Americans should not be forced to pay for abortions or to subsidize organizations that promote abortion, they think it doesn't happen here, when, in fact, let me say again that the largest abortion provider in America is the largest recipient of Federal funding under title X. 
   Now, abortion-rights advocates and, most especially, Planned Parenthood would be the first to step forward to say that they don't use title X family planning money to perform abortions. In fact, there are very strict Federal regulations that are in place that require a separation between Planned Parenthood abortion service clinics and Planned Parenthood title X clinics for the poor. I suppose, while there have been instances of alleged misfeasance and of the commingling of funds, I'll leave that completely out of this conversation and will allow for the fact that there is this separation, but I've got to tell you, Madam Speaker, that anybody knows that the money that Planned Parenthood receives for its non abortion activities frees up resources to go into its abortion activities. 
   The American people also deserve to know that this nonprofit organization received over $336 million in government grants and contracts, I think, in 2006. It had an excess of revenue over expenses of $56 million in 2005, and it had $112 million in 2006, which has given rise to the building spree that was reported on page 1 of the Wall Street Journal. Well, now Planned Parenthood is planning to go suburban with all new up-scale abortion mills around the country. So I commend the gentleman from New Jersey for bringing this conversation to the floor. 
   I authored a bill last year in the Labor-HHS legislation that would have denied any Federal funding in title X from flowing to Planned Parenthood of America, and it received 189 votes, including 20 Members of the majority voting for it. If Congress ever got around to considering the Labor-HHS appropriations bill this year, I sincerely believe that that number would grow as public awareness has grown about the simple fact that the largest abortion provider in America, Planned Parenthood, is the largest recipient of Federal funding, and that ought not to be. 
   Whatever a person's view of abortion is, it is my hope--and frankly, it is my prayer--that this Congress will come together in a bipartisan way and will implement a domestic Mexico City Policy and will say to the millions of Americans, to the hundreds of millions of Americans, perhaps, who have moral objections to abortion, we will not take your tax dollars and use it to subsidize the largest abortion provider in the United States of America. That's all we're here to talk about today. 
   I urge my colleagues to reflect deeply on the fundamental fairness of this issue and to support the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act that would bring a change to the law. In the appropriations cycle, if we ever get around to it in this Congress, let's take decisive action to defund Planned Parenthood, not cut a dime out of title X and its family planning programs, but let's say no more Federal tax dollars to the largest abortion provider in America. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY, JR. -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for the privilege of having the opportunity to speak in favor of this important resolution expressing the condolences of the House of Representatives on the death of William F. Buckley, Jr. I also want to thank the Democratic leadership of the Congress for scheduling this bill and giving this Congress and this country an opportunity to express appreciation for an extraordinary American life. 
   This resolution was introduced by Congressman Tom Feeney. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill. I want to thank Congressman Tom Feeney for his leadership and his compassionate attentiveness in bringing this legislation before the Congress. Congressman Feeney cannot be with us today. He is on a congressional delegation trip to China. But I know that were he here, he would regale this floor and those watching in with his deep affection and appreciation for the life and work of William F. Buckley, Jr. 
   As this resolution attests, William F. Buckley, Jr., was an American hero and an intellectual leader of the conservative movement for more than five decades. As the previous speaker just alluded, he led in a manner that earned both the respect and the friendship of his political adversaries. 
   William F. Buckley, from his many years on television, the program, Firing Line, which was the longest running political television program in the history of American television, he demonstrated that wit and sharpness and civility can all go together, and it is a lesson that I suspect many of us on an ongoing basis can continue to learn and apply in the institutions of our government. 
   By virtue of his distinct personality, his talents, his humor and his goodwill, William F. Buckley has been recognized as the premier conservative intellectual in post-World War II America. He once commented that he would ``rather live in a society governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston phone directory than in one governed by the 2,000 members of the Harvard faculty.'' It was that kind of rapier wit, beginning with the publication of his book ``God and Man at Yale,'' that ended up resulting in the publication of thousands of books, thousands of columns, and thousands of debates that turned him into a force of nature in the American public debate. 
   We also recognize him as a man who played a critical role in helping this Nation understand the great calling of his generation, which inasmuch as the calling of the greatest generation, was to confront Nazism and fascism. 
   William F. Buckley and his intellect and his capacity for elocution managed to help focus the Nation on the threat of Soviet communism and the realities of the Soviet Union, and I believe that history will record that it was William F. Buckley, Jr., perhaps more than any other American, who outside of government influenced the leadership in the 1980s that led to the collapse of Soviet communism and the Soviet Union. 
   Upon the election of Ronald Reagan, it was reported to me once that William F. Buckley was asked what position he would like to have in the new Reagan Administration, to which he apparently put his hand in his jacket pocket and replied with a twinkle in his eye, ``ventriloquist.'' And in many respects William F. Buckley was a ventriloquist for so many of us in public life, reading his columns, reading his books, having from time to time the privilege of watching him long distance or in person as he made the case for limited government. He made the case for traditional values. He made the case for the American ideal of freedom, here at home and on a global basis. We, all of us, were happy to have that extraordinary intellect and heart filled with goodwill pull the strings on our careers and guide us and direct us. 
   So, I join my colleagues, and especially Congressman Tom Feeney, in taking this moment to give honor and thanks to William F. Buckley, Jr., for all he did to advance the vision for America and a capitalist democratic vision for the world and to express the profound sorrow this Nation feels upon his death. 
   The Bible says if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. Today, thanks to the leadership in the minority and the generosity of the majority, Congress and the American people will have the opportunity once more to pay a debt of gratitude to this great American, who was William F. Buckley, Jr.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I come before the House today in strong opposition to H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. However well-intended, the bill extends existing employment discrimination provisions of Federal law like those contained in title VII of the Civil Rights Act to prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
   Let me be clear. I don't condone discrimination against people for any reason whatsoever. I believe in civility and decency in society. But the problem here is that by extending the reach of Federal law to cover sexual orientation, employment discrimination protections, in effect, can wage war on the free exercise of religion in the workplace. In effect, as has been said already, this sets up something of a constitutional conflict between the right to religious freedom in the workplace and another person's newly created right to sue you for practicing your faith or acknowledging your faith in the workplace. This is, as has been said before, a deeply enshrined tradition in the American experiment, emanating, as it does, out of the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 
   Some examples: Under ENDA, employees around the country who possess religious beliefs that are opposed to homosexual behavior would be forced, in effect, to lay down their rights and convictions at the door. For example, if an employee keeps a Bible in his or her cubicle, if an employee displays a Bible verse on their desk, that employee could be claimed by a homosexual colleague to be creating a hostile work environment because the homosexual employee objects to passages in the Bible relating to homosexuality. 
   The employer is in a no-win situation as well. Either the employer has to ban  employees from having a Bible at the workplace for their break time, or displaying Bible verses, and thereby face a lawsuit under title VII for religious discrimination, or the employer then has to continue to allow it and face a potential lawsuit under ENDA by the homosexual employee. This sets up a constitutional conflict headed for the courts, about which Congress should not involve itself. 
   Madam Chairman, I strongly oppose the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. We must stand for the right of every American to practice their faith according to the dictates of their conscience, whether it be in the public square or in the workplace. So I oppose the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and urge my colleagues to do likewise.

   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, our Nation is confronted by a serious financial crisis. The President and Congress were right to act with all deliberate speed, and I am confident every Member of this body is motivated by the best interests of this country. 
   It should be said that Republican leaders and my colleagues worked hard to improve this bill. They removed outrageous subsidies, and today the bank deposits of Americans are safer and the balance sheet of their local bank is more secure because of Republican leadership. 
   But even with these important improvements, this legislation remains the largest corporate bailout in American history. It forever changes the relationship between government and the financial sector and passes the cost along to the American people. 
   The sad part is, Madam Speaker, there are no easy answers, but there were alternatives. House Republicans offered an insurance program that would have required Wall Street, not Main Street, to pay for the cost of this recovery, and fast-acting tax relief to strengthen our economy from within. 
   Teddy Roosevelt said, ``An American must face life with resolute courage, win victory if he can and accept defeat if he must, without seeking to place on his fellow man a responsibility which is not theirs.'' 
   With this bill, we place upon the American public a responsibility which is not theirs, bailing out financial institutions after they made irresponsible decisions. This we should not do. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this legislation.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Our Nation is confronted by a serious financial crisis. It's a crisis of confidence in our financial markets and a crisis of confidence in government. While many are anxious about how we will confront this crisis as I saw on the faces of my constituents this week, many more approach this moment with faith, not fear. 
   We will get through this. But we must do so in a manner consistent with the principles that make America great. The President and Congress were right to act with all deliberate speed and I am confident all my colleagues are motivated by the best interests of the Nation. 
   It must be said that Republican leaders and my colleagues in the House worked hard to improve this bill. We slowed the process down, removed outrageous subsidies that were to be added and managed to include an optional insurance plan. And because of the principled stand that Republicans took on this floor last Monday, the bank deposits of Americans are safer and the balance sheet of their local bank is more secure. But even with these important improvements, this legislation remains the largest corporate bailout in American history, forever changes the relationship between government and the financial sector and passes the cost along to the American people. 
   I did not come to Washington to expand the size and scope of government. I did not come to Washington to ask working Americans to subsidize the bad decisions of corporate America. Therefore, I cannot support the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. 
   While this bill promises to bring near-term stability to our financial  turmoil, I ask my countrymen, at what price? The decision to give the Federal Government the ability to nationalize almost every bad mortgage in America interrupts a basic truth of our economy. When the government chooses winners and losers in the marketplace, every American loses. 
   Some say this crisis is too acute to rely on antiquated notions about the role of government in the private sector, but I disagree. I believe the principles of limited government, free enterprise and representative government are as relevant today as they were in 1776. 
   In another October--1964--Ronald Reagan addressed another time for choosing. He said their choice was ``whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.'' 
   There are no easy answers, but the American people deserve to know there were alternatives. House Republicans offered an alternative that would have made Wall Street instead of Main Street pay the cost of this recovery and would have injected liquidity into our markets through fast-acting tax strategies. 
   Should this current legislation pass and our economy continue to struggle, I am hopeful Congress will turn to these proven remedies based on American ideals. Teddy Roosevelt said, ``An American must face life with resolute courage, win victory if he can and accept defeat if he must, without seeking to place on his fellow man a responsibility which is not theirs.'' 
   With this bill we place upon the American public a responsibility which is not theirs: bailing out financial institutions after they made irresponsible business decisions. This we should not do. Instead we should confront this crisis with resolute courage, with faith in God and faith in the principles of freedom and free enterprise. I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I got a sense of what we have to show for it in Iraq this weekend. I joined a bipartisan delegation that toured the metes and bounds of Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   In the course of 4 days, we took off and landed 20 different times in four different types of aircraft. The one inescapable conclusion, after years of difficulty and setback in varying degrees, is freedom is winning in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   In northern Iraq, we saw firsthand the Kurdish region where security, political progress and economic growth are taking hold. In central Iraq, following the military surge, al Qaeda and insurgent violence are in steep decline. Violence across the country has been reduced in the last year by more than 60 percent. It is truly extraordinary. 
   And the political progress is taking hold. There has been a surge in optimism in Iraq due to the passage of a de-Ba'athification law, and provincial elections could well be just around the corner this fall. 
   Later today, in words and pictures, I will detail our trip on my Web log at mikepence.house.gov. And I hope many of my constituents will take time to read it. 
   As we practice freedom here at home, Americans of good will should be encouraged to know freedom is winning in Iraq and Afghanistan.

   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, almost 6 weeks ago this House adjourned for a 5-week paid vacation. A year and a half had passed, and the Democrat leadership remained, up to that moment, steadfast on one issue and one issue only--there would never be a vote on the House floor that gave the American people more access to American oil through domestic drilling. 
   House Republicans refused to go quietly. We held this floor for 5 weeks, demanding that, in the wake of this 21st-century energy crisis, Congress come together in a bipartisan way and develop a comprehensive energy bill that said yes to conservation, yes to alternative sources of energy, and yes to more domestic drilling. And now, although we don't have the language yet, there is word that there is a Democrat bill coming to the floor that includes more domestic drilling. 
   I rise to commend my Republican colleagues who fought for the right of the American people to debate, having access to their own resources, and I say to my colleagues, bring your bill to the floor. We'll bring our bill to the floor. Make it an open debate. Let us cast the votes, and let us lay forward a blueprint for energy independence in the 21st century as the bipartisan accomplishment of this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, last year, the President of the United States  called on Congress to find a rational middle ground between amnesty and mass deportation in the debate over immigration reform. Then, as now, the Senate is moving legislation that would respond to the President's call by simply granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. 
   But amnesty is not the middle ground. The true middle ground of this national debate would put border security first; reject amnesty and require that all illegal immigrants leave the country and apply outside the United States for the legal right to live and work here; create a new center built on the private sector that could make that an orderly process; temporary workers returning to America would learn English; and employers hiring illegals would face serious penalties. 
   That is the true rational middle ground, and after the Senate is done with its work, I hope it is the middle ground that we find in this Chamber on behalf of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment, but I come to the floor today having responded to the gentlelady from Florida, a distinguished colleague in the Democrat majority, who asked I think a very poignant question on the floor within the last hour, and that was: Where are the reformers? 
   I must admit, Mr. Chairman, I didn't get the whole gist and the whole context of her question, but it seemed to me that could be a headline. That could be the lead of an editorial. It really represents the question in which much of the exercise in which we are now involved could be summarized. 
   The chairman of this committee I think has earned throughout his career the label of reformer. I give Chairman Obey that with great respect, not just as a colleague but as a man who has earned that reputation. 
   But today, as someone who over the last 6 years in this Congress has engaged in fights almost exclusively with my own colleagues on the Republican side, to achieve the beginnings of earmark reform, I ask: Where are the reformers? 
   And let me specifically say to my Democrat colleagues who share my passion for transparency and accountability, I ask the question: Where are the reformers? 
   In the last 3 years, and there are colleagues in this room whom I consider not just friends but good friends with whom I have clashed. The ranking member of this subcommittee, we have been on this floor together, Republican on Republican, using, in some cases, the same tactics that we are using today, but we were not training them on the majority. We were training them on our own. We were training these tactics on our own Republican colleagues. That is how passionately we felt for the need for point of order protection in conference reports and for fundamental earmark reform. It would be Members of the Republican Study Committee that virtually singularly took on, not Democrats in the minority, we took on Republicans in the majority. And it was painful among our friends to do it, but we withheld our support for the majority budget. We negotiated fairly but firmly with our own colleagues and friends to achieve the beginnings of earmark reform, requiring that people add their names to earmarks, requiring that earmarks be included in legislation, that they be subject to challenge on the floor of this Congress. These were modest gains, and clearly, the result of election day on November 2006, they  were too little, too late. Our clock ran out on this side of the aisle. 
   But we were fighting on this side amongst ourselves and making halting progress toward earmark reform. That is why, as I watched this debate and as I participate in it, I will be here, as we say in Indiana, until the cows come home. I ask with a sincere heart: Where are the reformers in the majority? Where are the reformers who will come down into this well, and I see some up there that wear that label and deserve it, but on this issue, where are the reformers who are willing to come into this well and say, how about ``no''? How about we don't bring appropriation bills to the floor without all of the spending items in the bill, including Member projects and earmarks, so they can be subject to the accountability and the scrubbing of the legislative process? 
   I know it is inconvenient. I do not question for one second the sincerity of the chairman of this committee, that he is trying and laboring to find a way forward to achieve his goals. But at the end of the day, we cannot set aside the accountability of the legislative process. I ask again: Where are the reformers?

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and urge my colleagues respectfully to oppose it. 
   Our Nation has been confronted by a crisis in our financial markets. The President and this Congress are right to act with all deliberate speed in addressing this crisis. We now have a bill that promises to bring near-term stability to our financial turmoil, but at what price? 
   Benjamin Franklin in 1759 said, ``They that can give up liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.'' 
   Economic freedom means the freedom to succeed and the freedom to fail. The decision to give the Federal Government the ability to nationalize almost every bad mortgage in America interrupts this basic truth of our free market economy. 
   It must be said that Republicans in this Congress improved this bill. But it remains, in my judgment, the largest corporate bailout in American history, forever changes the relationship between government and the financial sector, and passes the cost along to the American people. And I cannot support it. 
   There are no easy answers, but the American people deserve to know there are alternatives to massive Federal spending. The Bush administration and this Congress have acted quickly, but ignored free market solutions to this crisis. The House Republican plan, as a solid alternative, would have set up an FDIC-style mandatory insurance program in which Wall Street firms would have paid to insure their mortgage-backed securities. Doing so would have made Wall Street pay the cost of this rescue instead of Main Street. And while there is an option for an insurance plan in this bill, it falls far short of the substitute that Republicans desired. 
   The House Republican plan would have injected liquidity into our markets through fast-acting tax strategies, releasing the economic power inherent in the American economy. Temporarily reducing the repatriation tax, as we did in 2005, would have brought hundreds of millions of dollars back into this economy. And there were other business deductions that would help the financial sector get back on its feet. There were alternatives. 
   So I say to my colleagues: before you vote, ask yourselves why you came here, and vote with courage and integrity to those principles. If, like me, you came here because you believe in limited government and the freedom of the American marketplace, I urge you vote in accordance with your convictions. 
   Duty is ours; outcomes belong to God. The American people and our posterity deserve to know that there were men and women in this Congress who opposed the leviathan state in this hour. If you do this, I promise you, I will stand with you. And I believe with all my heart, the American people will stand with you as well. Stand up for limited government and economic freedom. Stand up for the American taxpayer. Reject this bailout and vote  ``no'' on the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the King amendment, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to call for this apparently Draconian cut in the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor today in the context of having, like you, served in the Congress before September 11 and before there was a Department of Homeland Security. And I'll never forget in the hurried moments that would follow 9/11 how we  dealt with the immediate issues, funding, reconstruction and recovery efforts in New York and at the Pentagon, how we put together to the best of our ability transportation security for our country. 
   But I will never forget coming to this floor and feeling a great and ominous sense of foreboding as we created a Department of Homeland Security. I couldn't help but feel then that we might be unleashing, however well-intended, on the American taxpayers a behemoth of a new bureaucracy that we would someday find ourselves arguing over on this floor in the way we argue over every other bureaucracy. 
   But it was not meant to be the case. To be candid with you, Mr. Chairman, I thought this day might come decades from now, when the bureaucratic instinct would overtake even the wisdom and the clarity that would be derived on September 11, that made us focus a new department on the specific purpose of protecting our people from a real and present threat of terrorism. 
   And yet as I look at the watch, it is less than half a decade from that horrific day, and here we are with the party in the majority opposed to keeping bureaucratic and administrative staff funding levels at their previous year. It's really extraordinary to me; $8.8 trillion of national debt, and the majority comes to the floor of this Chamber with a 13.6 percent increase in the Department of Homeland Security.     
   The current budget, $31.9 billion, the proposed budget, $36.2 billion, more than 50 percent larger, or is $2 billion larger than the President's request. It's astonishing to me. I just have to wonder, as the American people look in on this issue, if they aren't just scratching their heads just the same. 
   But here we are, having these typical and predictable arguments on the floor of the Congress about bureaucracy and levels of bureaucracy when we are talking about homeland security. We are also doing it very much without, as most of my colleagues have said, without the daylight and the sunshine and the accountability of knowing what will ultimately be in this legislation. 
   I mean, it is extraordinary to me that a Democrat Congress seems so opposed to practicing democracy on the floor of the House of Representatives. To bring a bill to the floor of this Congress with the promise that Member projects, so-called ``earmark projects,'' will be added long after we have had the opportunity to challenge them. 
   The Democratic process on this floor is breathtaking to me. Again, it bespeaks of the embrace of a bureaucratic, big-government attitude even where our own homeland security is involved. 
   We ought, rather, in this process, to know what Members have requested what projects, and we ought to be having a thoughtful and focused discussion on this floor and calling votes one after another on those individual projects to decide what will keep our cities and our people and our families and our children safe. We ought to be having that discussion in the context of a full and open debate. 
   But, instead, we are told that we don't have time to do that. We are told the public will be made aware of these projects some day in the future. 
   That's not democracy, that's not the process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I rise in strong support of the Lamborn amendment, Mr. Chairman, for many of the reasons that have been expressed more eloquently by my colleagues, including the gentleman from Arizona. 
   It does strike me that at a time of an $8.8 trillion national debt, that we should be able to ask the Department of Homeland Security to get by on last year's public affairs budget, which is really all the Lamborn amendment does, by my way of thinking, is it asks the Department of Homeland Security to stay at the $6 million level for a public affairs budget as opposed to moving to a $6.3 million. 
   As my friend from Arizona just expressed, this legislation overall will allow for a 13.6 percent increase in a single year. And as other amendments have illuminated, much of those increases are simply going for the same kind of bureaucracy that we will argue over in every other aspect of government. 
   But I go back to my previous point, Mr. Chairman. I thought for sure when we created the Department of Homeland Security that it would be different. And I have to say, that is probably a naive thought. We excluded it from many of the public employee protections. We gave the President of the United States greater flexibility because we said, you know, very much like the military, the Department of Homeland Security will have a special and unique mission. It would not just be another Cabinet agency that we would be feeding from the trough here on Capitol Hill in the appropriations process every year. But here we are. Here we are with a Democrat majority that is opposed to even our willingness, with the outstanding leadership of the ranking member, to let this Department get by a 7 percent increase next year as opposed to 13.6. 
   I also would renew my objection expressed in much of the procedure that is happening on the floor today and well into tonight, and perhaps well into the rest of the week; that is, it is astonishing to me that a Democratic Congress is against democracy when it comes to providing for accountability in the spending process in the United States Congress. I mean, to simply say that there are tens of thousands of specific so-called earmark projects that have been requested of the committee that are in some filing cabinet here in the Capitol Building, but that were not able to be added to this bill in a timely fashion so that the democratic process and the accountability of this open rule could serve as that antiseptic that it is supposed to function is quite beyond me. 
   It is quite beyond me that the Democrat majority would think that the American people would be willing, having clamored loudly in the last election for fundamental reform in the way we spend the people's money, fundamental earmark reform, with the infamous ``bridge to nowhere,'' would now allow and stand idly by while the Democrat majority brings about earmark reform that says we will only bring earmarks when they can no longer be removed from bills. We will presumably make them public during the month of August so people can look at them, but we will give Members of Congress absolutely no power to challenge those earmarks in the legislative process. That seems to me to be a breathtaking step backwards from the earmark reform that the American people demanded in 2006. 
   And so I renew my support for the Lamborn amendment, Mr. Chairman, but I also renew my objection to the fact that we are seeing appropriations bills, starting today, coming to the floor with, shall we say, room to grow, room to add earmarks at a time in the legislative process when they cannot be challenged, and therefore, the interests of the American people and the accountability they demand cannot be served in the ordinary legislative process.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, today the President of the United States will come to the Capitol Building to revive a deeply flawed immigration bill being considered in the U.S. Senate. 
   One year ago, the President challenged this Congress to find an answer to the crisis of illegal immigration, and, Mr. President, amnesty is not the answer. The core fallacy of the Senate bill would grant unlimited Z visa amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants who simply pay a fine and submit to a background check. 
   While the Senate bill is not the answer, there is a way forward, Mr. Speaker. I truly believe that after the Senate bill goes away, the House of Representatives would do well to come together across party lines and find a way forward that puts border security first, rejects amnesty and creates a new guest worker system that requires illegal immigrants to leave the country to apply and to learn English once they're here. 
   There is a way forward. We can achieve immigration reform in this Congress, but the Senate bill is not that way.

   Let me say emphatically, Madam Speaker, amnesty is no bargain for the American people. Any effort at comprehensive immigration reform must begin by rejecting amnesty, will put border security first, and not implement any type of temporary worker program until border security measures have been undertaken and completed. And once a temporary worker program begins, we must require that every person who has come into this country illegally leave the United States and apply outside of our country for the legal right to live and work here. And if they come under the color of the law, we must require temporary workers to learn the language of the American people. 
   In addition, serious fines and an electronic verification system must ensure a full partnership between American business and the American government in enforcing our immigration laws. 
   The real grand bargain for the American people is comprehensive immigration reform that begins with an affirmation of the rule of law.

   Mr. Chairman, I have always believed that government should live within its means. No one was a harsher critic of runaway Federal spending under Republican control than me. When our majority faltered, I said we didn't just lose our majority, we lost our way. But thanks to the leadership of the gentleman from Wisconsin, this Republican substitute budget alternative should be entitled ``Lessons Learned.'' 
   The contrast between the Democrat plan and the Republican plan is startling. Under the Republican budget alternatives, no tax increases, period; a courageous freeze on non-defense/non-security spending; $279 billion in savings through commonsense reform of entitlements; and real budget process reform. 
   The contrast? The Democrat budget allows for the largest tax increase in American history. It includes $22 billion in increases in non-defense spending and completely ignores budget process reform or the looming entitlement crisis that our Nation faces. 
   Mr. Chairman, the voters spoke last fall. Democrats promised voters a return to fiscal discipline and reform. But this budget proves only one party got the message. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject the Democrat majority's effort to return us to the tax-and-spend policies of the past and vote ``yes'' on the Republican substitute budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I joined a bipartisan group of Members of the House and Senate just a few short hours ago here in the Capitol where we were accompanied by Martin Luther King III, and we gathered to remember a day that tens of millions of Americans will pause to remember tomorrow. That was the day that saw the assassination of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 40 years ago. 
   I rise today as someone who, as a 9-year-old boy, was deeply inspired by the example of Dr. King and as a 9-year-old boy who was shaped by those tragic events. 
   But I also rise today as a Hoosier and as a congressman representing Muncie, Indiana, because it may not be known to many, Mr. Speaker, but both Indiana, and Muncie, Indiana, in particular, played a small role in the unfolding drama of that day, April 4, 1968. And I will borrow generously from an article written by Nick Werner recently in the Muncie Star Press as I reflect on that connection. 
   Muncie helped shape history after the King assassination because it was in Muncie and at Ball State University where Senator Robert Kennedy was speaking. He was speaking at the men's gym, which is now Irving gym. He was running for President of the United States. And it was there after his speech, as he was moving through the crowd, that historians recall and record that he had first learned of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. And as he went to the Muncie Airport and traveled from the Muncie Airport to Indianapolis, Robert Kennedy would prepare what for all the world appeared to be an impromptu speech but one that perhaps he had been writing all of his life. A speech that he would deliver to a stunned crowd in Indianapolis that night, and it was a speech that I rise today to remember. 
   It was humbling to me, despite our differences on philosophy and politics, to sit today on the same row with Senator Ted Kennedy as we remembered the tragic events of that day. 
   Robert Kennedy stood before a largely black audience in an outside park in Indianapolis, and he spoke these words: 
   ``I have some very sad news for all of you and I think sad news for all our fellow citizens and people who love peace all over the world, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.'' 
   As Nick Werner wrote: ``The crowd gasped and screamed, but they remained fixed on Kennedy as he continued speaking, words that condemned violence and lawlessness. 
   He said, and I add, ``For those of you who are black, considering the evidence evidently that there were white people who were responsible, you can be filled with bitterness, with hatred, and a desire for revenge. But,'' he added, ``what we need in the United States is not division. What we need in the United States is not hatred. What we need is not violence and lawlessness, but love and wisdom, compassion toward one another. He asked those gathered to ``return home tonight to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King. Yeah, that's true, but  more importantly, say a prayer for our country, which all of us love; a prayer for understanding and the compassion of which I spoke.''     
   After he spoke those words, rioting would break out in more than 100 cities across the United States. But Indianapolis was peaceful. Robert Kennedy would go on to a tragic end of his own. 
   But I rise today as an American shaped by the courage in the life of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and I will remember tomorrow with gratitude his example. I will also say very humbly that the words of Robert Kennedy are as true today as ever, and that Muncie, Indiana, and the State of Indiana, will always be proud of the small role we played as a backdrop to those historic and tragic events. 
   May the words of Robert Kennedy, may the example of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., continue to inspire our Nation to aspire to a more perfect union.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5349, a bill to extend the Protect America Act of 2007 for 21 days. 
   Now it's hard for me to come to this floor and oppose an extension of a bill that I support, and supported in a bipartisan manner, Mr. Speaker. 
   It was this summer, I believe last August, that Republicans and Democrats came together on the Judiciary Committee and worked out a solution for an extension that came to be known as the Protect America Act. And we've heard in the course of this debate, eloquently stated on both sides, what the issues are here. We have antiquated foreign intelligence surveillance laws. The technology that has exploded across the globe in the last 25 years has occurred without a significant updating of those laws that govern the means and the manner and the technology whereby we can collect intelligence. And so we find ourselves, essentially, as the hub of communications in the world in the United States of America. You've heard the percentages, the enormous amount of communications that pass through the United States of America. And yet we have this massive loophole in our intelligence surveillance laws that does not permit us to listen to a terrorist in one foreign country talking to a terrorist in another foreign country. 
   When we worked out the compromise this summer, it was built, Mr. Speaker, I believe, on an understanding between Republicans and Democrats that that ought not to be, we ought to solve that problem in an equitable and bipartisan way. And I was pleased to support that extension and legislation for a period of 6 months. 
   But what I struggle with today is now, in the aftermath of that, the contrast between the work in the House and the Senate is rather startling. Yesterday, the Senate approved a bipartisan bill supported by nearly 70 percent of the Senate to close the terrorist loophole in our intelligence laws. It represented a strong bipartisan compromise between Congress and the administration. And yet here in the House of Representatives we passed a 6-month extension. A few weeks ago we passed a 15-day extension. Now I believe we're passing a 21-day extension. And yet the American people, I believe, know in their heart of hearts our enemy does not think in the short term and, therefore, our solutions must occur in the long term. And when it comes to the ability of our intelligence community during this administration or whomever will be the next administration charged with protecting this country, I believe it is imperative that we call the question.     
   I believe it is imperative that we rise today, respectfully to my colleagues on the other side, most especially the chairman whom I esteem, and say enough is enough. We need to modernize our foreign intelligence surveillance laws today. We need to find a bipartisan compromise as we did last summer. We need to find a bipartisan compromise as the United States Senate did yesterday. 
   And I say again with a heavy heart, our enemy does not conspire to harm us in the short term. Our enemy conspires to harm us in the long term: to harm our people, to harm our families, to harm our children and our interests around the globe. We must, in this Congress, find a way beyond politics, as we did last summer, as the Senate did yesterday, to repair those holes in our foreign intelligence surveillance laws and give our intelligence community the legal authority and tools that they will need to protect us in the long term. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject the bill to extend the Protect America Act for 21 days and call the question on this floor. We need a long-term solution to what ails our intelligence laws.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I don't need to tell you the HIV/AIDS pandemic has infected more than 60 million people worldwide, killed more than 25 million people, orphaned 14 million in its wake, and today, nearly 70 percent of the people in the world who are afflicted with HIV/AIDS reside in Africa. 
   In 2003, President Bush called on Congress to create a program to address the worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, was an extraordinary bipartisan achievement of compassion, and unfortunately, the majority in Congress has put forth a reauthorization drafted to this bill that will be considered tomorrow that puts at risk America's commitment to HIV/AIDS efforts. 
   The Democrat proposal will take a successful bipartisan achievement, do away with funding requirements for abstinence, and also mandate the integration of family planning services into PEPFAR, which would transform the program potentially into a mega funding pool for organizations with an abortion promotion agenda. 
   PEPFAR must not be hijacked in partisanship or domestic public policy issues. We owe the world a bipartisan remedy to meet the global AIDS pandemic that meets the crisis with American resources and values, and I urge my colleagues to work on this legislation in a bipartisan and compassionate manner.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the Democrat energy bill, the Comprehensive American Energy Act. 
   I have enormous respect for the gentleman from Maryland. This is a serious issue. The American people are hurting. Gasoline prices in eastern Indiana in 6 hours on Saturday went from $3.79 a gallon to $4.29 a gallon. They expect this Congress to come together. Where I respectfully disagree with my colleague from Maryland is this is a serious issue, but this is not a serious proposal.     
   A serious proposal is considered in committees. A serious proposal is the subject of hearings. A serious proposal is the subject of more than a half a day of debate on this floor. A serious proposal gives consideration to all the Members of this Congress through the amendment process. 
   The truth of the matter is this Congress is coming to this point, because after 20 months of the Democrat majority refusing to bring a vote to the floor to allow more domestic drilling, House Republicans took this floor in the month of August, and we held it. We demanded an energy bill, a comprehensive bill that said ``yes'' to fuel efficiency, ``yes'' to conservation, ``yes'' to solar, wind, and nuclear, and, ``yes'' to more domestic drilling. 
   The Democratic majority, the drill-nothing Congress, cried ``uncle,'' and it brings us to this day. But I would suggest to my countrymen, as you hear again and again, that Republicans are refusing to take yes for an answer. Read the fine print. 
   Reality is that this is no longer a drill-nothing Congress; it's a drill almost-nothing Congress. They say ``yes'' to drilling in this bill, but not in Alaska, not in the eastern coast and not within 50 miles. They say ``yes'' to drilling, but States can decide whether we do it or not, and they won't get a single penny from revenues for allowing drilling off their shores. I guess we are just going to rely on the goodness of our States' hearts to open up their shorelines to more drilling. 
   They say ``yes'' to drilling, but litigation rules will allow environmental lawyers to tie up the leases from the very day they are filed. I say to my House Democrat colleagues, from my heart, don't do this. 
   Daniel Webster said it a century ago, and it's chiseled on the wall. Let us develop the resources of our land and call forth its power, and let us do something worthy to be remembered. 
   We can do better than this. We can pass a bipartisan comprehensive energy bill, and I urge my colleagues to do that.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, the American people are hurting. They are struggling under the weight of record gasoline prices, and in that cause Republicans have been fighting for a comprehensive energy bill that includes more drilling. Three-quarters of Americans agree with us. 
   Just last week, the drill-nothing Democrat Congress announced they are going to bring an energy bill to the floor that includes more drilling. And now they say Republicans have to take ``yes'' for an answer. 
   Well, I would suggest to my countrymen, Mr. Speaker, that they look at the fine print. The drill-nothing Congress has brought a bill that actually includes basically drill-nothing provisions. They say ``yes'' to drilling, but not in Alaska, not in the eastern gulf, and not within 50 miles. 
   They say ``yes'' to drilling, but States can decide, even though they get absolutely no revenues for choosing to drill. I guess States are going to just allow drilling out of the goodness of their hearts. 
   They say ``yes'' to drilling, but litigation rules will allow environmental lawyers to tie up all leases from the very day they are filed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas for his leadership and for yielding this time. 
   And I rise to oppose this rule. I support the Childers amendment in the form of a substitute. I am left to wonder, as I'm sure any of our countrymen looking in are wondering why, after only learning of the Democrat's energy bill last night at 9:45 on the House, we have taken some sort of a timeout from a contentious, and I thought, substantive debate on the Democrat energy bill that will be brought up, I assume, within an hour. 
   The Supreme Court of the United States has already ruled on this issue. I understand there is some disagreement in the Democrat majority over how it's to be handled from a funding standpoint, but what I don't understand is the timing. 
   Mr. Speaker, to be honest with you, I look across this aisle, I see men and women that I respect deeply and with whom I have worked on issues, sometimes in nontraditional ways. And so I would not accuse my colleagues that are here on the floor doing their duty of any ill motive. But I have to wonder about a Democrat majority that introduces this discussion about gun control on the one and only day that they are going to permit us to debate their energy bill. 
   And I think the American people are entitled to know, Mr. Speaker, the Democrat Party in the Congress, after spending the last 20 months telling their constituency and the American people that there would never be a vote allowed on this floor that would permit more domestic drilling, abruptly announced last week that they were going to bring an energy bill to the floor with drilling. 
   Now for those of us who have been clamoring for a comprehensive energy bill that included more drilling, more conservation, more fuel efficiency, solar, wind, nuclear, this was welcome news. And imagine how anxious we were late last week to wait for the Democrat bill to be filed, assuming we would have the weekend to examine it. 
   And as we waited throughout the first day of the week yesterday, it wasn't until 9:45 last night that a 290-page bill was filed on this floor. And we found that the drill-nothing Congress has introduced legislation that is essentially a drill-almost-nothing bill; and I want to speak about that in the very limited time that we have. 
   So while I oppose the rule, I want to speak about what is bearing upon the American people, bearing upon American families and school systems and seniors, and that is the unbridled and unprecedented weight of the cost of energy in America. 
   As Wall Street reels from another financial crisis, as we hear unemployment numbers that are heartbreaking to real working Americans, most Americans know the high cost of energy is costing American jobs. 
   And so on the one day that the Democrat majority will allow us to debate their comprehensive strategy for energy independence, I want to speak about what the substance of that bill is. 
   Now, as I said, the drill-nothing Democrat Congress announced they were going to bring this energy bill to the floor. It includes more drilling, and now many of them have said in many corners of the national media that Republicans have to take ``yes'' for an answer. Well, I would suggest to my countrymen, before you sign a contract, read the fine print.     
   The fine print of this contract is profoundly disappointing to those of us that were looking to give the bipartisan majority of this Congress that supports a comprehensive energy strategy, that includes a real access to America's domestic reserves, a fair up-or-down vote. 
   The drill-nothing Democratic Congress is essentially, as I said, a basically drill-almost-nothing. Here's some examples. They say ``yes'' to drilling in their bill but not in Alaska, not in the eastern gulf and not within 50 miles of our country. 
   They say ``yes'' to drilling in the bill, but they say States can decide on whether we drill off their coasts, but we will give the States no revenues whatsoever for allowing us to drill. The Governor of a coastal State was on the floor of the Congress today. When I said, ``What's the likelihood that your State will permit drilling if we offer your State legislature no revenues from the drilling in your waters?'' And he only laughed out loud. 
   I assume that the Democrat majority, in saying that unlike the Gulf States that get some 39 percent of the revenues that are drilled in their waters under existing agreements, I assume the Democrat majority believes that States will opt in to drilling out of the goodness of their hearts, out of their patriotism. Maybe not. 
   They say ``yes'' to drilling, but the lack of litigation reform will allow environmental lawyers to swarm over any new leases, even those that are permitted more than 50 miles out, and they'll be tied up in court for years before a single drop is pumped. 
   In their legislation, there's a renewable mandate that literally could cause electrical rates between now and 2012 to skyrocket on working Americans. There's no commitment to increasing our refinery capacity. There's huge tax increases on oil companies. As I've asked before to my citizens in Indiana, ``Who among you thinks by raising taxes on oil companies you're going to lower the price of gasoline at the pump?'' That's usually a laugh out loud moment in town hall meetings. That's what passes for the Democrat bill.

   We have a bipartisan majority in this Congress, including some men and women that I am looking at right now, who, if given the opportunity, would come together in a bipartisan way and pass legislation that said ``yes'' to more real drilling, but also ``yes'' to conservation, ``yes'' to fuel efficiency, ``yes'' to solar and wind and nuclear. But we can't say ``yes'' with a backroom deal brought to the floor of the Congress, given one day of debate, no amendments, and jammed through the American people.

   Despite the lack of political progress at the national level in Iraq, the military surge is working. And because the surge is working, our troops can start coming home. 
   I urge every American to tune out the rhetoric in Washington, D.C. and read the report. But don't just read the testimony of General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker; read the recent report issued by the more liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. In each case, our men and that liberal think tank found civilian deaths are down. Sunni leaders are cooperating with U.S. forces, and al Qaeda is on the run in Baghdad and Anbar province. These independent assessments should be read by every American, and every American should be encouraged; for even to a war-weary Nation, I say, if we do not grow weary in doing well, freedom will prevail in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (WE MOURN THE PASSING OF SHEIK SATTAR BUZAIGH AL RISHAWI -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, scripture tells us to mourn with those who mourn and to grieve with those who grieve. I rise today to join our allies and his family and neighbors and friends to grieve the passing by assassination last week of a courageous Iraqi in Anbar province, Sheik Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al Rishawi, a man 37 years of age that I had the privilege of meeting this last April when I visited Falluja in Ramadi. 
   It was there that I learned from General Odierno, as well, in our nearly 1-hour meeting with Sheik Sattar about how what has come to be known, Mr. Speaker, globally as the Anbar Awakening was born. You see, it was this Iraqi sheik, whose father had been killed by al Qaeda in Iraq, his three brothers had been murdered by al Qaeda, who said sometime in late 2006, ``I have had enough.'' What the general told me, and the Sheik affirmed, as he came across the river in Ramadi, sat down with the Marines perhaps in the same room where we are pictured here, and said, ``How can we, as Sunni sheik leaders, work with you, American forces, and the Maliki government to rid Ramadi, to rid al Anbar of al Qaeda?'' 
   It was the end of a bloody year in 2006, just a few months earlier that Ramadi was at the very center of what was called the Triangle of Death. According to National Intelligence Estimates, Ramadi was so far gone that it could not be reclaimed militarily. But Sheik Sattar stepped forward. He had a vision for driving terrorists from his community. As General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker reported to Congress last week and independent organizations, like the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning think tank, have confirmed, because of the leadership of Sheik Sattar and over 42 other Iraqi sheiks that he recruited, Anbar province is transformed. The city of Ramadi is transformed. It has truly been a miraculous turnaround with the virtual elimination of al Qaeda in western Iraq being the result. 
   Iraqi military leaders say to the world media, ``We considered the sheik our first line of defense.'' President Bush just 10 days ago met with Sheik Sattar in Ramadi to celebrate the first anniversary of the Anbar Awakening. Of his passing, the interior ministry named a national police brigade after him. The leader of that ministry said, ``We will be building a great statue for Sheik Sattar Buzaigh al Rishawi at the entrance of Anbar province so it will be a witness to his great accomplishments and those of the people of Iraq.'' 
   Amidst the thousands who gathered for his funeral on Friday in Ramadi, his brother would say, ``All of Anbar is Abu Risha, so Abu Risha has not been killed.'' He went on to say, ``I pledge to you, my father, my brother, my cousins, we will follow the road taken by Sheik Abdul Risha. We will follow it until we kill the last terrorist in Iraq.'' I was pleased to see that even this Sunday U.S. military forces took into custody a man believed to have been involved in his assassination. 
   We mourn with those who mourn. In my meeting with Sheik Sattar, he said a few things to me I will never forget. He said, ``Congressman Pence, when you go home, tell your people that we in Anbar believe that an attack on an American is an attack on an Iraqi.'' He said, ``Anyone who points a weapon at an American is pointing a weapon at an Iraqi.'' He also looked at me, at age 37, wearing those flowing robes with a pinstripe suit underneath them, he looked at me, and he said through those warm brown eyes, he said, ``Anyone who tells you that Iraqis don't like Americans is lying to you.'' He said, ``Iraqis love Americans.'' And then he asked me, sitting at Camp Falluja and Ramadi, why we would even discuss permanently leaving Iraq. 
   He was a man of hope, a man of courage, a man of conviction. I mourn his loss as should every American and every freedom-loving citizen of the world mourn the passing of Sheik Sattar.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Hensarling amendment. I love a good debate. It is a great privilege for me to be able to come to the floor at a time when Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Jackson are here. I find them to be two of the most forceful and effective advocates of their view in the Congress in the majority, and so I welcome this opportunity to join in the debate. And I thank the gentleman from Texas who is consistently the strongest advocate for fiscal discipline and reform in the House of Representatives. 
   I will leave aside for the moment the whole question of which party forced the requirement of MTBE to be added to gasoline and created the regulatory challenges that the gentleman refers to, and just get to the larger question here. 
   Madam Chairman, we have an $8 trillion national debt. This is an amendment to cut $8 million. And it is being forcefully opposed. I think for anyone who would be looking on the people's House today, that is a rather dramatic comparison. Let me repeat that again. The Hensarling amendment, facing the stark reality of $8 trillion in national debt, comes to the floor with an idea to ask the Federal Government to do without spending $8 million. 
   The new majority, and I congratulate them again on securing the majority in the Congress, the American people spoke. But I do remember the new majority pledged no new deficit spending. I remember promises by this new majority in last year's campaign season that we would pay as we go in the Federal budget. If there was to be spending increases, they would be offset by cuts in other areas. 
   Yet this legislation, the bill is $7 billion over the 2007 request, $10.2 billion over the President's request, and it follows seven other pieces of legislation all of which have increased spending. And some of which, Madam Chairman, I have supported, but not all. 
   And it does seem to me as I walked here to this floor, I passed one sign after another in front of the offices of some of my most distinguished Democrat colleagues that bear the number $8 trillion writ large. If we are to be concerned about $8 trillion, will we not support an effort to cut $8 million?     
   That's the choice here today and whether the gentleman from Illinois, who I deeply respect, considers that this $8 million to be an enormous benefit, might there not be States and local governments that could make up for that, with the recognition that we are creating a burden for future generations of Americans that we ought not to create? 
   So I support the Hensarling amendment. It is the least we can do to take a step backwards. 
   I want to associate myself with the distinguished chairman of this committee who rose earlier to say, and I'm quoting now, that he was tired of defending administrative accounts with amendments by people who were coming to ask for more spending in other areas. 
   It is greatly to the credit of the gentleman from Texas that he is coming to this floor simply asking that we not spend this money. There's no other amendment or no other spending request that he's making in this regard, and it's what the American people ask us to do. 
   In fact, I would close, Madam Chairman, simply by saying I think the American people are tired of the national debt. I think they're tired of the sea of red ink. I think they were tired of it when my party had control of the place, and as the gentlewoman knows, I was one of the strongest opponents of wasteful government spending when my own party was in charge. 
   And so I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know the gentleman from Texas and myself and other colleagues, we come to this floor with sincerity of purpose and with consistency that we think government ought to live within its means and pay its bills, and we think we ought to balance budgets. And the Hensarling amendment simply asks that we might cut $8 million as a modest response to $8 trillion in national debt. 
   And I challenge my colleagues, in the spirit of goodwill, let's make this statement, let's start in the direction of fiscal discipline and reform or, for heaven's sake, Madam Chairman, and I say with a smile, let's take the signs down from the hallways. Let's stop pretending that we worry about the national debt if we cannot come together as a Congress and as a nation and accept an $8 million cut to deal with an $8 trillion national debt.

Because the United States can render timely assistance, I believe that we must. But it is imperative that we not only send our resources, but we also send them in a manner that is consistent with our values. 
   It is my hope, Madam Speaker, that when the bill comes tomorrow, it will preserve the careful balance between American resources and American values that we forged in the Foreign Affairs Committee. We cannot permit PEPFAR to become a mega-funding pool for organizations that are anathema to millions of Americans.

   Unfortunately, some in our Nation's Capitol want to achieve that result by bringing back what is known as the Fairness Doctrine, an archaic government regulation imposed by the Federal Communication Commission that for decades required broadcasters to present controversial issues in a fair and balanced manner. 
   Now, it sounds acceptable enough. But there is really nothing fair about the Fairness Doctrine, Mr. Speaker. This is a relic of America's broadcasting past, and it should stay in the past where it belongs. 
   Fortunately, 2 weeks ago, 309 Republicans and Democrats in the Congress voted in favor of the Pence amendment to prevent the FCC for 1 year from reinstituting the Fairness Doctrine. 
   While I was pleased with the bipartisan passage of this legislation, today we will open a second front to ensure that the Fairness Doctrine can never come back again. In cooperation with colleagues in the House and the Senate today, we will unveil the Broadcaster Freedom Act, which will ensure that the FCC and any future administration cannot re-regulate the airwaves of America without an act of Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, join me in cosponsoring the Broadcaster Freedom Act and preserve the free airwaves of America.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, at the outset, I would like to commend both Chairman Lantos and the author of this resolution, the distinguished gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks), as well as Mr. Smith for their leadership on working to bring this and so many other human rights issues to the attention of this body. 
   As we all know, India is not only the world's largest English-speaking democracy, but it's one of the world's richest and most diverse civilizations. 
   India is also emerging as one of the world's most dynamic economies, with the results of that growth uplifting the lives of millions of citizens. Yet despite this impressive record of reform and growth, India, like all countries, including our own, also faces a number of compelling domestic challenges. 
   As was recently reported in a front-page story in the Washington Post, one of these social traumas relates to the problem of inequality and deep-seated caste prejudice. More than 200 million people in India are considered untouchable, people tainted by their birth into a caste system that deems them impure and almost less than human. 
   Despite constitutional protections and other legal and regulatory efforts by the Government of India to improve the lives of the Dalits and other Tribal peoples, all too many continue to suffer from human rights abuses, as well as discrimination. 
   In this regard, the State Department reports that while rare in urban settings, examples of intolerance occur regularly in rural areas. Many Dalits are malnourished, lack access to health care, work in poor conditions and continue to face serious social discrimination. 
   In addition, Dalit women are all too often the victims of rape and exploitation at the hands of cruel human traffickers. Tragically, they also suffer disproportionately from the ravages of HIV/AIDS. 
   This Congress and the American people are enormously respectful of Indian sovereignty, its impressive democratic heritage and its respect for the rule of law. As awkward as circumstances may be, for this body not to acknowledge these extraordinary issues would be an error. 
   In a respectful and well-balanced way, this resolution appropriately shines a light on the plight of India's untouchables, and I believe it deserves our support.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, we all understand that from time to time the Overseas Private Investment Corporation has been the subject of controversy. On the other hand, it is accurate to say that it is significant that every President since 1971 has believed that OPIC is an important tool for advancing international development in U.S. foreign policy by stimulating private capital investment. 
   In recent years, OPIC appears to have better focused its resources and efforts, bringing economic development to underserved markets in Central America, Africa, Afghanistan, and now in Iraq. 
   OPIC has also reached out to U.S. small businesses and minority- and women-owned enterprises. For example, more than 80 percent of all OPIC projects approved in fiscal year 2006 involved U.S. small- and medium-sized enterprises. 
   OPIC has also sought to enhance transparency and fight corruption, thereby leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses as they compete in international markets. 
   It's also worth noting that OPIC is embarking on new efforts to encourage investments that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of clean energy; and by charging market-based fees for its products, OPIC continues to operate as a self-sustaining agency, which I applaud, effectively operating at no net cost to taxpayers and returning net income every year of operation, with reserves now totaling more than $5 billion. 
   On balance, then, despite controversy, I believe OPIC continues to serve foreign policy interests of the United States, and I urge support of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I congratulate Representative Gillibrand, as my colleague from California did, for this important resolution. 
   For close to a century, Lake Placid has been central to America's participation and achievements in international sports. It's the only site in North America to have hosted more than one Winter Olympics, both in 1932 and in 1980. 
   Moreover, in 1980, and if you haven't seen the movie, it was the site of one of America's greatest moments, when the U.S. national hockey team defeated the heavily favored Soviet Union. Walt Disney films recently created an extraordinary motion picture remembering that miracle on ice. 
   It was not only a victory for one hockey team over another, but for millions it symbolized the triumph of freedom over tyranny and seemed to be a part of setting into motion in 1980 what we would see with the collapse of Soviet communism in 1991. It forced you out of that, so in a very real sense, Lake Placid is important in the history of freedom as well as in the history of sport. Indeed, countless Americans actually remember where we were in that glorious moment. 
   Lake Placid's contributions to international sports continue to this very day. It's the home of one of the U.S. Olympic Committee's three national training centers and regularly hosts international sports competitions, bringing together athletes from across the globe to celebrate the excellence of sports.     
   Perhaps above all, Mr. Speaker, Lake Placid is an example of what a society can accomplish. This small village in New York with a population of less than 2,700 not only is a venue for grand-scale sporting events but also welcomes over 2 million visitors every year. This resolution recognizes Lake Placid's place in Olympic history, encourages Americans to visit that village's state-of-the-art Olympic facilities, and further encourages the U.S. Olympic Committee to select Lake Placid to represent the United States in the future for the Olympic or Para-Olympic games. 
   I commend my distinguished colleague from New York again, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. McHugh, for introducing this important resolution. I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (RESOLUTION COMMENDING IDAHO ON WINNING THE BID TO HOST THE 2009 SPECIAL OLYMPICS WORLD WINTER GAMES -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to congratulate Idaho on its successful bid, as well, to host the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games and express strong support for H. Res. 380. 
   The Special Olympics program has benefited countless people with disabilities nationwide and around the globe, raising awareness, fostering support for a great cause while enabling the participants to enhance their self-confidence and gain a sense of well-deserved personal accomplishment through sports and competition. It is, in every sense, a blessing to the participants. 
   The millions of volunteers, coaches and athletes involved with the Special Olympics do a great service for their community and their country and, of course, to those with intellectual disabilities. I would also say, though, having been involved and been in attendance at Special Olympics programs, I haven't met a volunteer yet, Mr. Speaker, who didn't think that they were richer as a result of their participation in this extraordinary program, to see the courage of those who compete and the extraordinary sacrifice of the parents of those who bring them to such a wonderful opportunity. 
   Through the dedication of these volunteers, the Special Olympics have continued to grow and impact the lives of more and more people around the world. 
   The 2009 Winter Games in Idaho promise to be a great showcase for Special Olympics participants from around the world to compete at a high level and demonstrate that disabilities are no match for individuals who are driven to succeed. 
   Again, I congratulate Idaho for being selected as the host of an event of such magnitude. I extend my best wishes to their new Governor and my friend, and I am fully confident that it will be a resounding success. 
   I urge my colleagues to render their full support for this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (COMMENDING DAVID RAY RITCHESON AND RECOGNIZING HIS EFFORTS IN PROMOTING FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO COMBAT HATE CRIMES -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, the old book tells us to mourn with those who mourn and grieve with those who grieve. I rise in support today of H. Res. 535 in a spirit of bipartisanship and mutual mourning in the tragic end of the life of David Ray Ritcheson. 
   I rise to commend David Ray Ritcheson in this resolution, a survivor, as my colleague from Texas just described, of a horrific crime. We commend him for his activism in raising awareness of violent crimes in this United States. 
   As has been noted, at the age of 16 years, David Ray Ritcheson was brutally assaulted in April of 2006 while attending a party in Spring, Texas. He was hospitalized for more than 3 months, had more than 30 surgeries to restore his appearance and regain his health. David Ray Ritcheson recovered and became a spokesman and a tireless advocate against brutal crimes. He spoke eloquently and with great courage. He testified, even at his young age, with conviction before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security. He did so in a way that gave honor to both his convictions and his character. David Ray Ritcheson's courage stands as a testament to all crime victims, especially those who suffer brutal attacks. 
   Violent crime strikes at the heart of every victim, the victim's family, and their community. We must do all that we can to eradicate all violent crimes. 
   Today we gather in support of this resolution simply to mourn the passing of David, to extend our heart-felt sorrow and respect to his family and his community and all those whose life he touched with his courage. His memory will live on in our hearts. His courage will inspire us all. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PENCE. I would be pleased to do that. I thank the gentlewoman for her courtesy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, H. Res. 535, commending David Ray Ritcheson, and urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Let me say from my heart, I have great respect for the gentlewoman from Texas. She and I have an intellectual difference of opinion on the merit of hate crimes legislation. The legislation specifically referenced in this resolution as having been passed in this Congress even earlier this year as a result of some of the work of the man that we are honoring, I did not support and I do not support. 
   I don't support hate crimes laws. I don't support penalizing thoughts like action. But I do support courage. I do believe in that ancient adage that says if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. 
   I disagree with the gentlewoman on the subject of hate crimes legislation. I disagree therefore with the late David Ray Ritcheson on that issue. But I rise today because this resolution says that the House of Representatives mourns the passing of David Ray Ritcheson and commends him for his activism in contributing and raising awareness toward the eradication and elimination of hate crimes in the United States. 
   We can come together as a Congress, and I expect we will today, to pay a debt of gratitude that we owe to a life that ended too soon. I commend the gentlewoman for her quite typical and forceful advocacy of her views, but I urge my colleagues to meet on that common ground of paying a debt of gratitude to a life that, as his family looks into this debate, I hope they know whatever our views are on the issues in which David found himself caught in violence and then standing in the national debate, we admire him, we honor his life, and we mourn his passing as a Congress and as a Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (MODIFYING DEADLINE RELATING TO ELECTION BY INDIAN TRIBES -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3095 which, simply put, will provide Indian tribes a 1-year extension in which to decide how to comply with the requirements of the Adam Walsh Protection and Safety Act of 2006. It's extremely important to note to colleagues looking in on this debate, H.R. 3095 does nothing to weaken the requirements of the Adam Walsh Act on Indian tribes. The children who live on Indian reservations deserve just as much protection as children in other communities. 
   The reality is that this important legislation simply creates an opportunity for Indian tribes to obtain 1-year extension to decide how to live under those requirements. 
   The Adam Walsh enacted new requirements for States and Indian tribes to maintain sex offender registration information, post such information on the Internet and share such information among States and other Indian tribes. 
   It allows Indian tribes one year to decide whether the Indian tribe itself will implement the sex offender registration and notification, or whether the tribe will rely on the registration and notification programs operated in an adjacent State to comply with the act's requirements. 
   H.R. 3095 simply extends the deadline for one year for Indian tribes to elect how they want to comply. The Justice Department recently proposed detailed regulations for States and Indian tribes to comply with the Adam Walsh Act, but those regulations are not yet final. The Indian tribes cannot make an informed decision on how to comply with the act until those regulations are final. And this year 1-year extension will give Indian tribes sufficient time to make that choice. 
   Again, let me say, H.R. 3095 does nothing to weaken the requirements of the Adam Walsh Act on Indian tribes. I urge my colleagues to support the bill as an important, somewhat technical amendment to this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING A CHILD OF A DECEASED MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, it represents a bipartisan conviction that is unanimous in this Chamber that we owe those who serve in the uniform of the United States and who fall in that service everything. And we owe their families who share their sacrifice the same. 
   H. Con. Res. 175, brought to this floor today by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Latham), will be an expression of a Congress acting on that gratitude and on that debt. It is a highly technical matter, but as I am sure the gentleman from Iowa will explain and the gentlelady from Texas explained, this is an issue that impacts the lives of people that this Nation cherishes the most. 
   There are a number of cases where the children of single-parent servicemembers killed in action and their guardians have not been able to access death benefits intended for them. This resolution addresses cases where specific instructions were left by a servicemember as to the distribution of benefits to caretakers. 
   In order of priority, death benefits are currently distributed to a surviving spouse, children, and other classes of persons such as siblings designated by the deceased. Benefits of a single parent's minor children must be held in trust by a State court which appoints a trustee who supervises the distribution of funds on behalf of the children. This consumes time and money in instances where the deceased clearly designated a caretaker to serve as a de facto trustee. 
   The fiscal year 2008 national defense authorization bill will include a provision allowing servicemembers to begin predesignating caretakers as recipients as part of the death gratuity payment. However, neither House nor Senate provisions help families that have already been affected. Although H. Con. Res. 175 takes the form of a congressional concurrent resolution and therefore has no legal effect, it is confidently hoped that attorneys for minor children will use the text, once passed by the House, to convince State courts to honor the wishes of deceased single parents who designated caretakers for this purpose. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Latham) in particular for his tender care of the service families of these American heroes, for his advocacy on behalf of families whose loved ones paid the ultimate price while defending our great Nation. I urge the House to adopt H. Con. Res. 175. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   It is a highly formalistic sounding bill, highly technical, but I think you could sense, Mr. Speaker, the emotion in the voice and the countenance of its principal author. I would expect that Mr. Latham of Iowa is here on this floor for Kayla and for the children of those 143 soldiers who find themselves caught in a confused bureaucracy and unable to access the benefits to which they are entitled and to which the hero that they lost as a parent and a loved one intended them to enjoy. 
   So, again, I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 175, and I rise with a humble sense of gratitude for the tireless work of the gentleman from Iowa in bringing this legislation so quickly and so thoughtfully to the floor of this Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in respectful opposition to H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. And I do so understanding that what I do may well be misunderstood by some of my constituents at home and even by some looking on in this debate. But let me say emphatically that a 41 percent increase in the minimum wage that is brought to the well of Congress without providing any relief to small business owners and family farmers is irresponsible and unwise, and it will harm both the wage payer and the wage earner.  
   An excessive increase in the minimum wage will hurt the working poor, Mr. Speaker, and especially those who are trying to begin the American Dream by entering the workforce at entry level jobs. Minimum wage increases, the unbroken record of our economic history attests, raise unemployment among the young, minorities and part-time workers, the very people that a minimum wage is thought to help. And sadly, for reasons I don't entirely understand, for every increase in the Federal minimum wage, African Americans have been hit the hardest with the advent of jobs that are lost with an increase in the minimum wage. 
   It would be the late economist Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate, who said, ``The high rate of unemployment among teenagers, and especially black teenagers, is both a scandal and a serious source of social unrest.'' And then he went on to say, ``It is largely a result of minimum wage laws.'' 
   I believe the minimum wage and this increase is one of the most anti-minority, anti-poor laws that we could bring into this Congress. It violates fundamental free market economics, and it will cost jobs. 
   The Heritage Foundation recently reported that for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage there is a loss of 2 percent of entry level minimum wage jobs. This means, for what we consider today, we literally could see evaporate overnight 8 percent of the entry level jobs in this country. 
   I recently received an e-mail from a small sub sandwich restaurant owner in Anderson, Indiana, who told me of his frustration about what Congress would consider today, Mr. Speaker; and he begged me to ask for balance and justice for the wage payer as well as the wage earner. He said he had 200 applications on file, but he knew that if Congress passed this irresponsible 41 percent increase in the minimum wage, not only would he not be able to extend opportunity to some, he would have to cancel jobs for others. 
   Let us serve the wage earner and the wage payer. Let us reject this irresponsible increase in the minimum wage.

   Mr. PENCE. Last week, President George W. Bush outlined a new strategy and new tactics in our war in Iraq; he called it, ``The Way Forward.'' Sadly, many in Congress and many around the country want to go backwards; to redeploy, to undo our military commitment to freedom in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I understand this temptation, even though I disagree with it. It is always tempting to go backwards, always tempting to want to go back before loss and hardship and war. The Old Book tells us otherwise, reading, ``Forgetting what is behind, I press on.'' 
   Winston Churchill gave us this counsel: ``One ought never to turn one's back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it; if you do that, you will double the danger. But if you meet it promptly and without flinching, you will reduce the danger by half.'' So said Winston Churchill. 
   I support our Commander in Chief. I support our new way forward. We must come together as a Nation. We must decide as a Nation not to see freedom fail in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, this morning in my hometown of Columbus, Indiana, gasoline hit $3.99 a gallon, one-tenth of 1 cent just shy of $4 a gallon. 
   So I rise this morning to ask my colleagues, what's it going to take? What's it going to take to get this Congress to take action to lessen our dependence on foreign oil? 
   Now Democrats think we can tax our way to lower gas prices or, this week, sue our way to lower gas prices. But the American people know the only way to lessen our dependence on foreign oil is to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. Only by drilling in an environmentally responsible way on American soil and off American shores can the American people increase global supply and reduce the price of oil. 
   As Memorial Day weekend approaches and Hoosiers headed to the lake see gasoline prices blow past $4 a gallon, I urge my fellow Americans, after $4 a gallon, after years of inaction, ask this Congress, what's it going to take to give the American people more access to American oil?

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, the tide is turning in Iraq. As The Washington Post noted just last week, the number of attacks against U.S. soldiers has fallen to levels not seen since before February of 2006, the bombing of a Shiia shrine in Samara that touched off waves of sectarian killing. 
   The death toll of American troops in October fell to 39, the lowest level since March of 2006. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced this last Sunday that Sunni-Shiia violence in Baghdad was down more than 75 percent in the last year. 
   But sadly, today the House of Representatives will bring an Iraq supplemental bridge fund that once again brings the same tired language mandating withdrawal from Iraq. 
   It seems, Madam Speaker, the Democrats are adding denial to their agenda of retreat and defeat in Iraq. Now is not the time to micromanage a widening success in Iraq. Let's give the American soldiers the resources they need to get the job done, see freedom win, and come home safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to the rule and the bill. 
   The tide is turning in Iraq, Mr. Speaker, but nothing changes on Capitol Hill. Here we go again. Another Democrat plan for redeployment from Iraq, tying some $50 billion in necessary combat funds to a Democrat plan for withdrawal. 
   With unambiguous evidence of progress on the ground in Iraq, the Democrats in Congress seem to have added denial to their agenda of retreat and defeat. And the evidence of our progress is unambiguous. 
   I have seen many different Iraqs in my five trips, some hopeful, some not hopeful. But the news coming out of Iraq just in recent days from independent and official sources is encouraging. 
   U.S. military fatalities are down sharply: 101 Americans lost their lives in uniform in June; 39 in October. Iraqi civilian deaths are down sharply: 1,791 casualties in August; 750 in October. Mortar rocket attacks by insurgents in October were the lowest since February 2006. Iraqi officials say they plan to reduce checkpoints, ease curfews, and  open some roads around Baghdad because of the improving security situation. And this weekend, the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said that sectarian violence between Shia and Sunni in the neighborhoods of Baghdad has declined by more than 75 percent in the last 12 months. And yet here we are again, another plan for retreat and defeat in Iraq. 
   And it is not just the official sources that say we have made progress. The Associated Press just reported, ``Twilight brings traffic jams to the main shopping district of this once affluent corner of Baghdad, and hundreds of people stroll past well-stocked vegetable stands, bakeries, and butcher shops.'' 
   The Washington Post recently wrote, ``The number of attacks against U.S. soldiers has fallen to levels not seen since before the February 2006 bombing of a Shia shrine in Samarra that touched off waves of sectarian killing.'' 
   And the New York Times noted just last week, `` `American forces have routed al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the Iraqi militant network from every neighborhood in Baghdad,' a top general reported today, `allowing American troops involved in the surge to depart as planned.' '' 
   I urge my colleagues to reject again this Democrat plan for withdrawal as a part of the supplemental appropriations bill, but I urge my countrymen to give our soldiers a chance. Freedom and stability are beginning to take hold in Iraq. We cannot lose faith in ourselves or in our fighting men and women. 
   It would be Winston Churchill who exhorted his own people as follows: ``Nothing can save England if she will not save herself. If we lose faith in ourselves, in our capacity to guide and govern, if we lose our will to live, then indeed our story is told. If, while on all sides foreign nations are every day asserting a more aggressive and militant nationalism by arms and trade, we remain paralyzed by our own theoretical doctrines or plunged into the stupor of after-war exhaustion, then indeed all the croakers predict will come true and our ruin will be swift and final.'' So said the man who saved western civilization. 
   To my countrymen and to my colleagues, I say again: Reject this legislation, give our soldiers in a widening and undeniable success in Iraq a chance, and we will all, Republicans and Democrats, celebrate some day a free and democratic Iraq that will be a legacy for our children and our grandchildren for generations to come.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this Iraq supplemental bridge fund. While no one is declaring victory in Iraq, the tide is turning. But nothing changes here on Capitol Hill. And here we go again, by some estimates, the 41st effort by the majority to come to this floor and force a precipitous and reckless withdrawal of forces from Iraq, another Democrat plan for redeployment from Iraq tying $50 billion in necessary combat funds for our troops to a Democrat plan for withdrawal. 
   With unambiguous evidence of progress on the ground filling the newspapers of America, the Democrats in Congress seem to have decided to add denial to their plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq. And the newspapers speak for themselves. 
   The Washington Post last week wrote, ``The number of attacks against U.S. soldiers has fallen to levels not seen since before the February 2006 bombing of a Shia shrine in Samarra that touched off waves of sectarian killing.'' The death toll of American troops in October fell to 39, the lowest since March 2006. 
   And on Thursday last, The New York Times noted, `` `American forces have routed al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the Iraqi militant network, from every neighborhood in Iraq,' a top general said today, `allowing American troops involved in the surge to depart as planned.' '' 
   The Washington Times would say, ``Responding to the good news, Speaker Pelosi has unveiled her newest legislative strategy to damage the war efforts. House Democrats this week,'' they wrote, ``will try to enact a bill calling for immediately beginning to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq. The surrender language will be attached to a 4-month, $50 billion funding.'' 
   ``The contrast could hardly be more striking,'' they said. ``American soldiers performing heroically and successfully, risking their lives on the battlefield in Iraq, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat leadership by contrast look for ways to advertise American weakness to the enemy.'' 
   And I say from my heart, with great respect to the good and patriotic Americans with whom I differ on this point, I urge my colleagues to reject this Democrat plan for withdrawal. But I also urge my countrymen to give our soldiers a chance. I know things have not always gone as we had all hoped in Iraq. 
   In my role as the ranking member of the Middle East Subcommittee and before, I have traveled to this war-torn country five times over the last 4 1/2 years. I have seen success and I have seen less than success. I have seen advance and I have seen failure. But today, we are seeing hope spring. Freedom and stability are beginning to take hold in Iraq. And I say from my heart, we cannot lose faith in ourselves. We cannot lose faith in freedom. We must reject this latest plan for retreat and defeat.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I come to the House today to express my support for the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007. 
   I believe after much consideration that this legislation is a constitutional remedy to a historic wrong. Now, while many have focused on the political consequences of such a move, I believe the only question for a Member of Congress on such matters is this: What does justice demand and what does the Constitution permit this Congress to do about it? 
   The fact that more than half a million Americans live in the District of Columbia and are denied a single voting representative in Congress is clearly a historic wrong, and justice demands that it be addressed. At the time of the adoption of our present system of government, the Federal city did not exist apart from a reference in the Constitution. And when the District of Columbia opened for business in 1801, only a few thousand residents lived within her boundaries. Among our Founders, only Alexander Hamilton would foresee the bustling metropolis that the District of Columbia would become, and he himself was an advocate of voting representation. 
   The demands of history in favor of representation for the Americans living in Washington, D.C. are compelling. In establishing the Republic, the single overarching principle of the American founding was that laws should be based on the consent of the governed. The first generation of Americans threw tea in Boston Harbor simply because they were denied a voting representative in the British Parliament. Given their fealty to representative democracy, it is inconceivable to me that our Founders would have been willing to accept the denial of representation to so great a throng of Americans in perpetuity. 
   But the demands of justice are not enough for Congress to act. As many of my colleagues have eloquently stated, under the principles of limited government, a republic may only take that action which is expressly authorized in its written constitution. In this regard, I believe that H.R. 1433 is constitutional. And I am not alone in this view. 
   In support of this legislation, Judge Kenneth Starr, former independent counsel and U.S. Solicitor General observed: ``There is nothing in our Constitution's history or its fundamental principles suggesting that the framers intended to deny the precious right to vote to those who live in the capital of the great democracy they founded.'' 
   Now, opponents of D.C. voting rights understandably cite the plain language of Article I of the Constitution that the House of Representatives be comprised of representatives elected ``by the people of the several States.'' Now if this were the only reference to the powers associated with the Federal city, it would be persuasive, but it is not. Article I, section 8, clause 17 provides that ``Congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever'' over the District of Columbia. 
   In 1984, it would be Justice Scalia who would observe that the seat of government clause gives the Congress ``extraordinary and plenary power'' over our Nation's capital. 
   And Congress has used this power to remedy the rights of Americans in the District of Columbia in the past. In 1949, the Supreme Court upheld legislation that extended access to the Federal courts to citizens of the district even though Article III expressly limited jurisdiction of those courts to citizens of States. As Judge Starr observed: ``The logic of this case applies here,'' and I agree. 
   But one caveat, Madam Speaker. None of this argues for the District of Columbia ever to be granted a right to elect Members to the Senate. From the inception of our Nation, this House of Representatives was an extension of the people. The Senate, from the inception of our Nation, was an extension of the States. If the people of the District of Columbia would like two seats in the United States Senate, under the Constitution, they will have to become a State. 
   You know, the Old Book tells us what is required: do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God. I believe that justice demands that we right this historic wrong. The American people should have representation in the people's House. I believe that kindness demands that we do the right thing for all Americans regardless of race or political creed, and I believe that humility demands that we do so in a manner consistent with our Constitution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on this and so many other issues affecting our national defense throughout his career in Congress. 
   I rise in opposition to this supplemental bill because, simply put, it is fiscally irresponsible and constitutionally flawed. 
   Mr. Speaker, emergency war spending bills should be about emergency war spending. This bill, with $124 billion in spending, only includes $111 billion in spending that is actually related to the war on terror in Afghanistan and in Iraq. 
   Thirteen billion dollars in this legislation will be spent on unrelated domestic spending; $25 million for spinach, $125 million for shrimp, $75 million for peanuts, $5 million for shellfish. That is not a war spending bill, that is the salad bar at Denny's. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know that with the deadlines for withdrawal, retreat and defeat, this bill is constitutionally flawed. Congress can declare war. Congress can choose to fund or choose not to fund military operations. But from the very inception of this Nation, no truth has been more evident, Congress cannot conduct war. In fact, the fear of war by committee was debated and rejected in Philadelphia in 1787. 
   The Democrats have a plan to end the war. Our Commander in Chief has a plan to win the war. The problem with the Democrat plan is, as Orwell said, ``The quickest way to end a war is to lose it.'' 
   Let's reject the Democrat plan for withdrawal, retreat and defeat. Let's give our soldiers a clean bill, no pork, no strings attached, and let's unite this Nation behind our Commander in Chief's plan to win a victory for freedom in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I support the war in Iraq and the President's call for reinforcements. I made every effort to support our troops in the field, but I cannot support the Iraq supplemental because it is fiscally irresponsible and constitutionally flawed. 
   Emergency war spending bills should be about emergency war spending. In addition to much-needed support for our troops, this legislation contains billions of dollars in domestic spending that have nothing whatsoever to do with our national defense. And this bill is constitutionally flawed. 
   Under the Constitution, it is very clear; Congress may declare war; Congress may choose to fund or choose not to fund war; but Congress may not conduct war. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is fiscally irresponsible and constitutionally flawed. The American people expect this Congress to send our soldiers the resources they need to win in Afghanistan and Iraq with no strings and no pork. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, consider carefully what you will do today. The American people want our troops to come home, but they want them to win and come home. Let's give them a clean emergency spending bill, and give them a chance to do just that.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (OUR MILITARY HEALTH CARE SYSTEM -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I have long believed that how we treat the most vulnerable in society says a great deal about who we are as a Nation. So you can imagine that I, along with tens of millions of Americans, was appalled at the recent revelations in the media about the care at the outpatient facility at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. 
   Now, let me say, having visited Walter Reed more than once with my wife to visit injured Hoosier soldiers returning from battle, that there are, in fact, dedicated caregivers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, doctors and nurses and members of the facility staff who spend their days and nights helping the wounded. But the now infamous Building 18, a decrepit former hotel outside the main gates of Walter Reed, has come to public notice. It housed more than 80 soldiers. With moldy walls, soiled carpets, leaky pipes, mice, and cockroach infested, this facility was a national embarrassment. 
   I am outraged that our wounded warriors were forced to endure these terrible conditions. Our troops deserve better care, and they deserve it as soon as possible. 
   But more than the filthy living conditions, Mr. Speaker, the dirty secret of the military health care system in this country is that our injured veterans, after navigating the dangers of the battlefield, must navigate a bureaucratic morass to get the care they deserve. After receiving lifesaving surgeries at military facilities, wounded soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines must negotiate an overwhelming amount of red tape. I have seen it firsthand, working with families attempting to make their way through our veterans' and military health care system. 
   I was at the President's speech this morning at the 47th annual gathering at the American Legion as the President said that these bureaucratic delays as well as these living conditions must come to an end. The President said, ``It is unacceptable to me. It is unacceptable to you. It is unacceptable to our country. And it is not going to continue.'' 
   I applaud the President and Secretary Gates for all they have done to hold the entire chain of command responsible for the conditions at Walter Reed, but we must do more to fundamentally bring reform to the system whereby we provide health care services to our veterans. 
   Today, the American Legion signed an agreement, for instance, with Walter Reed Army Medical Center to establish an office at the facility to assist in the transition of wounded servicemembers from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is a good start. The hope is that the legion office will significantly alleviate the long backlogs in out-processing wounded soldiers. Thank God for these veterans who are willing to help. 
   As a fiscal conservative, I have long called for smaller, more accountable government. In the area of military health care, we need now, more than ever, more accountable government. I appreciate the President's emphasis on the need to improve the delivery of services and not just throw more money at it. Washington D.C. and especially this Congress under current management and, quite frankly, prior management often solves problems by throwing more money at it. But assuming Congress enacts the President's 2008 budget, the VA health care budget alone will be up 83 percent since he took office. 
   Money alone is not the answer. We must change the way we serve the medical needs of those who have served us in uniform. We need substantive reforms, and it is my hope that the Dole-Shalala Commission and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs task force that the President announced this morning are able to meet those immediate needs. 
   The President said, and I would echo today, ``We have a moral obligation to provide the best possible care and treatment to the men and women who have served our country. They deserve it, and they're going to get it.'' 
   But let us not just solve the problem with more money, with changes in the chain of command. Let us work in a bipartisan way in this Congress to fundamentally bring changes to our health care system that serves our military, that serves our veterans, that ultimately will rise to the level that each one of them deserves. 
   The Old Book says if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. One of the ways that our Nation discharges a debt that we cannot ever fully repay to those who have worn the uniform is to ensure that they receive the medical treatment that they so richly deserve. And I commit myself to that today.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of fiscal responsibility, and, therefore, conscience demands that I rise in opposition to the budget of the liberal Democratic majority in Congress. 
   The American people deserve to know. We have a $9.3 trillion national debt. They also deserve to know that there are some $53 trillion in unfunded obligations that this government has committed to in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid that our children and grandchildren will have to find some way to resolve and to fund. Frankly, if this government was a business back in Indiana, we'd have to file bankruptcy. 
   Now, tomorrow Republicans will offer a budget to deal with this fiscal crisis at the national level that's based on spending restraint, entitlement reform. It balances the Federal budget without taxes and without earmarks. 
   But the answer from the Democrat majority in Congress: The largest budget in American history, $3.1 trillion. The largest 1-year increase in public debt in American history, some $646 billion. More earmarks, higher taxes, and nothing to reform the entitlement spending that threatens the vitality of our economy and the very future of our children and grandchildren. 
   In 2006, the American people voted for change in Washington, D.C., but they weren't referring to what would be left in their pockets after the Democrats took control. We must balance the Federal budget with fiscal discipline and reform, not with more spending and more taxes. We must reject the policies of the new liberal Democrat majority in Congress and reject this budget. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for fiscal discipline and reform and join me in voting against the budget priorities of the liberal Democrat majority in Congress.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the distinguished gentleman for yielding and for his courtesy. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 2006, the American people looked at a sea of debt and deficit spending and said, Enough is enough, and President Bush got the message. 
   In using his veto pen in the Water Resources Development Act, the President is exercising the fiscal discipline that the American people demand of this Congress. But the question today is, did the Congress get the message? Even The Washington Post said, and I quote, this last Sunday: ``Mr. Bush is a bit late in trying to recover his party's reputation for fiscal conservatism.'' But they go on to say: ``And he's right: after all, the Senate and House versions of the legislation tipped the scales at $14 billion and $15 billion, respectively.'' And the compromise that lawmakers came together with is $23 billion. 
   The American people long for a Congress and a national government that will embrace fiscal discipline and reform. 
   I urge my colleagues, respectively, support the President's veto. Say ``yes'' to a renewed commitment to fiscal discipline and reform.

   Mr. PENCE. One year ago, over 300 Democrats and Republicans stood together to oppose efforts to restore the so-called Fairness Doctrine to the airwaves of this country for a single year. It was an encouraging vote. But, following that vote, I introduced the Broadcaster Freedom Act, which would permanently ban the Fairness Doctrine from ever coming back, and so far, not one single House Democrat has signed our position for an up-or-down vote on broadcast freedom. Now we know why. 
   Asked yesterday if she supported reviving the Fairness Doctrine, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi replied, ``Yes.'' At a meeting at the Christian Science Monitor, she said that the Broadcaster Freedom Act would not receive a vote because ``the interest of my caucus is the reverse.'' 
   I say to Speaker Pelosi, with respect, defending freedom is the paramount interest of every Member of the American Congress. 
   I urge my Democrat colleagues to take a stand for freedom. Oppose the Democrat leadership's plan to censure the airwaves of American talk radio and American Christian radio. Sign the discharge petition for broadcast freedom, and help us send the Fairness Doctrine to the ash heap of broadcast history where it belongs.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in respectful opposition to H.R. 3, the  Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, a bill, Mr. Speaker, that authorizes the use of Federal tax dollars to fund the destruction of human embryos for scientific research. 
   The late President Ronald Reagan wrote, ``We cannot diminish the value of one category of human life, the unborn, without diminishing the value of all human life.'' 
   The supporters argue that this debate today is between science and ideology or dogma; that destroying human embryos for research is necessary to cure a whole host of maladies, from spinal cord injuries to Parkinson's. But the facts suggest otherwise, and physicians on our side have and will continue to make the case for the ethical alternative of adult stem cell research and new breakthroughs, past and present. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, the debate over the legitimacy or potential of embryonic stem cells, I believe, is actually not the point of our debate today. We are here simply to decide whether Congress should take the taxpayer dollars of millions of pro-life Americans and use them to fund the destruction of human embryos for research. 
   This debate is not really about whether embryonic stem cell research should be legal. Sadly, embryonic stem cell research is completely legal in this country and has been going on at universities and research facilities for years. But proponents of this legislation apparently don't want to just be able to do embryonic stem cell research, they want me to pay for it. And like more than 40 percent of Americans, I have a problem with that. 
   You see, I believe that life begins at conception and that a human embryo is human life. And I believe it is morally wrong to create human life to destroy it for research. But I believe it is also morally wrong to take the taxpayer dollars of millions of Americans who believe that life begins at conception and use it to fund research that they find morally offensive. 
   This debate then, Mr. Speaker, is not about what an embryo is. This debate is about who we are as a nation. Not will we respect the sanctity of human life, but will we respect the deeply held moral beliefs of nearly half of the people of this Nation who find the destruction of human embryos for research to be morally wrong. 
   Despite what may be uttered in this debate today, I say again, this debate is not about whether we should allow research that involves the destruction of human embryos. This debate is about who pays for it. 
   Last year here in Congress, I was surrounded by dozens of snowflake babies, Mr. Speaker, children born from frozen embryos. I couldn't help but think of that ancient verse: I have set before you life and blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live. 
   It is my fervent hope, Mr. Speaker, and my prayer, as we stand at the crossroads of science and the sanctity of life, that we will choose life.

   If I may, Madam Speaker, ask the majority leader a question just for clarification purposes and colloquy. 
   Mr. Leader, on the point of order protection, I was directly involved with a handful of our own when we worked through our side changing the rules in the spring of 2005 for that point of order protection. It is, in effect, a stopgap at the point of consideration of the conference report. An essential element of that is that the point of order is debatable, and I wanted to get your assurance that as we move toward adopting that rule change that that point of order would be debatable. I believe it was for at least 10 minutes per  side. Without the opportunity to debate, there was no capacity for Members or the public to know what projects are objectionable, and that might prevent going forward in consideration. 
   And I would welcome and yield time for your response.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the distinguished majority leader for that very direct and clear reply. The minority leader nodded his assent. There's very little value in point of order protection if Members do not have the ability to point to those aspects of the legislation that are objectionable. 
   But I will also, and I'm prepared to yield time to the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee for a question, I would also say that point of order protection obviously calls for a vote on whether to proceed with consideration for the entire conference report. It would not, and Members should be alerted, it would not be a specific vote on a specific objectionable project; and, therefore, the likelihood that a point of order would be successful, given the fact that appropriations bills generally have many fathers and mothers in this institution, is fairly remote. 
   So I would say to the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee that it certainly is not a substitute for the opportunity in the regular process here on the floor to challenge specific elements of bills, whether they be earmarks or other policy-related additions and programs. And so it's to that point and to this longer-term understanding that I wanted to ask the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for some further clarification. And, again, I want to reiterate my respect for the chairman, for the leader and my special respect and gratitude for the minority leader for their efforts in this regard. 
   But with regard to your expectation, I think you just used the phrase that the amount of time that would be subject to a negotiation for a unanimous consent on each bill going forward would be a good-faith negotiation, and it would be based on, in your words roughly, the same amount of time that had been attributable to those specific appropriations bills in the past. 
   I think the chairman made reference to 108 hours earlier in the last session of the last year of the Congress. I would note that we did not consider, to my recollection, a Labor-HHS bill during that period of time. I just wanted to give the chairman a respectful opportunity to express what your expectation of that may be because for many of us the opportunity to come to the floor and challenge individual provisions of bills and also make amendments for additions to bills is critical, and I would yield.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor today, along with my partners in this amendment, Congressman JEB HENSARLING of Texas, Congressman JEFF FLAKE of Arizona, very much in a spirit of bipartisanship. We come to the floor in this moment, on this amendment, to be about that, which I think we are all about. 
   The freedom of speech and the freedom of the press is not a partisan issue in this Congress. We all live under and cherish that first amendment that says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. 
   I, myself, Mr. Chairman, have worked in a bipartisan way in this Congress to fashion legislation that ensures a free and independent press. The amendment before this body today is simply an extension of that mission. 
   Our legislation would simply say that none of the funds made available in this act may be used by the Federal Communications Commission to implement the Fairness Doctrine, as repealed in 1985. 
   Now, the Fairness Doctrine actually came to pass in 1949, part of a regulation of a much older law. It required broadcasters to prevent controversial issues in a fair and balanced manner. That sounds reasonable enough. But because of the lack of clarity in the regulation, in the commission's rulings, broadcasters, during almost four decades, often opted not to offer any controversial programming whatsoever. 
   The FCC concluded that, in fact, by 1985, this regulation was having a chilling effect on the public debate and repealed it effective 1987. Since the demise of the Fairness Doctrine, talk radio particularly has emerged as a dynamic forum for public debate and, I offer, an asset to the Nation. 
   Our amendment, simply put, is an effort to maintain the status quo, to prevent this administration and this Federal Communications Commission, in this fiscal year about which we are debating, to use no funds to return the Fairness Doctrine. 
   Now, I want to acknowledge the fact that there are some who are skeptical about the need for this amendment. I have heard distinguished and respected Members of this body come to this floor and say that this is, quote, an issue which does not exist, and have seen writing, and I expect we will hear rhetoric to that effect, and I will respect the words of each person that utters that view, but I will differ. 
   Just for example, in the last 2 days, the Senate majority whip, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, RICHARD DURBIN, said, ``It's time to reinstitute the Fairness Doctrine.'' That was yesterday. In the last several days, the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN, said she was looking at reviving the Fairness Doctrine. The Democrat nominee for the President of the United States in 2004, the distinguished Senator JOHN KERRY, said, ``I think the Fairness Doctrine ought to be there,'' and he went on to say, ``I also think the equal time doctrine ought to come back.'' Most recently, the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, published an entire report on what it called the ``structural imbalance of political talk radio.'' 
   So you will forgive me if many of us sense there is afoot in the Nation's Capital a bit of a cool breeze on the freedom of the press and the freedom of expression on the airwaves. So we seize this opportunity in the appropriations process, with my partners, JEFF FLAKE and JEB HENSARLING, and hopefully a bipartisan majority in this Congress, to say yes to freedom and to reject, in this fiscal year, the power that we have in the spending bill, any funds to be spent to bring back this unfairness doctrine to American broadcasting law. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. America is at war. We have to do all we can to protect ourselves from those who seek to do us and our communities and our families harm. But for the past few weeks, we have unilaterally disarmed, because this House has failed to pass an acceptable long-term extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and it will fail again today. 
   The United States Senate passed a workable bipartisan compromise by a vote of 68-29 that extended FISA for nearly 6 years. The Senate bill provided necessary immunity to communication providers who aided the government after 9/11, and they are now facing numerous frivolous lawsuits as a result. It also closed a massive loophole in our foreign intelligence surveillance laws that prevents us from listening to terrorists in one foreign country who are talking to a terrorist in another foreign country; yet the Senate bill is not before us today. 
   It is extraordinary that a bipartisan compromise and accomplishment in the United States Senate is not being considered before this House today. 
   Last August, Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee came together in the Protect America Act and we forged a compromise, but it was only embraced in the short term. And, sadly, the Senate will not pass this bill, even if it passes the House today, and if it did, the President will veto it. So what we are involved in here is a futile attempt at compromise that will fail. 
   Speaking less as a Congressman and more as a father and as an American who was here on September 11, I urge my colleagues to take a breath, to step back, to examine the spirit of compromise evidenced by our colleagues in the Senate, and find a way to give our foreign intelligence gathering the tools they need to protect our families.

   I have heard a lot of generosity on the floor today, Mr. Speaker. People can always be generous with other people's money. And it seems that the new majority back in power has already gone the way of the old Democratic majority and, in fairness, along the way of mistakes that we made. 
   I was one of the Republicans that opposed our effort to vastly expand Medicare with the prescription drug entitlement. I think voters actually put some of us on the pavement because, with an $8 trillion national debt, they are tired of reckless and runaway spending in Washington, D.C. 
   This bill is a massive increase in the government's role in health care. It makes millions of middle-class families eligible for government insurance, many of which are already covered under private plans. I don't think taxpayers should be required to pay for government insurance for the children of parents who earn up to $80,000 a year. And we do this at the expense of seniors, cutting into the Medicare Advantage program. 
   And I would say to you American taxpayers should not have to support a system that provides health insurance coverage for illegal immigrants. This legislation allows funding of illegal immigrants in health care. It cuts health care for millions of senior citizens in the Medicare Advantage program. It provides government insurance for higher-income families, and it drastically expands the role of the government in America's health care system. 
   It just seems to me this new majority does well when it reminds the American people that we have a moral obligation to come to terms with an $8 trillion national debt. The next time I hear one of those speeches on the floor, Mr. Speaker, you will forgive me if I run to the floor to remind people of a $47 billion middle-class entitlement that passed the Congress today.

It would be Thomas Jefferson who would remind the American people that the government reaches actions only and not opinions, in his famous letter to the Danbury Baptists. 
   This legislation is unnecessary and bad public policy. Violent attacks on people or property are already illegal regardless of the motive behind them, and there is no evidence that underlying violent crimes at issue here are not already being fully and aggressively prosecuted. Therefore, hate crimes laws serve no practical purpose and, instead, serve to penalize people for their thoughts and beliefs. 
   Now, some of these thoughts and beliefs are abhorrent, like racism and sexism, and I disdain them. But hate crimes bills are broad enough to encompass legitimate beliefs as well, and protecting the rights of freedom of speech and religion must be paramount on our minds. 
   The first amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. There is a real possibility that this bill, as written, that religious leaders or members of religious groups could be prosecuted criminally based on their speech or protected activities under conspiracy laws or section 2 of title XVIII, which holds a person criminally liable if they aid and abet in the commission of a crime. Putting a chill on a pastor's words or a religious broadcaster's programming, an evangelical leader's message, or even the leader of a small group Bible study is a blatant attack on the constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of religion. 
   Last week, I offered an amendment before the committee that simply would have stated that nothing in this section limits the religious freedom of any person or group under the Constitution. Unfortunately, this amendment was rejected by the majority and rejected by the Rules Committee for consideration today. 
   We must guard against the potential for abuse of hate crimes laws. The Pence amendment would have done so by stating, once and for all, that people in groups will not have their constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of religion taken away. 
   On this National Day of Prayer, let's take a stand for the right of every American to believe and speak and pray in accordance with the dictates of their conscience and reject this legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today in strong opposition to H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. 
   As Thomas Jefferson once said, ``Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should `make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.'' 
   This legislation is unnecessary and bad public policy. Violent attacks on people or property are already illegal regardless of the motive behind them and there is no evidence that the underlying violent crimes at issue here are not already being fully and aggressively prosecuted in the States. Therefore, hate crimes laws serve no practical purpose and instead serve to penalize people for their thoughts, beliefs or attitudes. 
   Some of these thoughts, beliefs or attitudes such as racism and sexism are abhorrent, and I disdain them. However the hate crimes bill is broad enough to encompass legitimate beliefs, and protecting the rights of freedom of speech and religion must be paramount in our minds. 
   The First Amendment to the Constitution provides that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'' America  was founded upon the notion that the government should not interfere with the religious practices of its citizens. Constitutional protection for the free exercise of religion is at the core of the American experiment in democracy. 
   There is a real possibility that as this bill is written, religious leaders or members of religious groups could be prosecuted criminally based on their speech or protected activities under conspiracy law or section 2 of title 18, which holds criminally liable anyone who aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission; or one who ``willfully causes an act to be done'' by another. 
   In the debate at the Judiciary Committee, much was made of the fact that an amendment was adopted by the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. DAVIS. However, that amendment did not go far enough in making it clear that the bill will not limit religious freedom. The sponsor of the amendment admitted that a pastor could still be targeted under the bill for incitement of violence for simply preaching his religious beliefs. For example if a pastor included a statement in his sermon that sexual relations outside of marriage is wrong, and a member of the congregation caused bodily injury to a person having such relations, that sermon could be used as evidence against the pastor. 
   Putting a chill on a pastor's words, a religious broadcaster's programming, an evangelical leader's message, or even the leader of a small-group Bible study is a blatant attack on the Constitutionally-guaranteed right to freedom of religion. 
   Last week when the Judiciary Committee took up this bill, I offered an amendment to make it clear that the bill will not affect the Constitutional right to religious freedom. 
   The Pence Amendment stated, ``Nothing in this section limits the religious freedom of any person or group under the Constitution.'' 
   Unfortunately, the amendment was defeated by the majority in the Judiciary Committee. Yesterday, I submitted the Pence Religious Freedom Amendment to the Rules Committee for consideration, but that committee chose to adopt a closed rule for today's debate, effectively blocking my amendment and many other good amendments from consideration. 
   We must guard against the potential for abuse of hate crimes laws, and the Pence Amendment would have done so by stating once and for all that people and groups will not have their Constitutionally-guaranteed right to religious freedom taken away. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill threatens religious freedom by criminalizing religious thoughts. On this National Day of Prayer, let's take a stand for the right of every American to believe, speak and pray in accordance with the dictates of their conscience. Take a stand for religious freedom and the First Amendment and vote no on the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (REPUBLICAN STUDY GROUP -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Minority Leader for affording not only myself, but other members of the Republican Study Committee, the House conservative caucus on the Republican side of the aisle, the opportunity to take advantage of these opportunities on the House floor periodically in the form of a Special Order. 
   While I come to the floor today with the objective, Mr. Speaker, of addressing this week's momentous events concerning the President's second veto in the history of this administration and the war supplemental bill, I wanted to also speak about an issue that House conservatives have been heard on and have been active on in the course of this week, and it has to do with today's passage, by a vote of 237-180, of H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This legislation passed the House today, but not without the strenuous opposition of both the Republican Study Committee, and virtually all of its members who represented a lion's share of the 180 Members who opposed this legislation. 
   And to lead is to be misunderstood. And it is very likely, Mr. Speaker, that both yourself and maybe others that might be looking in would question why anyone would oppose hate crimes legislation. And I thought I might, before I move on to the attendant topic of the day, address the concerns that House conservatives had with this legislation and why, last night, with the leadership of our caucus chairman, Jeb Hensarling of Texas, and with the support of myself as a former chairman of our caucus, Mrs. Sue Myrick of North Carolina, a former chairman of our conference, and John Shadegg of Arizona, we urged the President of the United States to issue a veto threat of this hate crimes legislation, which he did so earlier today by way of a statement of administration policy. 
   So let me speak to our concerns about this bill before I move on to the topic of the Iraq supplemental. Thomas Jefferson said, famously, ``Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative power of government reach actions only, and not opinions,'' Jefferson went on to say, ``I contemplate with sovereign reverence that the act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and state.'' 
   Again, Thomas Jefferson, framing, as perhaps only he in American history could, the issue that grounded conservative concern in the hate crimes legislation today, that legislative powers of government should reach actions only and not opinions, and then reflected on that as the core central logic behind the first amendment protections of the freedom of religion. 
   In the case of the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act, we did not meet that standard today, Mr. Speaker. I believe this legislation was bad public policy, and unnecessary, and many House conservatives in the Republican Study Committee agreed. 
   Violent attacks on people or property are already illegal, regardless of the motive behind them. And there is no evidence presented on the floor today or before the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, that underlying violent crimes at issue are not already being fully and aggressively prosecuted in the States. Therefore, hate crimes laws truly serve no practical purpose and instead serve to penalize people for thoughts, for belief, for opinions. 
   Now, let's grant the point. Some thoughts, beliefs and opinions, like racism or sexism are abhorrent, and I disdain them and condemn them. However, hate crimes bills, as the one we passed today, are broad enough also to include legitimate beliefs, and protecting the rights of freedom and speech and religion must be paramount in cases like the bill we consider today. 
   The first amendment to the Constitution provides that Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. 
   Now, America was founded on the notion that the government should not interfere with the religious practices of its citizens. Constitutional protections for the free exercise of religion are at the very core of the American experiment in democracy.  
   But what does that have to do with the hate crimes bill? Well, there is a real possibility that this bill, as written, religious leaders or members of religious groups could be prosecuted criminally, based on their speech and protected activities under conspiracy law or section 2 of title XVIII, which holds criminally liable anyone who aids, abets, counsels, commands or induces or 
   procures its commission, or one who willfully causes an act to be done by another. 
   In the debate in the Judiciary Committee, much was made of the fact that there was an amendment adopted by my friend and colleague, Mr. Davis of Alabama. But that amendment did not go far enough in making it clear that this bill would not limit religious freedom. The sponsor of the amendment even admitted in open markup testimony before the committee, that a pastor could, theoretically, still be targeted under the bill for incitement of violence for simply preaching his religious beliefs having to do with moral issues related to life or family or sexual preference. 
   For example, if a pastor included a statement in a sermon that sexual relations outside of marriage are morally wrong, and even quoted the Bible to make that point, and then a member of perverse intention in that congregation caused bodily injury to a person having such relations, that sermon could be used as evidence against that pastor. 
   Now, the real world effect of this, in addition to the possibility of prosecution, is the much greater and geometric possibility of a chilling effect. Putting a chill on pastors' words or religious broadcasters' programming or an evangelical leader's message, or even the leader of a small group Bible study is quite simply a blatant attack on the constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of religion. 
   Now, last week, when the Judiciary Committee took up the bill, I offered an amendment in good faith to make it clear, crystal clear, that this bill would not affect the constitutional right to freedom of religion. The Pence amendment stated plainly, ``Nothing in this section limits the religious freedom of any person or group under the Constitution.'' Unfortunately, the Pence amendment was defeated and rejected by the majority of the Judiciary Committee. 
   Yesterday, I took another bite at the apple. I submitted the Pence religious freedom amendment to the Rules Committee for consideration. But, again, that committee chose to adopt a closed rule, effectively blocking my amendment and many other good amendments offered for consideration. 
   Now, I would say very emphatically, we must guard against the potential for abuse of hate crimes laws. And very humbly put, the Pence amendment would have done so by stating once and for all that people and groups will not have their constitutionally guaranteed right to religious freedom taken away, even as an addendum to or unintentionally as a result of the aiding and abetting clause of current law. 
   Mr. Speaker, House conservatives rose, as one man and one woman today, in opposition to this legislation. But it did pass. Again, Congress today adopted legislation, 237-180, but not without a fight. 
   Members of the Republican Study Committee came together late last night, called on President George W. Bush to veto this legislation should it reach his desk. And as I mentioned earlier today, the administration, in no small measure, due to House conservatives and the leadership of the Republican Study Committee, the administration issued a veto threat pertaining to the Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. They did so as House conservatives did, out of a belief that this bill threatens religious freedom by criminalizing ultimately religious thought. 
   And I must say before I move to my next topic, it was particularly grievous to many of us that the Democrat majority in Congress chose the National Day of Prayer to bring this bill to the floor; a bill that intentionally or unintentionally, could put in jeopardy the very religious expression that was being celebrated at tens of thousands of locations across the United States today. 
   I, myself, began my day in the east room of the White House with the President of the United States and religious leaders representing every faith in America to initiate and kick off this National Day of Prayer in, I believe, its 56th consecutive year. 
   In the ceremonies that took place here just off the Capitol, across the street in the Cannon Office Building, I learned that due to the leadership of Shirley Dobson and the organizers of the National Day of Prayer, by their estimates, there were some 50,000 venues in the United States of America where people were coming together, Mr. Speaker, not for politics, not for the purpose of political demonstrations, not to support one party over another, but as happened in Anderson, Indiana today at City Hall, for the purpose of coming together in prayer, believing that the effective and fervent prayers of a righteous Nation availeth much, believing that our prayers reach heaven and the throne of grace as Americans, by the millions, have believed from the very inception of our Nation.     
   And again I say I don't believe it was intentional. I would not ascribe this to the Democrat majority. But it was grievous, I can say, to many of us that this legislation, which we believe in our hearts threaten the very fabric of the first amendment, freedom of religion, was scheduled to come to the floor on the National Day of Prayer. 
   On the floor today, I closed with the thought that on this National Day of Prayer, we ought to take a stand for the right of every American to believe and speak and pray in accordance with the dictates of their conscience, that we ought to take a stand for religious freedom and the first amendment in opposing the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. 
   And with that let me yield to the planned topic of the day, and I may well be joined by colleagues on the attendant question that has been the preoccupation of much of official Washington, much of the national media, and, understandably, much of the American people over the last week. It has to do, of course, Mr. Speaker, with the President's decision to exercise his authority in the executive branch under the Constitution to veto legislation delivered to him by the Congress of the United States. This was, in fact, the President's second veto. And today's Republican Study Committee leadership hour was organized to speak to the issue of Iraq and specifically the Iraq supplemental. 
   It was, as I said, a momentous week. We began with the delivery to the President of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act on May 1. The President very promptly addressed the Nation at the dinner hour and announced his intentions to veto the legislation, just his second veto in the history of the 43rd President of the United States. 
   The President made his objections clear, that, in effect, he vetoed this legislation because he believed, as I do, as House conservatives do, that the legislation was constitutionally flawed and fiscally irresponsible. 
   The President made reference specifically to the arbitrary date for beginning withdrawal of American troops without regard to conditions on the ground. He spoke of the effort by Congress, his words now, ``to micromanage the commanders in the field by restricting their ability to direct the fight in Iraq.'' And he also mentioned that this legislation ``contained billions of dollars of spending and other provisions completely unrelated to the war.'' 
   The President spoke of the precipitous withdrawal from Iraq not being a plan for peace in the region. The mandated withdrawal in the legislation, he argued, would actually embolden our enemies and it could lead to a safe haven for terrorism in Iraq. 
   The President probably focused most of his objections in his message to the Nation on the micromanagement of the war by Congress. I have said many times on this floor, as many House conservatives have, under the Constitution of the United States, Congress can declare war. Congress can choose to fund or not to fund military operations. But Congress may not conduct war. And in the President's veto message to the Nation, it was precisely that effort by Congress, that constitutional overreach, in his words, to ``micromanage''  this war in Iraq that he found most unacceptable. The President would say the legislation is unconstitutional ``because it purports to direct the conduct of the operations of the war in a way that infringes upon the powers vested in the Presidency by the Constitution, including as commander in chief of the Armed Forces.'' 
   In a very real sense this is an issue, Mr. Speaker, that the Founders of this Nation thought about, I would argue, more deeply than maybe any other issue in that balmy summer of 1787. It was the debate over whether or not we want a unified chain of command in the commander in chief, centered in the Presidency, or whether we wanted to risk creating the possibility or the prospect of what our Founders would call ``war by committee.'' 
   Now, this notion of war by committee was actually something our Founders were fairly familiar with. A very cursory study of the early months of the Revolutionary War, from the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, all the way until that famed Christmas Day, 1776, is a classic case of an American military that is being beaten back, chased out of New York, chased across the Hudson River, chased all the way across New Jersey, and was facing great peril by the time they reached the Delaware. And many would observe, in the years that followed the war during the period of the formation of our constitutional government, that it was precisely war by committee that put our Nation in its nascent days most at risk. 
   History records that every night General Washington would spend a great deal of his time in his tent in the midst of the war, writing back to Congress, handing letters to couriers to send messages to the Congress to gain specific permission for military operations and appropriations and the conduct of the war. And the Congress was very busy engaging in what our Founders came contemptuously to refer to as ``war by committee.'' 
   When the Constitutional Convention came around in 1787, it would be precisely that same generation of Americans that would say ``no,'' we want a unified chain of command, we want to vest in the President of the United States the ability to conduct war as the commander in chief. 
   And I think singularly the President's objection is grounded there, with the slight addition of some more than $10 billion in additional spending that has nothing whatsoever to do with the conduct of the war in Afghanistan, Iraq, or, to that end, the conduct of the War on Terror. 
   House conservatives in the past have opposed war supplementals on the grounds that war spending bills ought to be about war spending and emergency war spending bills ought to be about emergency war spending. And the addition of funding, which the President described as ``billions of dollars of spending and other provisions'' that are ``unrelated to the war,'' are not an emergency and are not justified was altogether appropriate, in our judgment. The President said emphatically that ``Congress should not use an emergency war supplemental to add billions in spending to avoid its own rules for budget discipline and the normal budget process,'' and House conservatives agreed. 
   We were pleased to see the President veto this legislation, because House conservatives and the Republican Study Committee and, for that matter, virtually all House Republicans believed the bill, as the President found it, was constitutionally flawed and fiscally irresponsible. We would vote in a matter of a few legislative hours later to sustain the President's veto and facilitate a meeting that took place just yesterday, I believe, Mr. Speaker, between the leaders of the House and Senate in Congress and the President. And it seems to me that it was a pivot point in the debate, and I want to shift some of this conversation today to the same kind of pivot point. 
   While, frankly, Democrat leaders emerged from the West Wing speaking very little about compromise and it seems like the rhetoric of the Senate majority leader as well as the Speaker of the House centered around the phrase ``end the war,'' that their objective remained to be end the war, it would be President Bush in the Cabinet 
   room who struck a more conciliatory tone. And I commend him for it. 
   The President said, and I am quoting now, ``Yesterday was a day that highlighted differences. Today is a day where we can work together to find common ground.'' And I believe House Republicans would share the President's sentiment that we can and should move forward to find common ground; not to compromise on those principles of constitutionality and fiscal discipline that the President articulated and we fully support, but to look for ways that we can ensure that these resources reach our troops in a timely way without strings attached and without fiscally irresponsible spending. And to that end, we will work and labor in the days ahead. 
   My personal hope and ambition, Mr. Speaker, is that before we return home for Memorial Day, before we return home to that day where we remember those who did not come home, that we would be able to speed the resources to our soldiers in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq without unconstitutional strings and without additional and unnecessary spending. 
   But there is one other reason why I believe it is imperative that we provide these resources to our troops in the field, and it has not been highlighted as much I believe as it should, but it has been a point that I have felt a burden about ever since my return from Iraq just shortly 1 month ago. I began the month of April in a delegation that took me literally into the heart of Baghdad and to Ramadi and to Tikrit. We met with General David Petraeus and learned a great deal about the beginnings of modest progress on the ground in Iraq. And so I would posit at the beginning of the balance of my time to suggest that the President was right to veto this legislation because it was constitutionally flawed. The President was right to veto this legislation because it was fiscally irresponsible. But I also believe the President was right to veto this legislation and Congress would be right to find a way to deliver these funds to our troops because we are beginning to see evidence that the surge, that our new strategy, that our new diplomatic initiatives in the region are just beginning to take hold; and now is not the time for us to reverse course and to embrace the objective of those who would say the American people, whatever the circumstances on the ground in Iraq, apparently, want us to end the war. 
   In my district I would say with confidence, the constituents of eastern Indiana want our troops to come home, but they want us to win and come home, and more importantly, they want freedom to win in Iraq and then bring our soldiers home. 
   And let me say that despite a recent wave of insurgent bombing, this war in Iraq is not lost. In fact, because of the President's surge, because of the brave conduct of U.S. and Iraqi forces on the ground in Baghdad, we are beginning to see the evidence of modest progress in Iraq. Let me say emphatically Baghdad is not safe, but it is safer because of the presence of more than two dozen U.S. and Iraqi joint operating centers that are now spread throughout the capital city of Baghdad. 
   I had the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, of visiting one of these joint operating centers across the river from the Green Zone right in the heart of downtown Baghdad. These facilities represent a sea change in the strategy of U.S. and Iraqi forces in the capital city of Baghdad. The very essence of the surge, first recommended, of course, by the Iraq Study Group on page 72 of the publication that is available for most Americans, the very centerpiece of this surge was not that we could deal with the instability in Iraq strictly with a military solution but, rather, as the Iraq Study Group recommended and the President ultimately embraced, that we could increase forces in the city of Baghdad temporarily to quell violence in Baghdad, to create a sufficient level of stability in the capital city to allow the political process of reconciliation, de-Baathification, and oil agreement and the diplomatic process in the region to take hold. That is the essence of the surge. 
   Now, to make that possible, as General Petraeus described to me walking down the streets in Baghdad, our strategy now is different from the strategy we have employed the last 3 years. In Baghdad, rather than sending our troops out on patrols, confronting the enemy, and returning to our base installations, now we move into areas  with sufficient forces to clear areas, to hold areas by establishing joint operating centers where U.S. and Iraqi forces live together, and then investing the resources to build up those areas and add further security. 
   As I said, Baghdad is not safe, and it was not safe the day we were there. But it is safer because American and U.S. forces are beginning to move into these areas, again, more than two dozen of these joint operating centers. Once areas have been cleared in house-to-house searches, clearing out weapons caches, arresting and confronting dangerous insurgents and al Qaeda, then U.S./Iraqi forces move into those joint operating centers and live there and patrol those areas 24/7. U.S. forces actually stay at the joint operating centers, bunking in with Iraqi forces. 
   One of the more moving moments for me on our tour of Baghdad 1 month ago was walking into the bunkhouse with both U.S. and Iraqi military on either side of us and then being told by U.S. commanders on the ground that they had offered the Iraqis, out of sensitivity to their different religious traditions and observances, to build separate sleeping quarters for the U.S. forces and the Iraqi forces.     
   And it was the Iraqi forces that said absolutely not, that now you've got bunkhouses, which are really pretty informal, just bunk beds kind of slapped together in wood frames the way you would see at almost any military installation. And U.S. and Iraqi forces are bunking in together. They are deploying together. And the result of that is that sectarian violence in Baghdad has been reduced in some neighborhoods of Baghdad by a very significant amount. 
   Again, let me say again, because I have demonstrated in the past the capacity to be misunderstood; Baghdad is not safe, but it is safer, I believe, because of the surge of U.S. forces into the neighborhoods of the capital city and the establishment of more than two dozen joint operating centers where U.S. and Iraqi forces are working together to confront al Qaeda and insurgents and to quell violence in the capital city. 
   There has also been another significant development that argues against reversing course, or to borrow the phrase of some leaders in the majority, ``just ending the war'' at this point, and that is specifically in western Iraq, what is known as the al Anbar province, which is known as Ramadi. 
   Now, I stood at the grave site of an Indiana soldier; I stood and prayed with his parents. He fell on the streets in combat in Ramadi some 2 years ago. It's extraordinary the difficulty U.S. forces have faced. The Marines have been in Ramadi for a number of years. It has been one of the most deeply compromised cities in Iraq. Ramadi is, in effect, the upscale Sunni city in Iraq. During the era of Saddam Hussein, those who did not live in the highly fortified Green Zone in downtown Baghdad lived in upscale Sunni neighborhoods in Ramadi. 
   And so one can imagine that al Qaeda and the insurgency, in efforts to resist the al Maliki government, their violence would be centered on the streets of Ramadi. And that has absolutely been true until very recently. 
   Things have changed in al Anbar province and Ramadi. Even The New York Times, perhaps one of the harshest critics of the war in Iraq, I think it was Sunday morning, this last weekend, depicted a huge front page story about the change in al Anbar province. And I would like to say, and I will say that the presence of U.S. Marines, under the command of General Odierno on the ground in Ramadi, have played a vital role in the precipitous decline of al Qaeda and insurgent violence in Ramadi and in al Anbar province. But General Odierno and the others would be quick to say that the real difference that has been made has been because the Sunnis themselves, Iraqi tribal leaders, 20 out of the 22 tribes have stepped forward now and initiated what has been called the ``Iraq Awakening Movement.'' 
   During my trip to Ramadi just one month ago, I had the privilege of meeting with Sheik Sattar, a compelling and impressive man. His father was killed by al Qaeda in Ramadi. His two brothers were killed by al Qaeda in Ramadi. And Sheik Sattar, who presumably had had very little interest in becoming involved in the new government in Baghdad, Sunnis, if you will recall, had largely not participated in the national referendums and elections that have taken place, it would be Sheik Sattar who would go to the Marine Corps base several months ago in Ramadi and say, I'm done with al Qaeda and I'm done with the insurgency, how can I help. 
   And Sheik Sattar has now organized this Iraq Awakening Movement. To be specific, 22 of the 24 Ramadi area tribes are now cooperating with coalition forces, U.S. and Iraqi forces. And the decline in violence in Ramadi is that U.S. troops have established four bases, along with 40 joint security stations and observation posts throughout the city of Ramadi where they work and deploy and live alongside Iraqi soldiers. There are also 23 police stations in the city and in the surrounding area, as has been reported in the media in recent days. 
   Al Anbar province is not safe, but significant progress is occurring because the tribal sheiks have begun cooperating with American and Iraqi forces to fight al Qaeda, providing intelligence. And we are beginning to see a significant shift in al Anbar province. And I cite no further than the front page of The New York Times that actually had what I found to be a deeply moving photograph above the fold that showed a city where there has been war for some time. 
   The rubble of war shown along streets and torn asunder buildings, but there walking on the street were people and couples and children. And I caught sight of people on bicycles. When I was in Ramadi, we were presented with information of areas that had been protected from suicide bombs and car bombs, where soccer fields had opened back up. Children were returning to the streets. 
   Al Anbar province is changing. Is it safe? No. But is it improving? Yes. And the truth is that the progress that we're making on the ground in Baghdad, the modest progress demonstrated in the reduction of sectarian violence in the capital city, and what appears to be the beginnings of a sea change in the entire western half of Iraq, including in what was a war-torn city of Ramadi, give me hope. In fact, I characterized in an editorial in USA Today that what we saw a month ago in Baghdad could be evidence of just the sprouting of a springtime of hope in Iraq. 
   Let me say with confidence, Mr. Speaker, I know there is great frustration in this Congress and there are profound visions in this Congress over the role of this institution in developing policy in Iraq, and we will continue to have those arguments. But I would defy anyone to prove to me that there is one single Member of Congress who would like to see freedom lose in Iraq. I don't accept that. 
   Some may have come to the conclusion that freedom has lost and it can't be saved. I disagree with that. I don't believe freedom is lost. I don't believe the war is lost. But I believe in their heart of hearts, even the most hard-over opponent of continued U.S. involvement in Iraq who serves in this Chamber does not want to see freedom lose. 
   So I come to the floor today on behalf of the 
   Republican Study Committee, on behalf of my own franchise in Congress, to essentially just suggest that there are many good reasons why the President vetoed the war supplemental this week. Number one, it's constitutionally flawed. It's simply wrong for Congress to place arbitrary timelines for withdrawal, to tie the hands of commanders on the ground, to engage in the kind of micromanagement that is beyond the purview of the Constitution of the United States. Congress can declare war; Congress can choose to fund or not to fund war; but Congress cannot conduct war. And that was reason enough for the President of the United States to veto this bill. 
   The bill was also fiscally irresponsible. We ought to ensure that war spending bills pertain exclusively to war spending. And particularly emergency war spending bills ought to be emergency war spending and not domestic projects that should be dealt with in the regular budget process. 
   The third thought I had today was simply to say that we ought to now find a way to come together, without  compromising core principles on either side of the aisle, we ought to find a way to come together to get our troops the resources they need to get the job done, because the unspoken fact this week, in the midst of a lot of political conflagration and argument, is the fact that, as General David Petraeus told us here on Capitol Hill last week, there is evidence that the surge, and there is evidence that because of Sunni leadership, tribal leadership in al Anbar province in Ramadi, there is evidence that Iraq is beginning to make modest progress toward exactly the kind of stability that will make possible the political progress and the diplomatic progress that are the real long-term answer here. 
   Let me emphasize that point one more time. I don't think there is a military solution in Iraq; we simply cannot surge troops to the four corners of Iraq. That is not the President's plan. It would not be workable in any event. I believe the President's plan is sound, to surge troops into the capital city to quell violence sufficient to give the al Maliki government in Baghdad the credibility to move a de-Ba'athification agreement, to move an agreement for sharing the revenues of oil proceeds with all of the people in Iraq on an equitable basis, to move new provincial elections, including in al Anbar province, where many of the Sunni leaders that we met with had expressed an interest in participating in provincial elections, should they be scheduled in the next month or two. But it is that kind of political process that will encourage ownership by Iraqis in this new constitutional republic that will be the real victory for freedom. 
   As the President said this week, we cannot define success in Iraq as the absence of violence. The day that freedom wins, whatever that day would be, the day that we can know with a moral certitude that this new democratically elected government in Iraq is able to defend itself, able to defend its people, the day we have the moral certitude that they can do that and we can begin then to come home in good conscience, there will likely be insurgent and al Qaeda violence taking place somewhere in Iraq. Therefore, we cannot define victory as the absence of violence, but we can define victory as the presence of a stable democratic, constitutional republic that can defend itself. And that, it seems to me, beyond the issues that the President raised when he vetoed the legislation, is the most compelling argument for finding a way forward, finding the common ground necessary to get our soldiers the resources they need to get the job done and to come home safe. 
   This is a tough time in Iraq. General Petraeus told me on the ground in Baghdad a month ago, he told Members of Congress gathered in a bipartisan briefing last week that there are difficult days ahead, that there is no guarantee that the surge, which seems to be beginning to take hold in Baghdad, will ultimately succeed. But it seems to me the fact that, despite the recent wave of insurgent bombings, or the fact that sectarian violence is down in Baghdad, the fact that Ramadi and al Anbar province appears, because of Sunni Iraqi leadership and U.S. and Iraqi forces, al Anbar province appears to be taking a turn for the better, however modest, that that argues for us finding a way forward, finding common ground where we can give our soldiers the resources they need. Because in Baghdad, despite the recent bombings, sectarian violence is down. 
   Baghdad is not safe, but it is safer because of the presence of more than two dozen U.S. and Iraqi joint operating centers in that capital city, more than 40 joint operating centers now spread throughout Ramadi, and the fact that in al Anbar province, more than 20 Sunni sheiks across the region have united together to oppose insurgency and al Qaeda.     
   This war is not lost. Congress should find the common ground necessary to give our soldiers the resources they need to get the job done, to stand up this government, to ensure this new democracy in Iraq can defend itself, and then lay the framework for us to come home. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this time. It is my fondest hope that what the President called us to in his remarks from the Cabinet room this week will characterize much of the debate between now and Memorial Day, and I want to quote his words again. The President, in thanking the leaders for coming down, said, ``Yesterday was a day that highlighted differences. Today,'' he said, ``is the day when we can work together to find common ground.'' But he also added, ``It is very important we do this as quickly as we possibly can.'' And he expressed confidence that we can reach agreement. 
   I will close with that, Mr. Speaker. I truly believe in all my heart that it is possible for a majority of this Congress to come together in a manner that we can deliver to our soldiers the resources that they need within a constitutional framework that doesn't intrude on the President's role as commander in chief, in a way that reflects fiscal discipline and in a way, also, that continues to provide the resources that if, in fact, the modest progress we are beginning to see continues to widen through the summer, that we, in fact, provide the resources for an expanding success for the surge, an expanding success for Iraqis stepping forward to oppose al Qaeda and insurgency in Al-Anbar, and ultimately a success for freedom in Iraq. I am confident of this, I am confident the common ground is there; and it will be my hope and my prayer and my pledge to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to accomplish just that. 
   On behalf of the Republican Study Committee and our many members, I thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I thank the Republican leadership for yielding us this hour.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I am profoundly grateful that while I have the privilege of co-chairing the Congressional Caucus for Protection of the Press, I want to acknowledge you have been the driving force behind this caucus. You recruited me to participation a year ago and I am grateful for this opportunity to have a reunion with you publicly on the House floor. The gentleman from California is a Member I deeply admire, and am honored to be associated with, as well as our Senate colleagues, Senator CHRIS DODD and Senator RICHARD LUGAR from my home State. 
   I would reflect at the outset about World Press Freedom Day which was the very day that we launched the Congressional Caucus For Freedom of the Press back on May 3, 2006, the profound importance of the freedom of the press and my belief that the United States of America ought to be a beacon of freedom for the world. We ought to inspire, we ought to articulate, we ought to use our freedom, as the gentleman from California is doing today in this Special Order, to highlight the absence of freedom in other parts of the globe. I am greatly enthused by his leadership, Mr. Speaker, and by the opportunity today. 
   A few thoughts on freedom of the press. I would offer where there is no freedom of the press, there is no freedom. If America is to be a beacon of hope for the world, we must hold high the idea of a free and independent press. We must advance it abroad and we must defend it at home. 
   A few quotes about the centrality of freedom of the press. As the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff) suggested, sometimes we don't quite understand how central the freedom of the press is to the success of the American experiment. But our Founders enshrined the freedom of the press in the first amendment because they understood, as people who believed in limited government, that the only check on government power in real-time is a free and independent press. 
   Our Founders did not include freedom of the press in the first amendment because they got good press, they included it there because they believed in limited government and they believed in the survival of liberty, and they understood the role that the press plays in our society and as we seek to promote it through this caucus in other societies. The press is that agency of progress, that agency of accountability that makes freedom possible and sustains freedom. 
   A few thoughts from our Founders before I yield back to our effort to highlight what has been a train of frightening contract-style killings taking place in Russia that we seek to highlight today. Thomas Jefferson would say, ``Our liberty,'' and I would add parenthetically, anyone else's liberty, ``Our liberty cannot be guarded but by freedom of the press, nor that limited without danger of losing it.'' 
   Roger McCormick, the founder of the Chicago Tribune, spoke words that are chiseled on the wall of that newspaper to this day, and I wrote them down when I was visiting the paper a few years ago, about the goal, the mission of a newspaper. He said, ``The newspaper is an institution developed by modern civilization to present the news of the day, to foster commerce and industry, to inform and lead public opinion, and to furnish that check upon government which no Constitution has ever been able to provide.'' 
   Benjamin Rush, one of our Founding Fathers, would say, ``Newspapers are the sentinels of the liberties of the country.'' 
   James Madison would say, ``To the press alone checkered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all of the triumphs which have by gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.'' 
   And Daniel Webster would say, ``The entire and absolute freedom of the press is essential to the preservation of government on the basis of a free Constitution.'' 
   These great minds, these great voices of liberty, some of whom faces are chiseled into the wall of this great room, are what inspired the formation of the Congressional Caucus for the Freedom of the Press, and it inspires me to be able to stand with my co-chair, with the founder of this caucus, Congressman Schiff, to now use this platform,  this stage, this blue and gold and red carpet to hold up the ideal of the freedom of the press, and in the exercise of our own freedom to challenge those and expose those places in the world where the freedom of the press is under siege. 
   As I prepare to yield back to the gentleman, I would say that the rising tide of violence against journalists in Russia since the advent of the presidency of Mr. Putin is deeply troubling and ought to be troubling to anyone who cherishes the notion of a free and independent press. 
   As we saw the wall fall in 1991, we all hoped that the daylight of liberty was rushing in with perestroika and the changes and the democracy movement, but it seems that Boris Yeltsin's recent passing may be a metaphor for Russia today. The Boris Yeltsin who stood against Soviet totalitarianism, stood for democracy in his country, passed into history just a matter of weeks ago, and it seems as I think the gentleman will articulate in a powerful and compelling way today, that as he passes into history, we fear that this experiment in freedom and democracy, and particularly a free press in Russia, is passing into history as well. We do not conclude that, we fear it. 
   I am honored to be able to join my colleague and participate as he yields time to telling some of the stories of these journalists who have paid the price for doing liberty's work in that country of Russia. 
   So again, I commend the gentleman and give him whole cloth credit for founding the Congressional Caucus For Freedom of the Press. I am honored to stand with him and honored to call him a friend.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, also pictured on our poster, and I believe the gentleman from California could point to, in the upper left corner of the poster should be the image of Magomedzagid Varisov. 
   At around 9:00 p.m. on June 28, 2005, in the city of Makhachkala, assailants armed with machine guns opened fire  on Magomedzagid Varisov's sedan as he drove home with his wife. Varisov sustained multiple bullet wounds and died at the scene. The likely motive for Varisov's assassination was his work as a journalist and a commentator. 
   For three years prior to his murder, Varisov wrote analytical columns for the Novoye Delo, Dagestan's largest weekly newspaper. Dagestan, a Russian republic bordering the Caspian Sea, has been the scene of low-level political violence and unrest driven by a separatist rebellion since 2000. Varisov was often critical of the Dagestan separatists, and his expertise on the Northern Caucuses made him a highly sought after resource for reporters and researchers. As a journalist and a pundit, Varisov wrote that the opposition was trying to destabilize the republic and topple the regional government and authored investigative pieces into terrorism and organized crime in the region. 
   In an issue of Novoye Delo just before his death, Varisov examined Russian Army operations in the Chechen border town of Borozdinovskaya in which one person was killed and 11 others were reported missing. Ethnic Avars, fearing for their lives, left Borozdinovskaya by the hundreds and crossed into neighboring Dagestan. Varisov criticized Chechen authorities in his article for failing to protect the safety of Borozdinovskaya residents and appealed to Dagestan authorities to do right by them. 
   For over a year, Varisov had spoken of threats against him and had written about those threats in articles for Novoye Delo. Varisov complained that unknown individuals were following him, and he sought protection from Makhachkala law enforcement authorities. No protection came, and not long after, Varisov was gunned down. 
   In a tale that has become all too common in Russia, Mr. Varisov's murder will go unsolved and unprosecuted. A raid on October 25, 2005, killed three suspects in Mr. Varisov's death. Local prosecutors closed their case shortly afterward, and Varisov was added to the list of journalists whose murder will go unsolved but not forgotten.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, Aleksei Sidorov is our next victim, and his image appears along with Valery Ivanov at the center of the poster, if the gentleman from California would point it out. I do think, as Mr. Schiff said earlier, it is important in this moment that we dwell on the fact that these were people who demonstrated courage, who had loved ones and who are now gone forever, both to the cause and to their families and their communities, and it is imperative we look them in the face. 
   On October 9, 2003, Aleksei Sidorov, the editor-in-chief of the independent daily known as Tolyatinskoye Obozreniye, was murdered in Togliatti, a city on the Volga River 600 miles east of Moscow. 
   Sidorov was the second editor-in-chief of that newspaper to be murdered in a 2-year span. His predecessor, shown in the same photograph, Valery Ivanov, was shot eight times at point-blank range in April 2002. 
   According to local press reports, two unidentified assailants stabbed Sidorov in the chest several times as he approached the apartment building in Togliatti where he lived with his family. The assailants fled after stabbing Sidorov, and the editor died in his wife's arms after she heard his call for help and came down to the entrance of their building. 
   Sidarov's paper was a newspaper known for its investigative reports on organized crime, government corruption, and shady corporate deals in the heavily industrialized city of Togliatti. His colleagues are convinced the murder was in retaliation for the paper's investigative work. 
   One of them told the Committee to Protect Journalists, ``All of our investigative work was supervised by Aleksei.'' Another journalist at the paper told CPJ that Sidorov had received unspecified threats in retaliation for his work. 
   Government officials initially agreed that Sidorov's murder appeared to be a contract killing in retaliation for his work as a journalist. But a week after the killing, officials began offering conflicting explanations about the motive for the murder. On October 16, the local head of the Interior Ministry, Vladimir Shcherbakov, said Sidorov was stabbed after refusing to give a stranger a sip of some vodka he had supposedly been drinking, the independent Moscow daily Gazeta reported. 
   That same day, Deputy Prosecutor General Vladimir Kolesnikov said the  murder was related to ``the journalist's professional activity,'' the independent Moscow daily Kommersant reported. But the next day, he switched his story, calling the murder, ``an act of hooliganism,'' the ITAR-TASS news agency reported.     
   According to local news reports, Deputy Prosecutor General Yevgeny Novozhylov said that an intoxicated welder from one of the local factories, Yevgeny Maininger, stumbled upon Sidorov that evening and murdered him after a brief argument. The local police detained Maininger on October 12 and charged him with murder after he confessed to the killing. 
   Sidorov's family and journalists at the newspaper Tolyatinskoye Obozreniye were skeptical that the authorities had found the true killer. A year later, a Russian district court judge confirmed their doubts by acquitting the man. 
   On October 11, 2004, Judge Andrei Kirillov found that the 29 year-old alleged assailant was not involved in Sidorov's murder and said the prosecution's case was untenable, according to the independent Moscow daily known as Kommersant. Sidorov's family father said the family was pleased that the acquittal ended what they considered to be a flawed investigation. ``The investigation, instead of seeking out the real killer of my son, tried to dump everything on this innocent person,'' Mr. Sidorov's father, said. ``We will do everything possible to ensure the [authorities] start a normal investigation.'' 
   Karen Nersisian, the defense lawyer representing the Sidorov family, said, he will work to have the case transferred to a higher court in Moscow, according to local press reports. 
   More than 3 years later, Sidorov's killer has not been identified.

   Mr. PENCE. On March 9, 2002, Natalya Skryl, a business reporter working for the Nashe Vremya newspaper in the City of Rostov-on-Don in southwestern Russia died from head injuries sustained during an attack the previous evening. Her image appears on our poster at the lower right-hand. Perhaps the gentleman from California could point that out for our C-SPAN camera team, Natalya Skryl. 
   Late on the night of March 8, Natalya was returning to her home in the town of Taganrog just outside of Rostov-on-Don when she was attacked from behind and struck in the head about a dozen times with a heavy blunt object. Neighbors called an ambulance and the police after hearing her scream. Natalya was found unconscious just outside her home and taken to Taganrog hospital, where she died the following day. 
   Natalya, who was 29, reported on local business issues for a newspaper owned by Rostov regional authorities. Just before her death, she was investigating an ongoing struggle for the control of Tagmet, an metallurgical plant. Nashe Vremya editor-in-chief Vera Yuzhanskaya believes that Natalya's death was related to her professional activities, ITAR-TASS news agency reported. 
   Since opening an investigation shortly after her murder, officials have changed their theory several times. Initially, the prosecutor's office said that because Natalya was carrying jewelry and a large sum of cash that were not taken at the time of the murder, that robbery could be ruled out as a motive. 
   But on July 24, 2002, the Taganrog Directorate of Internal Affairs announced that robbery was the motive, and that the crime was unrelated to her journalistic activities, according to a local radio station report. Taganrog authorities switched their story again on September 5, and the Nashe Vremya editor in chief, Vera Yuzhanskaya, told the Committee to Protect Journalists, when they closed the murder investigation without officially identifying the reason for the murder. 
   Gregory Bochkarov, a local analyst in Rostov-on-Don for the Moscow-based Center For Journalism in Extreme Situations told the Committee to Protect Journalists that the only credible motive for Natalya's murder was her reporting about Tagmet and that police had emphasized the robbery motive in an effort to play down the significance of her case. Just prior to her death Natalya reportedly told several of her colleagues that she had recently obtained sensitive information about the Tagmet story and was planning to publish an article revealing this information. 
   Let me say that again. Just prior to her death, Natalya told several colleagues that she had recently obtained sensitive information about the story and was planning to publish an article revealing that information. 
   Natalya, like all other journalists, is among the ranks of unsolved ranks of murders of journalists in Russia. 
   Mrs. Pence is waiting supper. I will ask the gentleman's forbearance. I extend my gratitude for your leadership of our caucus, for the honor of participating 
   in this special order with you and to say how much I look forward to continuing to work with you as we use this institution of freedom to promote press freedom around the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (MAYOR WILLIAM ``BILL'' SANDBERG POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina. 
   Let me say I rise in support of H.R. 6229, honoring the life and the work and memory of Mayor William ``Bill'' Sandberg of St. Paul, Minnesota. I believe, given the tenure of his career and the durability of his reputation, we can assume in both parties that Mayor Sandberg was a man at the local level that attended himself to what people were really dealing with and he provided leadership. 
   And it is about just that focus that I also wanted to rise, Mr. Speaker, today. Because I rise this afternoon, I think with millions of Americans, simply to express my frustration, that after only one day of debate, late in the night last night, this Congress again failed to pass a bipartisan bill that would set us on a course for energy independence in the 21st century. 
   I must tell you that it was equally frustrating today to awaken and see headlines around the country that say ``Congress eases restrictions on drilling.'' But I don't want to be critical of my friends in the Fourth Estate. This bill was revealed to the world 24 hours before it was voted. It was written in the back rooms here in the Capitol, not considered by committees, but brought to the floor abruptly the night before last and just as abruptly voted without amendment or without serious consideration in the Congress. So I won't fault members of the media, who didn't understand that the drill-nothing Democrat Congress actually only moved to a position that was the drill-almost-nothing Democrat Congress. 
   But this legislation, despite the headlines, is a story worth telling. For the past 20 months, until last week, the Democrat majority in Congress made one thing more clear than anything else; there would never be a vote on more domestic drilling in America. Speaker  Nancy Pelosi repeated her personal and historic opposition to drilling and said that she would never permit a vote. And they adjourned on August 1, turned off the cameras and turned off the lights. 
   But Republicans refused to leave. We held this floor during the entirety of the August recess, and during that time the Democrat majority changed their position. In a very real sense, millions of Americans contacted their Members of Congress and said we want more access to American oil. We want Congress to come together and compromise on conservation, fuel efficiency, solar, wind, nuclear, an all-of-the-above strategy. But we want a bill that allows us to drill into our domestic resources. And, to their credit, the Democratic majority relented in their historic opposition to drilling. 
   But the bill that came to the floor abruptly and was just as abruptly passed last night failed in many counts. Not only did it bring with it an enormous tax increase, not only did it bring with it no opportunity for new refineries, no opportunity for nuclear energy development and other powerful alternatives, but also this bill truly brought with it very little, if any, opportunity to drill into our own domestic reserves. 
   The bill seems to allow drilling, but not within 50 miles of shore. Most experts say that 88 percent of our domestic reserves are within 50 miles of the shoreline of the east coast and the west coast and the eastern Gulf. Beyond that, the Democrat bill that passed last night would allow drilling, but only if States vote by referendum or in their legislature to permit the drilling. 
   That sounds reasonable enough. But what is not reasonable is the Democratic bill, unlike current law for Gulf States that allow drilling, the Democratic bill offered States no revenue whatsoever. So people in South Carolina, people in California, would presumably have to decide for themselves or their elected representatives decide to allow drilling off of their shore if it meant nothing financially to their State coffers. 
   Also there was a failure to provide any streamlined judicial review or litigation reform, leaving any drilling that would be allowed beyond the 50 mile limit to be tied up immediately in court, as hundreds and hundreds of leases are tied up today. 
   So that is why I say, and I attempt to be intellectually honest about this, Mr. Speaker, the Democratic majority did move on their energy policy about drilling. They went from a drill-nothing Democrat Congress to a drill-almost-nothing Democratic Congress. 
   And last night, most sadly, they passed on an opportunity that some 40 Democrats had been working tirelessly to develop, legislation coauthored by Congressman Abercrombie and Congressman Peterson that is a truly bipartisan solution. I was a cosponsor of the bill myself. Dozens upon dozens of Republicans joined us in the bill, as well as I believe 40 Democrat Members of Congress. 
   When it came time for the Republicans to offer their alternative, quite frankly, we could have played some sort of a game, but we think that the American people are struggling under the weight of record gasoline prices. Families are hurting, seniors are hurting, and this was not time for political posturing or games. So we brought the bipartisan bill to the floor as our alternative. 
   Strangely, unless I can be corrected, only 13 of the Democrats out of the some 40 who cosponsored the bill voted for it. It was a true bipartisan bill that had been fashioned through tough bipartisan negotiation over months of time, and it was rejected by many of the same Democrats who had worked to build the legislation. 
   We missed an opportunity last night, Mr. Speaker, to truly do something for the American people, to do something, as Daniel Webster says on words on these walls, to do something worthy to be remembered. 
   So I rise today to pay sincere tribute to Mayor William ``Bill'' Sandberg. I am confident that this tribute on this Post Office is altogether fitting. 
   But I also rise to just simply express my frustration that, at a time when we hear about one bailout after another, this Democrat majority passed an energy bill last night that Democrat Senator MARY LANDRIEU even said was ``dead on arrival in the Senate.'' We accomplished nothing to set this Nation on a course of energy independence. 
   So our message is very simple: We are not going away. We are going to fight on this floor in every moment that we have left, in the waning days of this Congress and in the weeks preceding our national election, to demand that this Congress roll our sleeves up and seek that bipartisan consensus that does exist. 
   Let me say from my heart, I truly believe that there is a bipartisan majority in this Congress that would say yes to conservation, yes to fuel efficiency, yes to solar, wind and nuclear, and would say yes to a substantial increase in domestic drilling that was real and significant and would lessen our dependence on foreign oil.  
   So Republicans are going to stay in this fight. Bailouts for corporate America, but no relief for our citizens struggling under the record weight of gasoline prices is not acceptable to Republicans in this Congress. We will stay on this floor. We will continue in this fight. We are not going away until the American people have a bipartisan strategy that sets us on a short-term course to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and on a long-term course for energy independence in the 21st century.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, the enmity that exists between American talk radio and the Democratic Congress came into high relief this Monday as leaders in the Senate engaged in repeated and distorted personal attacks of a prominent American commentator. 
   Now, while many see this as more politics as usual in Washington, DC, I see something more. I believe these attacks on talk radio are a precursor for returning censorship to the airwaves of America in the form of the Fairness Doctrine. 
   This week Congressman GREG WALDEN and I requested that the Democratic leaders bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor of this Congress immediately and take the power away from the FCC in this or any future administration to regulate the airwaves of America. The Broadcaster Freedom Act is cosponsored by 203 Members of Congress, and it enjoys broad bipartisan support. 
   The freedom of the press should not be a partisan issue. Let's reject the attacks on American radio personalities and ensure that the Fairness Doctrine stays on the ash heap of broadcast history, where it belongs.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, as America awaits word from our military and diplomatic leaders in Iraq early next week, it is apparent to me that many in Congress seem prepared to prejudge our progress and dismiss the report of General David Petraeus even before he makes it. 
   Many, as has been done here this morning, cite the recent GAO report as a basis for accepting retreat and defeat in Iraq. But as Fred Kagan of the American Enterprise Institute pointed out recently, the mandate of the GAO report was not to evaluate progress broadly defined in Iraq, it was to determine whether or not the Iraqi Government had met 18 benchmarks set by the U.S. Government. Fred Kagan pointed out that the term ``Anbar'' actually only appears twice in the GAO report, despite the extraordinary progress in the Anbar Province where we have seen Sunni leadership come forward, working with marines, working with the al-Maliki government and defeating terrorism. The so-called ``triangle of death'' is so safe the President of the United States was able to land there and meet with Sunni and Shia leaders earlier this week. 
   I think it is imperative that we stand with our soldiers, we wait and hear from our military and diplomatic leaders, and for the purpose of freedom in Iraq and for the purpose of our national honor, we accept nothing short of victory in that nation.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, if there is anything we learned from the conviction of Vice Presidential aide Scooter Libby yesterday, it is that the first amendment and the freedom of the press are still behind bars. The need for a Federal media shield bill has never been more apparent. 
   Yesterday, Mr. Libby was convicted of lying to a grand jury. That is reprehensible, and he will be held to the strictest account. 
   But as the Washington Post editorial page pointed out this morning, his chief accuser, Joe Wilson, also lied about who sent him to Africa, what he found there, and about whether his wife was a covert CIA agent. The Washington Post even called Joe Wilson today a ``blowhard.'' 
   Ironically, while Mr. Wilson was lying to the press and creating a partisan furor, Mr. Libby was telling the truth to reporters, and that is what got him in trouble. 
   The case presented us with a long spectacle of reporters being jailed and threatened with jail time for not revealing confidential sources. Because there is no Federal media shield law, the real losers in all of this difficult and tragic case are not actually reporters or the press, but the American public. 
   My own colleague, Congressman RICK BOUCHER, and I will be reintroducing the Free Flow of Information Act. I urge my colleagues in Congress to take it up expeditiously. It is time to restore the fabric of the first amendment freedom of the press.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. On November 29, Americans learned of the passing of one of the giants of this Congress in the 20th century. Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois died at the age of 83. 
   As Members in both parties know, throughout his nearly four decades in this Congress, Henry Hyde was the essence of dignity, civility, and a commitment to principle. He was a champion of the great causes, life, liberty  and the rule of law, a voice for the voiceless, victims of human rights abuses, and he was a lion of the right to life. In every sense, life has lost its lion, and this movement will miss his roar. 
   Henry once quoted me on this floor from his favorite poet Tennyson from the poem ``Ulysses.'' He said, by memory, ``Though we are not now that strength which in old days moved heaven and earth, that which we are, we are, one equal temper of heroic hearts made weak by time and fate, but strong in will to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.'' 
   On all the great issues of the day, Henry Hyde strove, he sought, he found, he did not yield. May he rest in peace, and those of us who share his values and his principles not rest until the work he began is done.

   Mr. Speaker, here in Washington, D.C., down the street from this very building is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, a museum that serves as a living memorial to the Holocaust and which challenges its visitors and the world in the words written in its charter to: ``Confront hatred, prevent genocide, promote human dignity, and strengthen democracy.''

   We have the unique ability in this institution to promulgate laws and policies that protect life, preserve liberty and confront genocide. Today, with the passage of the Genocide Accountability Act, in bipartisan numbers, this Congress will discharge that duty to history. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 888, the Genocide Accountability Act. In May of this year, it was my privilege to join my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Berman) to introduce H.R. 2489, which is the companion of the Senate version of the bill that is being considered today. I would like to commend the gentleman from California whose partnership on this and other legislation demonstrates his deep commitment to human rights and to human dignity and to America's place in advancing those principles in the world. 
   This is an important piece of bipartisan legislation simply because it provides America with a real and powerful tool to combat genocide around the world. The need for the Genocide Accountability Act is straightforward. Currently under U.S. law, genocide is only a crime if it is committed within the borders of the United States or by a U.S. national outside the country. Therefore, the Department of Justice is prevented from prosecuting people who may be in America who have committed genocide, as unthinkable as that might be. 
   Imagine a scenario where an individual who contributed to genocidal acts in Bosnia, Rwanda, or Sudan, or elsewhere, is determined to be here in America, somehow living under false pretenses or even traveling throughout our country. Under this scenario, the Department of Justice would be prevented under current law from prosecuting that person for genocide in this country. The Genocide Accountability Act closes this loophole. When implemented, it will allow prosecution of non-U.S. nationals who are in the United States for genocide committed outside the United States. 
   Under the scenario I just described, the Department of Justice would be able to prosecute people who are found to be in America and have perpetrated the worst kind of crime against humanity. Giving our law enforcement this type of tool is absolutely necessary in order to make it clear to the world that America will not tolerate genocide or the perpetrators of genocide, and that we will do all we can to hold those accountable who perform these heinous acts. 
   As Elie Wiesel stated, ``Once you bring life into the world, you must protect it. We must protect it by changing the world.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the Genocide Accountability Act changes the world today in a very small but a profound way, in my judgment. It strengthens the hand of the most powerful free Nation on Earth in fighting and prosecuting those who would commit the crimes of genocide. It is important and necessary, and I encourage my colleagues in the House to support this legislation today so it can be sent to the President for signature. 
   I want to commend the chairman of the committee, the ranking member and again the gentleman from California (Mr. Berman) for his extraordinary leadership on this important and historic measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to engage in a colloquy on an issue affecting this legislation with the gentleman from California, Mr. Berman. 
   Our legislation, H.R. 2489, and S. 888 are identical bills, as you know. But during the Crime Subcommittee hearing on H.R. 2489, a witness from the Department of Justice theorized that the changes proposed by this bill might constitute a violation of the ex post facto clauses of article I of the Constitution in some cases. Let me ask you, if this legislation becomes law, Mr. Berman, would we be able to use it to prosecute a non-U.S. national taking part in the genocide in Darfur today? 
   I yield to the gentleman from California.

The gentlewoman from Virginia was elected in 2000, the same year I arrived in Washington, D.C., and we became fast friends. From the start, Jo Ann Davis stood out. Her commitment to her family, her devotion to God, and her commitment to a strong defense and traditional values were inspiring. 
   On the day I met Jo Ann, she said to me very simply, ``Mike, the Lord put me here. I am going to serve Him every day that I am here.'' Representative Jo Ann Davis kept her word.

   Mr. PENCE. Yesterday, by one vote, the House voted to adjourn as soon as today for the August recess. This means Congress is about to take a 5-week vacation without even taking a vote on bipartisan measures that would lessen our dependence on foreign oil by allowing more domestic drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people won't get a vacation from high gasoline prices, so Congress shouldn't take a vacation until we vote to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. 
   If the Speaker won't keep the House in session to allow this vote, I urge President Bush to call an immediate  energy special session of Congress. Under article II, section 3 of the Constitution, the President has the power, quote, on extraordinary occasions to convene the Congress. If $4 a gallon of gas isn't an extraordinary occasion that demands action by the Congress, I don't know what is. 
   The Congress should stay in session and do its job and give the bipartisan pro-drilling majority a vote. And, Mr. President, if this Congress tries to leave town without voting on more drilling, use your constitutional authority, bring them back and make them work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank Mr. Hensarling and the ranking member of the Budget Committee for their yeoman's work on the Republican alternative. I also want to express my admiration for the chairman of the Budget Committee, who I believe to be a sincere man and effective legislator. 
   I must say that I do love following the distinguished majority leader to the floor. He is, as has been said, an eloquent and effective champion for the Democrat agenda in Congress. But the American people deserve to know this budget puts that agenda in high relief. It is more taxes, more spending, no entitlement reform, and pork barrel spending as usual. 
   Now let me say Tuesday and Wednesday of this week we were beset by terrible tornadoes. I will be heading back home tomorrow after we finish up business. A military base in my district, 40 buildings compromised, some destroyed; dozens of homes destroyed and compromised through Rush County and Shelby County. 
   But you know what? I know what Hoosiers are doing today. I know what they are doing. They are grabbing a shovel, they are rolling their sleeves up. Some have been out all night long sacrificially coming alongside their neighbors in a community in crisis and they are cleaning up the mess. 
   I want to suggest, Mr. Speaker, that we are facing a fiscal crisis in this Nation, and it is a mess of extraordinary proportions: $9.3 billion in national debt, $43 trillion in unfunded obligation in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 
   Let me say to the distinguished chairman of this committee: There is plenty of blame to go around. I do not take issue with the gentleman's characterization that the national debt grew precipitously under Republican control. Pork barrel spending grew precipitously under Republican control. But that is no excuse. Continuing the argument and the blame game is no excuse for not dealing with the problem in the way that the American people sit down and solve problems, and that is by confronting them head-on and coming together with solutions. 
   The Democrat budget here is not the solution. More spending, more taxes, pork barrel spending as usual, and not one penny of entitlement reform ignores the problem. It doesn't deal with the problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Republicans in Congress offered an alternative this year that would face this fiscal crisis head on. The American people deserve to know the Democrat budget is not the answer.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have listened to this debate all week, and I must say I admire the seriousness and the civility of most, if not all, of those who have come to this floor in this historic week to address the issue and express themselves on this resolution. But I rise respectfully to urge my colleagues in both parties to vote ``no'' on this no-confidence resolution. 
   I support the President's call for a surge of 21,500 forces in Baghdad because the President has not just asked for more troops for more troops' sake. Despite what has been said again and again on this floor, Mr. Speaker, this is a new strategy. It involves new tactics and new rules of engagement on the ground. 
   This surge of forces in Baghdad, designed to quell violence in that capital city and enable a political solution to take hold, was part and parcel of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, which said, as Americans could see for themselves on page 74 of the Iraq Study Group, and as Chairman Lee Hamilton of Indiana said before the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Iraq Study Group concluded that a temporary surge, and they used the word ``surge,'' a temporary surge of forces in Baghdad would be acceptable to them to quell violence. 
   But while I must tell you that many of my colleagues have no confidence in the President's new way forward in Iraq, I say with respect, I have no confidence in the ability of Congress to conduct war. It was Napoleon Bonaparte who said hundreds of years ago, ``I would rather face 20 brilliant generals than one mediocre one.'' 
   I would assure you today, Mr. Speaker, that our enemies would rather face 435 commanders in chief rather than one. 
   Our forefathers rejected war by committee when they enshrined the power to conduct war exclusively in Article II of the Constitution of the United States. In Article I, where this House finds its home, is the power to declare war. It is the power to appropriate funding and to set essentially military rules of conduct by statute. But the ability and the conduct of the war of the Commander in Chief is exclusively vested in the President of the United States, in that document upon which we all swear our oath of allegiance. 
   So I stand with our Commander in Chief, but also in a very profound sense, Mr. Speaker, I stand with the Constitution. 
   Vote ``no'' on this resolution and embrace our Constitution as written.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule and in particular opposition to this ominous omnibus bill that comes to the floor of the Congress today. 
   I am tempted to say to the American people, Here comes the bus, but I'm not going to get on, because this legislation represents a fundamental failure of the legislative process. 
   Eleven separate appropriations bills balled into one, the sheer tonnage and weight that has been visible on the  screens of America tonight give evidence that this government is broken, and this budget process is broken; 3,500 pages, 34 pounds, and Members of the minority have had, at this very hour, roughly one day to review its contents. 
   This legislation, which we'll consider under this rule, will cost approximately $515 billion, including $44 billion designated as so-called ``emergency spending,'' and over $10 billion in other budget gimmicks being used to artificially lower the cost. 
   Now, I want to commend President Bush and the men and women of good will in this Congress who have worked to lower the cost of this legislation from its House- and Senate-passed versions. There have been improvements on the margin. There has been lipstick placed on this pig, but it's still a pig; and the American people are soon to find that out. 
   Let's take, for example, this legislation includes $31 billion for military operations in Afghanistan for protective equipment for troops overseas, but it does not include one dime to fund our troops in harm's way at this hour serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I say to my patriotic colleagues in the other party, that is unconscionable that we would bring before this Congress a spending bill which, for some purpose, serves some audience far to the left of this Chamber, I suspect, who are not including a single cent for our soldiers in harm's way. 
   And this omnibus contains over $11 billion in so-called ``emergency'' and ``contingency'' spending. Let me favor my colleagues with some of the emergency provisions in this bill: $20 million for salaries at the Farm Service Agency, apparently salaries of employees at the Farm Service Agency unanticipated; $8 million for salaries at the Department of Justice, legal activities and salaries also at DOJ; salaries and expenses for everything from the U.S. Marshal Service to U.S. Attorneys. I mean, Mr. Speaker, where is the surprise in the emergency of finding out we have employees at the Department of Justice? And my own personal favorite here, we have a legislative emergency in the form of $100 million for Presidential security at political conventions. This is the so-called ``emergency spending'' which those who will point to this legislation as having come in at or near the President's numbers will not include these provisions. And there are so many more that will be explored in the months ahead. 
   This bill is also chock-full of the very worst kind of pork barrel spending. Let me say, Mr. Speaker, I requested earmark projects for my district, and there are some necessary infrastructure projects in this legislation for eastern Indiana. I brought every single one of them through the ordinary committee process in the light of day. But there are, we must assume, thousands of so-called ``air-dropped'' earmarks in this legislation which will not come to light until after this legislation is signed into law. 
   So it's what we don't know in this legislation that frustrates me the most; 24 hours, I say again, Mr. Speaker, 24 hours to review 3,500 pages and 34 pounds. 
   Twenty years ago, President Reagan came to this podium and said these words: ``The budget process has broken down. It needs a drastic overhaul. With each ensuing year, the spectacle before the American people is the same as it was this Christmas,'' he said, ``budget deadlines delayed or missed completely, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending packed into one bill, and the Federal Government on the brink of default.'' So said Ronald Reagan before this Congress two decades ago. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same. 
   I was a harsh critic of reckless and wasteful spending when my party was in control; and I rise, respectfully, to register the same dissent. We can do better, Mr. Speaker. The American people expect from this Congress, whatever its management, whichever party, to do better than to pile into a heap our unfinished business the week before Christmas and send it all to the President without the light of day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, yesterday, as the Nation looked on, once again Indiana law enforcement, State, county and city personnel, showed their professionalism and courage. 
   I rise today to commend the swift response by Indiana State and local authorities to quell the disturbance that began at 2:01 p.m. at New Castle Correctional Facility, at the very heart of my congressional district. 
   During a routine transfer from a dining hall to their cellblocks, a group of inmates removed their shirts, an officer was knocked to the ground, and the situation quickly spiraled out of control involving nearly one-third of the prison's population. 
   Guards quickly isolated the areas of disturbance. As the Nation looked on over the cable airwaves, backup officers arrived just 15 minutes later. The Indiana Department of Correction activated its Special Emergency Response Team and involved the State police. All offenders and the facility were secured by 4:45. 
   Investigations will go forward and questions will be answered, but, Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of eastern Indiana, I rise to express my pride and gratitude to the law enforcement community involved, the State, the local, the city and the county, all those who ensured that this disturbance was contained, tragedy was averted, and the people of my congressional district were protected.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Chairman, on Monday I was proud to visit with sailors at Naval Station Norfolk, the largest military station in the world. When the 78 ships and 133 aircraft home ported at Norfolk are not at sea, they are alongside one of the 14 piers or inside one of the 15 aircraft hangars for repair, refit, training and to provide the ship's or squadron's crew an opportunity to be with their families. 
   As I looked into the eyes of our brave men and women in uniform, I felt sick knowing that instead of getting the support they need in this fight, this Democratic Congress is pulling the rug out from under them. Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee rejected Republican efforts to adopt an amendment to H.R. 1585 that would have authorized emergency supplemental appropriations for Fiscal Year 2007. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today to condemn the Democratic plan to fund the war on the installment plan. Failure to pass an acceptable long-term supplemental appropriations bill for FY07 is a clear and present danger to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, to the Department of Defense institutionally, and to its national security mission to defend the homeland. 
   Tomorrow marks the 100th day since the administration asked Congress to provide funding for our troops. Because Congress has not sent the President an acceptable supplemental funding bill, DoD will notify Congress today of its intent again to transfer an additional $1.4 billion from Navy and Air Force personnel accounts to fund on-going Army operations in the War on Terror. This funding will last about a week. 
   This latest transfer request is the fifth one necessitated by the lack of supplemental funding. In sum, two have been necessary to fund Army operations, one to fund procurement of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, one to bolster the Iraqi Security Forces, and one to counter improvised explosive devices. 
   In addition to these transfers, the Army has moved funding originally allocated for fourth quarter expenses into the third quarter. The Army Operations and Maintenance account--the principal account that covers day-to-day Army operations--no longer has any funding available for the fourth quarter operations. 
   Moving money around like this creates uncertainty and inefficiency, ultimately costing the taxpayers more money in the long run and wreaking havoc on existing contracts. 
   The funding delay has already caused disruptions. Delays have limited DoD's ability to properly contract for the reconstitution of equipment for active and reserve forces. This increases the readiness risk of our military with each passing day. Needless delays in accelerated fielding of new force protection capabilities such as the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle and counter-lED technologies. Depletion of funds necessary to accelerate the training of Iraqi security forces. 
   Without relief soon, the Department of Defense will be forced to take further drastic steps like halting training, delaying deployments and re-deployments, and/or resorting to the use of the Feed and Forage Act, which permits obligation of funds prior to appropriation in emergency situations, an extremely poor and disruptive way of waging a war on terror. 
   Madam Chairman, our troops need funding and they need it now. 
   2007 REPROGRAMMED FUNDS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
   DoD has $4.5 billion in General Transfer Authority. All transfers in excess must come from other sources. War-related reprogramming includes: Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles: $32 million from emergency funding for Humvees and radios; Iraq Security Forces Fund: $800 million Under General Transfer Authority as well as various Army military personnel, procurement, and research and development programs (includes helicopter modifications, ammunition, and communications equipment); IED Defeat: $825 million Under General Transfer Authority from 4th quarter Navy and Air Force personnel accounts funding; and Army Operations: $3 billion under General Transfer Authority from 4th quarter Navy and Air Force personnel accounts funding. 
   Total Requested Transfers: $4.918 billion. 
   Total General Transfer Authority Remaining: $342 million.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and in support of most of this bill, and certainly appreciate the spirit with which it has come together. 
   I certainly strongly support the military funding portion of the Iraq/Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill. It will speed roughly $165 billion in emergency funds to our men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it will do so without imposing artificial timelines and timetables for withdrawal. 
   Far away from Washington D.C., our brave troops are focused on doing the job we've asked them to do, continuing our progress in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Earlier this week, the headline of the Indianapolis Star, the leading newspaper in my home State, simply read, ``Iraq May Have Reached Turning Point.'' In a national Associated Press story the following words were written, ``Signs are emerging that Iraq has reached a turning point. Violence is down, armed extremists are in disarray, government confidence is rising, and sectarian communities are gearing up for a battle at the polls rather than slaughter in the streets.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve to know that these headlines would not be possible if most Democrats in Congress had had their way, if they had passed any of the measures over the last year and a half that are brought to this floor again and again which would have cut off funding to our troops and facilitated a retreat and defeat from Iraq. And these headlines would not be possible if Republicans in Congress had not stood with our soldiers in the field, stood with our Commander in Chief, supported the new strategy and the new tactics that have brought about what the Associated Press describes as ``a turning point in Iraq.'' 
   And so I strongly support the military supplemental funding in this bill. And I commend the leadership, most especially my colleagues who have stood with our soldiers and our Commander in Chief, for bringing this clean bill to the floor. 
   Also, Mr. Speaker, I was heartened, as the gentleman from California just alluded, the ranking member, that after weeks of some of the most devastating weather in Indiana history, that this legislation will include $2.65 billion in disaster relief funding to ensure that critical resources are available to respond to the tornados and flooding across the Midwest.     
   I've spent a great deal of my time with Hoosiers that are hurting. And my heart goes out to families across the Midwest and to those government agencies that are responding with such effectiveness. But I must say that in this emergency military spending bill, when we fund these emergencies, be they at home or abroad, we still need to do so in a fiscally responsible manner. 
   I've said before and will say again that we must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children and grandchildren. I support this funding for true emergencies. But I still believe, as others have said before, that it should be offset by reductions in other government spending. 
   And let me say emphatically, military emergency funding bills ought to be about military funding and emergencies. Our war funding is emergency military spending. The GI Bill improvements in this bill are meritorious and military. Flooding in the Midwest is an emergency. But I say with respect, what does $178 million for the Bureau of Prisons have to do with military or emergencies? What is $210 million for the Census or $400 million for scientific research doing in an emergency military funding bill? 
   I support this expansion of the GI Bill. I support funding FEMA during a  time of crisis. And I certainly support our troops.

   So I will not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I will support this bill, because on balance I believe it funds urgent national needs in various respects. But I rise, as others have before, to say that emergency funding bills for the military ought to be about military funding and emergencies. And supporting those aspects of this bill will bring me to the floor and to an ``aye'' vote today.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2102, FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, 3 years ago this month, I read a newspaper editorial decrying a growing trend of cases where reporters were being subpoenaed and threatened with jail time to reveal confidential sources. The article also lamented how Republicans in Congress would never support such a statute to shield reporters in those cases. 
   The next day I asked my congressional staff two questions: First, I asked, what's a Federal media shield statute? And next I asked, tell me what I will never do. And it was in that moment of challenge and inquiry that the Free Flow of Information Act was born. 
   Shortly thereafter I partnered with the gentleman from Virginia, Congressman RICK BOUCHER, the lead sponsor of this legislation today. And the legislation that we will bring to the floor of the House of Representatives this afternoon is a direct result of a bipartisan partnership that has been a singular personal and professional pleasure for me. It is indeed humbling for me to work with Mr. Boucher, Chairman Conyers, and colleagues on both sides of the aisle to truly put a stitch in what I believe is a tear in the fabric of the Bill of Rights. 
   When the Free Flow of Information Act passed out of the Judiciary Committee on August 1, 2007, Mr. Speaker, I was informed that in the past 30-odd years approximately 100 Federal media shield statutes had been introduced in Congress. But the Free Flow of Information Act is the first of those to be passed out of the committee, and it will be the first Federal media shield bill to ever be considered by the House. It is arguable, in fact, that the Free Flow of Information Act is the first Federal legislation regarding the freedom of the press since the words ``Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press'' were added to the Constitution. As such, and I say humbly, passage of this legislation today would be both momentous and historic. 
   So what's a conservative like me doing passing a bill that helps reporters? I have been asked that question many times. 
   It would be Colonel Robert McCormick, the grandson of the founder of the Chicago Tribune, who once said: ``The newspaper is an institution developed by modern civilization to present the news of the day and to furnish that check upon government which no Constitution has ever been able to provide.'' 
   As a conservative who believes in limited government, I believe the only check on government power in real-time is a free and independent press. The Free Flow of Information Act is not about protecting reporters. It is about protecting the public's right to know. 
   Thomas Jefferson warned that ``our liberty cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press, nor that limited without danger of losing it.'' Today, the Congress has the opportunity to heed President Jefferson's words and take this important step towards strengthening our first amendment, a free and independent press. 
   Not long ago a reporter's assurance of confidentiality was unquestionable. That assurance led to sources who provided information to journalists who brought forward news of great consequence to the Nation, like Watergate, where government corruption and misdeeds were brought to light by the dogged persistence of Woodward and Bernstein. 
   However, the press cannot currently make the same assurance of confidentiality to sources today, and we face a real danger that there may never be another Deep Throat. In recent years, reporters like Judith Miller have been jailed, James Taricani placed on house arrest, Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams threatened with jail. The protections provided by the Free Flow of  Information Act, I submit, are necessary so that members of the media can bring forward information to the public without fear of retribution or prosecution and, more importantly, so that sources will continue to come forward. 
   Compelling reporters to testify, and in particular compelling them to reveal the identity of confidential sources, is a detriment to the public interest. Without the promise of confidentiality, many important conduits of information about our government will be shut down. The dissemination of information by the media to the public on matters ranging from the operation of our government to events in our local communities is invaluable to the operation of democracy. Without the free flow of information from sources to reporters, the public will be ill prepared to make informed choices. 
   Which is not to say the press is always without fault, as the chairman of the Rules Committee said just moments ago, or always gets the story right. In fact, President James Madison wrote: ``To the press alone checkered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs that have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.'' 
   As a conservative, I believe that concentrations of power should be subject to great scrutiny. Integrity in government is not a Democrat or Republican issue, and corruption cannot be laid at the feet of one party. But when scandal hits either party, any branch of government, or any institution, our society is wounded. 
   The longer I serve in Congress, the more firmly I believe in the wisdom of our Founders, especially as it pertains to the accountability that comes in a free and independent press. 
   And it is important to note this legislation is not a radical step. Thirty-two States and the District of Columbia have various statutes to protect reporters from being compelled to testify and disclose confidential sources. And the Free Flow of Information Act, I would say to all of my colleagues, has been carefully drafted after reviewing internal Department of Justice guidelines, State shield laws, and gathering input from many talented members on the Judiciary Committee and throughout the Congress. It puts forward only a qualified privilege for journalists to protect sources and strikes an appropriate balance between the public's need for information and the fair administration of justice. 
   In most instances under our legislation, a reporter will be able to use the shield provided in the bill to refrain from testifying or providing documents. But testimony or documents can be forced under certain circumstances if all reasonable alternatives have been exhausted and the document or testimony is critical to criminal prosecutions. A reporter may also be asked to reveal the identity of a confidential source in very specific and exceptional cases. And the manager's amendment we will consider today will add even additional exceptions. 
   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, let my say how humbling it is for me to have played a small role in moving this legislation forward. From my youth I have enjoyed a fascination with freedom and with the American Constitution. I learned early on that freedom's work is never finished, that it falls on each generation of Americans to preserve, protect, and defend our freedom as those who have bequeathed it to us did in their time. 
   The banner of the Indianapolis Star, the newspaper of record in my home State, quotes a verse from the Bible that reads: ``Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.'' As I opened my Bible this morning for devotions, it was that verse that just happened to be in my daily readings.     
   It reminded me that when we do freedom's work, like putting this stitch in a tear in the fabric of the Bill of Rights, His work has truly become our own. 
   I ask all of my colleagues in both parties to join us today in freedom's unfinished work. Say ``yes'' to a free and independent press. Vote ``yes'' on the Free Flow of Information Act.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I want to thank Ranking Member Smith for his spirit of cooperation on this legislation. While we may differ ultimately on the vote today, he is a public-minded man deeply committed to the free press, and I appreciate his engagement. 
   My heartfelt thanks to Chairman Conyers for his yeoman's work in moving this legislation forward. And I also want to express my profound gratitude to the gentleman from Virginia, Congressman Rick Boucher, who is the lead sponsor of this legislation today and has been my partner these last 3 years as we've moved the Free Flow of Information Act to this moment on the House floor. 
   This legislation today is a direct result of his bold and thoughtful leadership, and it is a result of a bipartisan partnership that has been a singular, personal and professional pleasure for me. 
   As a conservative who believes in limited government, I believe the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press. The Free Flow of Information Act is not about protecting reporters; it's about protecting the public's right to know.  
   Not long ago, reporters' assurance of confidentiality was unquestionable, but today the press cannot currently make the same assurances, and we face a time when there may never be another Deep Throat. Compelling reporters to testify, in particular, compelling them to reveal the identity of confidential sources is a detriment to the public interest. 
   The Free Flow of Information Act has been carefully crafted after reviewing internal Department of Justice guidelines, State shield laws, and other gathering input from interested parties. In most instances, under our bill, a reporter will be able to use the shield provided to refrain from testifying or providing documents or revealing a source, but the privilege is not absolute or unlimited. Testimony or documents can be forced if all other reasonable alternative sources have been exhausted, it's critical to a criminal prosecution, and a judge determines, through a balancing act, that its disclosure is in the public interest. 
   In a situation where a reporter is being asked to reveal the identity of a source, the bill provides several exceptions where a reporter can be compelled to reveal a source, and in the Boucher-Pence manager's amendment we will add additional exceptions to this bill under which compelled disclosure of a source will be permitted in cases of unauthorized leaks of national security secrets. 
   It is important to know what the bill does not do. It does not give reporters a license to break the law, the right to interfere with police or prosecutors; it simply gives journalists certain rights and abilities to seek sources and report information without intimidation. 
   Lastly, let me say how humbling it is for me to have played a small role in moving this legislation forward. From my youth, I have enjoyed a fascination with freedom and the Constitution. I learned early on that freedom's work is never finished, that it falls on each generation to preserve the freedoms we inherit. The banner of the Indianapolis Star in my home State reads below the name, ``Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.'' I opened my Bible this morning for my devotions, and it was that verse that happened to be in my daily readings; just happened to be. It reminded me of when we do freedom's work by putting a stitch in a tear in the fabric of the Bill of Rights, His work has truly become our own. 
   I urge my colleagues and both parties to join us in freedom's unfinished work. Say ``yes'' to the Free Flow of Information Act.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for a thoughtful question. 
   The answer would be no, that was not our intent and it is not how this provision should be read. This provision is meant to close a potential loophole in the bill. Without this provision, we were concerned that a person would be able to call a journalist to testify or provide documents for the purpose of showing why the journalist's testimony or documents are needed in the litigation. That obviously would short-circuit the statute and would not make sense. 
   The news article would be a matter of public record and would not be obtained from the journalist, and therefore could be used at such a hearing.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, under the provisions of the Free Flow of Information Act where a reporter is being asked to reveal the identity of a confidential source, the underlying bill here provides several exceptions where a reporter may be compelled to reveal a source. Sources can be revealed under exceptions for the prevention of terrorism, other harm to the Nation's security, to prevent bodily harm, in cases where trade secrets and personal health information are revealed. 
   As a result of Chairman Conyers' bipartisan working group, we have conceived of the Boucher-Pence bipartisan manager's amendment, and I rise to support it. 
   It adds additional exceptions to the bill. Under it, compelled disclosure of a source will be permitted in cases of unauthorized leaks of national security secrets. Also, if a journalist is an eyewitness to a crime or tortious conduct, the journalist cannot claim the privilege of the shield and can be required to turn over information documents. 
   Also, as Mr. Boucher said, the amendment makes two changes regarding the definition of a covered person. Covered persons are those who are able to use the shield, and we have been discussing how we define journalists throughout the history of this debate. In the manager's amendment, we restrict coverage to those people who regularly engage in journalism for substantial financial gain or a substantial part of their livelihood. And this way, the definition will exclude casual bloggers but not all bloggers, criminal offenders or the media wings of terrorist groups who are not practicing journalism. It also adds further exclusions to the list of terrorist organizations which are excluded in order to supplement the language already there to make it 100 percent clear that terrorists cannot claim the privilege of this bill. 
   I believe the Boucher-Pence manager's amendment, as the entirety of the bill, is a result of bipartisan cooperation. I believe the Boucher-Pence manager's amendment improves the Free Flow of Information Act. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, in January, President Bush described his plan to win the war in Iraq, and last week Speaker Pelosi described her plan to end the war in Iraq. The only problem with that, Mr. Speaker, is, as George Orwell said, the quickest way to end a war is to lose it; and I believe the Democrat plan to micromanage our war in Iraq with benchmarks and deadlines for withdrawal is just that, a prescription for retreat and defeat. 
   But common sense and the Constitution teach us that Congress can declare war, we can fund or choose not to fund a war, but Congress should never attempt to conduct war. In fact, this is a broadly held view by some of the leading arteries of America's traditionally liberal media. The L.A. Times yesterday said: ``Congress can cut funding for Iraq, but it shouldn't micromanage the war.'' In The Washington Post today, the lead editorial entitled ``The Pelosi Plan For Iraq'' said: ``In short, the Democrat proposal is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard to the war itself.'' 
   I commend these American newspapers for their sensible reasoning. Common sense and the Constitution demand Congress should reject the Pelosi plan.

   Mr. PENCE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   By the end of 2006, most Americans could see that our strategy in Iraq was not working. In January of this year, President Bush outlined his plan to win the war in Iraq. And just last week, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat majority announced their plan to end the war in Iraq. The only problem with that, Mr. Speaker, is that, as George Orwell wrote, the quickest way to end the war is to lose it, and I believe that the Democratic plan to micromanage our war in Iraq with benchmarks and deadlines for withdrawal is a prescription for retreat and defeat. 
   Common sense and the Constitution teach us that Congress can declare war. Congress can fund or choose not to fund war. But Congress must not ever attempt to conduct war. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to heed the call of the Constitution and common sense and reject the Pelosi plan for retreat and defeat in Iraq. 
   It turns out, Mr. Speaker, that I am actually not alone in my concern about the constitutionality and the commonsense value of the current plan for withdrawal from Iraq being propounded by the majority. The newspaper of record in the home State of Speaker Pelosi, the Los Angeles Times, wrote an editorial yesterday under the title ``Do We Really Need a General Pelosi?'' adding ``Congress can cut funding for Iraq, but it shouldn't micromanage the war.'' Allow me to quote further from yesterday's lead editorial in the Los Angeles Times: 
   ``After weeks of internal strife, House Democrats have brought forth their proposal for forcing President Bush to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by 2008. The plan is an unruly mess: bad public policy, bad precedent and bad politics. If the legislation passes, Bush says he'll veto it, as well he should.'' 
   The Los Angeles Times editorial board went on: 
   ``It was one thing for the house to pass a nonbinding vote of disapproval. It's quite another for it to set out a detailed timetable with specific benchmarks and conditions for the continuation of the conflict.''

   Mr. PENCE. I think war funding bills ought to be about war funding. Last week, the Democrat Congress tried and failed to pass an Iraq funding bill by piling billions of dollars in unrelated domestic spending and higher taxes on the backs of our soldiers. But because House Republicans took a stand, the American people could plainly see that the majority of the majority is willing to cut off funding to our soldiers, even when they are in harm's way. 
   With Memorial Day just around the corner, this Congress should stop playing politics with funding for our troops. We should pass a clean Iraq funding bill, legislation authored by Representative JERRY LEWIS of California, and we should pass it this week. As we prepare to remember the heroes of conflicts past, let's make sure that today's heroes have the resources they need to get the job done and come home safe.

   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, as President Bush said yesterday, this is a tough time in Iraq. 
   This week our Congress will hear from our commander in Baghdad, General David Petraeus, here on Capitol Hill. I suspect we will hear what I heard from General Petraeus on the streets of Baghdad just 3 weeks ago. That is, despite a wave of recent insurgent bombing, this war is not lost. 
   In fact, because of the President's surge and the brave conduct of our forces and the Iraqi forces, we are making modest progress in Iraq. In Baghdad, despite recent bombings, sectarian violence is down. Baghdad is not safe, but it is safer because of the presence of more than two dozen U.S. and Iraqi joint operating centers, and now more than 20 Sunni sheiks across the Al Anbar Province have united together to oppose the insurgency and al Qaeda. 
   I truly believe that we are making progress because of the President's surge. This war is not lost. The American people know in their hearts that victory is our only option. 
   Let's give General Petraeus a willing ear, the time and the resources and the authority to secure a victory for freedom in Iraq, for ourselves and our posterity.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to come before my colleagues and those that might be looking in to speak about the war in Iraq. 
   We have heard colleagues speak about the issue tonight in poignant and, no doubt, sincere terms. Mostly, the words of my Democrat colleagues register their objection to the ongoing war in Iraq, and that is expected, as Democrats will prepare to bring to the floor of the House of Representatives by this weekend a war spending bill that will include timetables for withdrawal that will add unconstitutional provisions which will necessitate the beginning of troop withdrawals by July 2007, with the goal of ending U.S. combat operations no later than March of 2008. 
   I want to leave for a little later, Mr. Speaker, the discussion of whether or not Congress has the constitutional authority that will be contemplated in this legislation, but for now I want to speak specifically to the state of the war. And I want to say, as President Bush said yesterday in the Oval Office, this is a tough time in Iraq. 
   In my role as the ranking Republican member of the Middle East Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee here in the House of Representatives, I am regularly and routinely briefed both about our surge strategy, the efforts of U.S. and coalition and Iraqi forces on the ground, and of course regularly briefed on the efforts of insurgents and al Qaeda and those attempting to foment sectarian violence and to generate a civil war in Iraq. It is a tough time in Iraq. 
   This week, we will hear from our commander in Baghdad. General David Petraeus is on Capitol Hill as we speak, preparing to meet tomorrow with Members of the United States House of Representatives to present his report on the progress of the surge. And that is specifically what I want to speak about tonight, because, Mr. Speaker, I suspect my colleagues will hear tomorrow what I heard from General David Petraeus in Baghdad just 3 weeks ago when I traveled with colleagues in the House and Senate to tour literally the streets of Baghdad and to tour our progress in Ramadi and in al-Anbar province. 
   I believe what General Petraeus will tell our colleagues on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that despite a recent wave of insurgent and horrific bombings, this war is not lost. In fact, because of the President's surge and the brave and courageous conduct of American soldiers on the ground and brave Iraqis on the ground, we are making modest progress in Iraq in the early months of this surge. 
   But, as General Petraeus will say, while Congress will this week contemplate embracing a resolution that will be built upon the predicate that the war is lost, in fact there is evidence that this new surge strategy both in Baghdad and in the al-Anbar province are beginning to have a good effect. 
   In Baghdad, for instance, as I will chronicle tonight, despite recent and horrific bombings, sectarian violence is down significantly in the past 2 months. Baghdad is not safe, but it is safer because of the deployment of more than two dozen U.S. and Iraqi joint operating centers throughout the city. And now, perhaps most compellingly, in the al-Anbar province in Ramadi, more than 20 of the Sunni sheik leaders have come together to form what they call the Iraq Awakening Movement. For the first time ever, Sunni leadership in the al-Anbar province are standing with the American soldier and with the government of Nouri al-Maliki. 
   Again, let me say, this is a tough time in Iraq. But we are in the midst of  a strong backlash and counterattacks by insurgency in al Qaeda. We are beginning to see the seedlings of hope in that war-torn country. I truly believe we are making progress precisely because of the President's surge strategy. 
   This war is not lost. And before I close tonight, I will reflect on my heartfelt sentiment that I believe the American people know that victory is our only option in Iraq, and I will urge this Congress to give General Petraeus not only a willing ear tomorrow but also the time, the resources, and the authority under his Commander in Chief to secure a victory for freedom in Iraq. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the skepticism of my colleagues on this point and perhaps even the skepticism of some who would be looking in tonight. So let me stick tonight not so much with rhetoric or semantics, but let's just talk about the facts on the ground in Baghdad. Because it seems to me just, not as a Congressman, but as an American, that most of the facts that I get in the popular debate in America in the mainstream media have to do with the horrific counterattacks that insurgents and al Qaeda are conducting in response to the surge.     
   But I want to focus tonight, in the time that I have been allotted, on the products of the surge, both militarily, both with regard to security in Baghdad and in Ramadi, where I visited just 3 short weeks ago, and also, in the political process which we all know ultimately holds the solution to our impasse in Iraq. 
   Let me begin by saying, first and foremost, despite the difficulty of our challenge in Iraq, we are seeing positive indicators under the President's new strategy that we hope will turn into positive trends. 
   General Petraeus has been carrying out this new strategy now for just over 2 months. He will not have the full complement of U.S. forces and reinforcements on the ground in Baghdad for several months yet, which makes all the more questionable those who would be prepared at this point to announce withdrawal before the surge has been even fully implemented in Iraq. 
   Iraqi and American forces are making incremental gains, specifically in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. And let me emphasize, President's strategy, from the first time he outlined it to the Nation, from the time, a few days before that what I and a handful of Members were in the Cabinet Room and the President described his strategy for a surge of military reinforcements. 
   This is not about sending in enough forces to provide military control of the entire country of Iraq. President's strategy, the so-called surge, actually found its origin in the Iraq Study Group report, which, if memory serves, on page 74 in the published edition, actually said that, and I quote, that the Iraq Study Group said that they would support a temporary increase in forces or a surge in U.S. forces in Baghdad to quell violence in the capital city, to make possible a political solution. 
   Now, I know in the past, and perhaps even before the end of this week, many of my colleagues who oppose the war will cite glowingly the Iraq Study Group. But I will take whatever opportunity I have, informally or formally, to respectfully point them to that page of the Iraq Study Group report. The President's surge is a military strategy designed to quell violence in the capital city of Baghdad, and, to no less extent, in Ramadi and the al-Anbar Province. 
   The belief is that if we can, U.S. and Iraqi forces in the lead, if we can quell violence in the capital city, we can create an environment where the political process and a political settlement and, ultimately, regionally a diplomatic settlement can take hold. And there is some evidence that that surge strategy is beginning, just beginning to deliver on the security that will make that political and diplomatic settlement possible. The most significant element, therefore, of the new strategy is being carried out in Baghdad. 
   Baghdad, it is widely known, was the site of most of the sectarian violence in Iraq, and therefore it is the destination for most of our reinforcements. At this point there are three additional American brigades that have reached the Iraqi capital, and while another is in Kuwait preparing to deploy, one more will arrive next month. 
   The Iraq Government, for its part, when I am home in Indiana I am asked a lot about what are Iraqis doing for their own security as a part of this surge and as a part of this war. Well, the Iraqi Government is meeting its pledge to boost force levels in Baghdad. 
   Here is a jarring statistic, Mr. Speaker. For every U.S. combat soldier deployed in Baghdad, there are now roughly three Iraqi military forces deployed in Baghdad. Let me say that again. For every one American combat force, for every American soldier, combat soldier deployed in Baghdad, there are now roughly three soldiers as a part of the Iraq Security Force deployed in Baghdad. 
   And American troops are now living and working side by side with Iraqi forces. I actually had the chance to see it firsthand in our trip to Baghdad; in fact, our trip to a joint operating center with General David Petraeus on April 1. These neighborhood small outposts are called joint security stations. 
   In fact, on this map, Mr. Speaker, we see the coalition's forward operating bases in the fall of 2006. Here we see in the center of town the international zone, so-called the Green Zone. Of course here is the Baghdad international airport. And at this point, in fall of 2006, roughly, these diagrams, these small triangles, 1, 2, 3 and 4 represented all of the forward operating bases in Baghdad. 
   Since the beginning of the surge, now, Mr. Speaker, there are 21, 21 combat outposts throughout Baghdad, and 26 joint security stations run together with U.S. and Iraqi forces. These are seen as a key building block in an effort to increase security for Baghdad's residents. 
   As I mentioned, we traveled out to the al Karada joint security station during my April 1st trip to Baghdad. We helicoptered from the Green Zone. We landed at the al Karada joint security station. These joint stations, for all the world, they are like neighborhood police stations. And U.S. forces, literally, on 2-week rotations, move to these stations. 
   And it was very compelling to me to see U.S. and Iraqi forces side by side when we arrived in this joint operating security station. And they greeted us warmly, and we spoke with Iraqi military personnel; spoke, of course, with American personnel. 
   And I remember one of the facts that stuck out in my mind was that when they were building this particular joint operating center at al Karada, right literally in downtown Baghdad, they offered, out of respect to religious traditions, they offered the Iraqi forces, they said, Well, you could have separate living forces from the U.S. forces so that you wouldn't have to essentially bunk together. And it was the Iraqi soldiers who said, Absolutely not. We want to bunk together with the American forces. We want to, essentially, be in the same dorm with them, and we are deploying with them every day. 
   And there is a tremendous sense for all the world, Mr. Speaker, of esprit de corps that one gets when you see the American soldier and you see the Iraqi soldier, as we did that day at the al Karada joint security station. 
   Let me say again, I was unable to bring tonight, Mr. Speaker, a diagram that would show all of the locations of the 26 joint security stations that now dot the landscape of Baghdad, 26 stations that were not there in the fall of 2006. Security issues would not permit me to put that on, essentially, global television through C-SPAN coverage, looking in. 
   But for all the world, if you can imagine, here we had four forward-deployed stations in the Green Zone, and now, literally, I would mark up this map into almost an incomprehensible state if I were to draw the 21 combat outposts and the 26 combat security stations that are now on the ground in Baghdad. 
   Iraqi and American forces are working together. Specifically, not only living at these stations, but deploying 24/7 to clear out and secure neighborhoods. If a heavy fight breaks out, American forces step in. Iraqi forces learn, side by side, valuable skills in fighting shoulder to shoulder with our troops. 
   Iraqi and American forces have also, in the past 3 months, received more  tips than during any 3-month period on record. 
   Baghdad is not safe; can we say that for the RECORD? But Baghdad is safer because of the presence of U.S. and Iraqi forces throughout the capital city. And an evidence of that, number one, is a sharp decline in insurgent sectarian violence within the city of Baghdad, a sharp decline which I mentioned in my opening comments. 
   But also evidence we can point to is more tips from people in Baghdad than at any 3-month period on record. By living in Baghdad neighborhoods, it is believed that American forces are getting to know the culture, the concerns, the local residents. 
   I don't understand every operational profile of our presence in Iraq. I have been there five different times. But my sense is, Mr. Speaker, that prior to, essentially, the embedding of these joint security stations throughout the capital city, American forces essentially would deploy from one of our forward operating bases where there was a problem, patrol, deal with the problem and go back to base. Now we go, we stay. And that is what is being widely credited with two facts, one good and one bad. 
   The first fact, as I have mentioned, and I will say again, there has been a drop in sectarian violence in Baghdad, as well as in Ramadi, which I will get to in a minute. That is the good news. 
   The bad news is that the enemy is fighting back in the form of horrific bombings. We saw the bridge car bomb. We saw bombings against unsecured marketplaces, particularly recently on the south and west of Baghdad. Heartbreaking, violent acts by the enemy, which I believe give evidence of the fact that we are taking the fight to the enemy and the enemy is responding. 
   But again, let me say again, sectarian violence overall in Baghdad is down in the first 2 months. And it gives us just an inkling of hope for success of the surge. 
   Baghdad is not safer. But it is safer because of the presence of 26 joint operating centers where U.S. and Iraqi forces deploy and live together and patrol the neighborhoods 24/7. 
   Now, let me speak a little bit about the al-Anbar Province, truly an extraordinary experience from our time in Baghdad. Our delegation traveled west into the al-Anbar Province, the capital of which is the city of Ramadi. And Ramadi is a very dangerous place, Mr. Speaker. It is a place where there has been a great and tremendous and consistent insurgent presence. 
   Ramadi historically is where, frankly, most of the Sunni power in the country was focused. Most of the wealth of Sunnis was concentrated in Ramadi, and therefore the Sunni insurgency against the al-Maliki government found much expression in violence in that city. 
   Here is a picture on the ground, unclassified, of the insurgent presence in Ramadi, of just 2 months ago, the river passing through the middle of town. I believe the U.S. military base is in this direction. 
   But just to give you a snapshot here, Mr. Speaker, you can see all of this red area that shows insurgent presence in Ramadi. Quick snapshot, the present picture in Ramadi is this. And again it is in direct connection with the leadership of General Odierno, U.S. forces and Iraqi forces employing exactly the same strategy that I just described is being deployed in Baghdad, the deployment of joint security stations, Iraqis and Americans working together. 
   Now, the city of Ramadi that was highly compromised 2 months ago with insurgent presence, according to U.S. sources this would represent al Qaeda in Iraq positions, now, according to official U.S. military sources, now has been reduced in its scope to a relatively isolated area of the city of Ramadi. 
   Well, how is that happening? Is it all about joint operating centers and the military response? 
   Well, it certainly is a part of that. But I would also add, a great deal has to do with a sea change that is taking place among Sunni sheiks and Sunni leadership. 
   Remember, in the history of the three successive national elections and referenda that took place in Iraq, for the most part, Sunnis, and particularly Sunnis in al-Anbar Province, not only were opposed to measures, but refused to participate in most cases. 
   Now, there has been a breakthrough in recent months, and we met with a Sheik Sitar, a courageous man, roughly my age, who ended up, Mr. Speaker, being featured for all the world on a 60 Minutes program a week after we returned from Iraq, for all the world to see and hear his own words. 
   We sat in a room with Sheik Sitar and we heard them describe what he helped to found. It is called the Iraq Awakening Movement. The Iraq Awakening Movement already includes 22 of 24 Ramadi-area Sunni tribes that are now cooperating with U.S. and Iraqi forces. 
   Let me say that again; 22 of 24 Ramadi area tribes are now cooperating with U.S. and Iraqi and coalition forces.     
   Sheikh Sattar himself has an extraordinary and compelling story. His father was killed in his native town of Ramadi by al Qaeda. His two brothers were killed by al Qaeda. And to hear him tell it, Sheikh Sattar just said, That's enough, and began in the process with other sheikhs and other tribal leaders throughout the Sunni population of Ramadi and to say this is not going to happen like this anymore. And they came to the American base in Ramadi and sat down with officials and said, We want to figure out how to move forward. 
   He made comments that were echoed across the Nation on that ``60 Minutes'' CBS television program. And I commend Scott Pelley and I commend CBS News for replaying his comments. 
   He looked at us across the table and spoke about the American soldier. And I paraphrase now, Mr. Speaker, but Sheikh Sattar said, Anyone who points a gun at an American soldier in Ramadi is pointing a gun at an Iraqi. It was incredibly moving. He spoke of their gratitude to the American soldier. And then he looked me right in the eye across this small conference table at the U.S. military base in Ramadi, and he said, Congressman, anyone who tells you the Iraqi people don't like Americans is lying to you. And then he said with even greater emphasis, Iraqis love Americans and, particularly, he added, the American soldier. I don't have his words precisely correct, but it was very moving to this small-town boy to hear a man roughly my age living in this war-torn country who was now risking his life to stand with his own nascent government, the al Maliki government, and to stand with U.S. and coalition forces. 
   We are forward deployed. Much of the strategy that I described in Baghdad we were told in Ramadi is being employed in Ramadi. But I think something else is happening in the al-Anbar province: tribal sheikhs cooperating with American and Iraqi forces to fight al Qaeda, providing highly specific intelligence. We have sent more troops to the al-Anbar province with these significant changes where presence of al Qaeda terrorists in the city has declined significantly in the past 6 months, as evidenced by these charts. 
   But it would be important to note, as I return to my original graphic, that al Qaeda responds to these changes with sickening brutality. But the local Sunnis in al-Anbar province and in Ramadi are refusing to be intimidated, and they are stepping forward to drive out terrorists. 
   We are cracking down on extremists also gathering in other parts of Iraq, but as I conceded on a news program this afternoon, one of the concerns that I heard, Mr. Speaker, from General Odierno in Ramadi and General Petraeus in Baghdad was that as we move U.S. and Iraqi forces into those major cities with a special emphasis on Baghdad, number one, the enemy will fight back, and the horrific bombings of the past few weeks are evidence that this enemy will not go quietly. But, number two, the other, and we are seeing evidence of this already, is that the al Qaeda and the insurgent elements, to the extent that we are able systematically neighborhood by neighborhood to drive them out of those major cities, that they will move into the outlying province, and we are seeing evidence of that. 
   But let me say again the strategy here is not to go neighborhood by neighborhood to secure the entire city of Baghdad. The President's surge strategy is a clear hold-and-build strategy designed to provide enough security in Baghdad and a critical area in  Ramadi to allow a political solution to take hold. 
   We can assume our enemies will continue to fight back. These are ruthless, blood-thirsty killers who not only desire the power that would come with a nation-state in Iraq, but they desire to do us harm and to do harm to our posterity. They will continue to fight back. But I believe there is evidence that this strategy to clear areas, to hold them with the joint operating centers, again, 26 joint operating centers throughout the city of Baghdad where American forces and Iraqi forces are living and patrolling 24/7 is a strategy where we can provide the kind of stability to facilitate the political and economic progress that will make a lasting peace possible. 
   And let me speak to that. As we increase our troop levels, it is vital that we also strengthen our civilian presence, provisional reconstruction teams, organizations that restore basic services, stimulate job creation, promote reconciliation. 
   I was at USAID yesterday. I met with Ambassador Tobias and learned about the extraordinary efforts that are taking place to meet real and human needs on the ground. I met in my office today with the head of the Iraqi Red Crescent organization, an admirable organization modeled in effect after the American Red Cross but built on the Muslim tradition of the Crescent. The Iraqi Red Crescent is an organization that day in and day out is answering the humanitarian crisis on the ground in this violent and war-torn country. 
   Military operations are beginning to open up a breathing space, though, for political progress, and therein lies the real hope, Mr. Speaker. As we sat down with the foreign minister, seven members of the cabinet, and the Vice President of Iraq over a long and lengthy and brutally frank dinner in the ambassador's headquarters in the Green Zone at the end of our day in Baghdad, we emphasized the need to move forward on reconciliation, to move forward on an agreement that would distribute the oil revenues equitably between all the ethnic groups in Iraq. And, truthfully, as they reminded us, the Iraq legislature has met some key milestones, met one benchmark by passing a budget that commits $10 billion for reconstruction. The Council of Ministers recently approved legislation that would provide a framework for an equitable sharing of oil revenues. 
   Now that legislation will go before the Iraq Parliament for its approval. The government has formed a committee to organize provincial elections. And I want to say of the al-Anbar province, with Sunnis now in the Iraq Awakening movement beginning to stand with U.S. and Iraqi forces and the al Maliki government, we urged them very strongly to move as quickly as possible toward provincial elections with the expectation that Sunnis in the al-Anbar province and in other provinces of the country would, in many cases for the first time, participate and take ownership in the electoral and the governing process. 
   The Iraqi cabinet, as they reminded us, are all taking steps to finalize toward agreement on a de-Baathification law. And in a conference in Egypt next month, Prime Minister Maliki will seek increased diplomatic and financial commitments for Iraq's democracy. 
   Ultimately, let me say as clearly as I can, during these difficult days for the war in Iraq, the answer in Iraq is not exclusively military, but we must provide the military support to give the al Maliki government and this nascent democracy the capacity to defend its capital. To defend its capital is at the very essence of the credibility of any government. And given the opportunity to provide basic services and basic security in Baghdad, we believe that all of these objectives could move forward, not only internally in Iraq. The de-Baathification law, oil revenue sharing agreement, provincial elections, all of which would contribute to a widening sense of ownership in this new democracy, but also it would provide an opportunity where Iraq could begin, as it has just recently begun, to reach out to its neighbors with the United States already at the table. Even with countries greatly antagonistic to our interests in the region, the United States has been willing to sit down and begin to facilitate the achievement of a diplomatic solution. 
   The truth is that giving up on Iraq would have consequences far beyond Iraq's borders, and there may be time before the end of this week and before the end of this debate to expand on that. But let me just say emphatically, Mr. Speaker, that withdrawal is not a strategy. Withdrawal would do nothing to prevent violence from spilling out across the country and plunging Iraq into chaos and anarchy. 
   In fact, when I asked the leader of the Iraq Red Crescent movement today what a precipitous and early withdrawal of U.S. forces would mean, he painted a frightening picture of a humanitarian crisis, true civil conflict and strife, potentially widening into a wider regional war generated by the instability and uncertainty in Iraq. 
   But that being said, let me speak, if I can, in my time remaining, of the proposal that we will consider this week on the floor of the Congress. And that is what I have described in the past as the Democrat plan for retreat and defeat in Iraq. I wanted to come to the floor tonight, Mr. Speaker, to basically share what General David Petraeus shared with me in Baghdad and just the seedlings, the very beginning of hope, that the President's planned surge is beginning to produce modest progress in Iraq. 
   But let me say again at the outset, it is easy to be understood in this debate, it is a tough time in Iraq; but despite a recent wave of insurgent bombings, this war is not lost, and Congress would do well to reflect very deeply on the real facts on the ground, not the images in the media, but the real facts on the ground that I have recited tonight, that General Petraeus will recite to Members tomorrow, before we make a decision to embrace a plan contemplated by House and Senate agreement, a $124 billion spending plan expected to come to the floor with the goal of bringing U.S. troops home beginning July of this year and ending U.S. combat operations no later than March of 2008. 
   When I think of the Democrat plan in the midst of this hard-fought effort, street by street, the sacrifices that American and Iraqi soldiers are making, and the fact that both in Baghdad and in Ramadi sectarian violence is down. Despite the horrific bombing, sectarian violence is down. Cooperation in the form of tips is increasing. We are just beginning to see the inklings of hope in Iraq. And yet the Democrat majority will bring forward a proposal that would micromanage it, deadlines for withdrawal. For all the world, that makes me think of George Orwell, who said: ``The quickest way to end the war is to lose it.'' And I really do believe the Democrat plan is a prescription for retreat and defeat. 
   Now, let me speak about the proper role of Congress in this context. And I think it speaks of the great wisdom of our Founders that Congress, as a body of 435 otherwise well-intentioned men and women, is not particularly well suited to the conduct of war. In fact, at the Constitutional Convention, almost no issue was more summarily dealt with than what our Founders referred to as war by committee. They feared it. Their experience was derived from stories of the Revolutionary War as General Washington was chased from New York all the way across New Jersey, facing almost certain defeat in the Philadelphia suburbs across the river, the Delaware.     
   Every single night, General Washington would later record that he would sit in his tent and write letter after letter to Congress asking for appropriations, asking for support, asking for details. 
   As our founders put together the Constitution of the United States, they said there would be one Commander in Chief, and that would be the President of the United States of America; and that we would not have war by committee. And the Constitution is more clear on no other fact. Congress can declare war, Congress can choose to fund or not to fund military operations, but Congress cannot conduct war. In fact, those times in American history where Congress has intruded itself on the purview of the Commander in Chief have been marked as summarily perilous times. 
   I am recently reading up on the committee in this Congress during the Civil War. I think it was loosely entitled ``The Committee on the Conduct of  the War.'' And it was a committee in Congress that did not just attend itself to President Lincoln's use of public assets and funding of the war, but it involved itself well into recommendations about military operations and the like. It would be none other than Robert E. Lee, the leader of the Army of the Confederacy, who would say, ``That committee in Congress was worth two divisions to me.'' Robert E. Lee, leading the Army of the Confederacy, would say that the Committee on the Conduct of the War, functioning in Congress, was worth two divisions to him. And yet, we will see this majority bring forward a measure that I believe violates both common sense, the Constitution and our history with a plan for withdrawal from Iraq. And a message of withdrawal at a time when we are just beginning, in the midst of horrific counterattacks by the enemy, where we are just beginning to see evidence of modest progress from the surge, I think is precisely the wrong message to send. 
   But on this constitutional argument it is worth noting that it would not simply be my reading of history and the Constitution that would criticize the plan for a timetable for withdrawal included in the war funding bill this week, but let me quote, if I may, Mr. Speaker, an editorial in the Los Angeles Times that was published in the month of March under the heading, ``Do We Really Need a General Pelosi?'' Their main point was, in effect, ``Congress can cut funding for Iraq, but it shouldn't micromanage the war.'' That newspaper went on to say, and I am quoting now the Los Angeles Times, ``After weeks of internal strife, House Democrats have brought forth their proposal for forcing President Bush to withdraw troops from Iraq by 2008.''

   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, the Old Book says if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. 
   Today I rise to pay a debt of gratitude and honor for a Hoosier lost in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I was deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Specialist Johnathan Lahmann of Richmond, Indiana, from wounds suffered in Bayji, Iraq on Monday when a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. 
   Specialist Lahmann served in the 59th Engineering Company, 20th Engineer Battalion, 36th Engineer Brigade, part of the Army III Corp based in Fort Hood, Texas. 
   To be a U.S. Army soldier is to be a part of the strongest fighting force in the world. Specialist Lahmann embodied the American Army values of loyalty, duty, honor, respect, and selfless service. He continued that proud tradition as a combat engineer. 
   Specialist Lahmann was also the recipient of the Expert Rifleman Badge and Army Good Conduct Medal. And he will be posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart, having died in the line of duty. 
   I rise to express my profound condolences to his parents, Alan Lahmann and Linda Lahmann, to family, neighbors and friends for the loss of this brave young man. 
   Eastern Indiana will never forget the service and sacrifice of Johnathan Lahmann. His name will be enshrined in the hearts of two grateful nations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago next month, the State of Israel, under the leadership of a small band of courageous Zionists declared independence in its ancient homeland. It was promptly recognized by the United States, as the majority leader just eloquently described, and it was promptly attacked by its Arab neighbors. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same. 
   Well, Israel has prevailed against long odds, and we celebrate 60 years of that on the floor today and around the United States and around the world next month. It was against those extraordinarily long odds. It was forced again in 1967, 1973, and on countless other times since. 
   It is important that we note through these trials and travails, Israel remains the only fully functioning democracy in the Middle East. It was founded by Holocaust survivors resolved to overcome the horrors of the mid-20th century Europe's atrocities. 
   Today, Israel's boasts a vibrant economy with a well-educated populace. Israel's GDP exceeded most major economies in 2007 and it's reached Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development candidate status. 
   Israel's 60 years on from that historic day next month is an extraordinary  success. But Israel is still in the neighborhood of sworn enemies. In its 60th year of history, all of two Arab countries have seen fit to recognize Israel. And today's leader of Iran threatens with regularity to wipe Israel off the map. 
   That's why I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to say two things: Number one, I join my colleagues in both parties who rise to congratulate this historic accomplishment of 60 years hence. But I also say that as we commend Israel, we in this body in both parties should look for opportunities to recommit ourselves to her defense. We cannot stand idly by while a gathering menace grows in the region. We cannot stand quiet while some Americans travel overseas and associate themselves with the blood-soaked enemies of Israel. 
   So today we celebrate, and we celebrate in a spirit of bipartisanship. But I hope as this historic 60th anniversary approaches, we in this body in both parties will look for those opportunities upon which we can come together to rededicate ourselves to the preservation and the protection of Israel as a Jewish state and to Jerusalem as her eternal capital.

   Mr. PENCE. The father of our Constitution, James Madison, wrote, ``The Constitution expressly and exclusively vests in the legislature the power of declaring a state of war. The separation of the power declaring war from conducting it is wisely contrived to exclude the danger of its being declared for the sake of its being conducted.'' 
   As we begin the process of hearing resolutions down the hall of this Capitol in the United States Senate, nonbinding resolutions over the way and the manner in which we would conduct our war, we would do well to reflect on the wisdom of our Founders, who separated the article I powers of this body from the article II powers of our Commander in Chief. 
   Let us remember, as Franklin Roosevelt said, ``Hostilities exist, there is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory and our interests are in grave danger.'' Let this grave danger color our debates. Provide the oversight that is our purview, but we have but one Commander in Chief, and let him lead us to victory in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, over the past year, I have worked with colleagues in the House and Senate to achieve border security and comprehensive immigration reform without amnesty. I believe illegal immigration is a crisis that demands a national response, but amnesty is not that response. 
   From what we know about the recent compromise announced in the Senate, there are many commendable elements of the plan, including stronger border security measures and a shift to a merit-based immigration system. However, ultimately what has been dubbed a ``grand bargain'' is no bargain for the American people. 
   By permitting illegal immigrants to get right with the law without leaving the country, the Senate compromise amounts to amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants, and I cannot support it. 
   I do hope to continue to work with colleagues in both parties in the House and Senate to craft final legislation that puts border security first, creates a temporary worker program without amnesty, that requires illegal immigrants to leave the country to apply, and, when they come, to learn English and live under the law when they are here.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for his support. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Constitution vests, in article I, section 8, clause 8, the power and the duty of the Congress ``to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries.'' This is an express obligation of the Congress under the Constitution. 
   Our patent laws, as currently written, were essentially drafted over 50 years ago, and I believe it is time to update them to account for changes in our dynamic 21st century economy. 
   We need to strengthen out patent laws to make sure that patents that are issued are strong and high quality, but I would submit that we also need to reform our patent laws to eliminate lawsuit abuse that has become so prevalent. Aspects of this legislation will do that; my amendment seeks to do that further. 
   As I said before, I am sympathetic to those who say that further work on damages needs to be done in conference. I agree with their sentiment to that point, and I trust that will occur. 
   On balance, though, I have determined that this legislation is an important and useful step toward modernizing and strengthening our American patent law, and I am pleased to support it. But I encourage Members of the House not to take this step without first supporting the Pence amendment, which makes an important clarification of provisions governing what is known as best mode in patent law. 
   At the Judiciary Committee markup of this bill, I first supported an amendment which would have repealed best mode in full. American patent law requires that a patent application, ``set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention'' at the time the application is filed. But providing the best mode at the time of application is not a requirement in Europe or in Japan or in any of the rest of the world, and it has become a vehicle for lawsuit abuse. 
   In my view, the best mode requirement of American law imposes extraordinary and unnecessary costs on the inventor and adds a subjective requirement to the application process, and I believe public interest is already adequately met in ensuring quality technical disclosures for patents. 
   At the Judiciary Committee, I offered a best mode relief amendment that was accepted. The Pence amendment then retained best mode as a specifications requirement for obtaining a patent, the intent to maintain in the law the idea that patent applicants  should provide extensive disclosure to the public about an invention. But the Pence amendment endeavored to remove best mode from litigation. 
   Increasingly in patent litigation defendants have put forth best mode as a defense and a reason to find patents unenforceable. It becomes virtually a satellite piece of litigation in and of itself, detracts from the actual issue of infringement, and literally costs American inventors millions in legal fees. 
   The intent of the amendment was to keep best mode in the Patent and Trademark Office. My amendment today continues this effort toward eliminating this archaic and costly provision of the law. Specifically, the amendment today makes it clear that arguments about best mode cannot serve as the basis for post-grant review proceedings. It's quite simple in that effect. 
   With my amendment, under the new post-grant review system, best mode will not be litigated. That will lessen the burden put on patent holders in defending their patents in post-grant review proceedings, and it will prevent the expenditure of millions of dollars in needless lawsuit abuse. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. PENCE. Beginning in 1949, the Federal Communications Commission enforced the so-called fairness doctrine that required broadcasters to present controversial issues in a fair and balanced manner. 
   It sounds reasonable enough, but there is nothing fair about the fairness doctrine. Thankfully, the FCC overturned its own ruling in 1985. Since the demise of the fairness doctrine, talk radio has emerged as a dynamic forum for public debate and an asset to the Nation. 
   Unfortunately, in the name of fairness, there has been much talk recent days about bringing back the fairness doctrine. Liberal think tanks and elected officials in both political parties in Congress are contemplating it. Bringing back the fairness doctrine would amount to nothing more than government control over political views expressed on public airwaves, and it must not be allowed to occur. 
   This week I will be introducing the Broadcaster Freedom Act that will prevent the FCC or any future president from reinstating the fairness doctrine. President Kennedy said, ``A nation judge that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a Nation that's afraid of its people.''

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the ranking member for yielding, and I thank him for his extraordinary leadership on this budget. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of fiscal responsibility, and my conscience therefore demands that I rise in support of the Republican budget. 
   Now, the American people deserve to know the truth. We have a $9.3 trillion national debt, but that is not the whole story. The American people also deserve to know that we have some $53 trillion in unfunded liability in Social Security and Medicare over the next 75 years. Frankly, if this government were a business back in Indiana, it would have to file bankruptcy. 
   Republicans are offering an alternative budget to deal with this fiscal crisis at the national level based on spending restraint and entitlement reform. It balances the budget without taxes and without earmarks. 
   But the answer from the Democrat majority? Get this: The largest budget in American history, $3.1 trillion. The largest 1-year increase in the public debt in American history, some $646 billion. Higher taxes and nothing to reform earmarks or the very entitlement spending that threatens the economic vitality of our children and our grandchildren's future.     
   In 2006, the American people voted for change in Washington, D.C., but they weren't referring to what would be left in their pockets after the Democrats took control. We must balance the Federal budget with fiscal discipline and reform, not with more spending and more taxes. We must reject the policies of the new liberal Democratic majority in Congress and reject their budget. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for fiscal discipline and reform, to end earmarking as usual, and to stand for fundamental entitlement reform in Washington, D.C. Vote for the budget priorities of the Republican minority in Congress. They are, I believe with all my heart, the budget priorities of the overwhelming majority of the American people.

We'll get people out on the road for vacations this summer, and I don't know what it's going to take for Congress to take dramatic action to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. 
   I've got to tell you I was little bit encouraged last night, Mr. Speaker. The Democrat majority brought a bill to the floor that actually endorsed the idea that the cost of oil and gasoline is affected by supply and demand. We voted to suspend purchases by the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, therefore lessening the demand on global oil, believing that the price would come down. 
   Well, today, this motion to instruct conferees is all about increasing the supply. Look, we hear a lot about oil profits; we always have. And no one respects the previous speaker more than me. But who in the world thinks that raising taxes on oil companies is going to lower their prices at the pump? 
   I mean, for heaven's sakes, we understand as Americans that commodities and the price of commodities are dictated by supply and demand. We simply have to take those measures in an environmentally responsible way to explore and further exploit the resources that we have in the ground, and I speak specifically of the Alaska National Wildlife region and the other areas that are affected by this motion to instruct conferees. 
   As long as we are going to continue to look at the most volatile area of the world for the majority of our energy needs, we are going to continue to see the extraordinary per barrel prices that we're seeing today, and Americans and Hoosiers are going to be suffering at the pump.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, Indiana is agriculture, but Hoosiers on and off the farm also believe in fiscal discipline and reform. And it's for these reasons that I regretfully express my opposition to this farm bill, the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. 
   During my years of service on the House Agriculture Committee, I have sought to be a voice for Indiana family farmers and an advocate for reform. I have worked to advocate changes in this legislation. And I want to express my profound appreciation to Chairman Peterson and to Ranking Member Goodlatte for including provisions in this farm bill that will save Indiana jobs and create new opportunities for farmers across the Midwest. While I differ ultimately in the support for the final product, I respect deeply these two men and am grateful for their work on behalf of these issues. 
   I'm opposing the farm bill because I believe it's fiscally irresponsible and does not contain the kind of reforms in American agriculture that these times demand. This bill fails to reduce government subsidies to farmers, fails to encourage market-based reforms to the Nation's agricultural policy, and fails to promote international trade. It also fails to meet our Nation's farm policy needs within our own budget guidelines. 
   The farm bill being considered today will actually increase the size and scope of government and will cost taxpayers more than $650 billion over the next 10 years. In comparison with the previous farm bill, this bill will cost $65 billion a year as opposed to the $45 billion before. It is in effect a 44 percent increase in spending. 
   And let me say I support family farming and I loathe the demagoguery of many who criticize farm subsidy programs, ignoring completely the real world input costs that American farmers face. But this bill still goes too far, in my judgment. It will continue to allow married couples with household incomes up to $2.5 million to receive subsidies. Subsidy payments oftentimes, under this legislation and previous bills, are concentrated in the hands of a few with the top 10 percent of recipients receiving nearly two-thirds of all farm payments. 
   There are other problems with this bill as well. It will allow farmers to lock in price support payments at the lowest possible market price and sell their crops at the highest price. And the bill also ignores the plight of consumers facing skyrocketing food prices by making a bad sugar program worse. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor with a sense of melancholy about this, having been on the Agriculture Committee during development of the last farm bill and coming from the great State of Indiana. It has always been my ambition to support Indiana farmers, to support them with Federal policy that enables farmers to sustain the American cutting edge in global agriculture. But I have always sought to do that in a way that protects our Federal budget and protects the American taxpayer at large. 
   It's for those reasons that I am opposing this farm bill legislation and urge my colleagues to do likewise.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, the American people cherish freedom. That's why President Reagan repealed the so-called Fairness Doctrine back in 1987 that actually regulated the content of radio airwaves for more than four decades. 
   Today, while some of the most powerful Democrats in Congress make plans to restore this Depression-era regulation, Republicans have taken action. We introduced the Broadcaster Freedom Act that would take the power to restore the Fairness Doctrine away from this or any future President, and we filed a discharge petition to force an up or down vote. But in 245 days, not one single House Democrat has signed the discharge petition for broadcast freedom. 
   I offer my Democrat colleagues this respectful challenge. If you cherish freedom, you cherish the freedom of the press. If you cherish the airwaves of America, left, right and center, let's make this Fourth of July Radio Independence Day. 
   Sign the discharge petition for broadcast freedom by Independence Day.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a very straightforward amendment. It would prohibit funds appropriated in this bill from being used by the Department of Justice to enforce the criminal penalties provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, commonly known as McCain-Feingold. It would, essentially, prevent the Justice Department from using funds to enforce criminal penalties against organizations that make electioneering communications under that bill. 
   The electioneering communications section of McCain-Feingold prohibits the use of corporate or labor union funds to finance broadcast advertisements that include the name or depiction of a Federal candidate within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days before a general election. Basically, it restricts the first amendment rights of Americans, whether they be in right-to-life organizations or the AFL-CIO or other labor organizations, from lobbying their Representatives and using the airwaves in those days before elections. 
   Happily, on June 25 of this year, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, ruled unconstitutional this provision of the McCain-Feingold law that prohibits the broadcasting of such issue advertisements prior to an election, even if those advertisements reference a Federal candidate, and even if the advertisements have some electoral effect. It was, in a very real sense, Mr. Chairman, a huge victory for the first amendment because it's a major step in restoring the free speech rights to grass-roots lobbying organizations, left, right, and center. 
   The ruling allows advocacy groups around the country, like Wisconsin Right to Life, the freedom to run ads to encourage citizens to contact their legislators on issues of importance to them. And it reasserts the principle that the presumption under the law should be in favor of free expression rather than the muzzling of speech. 
   Those of us who hailed this ruling and welcomed it as a first step toward the reversal of McCain-Feingold were encouraged, but we knew this was not the end of the story. As the sole House plaintiff in the McConnell v. FEC case that challenged McCain-Feingold, I believe we must maintain our effort, which is to ensure that that about McCain-Feingold that intrudes on the first amendment rights of every single American are challenged. And that's why I'm on the floor today. 
   The Pence amendment reaffirms the Supreme Court's ruling in Wisconsin Right to Life. It simply states that no funds under this bill can be used to enforce criminal penalties against any organization airing such an issue advertisement. It further prevents criminal penalties attendant to the reporting requirements associated with the airing of such ads. We should not allow criminal penalties to be imposed on citizens for engaging in protected speech and for not reporting to the Government about their protected speech. 
   That is the crux of the Pence amendment.

   Mr. PENCE. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate the gentleman's question. 
   In fairness, my amendment says that no funds may be used to force amendments made subject to title A of title II of Public Law 107-155, which, according to some, is slightly broader than the Supreme Court decision. But this is the provision of the law that the Supreme Court essentially struck down. That's the crux of the Pence amendment. 
   All of those who claim allegiance to the first amendment, I believe, should be thrilled with the Wisconsin Right to Life decision and support the Pence amendment. 
   I think we still have much to do to reinstate full first amendment protections to the American people. But I continue to believe we're badly trampled by McCain-Feingold. 
   But passing the Pence amendment today in the Congress would simply reaffirm the essential elements of the Supreme Court's decision in the Wisconsin Right to Life case. It's an important first step on this floor. It's one I encourage my colleagues to support. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for bringing this important amendment. 
   Facts are stubborn things, Mr. Chairman. The CJS bill spends $53.6 billion. This amendment would reduce that by 1.4 percent, but it would still allow for  an increase in the Commerce-Justice, and Science spending. With the passage of this amendment that is being characterized as a cut in the CJS budget, this bill still increases by nearly $1 billion compared to last year. 
   And let me be clear on what we are trying to do, I think what the gentleman from Georgia is trying to do here, and that is we are trying to find a way to avoid having to raise taxes the way the Democrats are planning to do in the farm bill later today. I mean, the Democrat majority is planning to bring a $7.5 billion tax increase to the floor of the Congress in the context of the farm bill later today, and we are just trying to take this opportunity to make a cut in a single year that, if we did it over 10 years, we wouldn't have to raise taxes. 
   Now, that is being characterized as the work of a small minority versus a bipartisan majority. At least they are not calling us a fringe this week. 
   Well, I think if the small majority is the people that want to pay for increases in spending with budget discipline, and the bipartisan majority is the one that wants to pay for increases in spending by raising taxes, I am happy to be part of the small majority that I happen to think speaks for the overwhelming majority of the American people, who want this Congress to live within its means, who want this Congress in a bipartisan way to make the tough choices to put our fiscal house in order. 
   I commend the gentleman from Georgia. I thank him for his vision. I urge passage of the Price amendment, because if it passes, it will lay a foundation where we will not have to raise taxes by $7.5 billion in the farm bill later today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress from the heartland, I have supported the farm bill in the past. Regrettably, the 2007 farm bill that we will consider this week is a deeply flawed piece of legislation. It combines traditional agricultural programs with the misplaced priorities of the Democratic Congress. Tax increases, budget gimmicks, workplace restrictions, and a public union provision that offends States' rights, and I cannot support it. 
   This farm bill is a disservice to American farmers and an attack on hurting families in the State of Indiana. 
   At the behest of one of the Nation's largest public employee unions, the Democrat Congress added language to this bill that will prohibit States from working with private companies to improve the administration of welfare services. Since Indiana is leading the Nation in improving welfare services through these partnerships, this bill is bad for Indiana, bad for hurting families, and bad for Hoosier taxpayers. 
   In the interest of federalism, it's imperative that Congress give State governments the freedom to innovate in the delivery of food stamps and other welfare programs to benefit recipients and improve services. 
   I will vote against this farm bill because it raises taxes, busts the budget, and does a great disservice to our most hurting Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, one year into a liberal Democratic majority in Congress, the economy is struggling. The big government policies of the new majority are taking their toll. High gasoline prices, the subprime market crisis in housing and news that inflation is at a 17-year high all demand a bipartisan stimulus package in the next 30 days. Congress must act, and must act swiftly. 
   But there will be choices to make. Democrats want an extension of unemployment insurance benefits and tax rebates. Republicans will accept rebates, but they also want incentives for businesses, while avoiding tax increases to offset the package. 
   I submit that Congress must focus stimulus on the kind of economic stimulus that will create jobs and growth for small business and family farmers. The real antidote to the impending recession is more money in the hands of the wage earner and the wage payer. This is and always has been the pathway to prosperity in the American economy. 
   I urge my colleagues to work in a bipartisan manner to stave off this impending economic downturn in the best interests of all of the American people.

   It was in that spirit that 3 years ago, I authored the Free Flow of Information Act with my colleague Congressman Rick Boucher from Virginia. The bill provides a qualified privilege to shield confidential sources from disclosure except in cases where national security or classified information is at issue. 
   Last year, the House proved that freedom is not an issue alone in the province of the left or the right by passing the measure with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. 
   Last week, the Washington Post and Washington Times proved the same. Newspapers with great liberal and conservative traditions alike have endorsed this vital legislation. 
   We learned this morning that the Senate may consider the Free Flow of Information Act as soon as tomorrow, and so I respectfully rise to encourage our colleagues in the other body to remember, freedom is not the business of Republicans or Democrats, liberals or  conservatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Chairman, I rise on behalf of the fringe in America. Madam Chairman, that would be the fringe that believes that governments ought to live within their means, ought to pay their bills, ought to balance budgets. 
   The gentleman from Ohio, whom I respect and admire his style as a legislator and a leader, has coined the phrase ``fringe,'' and I want to embrace it. I want to come to this floor and say every American who believes that we ought to balance the Federal budget, who believes that we ought to come together across the political divide and reform entitlements, who believes we ought to wrestle to the ground an $8 trillion national debt, that fringe is the fringe that I represent in America and those with which I proudly stand. 
   And let me say I know that number 8 trillion very well. On my way to the floor today, I passed the office of clearly a dozen of the gentleman from Ohio's colleagues' offices, Democrats all, who anyone looking on wouldn't necessarily know, who all have signs in front of their office lamenting an $8 trillion national debt. And as the other gentleman said, I lament the role of the Republican majority in creating that, and I fought members of my own majority in years that we saw the debt go from $5 trillion to $8 trillion. 
   But I say on behalf of the fringe, the fringe of Americans who say governments ought to live within their means, they ought to balance budgets, they ought to make the tough choices in a bipartisan way to live within the fiscal values that the American people represent, I say let's deal with it. And this cut today brought by the gentleman from Georgia is a modest step to be sure. It is a 1 percent cut. It says instead of doing with a 4.8 percent increase over last year, the Federal Government will have to get by on a 3.8 percent increase over last year. And it doesn't seem to me to be too much to ask, with an $8 trillion national debt, for us to come together and begin to trim and begin to make the hard choices. But it won't solve the real problem, and my cherished colleagues on the other side of the aisle know this. We have to get past the names; we have to get past the categories, and we have to represent the fringe of America that wants to see us balance this budget.

   Mr. PENCE. Allow me to say there are many good things happening in federally funded Family Planning clinics nationwide: 5 million Americans served, 90 percent of whom are low income; 900,000 unintended pregnancies were averted by title X family planning funding; and it is reassuring that abstinence education is required for all clients. But today, I am offering an amendment that is very simple. 
   The Pence amendment states that no funds under title X may be granted to Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient of title X funding, and it is the largest abortion provider in America. Last year alone, Planned Parenthood's own annual report states that it received more than one-third of its $1 billion budget from government contracts and grants. And, again, according to their annual report, Planned Parenthood performed more than one quarter of a million abortions. 
   Millions of pro-life Americans should not be asked to fund the leading abortion provider in the United States. Now, let me stipulate, I know that title X funds may not be used for abortion. And my amendment does not cut or reduce the budget for family planning in this appropriation bill; it simply prevents appropriated funds from reaching an organization that profits from the abortion trade. 
   It is time the American people stop funding the Nation's largest abortion provider, and I urge support for the Pence amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank my colleague from New York for his extraordinary courtesy. And let me say, I regret that this debate will only take 15 minutes. It is a great and serious matter, and I think the dignity with which it's been conducted thus far is evidence of the capacity of this Congress to discuss even the most contentious issues of our time in a manner that reflects civility and favorably on the institution. 
   Now, that being said, let me clear up a few points. This is not, as the chairman said, ``a frontal assault on family planning.'' There are no cuts in Title X in the Pence amendment. The Pence amendment states plainly that no funds under Title X may be granted to Planned Parenthood. 
   Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient of Title X funding, and it's also the largest abortion provider in America. 
   And as to whether we are living under the same arrangements, as the chairman said, and I respectfully quote, ``same arrangements under Republican rule,'' it seems to me just a short time ago we saw this new majority overturn much of the decades long Mexico City policy that prevented Federal dollars from going to organizations overseas that provide abortion for family planning. 
   I think this Nation needs a domestic Mexico City policy. And frankly, if the common ground that this Congress has reached means tens of millions of Federal tax dollars going to the largest abortion provider in America, that is not a common ground I can accept. 
   Say ``no'' to Federal funds for Planned Parenthood in Title X. Say ``yes'' to family planning funding through Title X. Say ``yes'' to the Pence amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in the midst of what has been characterized as a silly debate, and I don't rise so much to disagree with that characterization, but maybe for different reasons. 
   Let me say, as others have said, I was here on September 11, like many of my colleagues. I do not question the imperative of providing for the physical safety of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. I strongly supported the decision by the President to provide for private jet travel for the Speaker of the House then and support such transportation now. We must protect those who lead us and we must not play politics with that protection. 
   But let me say on the subject of whether this is a silly debate around the gentleman from Virginia's amendment, I think it is silly to question the right of the minority to question public expenditures. The gentleman from New York, whom I deeply respect, comes to the floor to question the very act of Congress being Congress. We are asking questions, in the minority, of the majority about the public expenditure of public assets; and that is precisely what Congress and the minority in Congress exists to do. I think it is altogether silly to question the right to question in the Congress. 
   Let me also say, Mr. Chairman, I think it is a little bit silly, some of the public consternation about a Democrat Speaker's airplane needing to be much bigger than a Republican Speaker's airplane, because to the extent that the airplane itself is a metaphor for government, I believe that we can expect all of the government will continue to need to be much bigger under a Democrat majority in Congress. 
   In a very short period of time, we have seen our colleagues bring wage and price controls and raise taxes. So to part of me, with great respect for my colleagues on this side of the aisle, it is not terribly surprising that the plane needs to be bigger too. When we think of the history of entitlements under Democrat control of Congress, we might well anticipate a fleet of planes in a fairly short period of time. 
   But, of course, I jest. I think it is a bit of a silly debate to question the right to question in this Congress. I think my colleagues know this to be true. But I also think it is a little bit silly for the American people to ever expect government to get smaller under Democrat control. 
   And it is also rather silly, and I close, to think that Republicans will ever fail to come to this floor to object when government grows needlessly under a Democrat majority. We will rise to that challenge. We will object to the expansion of government, even when it takes the shape of a 757.

   In May, Congressman Gary Ackerman and I introduced bipartisan legislation, H. Con. Res. 362, urging this administration to impose expanded economic sanctions on key sectors of the Iranian economy. It appears as though it's having its good effect. In what's being reported today as what will be the ``closest contact between the two countries since the Iranian revolution of 1979,'' this weekend, U.S. Ambassador William Burns will meet with top arms negotiators from Tehran. It will be more of a listening session and should not be overstated. 
   However, I would offer that this glimmer of hope in these negotiations is precisely because of the resolve of the United States and the European community to economically and diplomatically isolate Iran over its nuclear ambitions. But now is not the time for us to shrink from renewed diplomatic pressure. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join Congressman Gary Ackerman and me and cosponsor H. Con. Res. 362 before this weekend. Let's send a deafening message to the negotiators in Iran that the American people stand for diplomatic and economic isolation until they abandon their nuclear ambition.

   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I always find the majority leader's comments compelling and moving. He is among the best communicators I think in this generation of leaders in this House. And let me say as a conservative Member of this House who was in Baghdad one month ago, I believe that it is imperative that we express to the Iraqi Government an urgency about performing on all the issues that the majority leader just addressed. 
   But the reason why I rise in opposition to this bill is because under the Constitution of the United States, Congress can declare war, Congress can choose to fund or not to fund war, but Congress cannot conduct war. And the latest Democratic plan to micromanage our war in Iraq is ``war on the installment plan,'' and it should be rejected on the basis of proof on the ground and common sense and history. 
   The proof on the ground is this: Baghdad is not safe, but it is safer as I saw a month ago. Due to more than two dozen U.S. and Iraqi installations set up throughout the city, insurgent violence is down. Thanks to the fact that 20 of 22 tribal leaders have stepped forward to support U.S. and Iraqi governmental forces, violence in the al-Anbar province is coming down. 
   Now is not the time for us to say we will do war on the installment plan and come back in 60 days and evaluate. 
   My Democrat colleagues heard General Petraeus on the Hill 10 days ago. He said by late summer we will have a better idea whether the surge is taking hold. He pledged to report to this Congress in September. So why this? Why do we come here tonight with a 60-day timetable for another vote? 
   As our troops do their duty on the ground in Iraq, our duty is clear. Let's set aside the politics of the moment. Let's find a common ground and build legislation that is constitutionally sound and fiscally responsible. Let's give our soldiers the resources they need to get the job done and then come home safe.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act of 2007. 
   The fact that more than half a million Americans living in the District of Columbia are denied a single voting representative in Congress is clearly a historic wrong. 
   The single overarching principle of the American founding was that laws should be based upon the consent of the governed. The first generation of Americans threw tea in Boston Harbor because they were denied a voting representative in the national legislature in England. Given their commitment to representative democracy, it is inconceivable to me that our Founders would have been willing to accept the denial of representation to so great a throng of Americans in perpetuity. 
   But the demands of justice are not enough for Congress to act. Under our  system of government, Congress may only take action which is authorized by the written Constitution. I do believe in my heart that H.R. 1905 is a constitutional remedy to a historic wrong, and I am not alone in this thought. 
   Judge Kenneth Starr, the former Independent Counsel and U.S. Solicitor General observed: ``There is nothing in our Constitution's history or its fundamental principles suggesting that the Framers intended to deny the precious right to vote to those who live in the capital of the great democracy that they founded.'' None other than Justice Antonin Scalia observed in 1984 that the seat of government clause of the Constitution gives Congress extraordinary and plenary power over our Nation's Capital. Judge Starr observes: ``The logic of that case and that reasoning applies here.'' 
   Congress has used this power in the past. It was in a 1949 case that the Supreme Court upheld legislation that extended access to the Federal courts even though article III expressly limited jurisdiction to the courts to suits brought by citizens of several States. None of which argues for the District of Columbia ever to be granted the right to elect Members to the Senate. In a real sense, the House is derivative of the people, the Senate is derivative of the State. 
   It is my privilege to stand today, albeit in opposition to some of my most cherished colleagues, and stand in support of the D.C. Voting Rights bill.

Yesterday, thanks to the leadership of the Republican Congress and this Republican President, the United States Supreme Court echoed that moral awakening.

   To all who labor in the cause of life, I say in the wake of yesterday's decision, press on. Your labors on behalf of the unborn are not in vain.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, we come to this floor in the midst of an extraordinary time in the life of this economy and in the life of our cherished domestic automotive industry. 
   The American automotive industry is facing a financial crisis. Millions of jobs are on the line. Let me say from my heart, Madam Speaker, inaction by this Congress is not an option, but I rise in opposition to the rule, and I rise in opposition to the legislation that will be brought to the floor under this rule, because I believe the American people know we cannot borrow and spend and bail our way back to a growing economy. 
   We cannot borrow and spend and bail our way back to a vibrant automotive sector here in the United States. The legislation that will come before the Congress today will take $15 billion in taxpayer money and make it available to the automotive industry, appoint something in the form of a car czar for the purpose of organizing and encouraging the kinds of changes in the industry that Washington, D.C. believes are appropriate. 
   But I would say the bailout proposed by the White House and congressional  Democrats is fundamentally flawed. It exposes the American taxpayer to more debt, fails to reorganize our domestic auto manufacturers, and does not fix the immediate credit crisis that those good companies are facing. 
   Instead, the Democrat bill will actually prevent the necessary changes and force us back into the same situation where taxpayers will undoubtedly be asked to bail this industry out again and again and again. The Democrat bailout also seeks to create, as I mentioned, something known as a car czar with the responsibilities of making car companies more profitable, more fiscally responsible. Well, trusting a Washington bureaucrat, who has probably never even tightened a lug nut, with fixing what ails the American automotive industry is not the answer. 
   Today, House Republicans propose the American Automotive Reorganization and Recovery Plan. It is an effort to lock in the restructuring promised over the last few weeks with firm benchmarks and a tight timeline. Also, in the place of a taxpayer-funded government bailout, House Republicans would encourage private investment to finance a Detroit recovery in this year and the next. It is a solution that will protect our domestic auto industry and the American taxpayer, and that must be paramount in our interest. 
   Under the Republican plan, the Big Three, having presented their plans for restructuring, would be required to lock in a tight timeline with a high degree of specificity about the kinds of changes that will make our domestic auto industry truly competitive and on parity with those cherished companies that have made foreign investments and are manufacturing cars here in the United States. 
   Secondly, we would establish a process for reaching an expedited agreement. Instead of nationalizing America's auto companies by having the Federal Government take a stake interest in those companies, an equity and stock position, we would rather say that because of the many legal and contractual hurdles to restructuring, the companies would be urged to accomplish a restructuring through the use of a prepackaged bankruptcy or other legal mechanism to bring all stakeholders to the table for an agreed-upon determination about their future. 
   With regard to interim financing, again, Madam Speaker, we would not look to the Federal Treasury to finance a recovery in Detroit, but, rather, we would look to the private sector. We would create a hand up, not a hand out, by creating an FDIC-style insurance program where auto companies could be required to purchase insurance as a backstop to private lending that's made into their industry. Now, many of us believe that this would loosen up an extraordinary amount of financing, the so-called debtor-in-possession financing, which is so scarce in our economy today--so a serious reorganization and recovery plan, with hard timelines and urgency. 
   Secondly, a process using the existing judicial institutions of this country to enforce that restructuring; and, thirdly, a priming of the pump with a new federally backed insurance program to encourage investment in Detroit is the antidote to what ails us. Simply handing $15 billion out to Detroit today, however popular it may be with some Americans, I believe, in my heart, it would ultimately be a disservice to the American taxpayer, to our children, and our grandchildren. 
   So I urge consideration of the Republican plan, the American Automotive Reorganization and Recovery Plan. I urge my Democrat colleagues to allow such a proposal to come to the floor, and I oppose this rule.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, the Good Book tells us if you owe debts, pay debts; if honor, then honor; if respect, then respect. And this weekend, Sunday specifically, millions of Americans will gather in places large and small in this country to pay a debt of gratitude that we owe to the American soldier. And I rise today like all of those who will gather in ceremonies and parades, surrounding people wearing mothballed uniforms and gray hair, to celebrate Veterans Day. Memorial Day is that day in the spring when we remember those who did not come home; Veterans Day is the day in the fall when we remember those who did. 
   A close friend of my late father, a combat veteran, said to me once poignantly, I think your dad never got over the guilt of coming home. While we remember those who served and fell this weekend, we will remember those who carry the burden of veterans; who fired shots in anger; who wore the uniform of the United States of America; and who, every day of their lives thereafter, carry the burden of that poignant service and significant loss. 
   To veterans all across America and especially those in eastern Indiana, we will remember you this Veterans Day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. 
   America is at war. We have to do all we can to protect our Nation from those who seek to harm this country, our communities and our families. 
   After nearly a year of delays, we finally have before us a bill that will institute a long-term fix to our Nation's foreign intelligence surveillance laws and provide the intelligence community with the tools it needs to protect this country. 
   I rise in particular appreciation of Republican Whip Roy Blunt, Ranking Member Smith and Mr. Hoekstra. These Republicans stood firm and have succeeded in negotiating a strong 4-year extension to our surveillance laws. 
   While this bill is tough on terrorists, it includes strong protections for civil liberties and Americans that have also been put in place by extensive measures of oversight and review in the Department of Justice, and it protects those patriotic telecommunications companies who assisted the Federal Government in the wake of 9/11. 
   While I endorse these reforms and safeguards, let me say, Madam Speaker, Congress and future administrations must be vigilant to ensure that the exigent circumstances exceptions are practiced in a way that preserves Presidential discretion when conducting real-time foreign intelligence. Speaking less as a Congressman and more as a father, and as an American who was here on September 11, I am grateful to my colleagues in both parties for bringing this important compromise to the floor and making sure that our intelligence community, those who work tirelessly every day to protect us, have the tools they need to prevent the horrors of that day from ever being visited on our soil again.

We have hostages in Iran, Congress is making plans to withdraw from another unpopular war, and the Democrats return to the floor of Congress with plans to tax and spend once again. Higher taxes for working families, small businesses and family farms to finance billions of dollars in new spending with absolutely no reform of entitlements, the real threat to our children and grandchildren.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding; and I express strong support for his leadership and remarks concerning the Joint Economic Committee. 
   I also would echo the sentiments of the chairman who expressed on this floor, moments ago, the importance for pursuing a ``more sensible course for economic policy.'' And, as she did, I will reflect on the fact that that begins with the Federal budget. 
   We are in the midst, Mr. Chairman, of considering the Federal budget; and I rise this evening to reflect on that, however briefly. But I must tell you, I have a strong sense of deja vu as I come to this floor. It seems like it is the 1970s all over again. 
   I mean, seriously, if you think about it, there are hostages in Iran; Congress is making plans to withdraw from another unpopular war; the Equal Rights Amendment is about to be considered in the Congress, once again; and the tax-and-spend policies of a liberal Democrat majority are about to beset Washington, D.C.     
   The contrast between the Democrat plan for tax and spend and the Republican plan to balance the budget by 2012 could not be more startling, and I would like to speak about that this evening. 
   On taxes, under the Democrat budget that will be considered tomorrow, we find the largest tax increase in American history. Despite hollow promises, the tax hikes are in the numbers, and in a budget resolution the numbers don't lie. 
   The Republican budget, no tax increases, period. 
   On the spending side, the Democrat budget includes a $22 billion increase in nondefense spending above the President's request on top of $22 billion of unrequested spending in the supplemental and $6 billion in the omnibus. More taxes and more spending. 
   Under the Republican budget, we see a courageous effort to freeze nondefense, nonsecurity spending, while providing additional funds for veterans, the war on terror, CDBG, the National Institutes of Health and Science and Technology. 
   And perhaps most grievous and most startling a contrast, Mr. Chairman, is under the Democrat budget that will be considered tomorrow, we see a majority party in Congress that is prepared to ignore the trillions of dollars in unfunded obligations in entitlements altogether. The Democrat budget ignores the Nation's looming entitlement crises and allows unfunded liabilities in Medicare and Social Security to actually grow by an additional $25 trillion. 
   Again, the Republican alternative includes $279 billion in savings and commonsense reforms to entitlement programs to preserve our social safety net for future generations. And on budget process reform, believing, as I always have, that we must change the way we spend the people's money, the Democrat budget relies on gimmickry and hollow promises of reserve funds and PAYGO strategies that will only chase higher spending and higher taxes. 
   Under the Republican plan, we see legislative line item veto and PAYGO for all congressional spending. 
   So the contrasts have been startling, and it does seem like deja vu. But who will pay the price? Well, under the Democrat plan, working families in Indiana will pay an additional $2,700 per year. The Democrat budget resolution will increase marginal tax rates for all Americans, eliminate the new 10 percent tax bracket, increase taxes paid on capital gains and dividends, reimpose the death tax, cut the child tax credit. And that is just a start. 
   The GOP budget alternative will preserve tax cuts, will protect Social Security, and will balance the Federal budget by the year 2012. It is truly an historic recommitment by this Republican minority to the principles of fiscal discipline and reform. 
   It is, in fact, the 1970s all over again. But I would say very humbly, Mr. Chairman, let's not, as a Nation, relearn those lessons. Let's rather say ``no'' to bell bottoms, to disco, and to the tax and spend policies of the 1970s; and say ``yes'' to the fiscal discipline and reform reflected in the Republican budget resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the ranking member for yielding. 
   I rise in support of the Tom Lantos and Henry Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   The Bible tells us to whom much is given much is expected. And I believe the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in confronting the pandemic of HIV/AIDS. 
   The dimensions of this crisis are truly staggering. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has infected more than 60 million people worldwide. It has killed more than 25 million, a number which grows grievously every day by more than 8,500. HIV/AIDS has orphaned some 14 million children. And today, 70 percent of the people in the world with HIV/AIDS reside in Africa. Within that continent, there are entire countries where more than one-third of the adult population is infected. 
   More startlingly, if current infection rates continue, new epicenters for the disease are likely to arise out of India,  China, Eastern Europe with numbers that could surpass Africa in a few short years. 
   And the threat this pandemic poses to our security is also real. Left unaddressed, this plague will continue to undermine the stability of nations throughout the two-thirds world, leaving behind collapsing economies and tragedy and desperation, a breeding ground for extremist violence. This is truly a global crisis. And because the United States can render timely assistance, I believe we must. 
   Originally titled the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR put the world on notice that America will not ignore despair, desperation and disease. I am proud to have supported the original passage of PEPFAR in 2003, and I'm proud to support it today. 
   You know, every so often, in this place, we have the opportunity to do something for humanity and serve the American people, and this is such a time. 
   I thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their strong leadership. I commend my colleague, Chris Smith in particular for his yeoman's work on carefully preserving the delicate balance of this legislation. 
   And I also would like to publicly acknowledge the work of our President, George W. Bush. Mr. President, because of your moral leadership and compassion, Africa will never be the same, and history will record your work. 
   This Global AIDS bill seeks to address the crisis, not by providing medicine and health care to those in need, but also by providing resources for evidence based programs that have been successful in preventing infection. It's imperative, I believe, that we not only send our resources, but we also send them in a manner that is consistent with our values. We cannot send billions of dollars to Africa without sending value-based safeguards and techniques that work to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS by changing behavior. 
   Currently, within the Global AIDS bill, these pivotal provisions exist in the form of a requirement to ``provide balanced funding for prevention activities'' and to ensure that abstinence and faithfulness programs are ``implemented and funded in a meaningful and equitable way.'' 
   It was essential that we preserve these prevention methods that focus on behavioral change, that we work with faith-based and nongovernmental organizations at the local level, particularly through the ABC model that has produced such undeniable results. 
   Also, it was absolutely critical that we administer this foreign aid under the historic pro-life guidelines that prevent our foreign aid from going in a direction that's antithetical to the values of millions of Americans. I'm pleased to say the Lantos/Hyde Global AIDS bill preserves all of these vital pro-family provisions. 
   As we tend to the suffering though, we always have to figure out how we're going to pay for it. The Federal budget, I believe, is packed with wasteful and bloated programs which could supply more than enough opportunities to cover the costs of the Lantos/Hyde Global AIDS bill.     
   This summer, Madam Chairman, when it comes time to fund this program during the appropriations process, I believe Congress should make the hard choices necessary to ensure that this global health crisis does not become a crisis of debt for our children and grandchildren. I believe it is possible to be responsible to our fiscal constraints while being obedient to our moral calling. 
   The greatest of all human rights is the right to live. America is a Nation of great wealth, wealth of resources, but more importantly, a wealth of compassion. The history of the world is filled with telling moments regarding the character of a people. Sometimes we are witness to mankind's great inhumanities; other times, we marvel at the beauty of mankind's selfless acts of compassion when we rise above politics and raise up those in dire need. Let this be such a day. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Lantos/Hyde Global AIDS bill and its carefully crafted bipartisan compromise.

   Mr. PENCE. The national average cost of gasoline at the pump today is $3.98 a gallon. When I was home over the Memorial Day break, one Hoosier after another stopped and asked me the same question. They said, Mike, what is it going to take? What is it going to take for Congress to take action to give the American people more access to American oil? 
   The reality is today that the Democrat majority thinks that we can tax our way to lower gasoline prices. A few weeks ago, they actually passed legislation suggesting we could actually sue our way to lower gasoline prices. But the American people know the only way to lessen our dependence on foreign oil is to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. 
   We must take action now to allow additional drilling in environmentally responsible ways on American soil off American shores so the American people can increase global supply, reduce the price of oil, and bring real relief to families and businesses and farmers at the pump.

   Mr. PENCE. This summer, some of the most powerful Members of Congress, the House and the Senate, advocated a return of censorship to the airwaves of America in the form of the so-called Fairness Doctrine. I, along with more than 200 of my colleagues, introduced the Broadcaster Freedom Act. It would ensure that no future President could regulate the airwaves of America without an act of Congress. 
   Yesterday, House Republicans introduced a discharge petition to bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor of Congress. In 1 day, Madam Speaker, over 125 Members of Congress signed this petition. 
   The American people should know, if 218 Members of Congress sign this petition, we can have an up-or-down vote on legislation that would keep the Fairness Doctrine from ever coming back. 
   I urge my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, if you believe in broadcast freedom, if you believe in the freedom of the press, if you believe that freedom of the press is not a partisan issue, sign the petition. Bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor of the Congress and freedom will win again in Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (THE FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor weary but well after a week in which I have had the privilege of being involved in not one but two debates over the very freedoms enshrined in the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States. I am humbled as someone who not only has been charged with public duties in representing the good people of eastern Indiana here on the floor of the Congress, but I am humbled as someone who, from my youth, has been fascinated with the freedoms enshrined in the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States. 
   This week, I had the privilege of seeing legislation that I authored 3 years ago come to the floor of this Congress and be adopted in overwhelming and bipartisan measure. It was legislation known as the Free Flow of Information Act that I first introduced in the last Congress in partnership with Congressman Rick Boucher of Virginia, and our journey over these last 36 months brought us to that moment, this Tuesday, where we were able, through regular order, through a thorough process of committee hearings and markups and amendments on the floor, to see the first Federal legislation concerning the freedom of the press to be adopted by this Congress, a sense that freedom was enshrined in the first amendment and added by Congress to the Constitution itself. 
   What was especially gratifying to me was that we did it in a bipartisan way. Because I want to say as a recurrent theme this afternoon that on this floor there are many differences of opinion, but freedom is not a partisan issue in the House of Representatives. And the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech proved this week not to be a partisan issue, when 398 of our colleagues came together across the partisan divide to say ``yes'' to a free and independent press. 
   I come before this Chamber today, Mr. Speaker, to say ``thanks'' and to say how moving it was for me to play some small role in putting what I believe was a stitch in a tear in the fabric of the first amendment, freedom of the press. In that legislation known as the Free Flow of Information Act, we created for the first time a privilege, a qualified privilege for reporters to keep information and sources confidential. 
   Now, this was not a radical step. Some 33 States already have statutes that protect a reporter's privilege. But it was the first time that it has succeeded in passing the House of Representatives on the Federal level. And we await action by the Senate on similar legislation and hope for a conference committee and resolution of the matter that it might be sent to the President. We also hope, despite concerns expressed by the administration, that we can continue to shape this legislation, continue to work with the good men and women in the Department of Justice Criminal Division to dial it in in such a way that would make it possible for this President to sign this legislation. 
   I come before you today not just because I was privileged to co-author legislation that protected a reporter's right to the freedom of the press and a free and independent press enshrined in the Constitution, but also because I have authored one other piece of legislation about which we have taken action this week which is also about freedom of the press. It is called the Broadcaster Freedom Act. It is principally my purpose for coming before the Chamber today. But in each case, I want to begin by saying, Mr. Speaker, that I see the two as inextricably linked, that the work that Congressman Rick Boucher and I with, now, 390-plus of our colleagues to strengthen a free and independent press for those who engage in the business of reporting the news, we were attempting to do just as vigorously and just as effectively for those who commentate on the news. Because it has been the subject of commentators, especially commentators on talk radio in America, about which there has been much discussion and much consternation since this summer. And as I will expand further, there has been what I would characterize as, both on Capitol Hill and off Capitol Hill, troubling discussion about returning censorship on the airwaves of America by reimposing what used to be known as the Fairness Doctrine on radio and television broadcast outlets in this country. 
   I want to begin by stitching these two projects together because I think they are linked. Back in southern Indiana, we like to say ``what is good for the goose is good for the gander.'' The press freedom that our Founders enshrined in the first amendment for those that engage in reporting is also the same freedom I would argue that protects those that are engaged in commentating. We tend to forget that opinions that we 
   hear, left, right and center, on radio and television are  every bit as much protected by the first amendment freedom of the press than those who are typing copy and bylines that appear on the front page of the Indianapolis Star, the Muncie Star Press, the New York Times or the Washington Post. And the business of reporting and the business of commentating are two time-honored traditions in the practice of American press that I have been able to be a part of strengthening and defending this week. 
   As I said, now on the first, the creation of a reporter's privilege, we were able to come to the floor and pass that legislation out of the House in strong bipartisan measure. On the second, we took action this week to file a, Mr. Speaker, what is known as a discharge petition at the Calendar here in the House of Representatives to enable the Broadcaster Freedom Act to come to the floor for an up-or-down vote. 
   I want to explain to my colleagues and to anyone else looking on the import of that discharge petition and why I believe it is every bit as important that we have a vote on the Broadcaster Freedom Act as I believed it was important that we have a vote on the Free Flow of Information Act. 
   Let me take a half step back and say once again what a joy it was for me on both of these measures to be doing freedom's work here on the floor of the Congress. Because we debate many things in our various committees and responsibilities here, some foreign, some domestic, and some having to do with spending, some things as mundane as roads and bridges and potholes, but as we saw today with our newly elected colleague, Congresswoman Tsongas from Massachusetts, every one of us takes a very simple oath. We raise our right hand, as she did in this Chamber today, in a moment I was privileged to attend as a new colleague. We raise our right hand and we take an oath to support and uphold the Constitution of the United States and to protect her against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It is at the very center of what we are here to do. In the first amendment of that Constitution, this Congress is specifically enjoined. We are, in effect, commanded by our Founding Fathers to make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. It was an application of that principle, a principle that I believe is a principle of limited government, because I happen to believe in my heart of hearts, as I said during the debate over the Federal media shield bill this week, that as a conservative who believes in limited government, I think the only check on government power in real-time is a free and independent press. There is actually nothing more consistent with my belief in limited government than my vigorous defense and advance of the interests of a free and independent press. 
   Now, that being said, while we have the success on the one, we need an up-or-down vote on the other for reasons that I want to describe. But I want to be clear on the point that I believe this is all tied up in our duty that each one of the 435 Members of this Congress embraced in taking that oath of office. Because I can't help but feel that whether it was the erosion of an independent press and a rising tide of reporters being threatened with subpoenas, subpoenaed, and even being put into jail that was encroaching on that injunction in the first amendment, I also believe that much of the talk about restoring regulation and outright censorship to the airwaves of America, particularly the radio airwaves of America, is also violative of that specific language in the first amendment. 
   Now, about the Fairness Doctrine. The American people love a fair fight, and so do I, especially where the issues of the day are debated. But I would submit that in a free market, fairness should be based on equal opportunity, not equal results. And the fairness doctrine, as it was applied to 4 decades in American radio, was a doctrine that, while it was perhaps borne of the best intentions, it was not about the equal opportunity in a wide range of ideas, but it was about dictating results on the airwaves of America. Here is where it came from. 
   The Radio Act of 1929 was passed into law by this Congress, perhaps well-debated in this very room. When it became law there were, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, very few radio stations in America. I don't know the exact number off the top of my head, but radio at the time of the Depression was in its infancy. By the time that the Federal Communications Commission got around to passing the regulations that came to be known as the Fairness Doctrine in 1939, there was virtually no television in America, and radio was still in its infancy. Many communities in America, having no indigenous radio station at all, but the regulations folks then came along and said, look, there is a limited number of radio stations in America, in 1929 to 1939, and so the thought was because they are, the airwaves belong to the public, that, in effect, the Federal Communications Commission ought to make sure that both sides of controversial issues is debated fairly and evenly. It sounded reasonable enough at the time, I suspect, and while it rubs against my more libertarian instincts, I will say, there may have been a legitimate basis for the Fairness Doctrine in 1929, less so, but maybe in 1939, because of the scarce number of radio signals that were there. But from 1939 to 1987, for 4 decades, the Fairness Doctrine reined on the airwaves of America.     
   As we learned in those 40-some-odd years, there is nothing fair about the Fairness Doctrine. The elements of this regulation that were designed to ensure that both sides of the argument were heard ended up having the effect of ensuring that in most cases, on most radio stations, no sides of the argument were heard. 
   The reality is that from 1939 to 1987, when the Federal Communications Commission struck down the Fairness Doctrine on its own, there was virtually nothing like what has come to be known left, right and center as American talk radio today. In fact, it is almost inarguable that the dynamic forum that has emerged as talk radio today virtually began with the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. 
   So the first part of this debate, Mr. Speaker, is we don't need to wonder what American broadcast radio would look like if the Fairness Doctrine were re-imposed. We have four decades of experience. We know precisely what the public airwaves would look like if we returned to this arcane rule of content regulation. 
   Truthfully, I think the most likely outcome is not that radio stations that carry Rush Limbaugh would also carry Alan Colmes. The reality is, faced with recordkeeping, red tape, potential legal fees that would attach to a Fairness Doctrine challenge filed with the FCC, and potential loss of their license, most of the 2,000 radio stations today that carry talk radio simply wouldn't carry it any more. 
   Now why do I know this? Let me be a little bit autobiographical for a second, Mr. Speaker. Before I was elected to Congress in the year 2000, I made a living in radio. I had a call-in talk radio show heard exclusively in Indiana. It was carried on 20 different radio stations, from 9 a.m. to noon. I tell people sometimes I was Rush Limbaugh on decaf. I was conservative, but wasn't in a bad mood about it. We had all different sides on. But I would bring my cheerful conservative perspective to bear across the airways of heartland Indiana every day. 
   Mr. Speaker, I started in radio in little old, no pun intended, Rushville, Indiana, in 1989, a little tiny show that aired from 6 to 6:30 p.m. That gave rise to a weekend show, and that gave rise to a daily show, and then I was in syndicated radio for the better part of 7 years. It was a blast. I enjoyed it. When the opportunity came for me to go into public service, I was torn because I so enjoyed the opportunity to get in front of that microphone and talk to Hoosiers every day about the things that were important to them and share my philosophy of government. 
   My wife and I ultimately felt a calling in our life to public service. We stepped forward. I never looked back. But I lived in the business for a long time. I spent a lot of time driving around to little radio stations across Indiana and dropping off tapes to station managers and asking them if they would carry what we conveniently entitled ``The Mike Pence Show.'' 
   So I know these radio station owners, and I know that a lot of them run these stations on a shoestring. The reality is, and the reason why, when the Fairness Doctrine was in effect, there were 200 talk radio stations in America, and after the Fairness Doctrine was repealed, there are now 2,000 talk radio  stations in America, is because, quite frankly, when the Fairness Doctrine was in effect, most radio stations just said we can't deal with the controversy, the recordkeeping, the making sure that we live up to Federal regulations. For heaven's sake, we can't live with the risk that somebody would file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission and we would possibly lose our license. 
   I saw in the years immediately following the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine radio station owners beginning to awaken to the fact that they could put commentators on the airwaves and enjoy freedom and let nothing other than the marketplace itself choose who was going to succeed on their radio station. As my friend, the former majority leader, Dick Armey, loves to say often, and I give him credit for the phrase, freedom works. 
   The truth is, after the Reagan administration struck down the Fairness Doctrine, we saw an explosion of talk radio. Frankly, most of the talk shows that have succeeded on a national level reflect a center right philosophical perspective. The truth is, Mr. Speaker, that in many of the largest markets around the country, some of the most popular talk show hosts are self-described liberals, or progressives and I say more power to them. 
   The truth is that the reality of American talk radio today is as diverse as the American people. And yet, and now I shift on the reason for the Broadcaster Freedom Act and the reason for us taking the extraordinary measure of filing a discharge petition on the floor of the Congress, I say with a heavy heart that some on Capitol Hill are calling for a return of the Fairness Doctrine to the airwaves of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will offer some quotes, with great respect to colleagues in this Chamber and the next. Senator RICHARD DURBIN said, as quoted in The Hill on June 27: ``It's time to reinstitute the Fairness Doctrine.'' The Senate majority whip, DICK DURBIN of Illinois, went on to say: ``I have this old-fashioned attitude that when Americans hear both sides of the story, they are in a better position to make a decision.'' 
   Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN told the same publication that she is, in fact, ``looking at'' reviving the Fairness Doctrine. She told Fox News on Sunday, June 24, that she was reviewing the Fairness Doctrine ``because talk radio is overwhelmingly one way,'' in her words. Senator JOHN KERRY, the former Democratic nominee for President of the United States, and easily one of the most respected and powerful Members of the United States Senate, told the Brian Lehrer radio show on June 26: ``I think the Fairness Doctrine ought to be there. I also think the Equal Time Doctrine ought to come back.'' He went on to say: ``I mean, these are the people who wiped out one of the most profound changes in the balance of the media, is when conservatives got rid of the equal time requirements. And the result is that, you know, they have been able to squeeze down, squeeze out opinions of opposing views, and I think it's been an imposing transition in the imbalance of our public.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, three of the most powerful Members of the United States Senate this summer, in the wake of the collapse of the amnesty bill that the Senate was attempting to move, expressed with frustration the need to return Federal regulation of the airwaves of America. American Spectator recently reported that according to two Members of the House Democratic Caucus, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and STENY HOYER, they will ``aggressively pursue reinstatement of the so-called Fairness Doctrine over the next six months.'' That was reported on May 14. 
   When I brought an amendment to the floor this summer that would just buy a 1-year moratorium to the re-imposition of the Fairness Doctrine, while 107 of my Democratic colleagues voted with us, none of the Democratic leadership or any of the leadership of the powerful committees of jurisdiction voted with us to prevent the Fairness Doctrine from returning. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are other examples of distinguished colleagues who have every right to hold the views they hold. I do not question their integrity or their sincerity; I just disagree with them vigorously. I do not accept the conclusion of the Center for American Progress, run by the former chief of staff of the Clinton administration. John Podesta, one of the most highly regarded thinkers in the modern Democratic Party today, runs a think tank. That group published an extensive cross-tabulated report this summer from their Center for American Progress entitled: ``The Structural Imbalance of American Talk Radio.'' While their proposal did not specifically call for the Fairness Doctrine, frankly, it called for much worse. It called for a whole new range of regulations involving ownership and consent on the airwaves of America. 
   So before anyone dismisses our efforts in trying to bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor of the House of Representatives as just more politics, let me say that I believe that it is imperative that the American people know that the next President of the United States, whoever he or she might be, could reinstate the Fairness Doctrine without an act of Congress unless we pass the Broadcaster Freedom Act. 
   Now, let me get to the legislation and make a few other comments about our extraordinary measure in the discharge petition that we filed this week. The legislation itself is very simple. The Broadcaster Freedom Act, which I introduced with Congressman GREG WALDEN that is cosponsored by every single Republican Member of the House of Representatives, and one Democrat, I am very happy and proud to say, a formal journalist himself, Congressman JOHN YARMUTH of Kentucky, the Broadcaster Freedom Act simply says this, Mr. Speaker: it says that the Congress takes away from the FCC the power to re-impose the Fairness Doctrine without an act of Congress. 
   Now why is that necessary? Well, I hasten to remind my colleagues and anyone looking in that the FCC did away with the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. They were doing away with a regulation that they created. Therefore, if the FCC were to change its mind, it could bring back the Fairness Doctrine without ever consulting the Congress. The truth is, the next President of the United States is, whoever he or she might be, were they sympathetic to the opinions expressed by Senator RICHARD DURBIN, Senator JOHN KERRY, and others that we need to re-impose the Fairness Doctrine, re-impose provisions of regulations like equal time and other things, that President, whoever he or she might be, could make virtually one appointment to the FCC and restore the Fairness Doctrine like that. I think the American people have a right to know that. The Broadcaster Freedom Act essentially says we are taking that power away from the FCC to re-impose the Fairness Doctrine. It's just that simple and no more complex than that. 
   Mr. Speaker, why do we need to do this? Then I will talk a little bit about what we are doing tactically and strategically to get an up-or-down vote. The reason we are doing it, I think, frankly, is because who's against fairness? I have to tell you that I was not terribly surprised when a recent national poll done by the Rasmussen polling firm found that 41 percent of those surveyed said they would be willing to require radio and TV stations to offer equal amounts of conservative and liberal commentary, and only 41 percent said they opposed. 
   So literally the American people, as we stand today, having not had this national debate, are fairly evenly divided on what I believe amounts to censorship of the airwaves of America. But, again, it's because of that pernicious word ``fairness.'' We have seen an entire cable television network built on the catch phrase ``fair and balanced.'' Yet, as I said at the outset of my remarks on the House floor today, there is nothing fair about the Fairness Doctrine. The reality is that were we to bring back this archaic rule to the airwaves of America, we would see talk radio as we know it either greatly diminished or essentially vanish from the American political debate. 
   So the Broadcaster Freedom Act I think is an effort to run to the sound of the guns on behalf of freedom. I hope that my colleagues who know me well know that I bring the same sincerity of purpose to this mission as I brought to the legislation that I coauthored that we passed this week to create a qualified privilege for reporters in the Free Flow of Information Act. To me, it's all about that constitutional principle of a free and independent press. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I will say that despite the fact that the Broadcaster  Freedom Act is cosponsored by 203 Members of Congress, despite the fact that the principles of broadcast freedom that were enshrined in the Pence amendment this summer that essentially created a 1-year ban on re-imposing the Fairness Doctrine passed by 309 votes, we are yet to see any action either at the committee level or on the floor calendar for consideration of the Broadcaster Freedom Act.     
   And I want to tell you, and I will talk a little technical here, Mr. Speaker, I am a regular order kind of a guy. I like legislation to go through subcommittees and committees and have hearings. I think the American people work their will when Congress is moving in the ordinary processes designed to vet and draft and redraft legislation. 
   And so it is an extraordinary thing for me to say that we ought to have a petition that brings the Broadcaster Freedom Act straight to the floor. In fact, in keeping with that principle, the rule that we wrote is an open rule. I would be more than willing to have several days of debate about broadcast freedom on the floor of this Congress. I would be more than willing to entertain as many amendments to the Broadcaster Freedom Act as Members wanted to propose. This is not an effort to silence the debate; it is an effort to have a debate about the freedom of American commentators on the public airwaves of America to engage in speech in a manner consistent with the first amendment. 
   And so this week, as I have been alluding, I along with now, I believe, the count this afternoon is about 140 Members of Congress, including all of the Republican leadership, we filed what is called a discharge petition that, if it is signed by 218 Members of Congress, will bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor of the Congress for an up-or-down vote. 
   While I would hope that my colleagues in the Democrat majority, while I would hope that the distinguished Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, might even be looking in on my remarks today and may ultimately decide MIKE is right, we ought to have a debate and a vote on the Broadcaster Freedom Act and the discharge petition would not be necessary, I am getting the impression that is not likely to happen. 
   And so we have taken an extraordinary measure, and as I said, I, along with the Republican leader, JOHN BOEHNER, the Republican whip, ROY BLUNT, conference chairman, ADAM SMITH, and others are now calling on our colleagues in a spirit of good will to say: Give us an up-or-down vote on the Broadcaster Freedom Act on the floor of the House of Representatives, because I want to make a very bold statement about this legislation. And having just seen legislation that I coauthored get 398 votes on the House floor Tuesday, I hope people don't think that I am talking through my hat. 
   I want to say with confidence that if the Broadcaster Freedom Act was brought to the floor of the House of Representatives, I believe it would pass overwhelmingly, because every time freedom gets an up-or-down vote on the floor of Congress, freedom wins. 
   I go back to this summer, as I said, I introduced an amendment, the Pence amendment to the appropriations bill that funded the FCC. I didn't know how it would do. I introduced the amendment to deny any funding to the FCC in the next year to bring back the Fairness Doctrine. It was a way of starting this conversation. My gosh, it passed; 309 Members of Congress voted for the Pence amendment. It was overwhelming, including 107 backbench Members of the Democratic majority. I am sincerely grateful for that, but that was a 1-year moratorium. 
   The truth is we have a Presidential election just around the corner. We will have a new administration in Washington, DC, and many of the leaders of the Democratic Party on Capitol Hill are calling for a return of the Fairness Doctrine, so now is the time for us to permanently do what 309 Members of Congress voted to do for a year, and that is to ensure the ongoing freedom of the airwaves of America by passing the Broadcaster Freedom Act. 
   Again, I want to say I am absolutely positive it would win, and I am positive it would have an overwhelming bipartisan vote because, as we learned this week with the Free Flow of Information Act, every time freedom gets a vote on the floor of the people's House, freedom wins. 
   Let me close, and I notice from the clock it is coming up on the time for me to give a tour to 100 eighth graders from Dearborn County, Indiana, and I can't be late for that. But let me say, bringing back the Fairness Doctrine would amount to government control over political views expressed on the public airwaves. Plain and simple. 
   I say with great respect to those who think we ought to return to those 4 decades where the Federal Government thought it was its role to regulate the debate that took place on the airwaves of radio and television, I say with great respect to them, I think there is a great danger when we unleash the power of the Federal Government to corral, to organize, to minimize or categorize or prioritize the American political debate. It is the essence of my belief that as messy as freedom is, it is the freedom of the American people that has created the most powerful and the most prosperous Nation in the history of the world. 
   I really believe with all my heart that at the end of the day, that as messy and as painful as it sometimes is for those of us in positions of public power, that the very well-being of the Nation is tied up in those of us in this body standing for the freedoms enshrined in the first amendment. 
   I was asked by a reporter yesterday at a press conference, Mr. Speaker: What if all of talk radio, monolithically talk radio reflected a liberal world view, would you still be doing this? 
   And I stepped to the microphone confidently and I said: Well, let me tell you, a lot of people think a lot of the national news media is fairly liberal. And I agree. An awful lot of the people that report on the network national news and some of the leading newspapers in America are quite liberal in their viewpoints. 
   Mr. Speaker, that didn't stop me from coauthoring the Free Flow of Information Act to protect the right of reporters in the electronic news media and the print media to keep sources confidential. And I appeal to my colleagues, men and women of good will all, who voted with us this summer for broadcast freedom, to join us again and sign this discharge petition. 
   I said on the House floor yesterday, if you support broadcast freedom, sign the petition. If you oppose the Fairness Doctrine and the archaic notion of the Federal Communications Commission regulating the airwaves of America as it did for 4 decades, sign the petition. I said if you cherish the dynamic national asset, left, right, and center that has become American talk radio since 1987, sign the petition. And ultimately, if you don't agree with any one of those positions but you just think that broadcast freedom ought to get an up-or-down vote on the House floor, I say to my colleagues, sign the petition because it is imperative to me, and the American people understand, that if 218 Members of this body sign that piece of paper, we will get an up-or-down vote on the Broadcaster Freedom Act, and I am positive we will send the Fairness Doctrine to the ash heap of broadcast history where it belongs. 
   I have every confidence that Republicans and Democrats in overwhelming numbers will reject the Fairness Doctrine, will adopt the Broadcaster Freedom Act, and we will be able, like we did on Tuesday of this week, to know that we set aside politics and we stood together as a Nation behind that blood-bought freedom of speech and freedom of the press that is enshrined in the first amendment. 
   Lastly, let me quote President John F. Kennedy, who was a boyhood hero of mine. When I first became involved in politics, it may surprise some of my colleagues to know that I was the Youth Democrat Party Coordinator in Bartholemew County, Indiana. I am probably the only Republican in Congress who has a bust of John F. Kennedy in my campaign headquarters. But as a fellow second generation Irish American, I still find him a deeply inspirational figure. 
   It seems to me John F. Kennedy expressed some words that speak to our time about this debate. He said: ``We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign  ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.'' 
   Let me say that one more time because it literally could be a part of this debate over the Fairness Doctrine today. President John F. Kennedy said: ``We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values.'' Let me stop there. 
   You listen to talk radio today, it is almost as if John F. Kennedy had listened to it. There are an awful lot of unpleasant facts for people in power that get mentioned on talk radio. A lot of foreign ideas. Occasionally some downright alien philosophies. If you listen to late-night talk radio, there are sometimes literally alien philosophies, and there certainly are competitive values. 
   But John F. Kennedy went on to say: ``A nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.'' 
   You know, America is a Nation of freedom and strong opinion, and our government must not be afraid to entrust our good people with all the facts and all the opinions necessary to make choices as an informed electorate. That is what democracy is all about. Now, is it comfortable for men and women in power who work in this rarified air of this marble building, no. But is it freedom? Is it what our Founders intended when they enshrined a free and independent press in the first amendment of the Constitution? You bet it is. I mean to tell you, our Founders did not enshrine the freedom of the press in the first amendment because they got good press. Our Founders enshrined the freedom of the press in the first amendment of the Constitution because they understood that a free and independent press is the only check on government power in real-time. And our Founders whose faces, some of which are chiseled into the wall or painted on canvasses in this Chamber, believed in limited government and they believed in holding people like me and the other 434 Members of Congress who work in this Chamber accountable to a free and vigorous debate among the American people. 
   So I just come to the floor today to say thank you to my colleagues, thank you for standing for a free and independent press this week in the Free Flow of Information Act. I am deeply humbled and grateful for the work of my coauthor and colleague, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher) as we passed the first Federal legislation protecting a reporter's right to keep a source confidential in American history. It passed the House this week. It passed by 398 votes. 
   I also want to thank my colleagues who stood with me this summer against broadcast censorship, voting for my amendment to ban the Fairness Doctrine for 1 year, 309 Members, 107 Democrats in the Congress joined us, and I thank them for that. 
   I want to thank the 203 colleagues, all of the Republicans and one Democrat, who have cosponsored the Broadcaster Freedom Act that would send the Fairness Doctrine to the ash heap of broadcast history forever. 
   Now I want to close on this last legislative day of the week with a challenge.     
   I want to challenge my colleagues to sign the petition that's at the counter to bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor of the Congress for an up-or-down vote; and I say again, Mr. Speaker, to you and to my colleagues and to anyone who might be looking in, if 218 Members of Congress sign the discharge petition for the Broadcaster Freedom Act, we will bring this legislation to the floor of the Congress and it will pass. 
   I say that having been through literally thousands of votes on this House floor, many of which I didn't know the outcome before I showed up, some of which I had to wait a long time for the outcome, longer than I should have. But this one I say with confidence and with humility and with gratitude, if the Broadcaster Freedom Act that would do away forever with the Fairness Doctrine comes to the floor of the House of Representatives, it will pass with bipartisan support because freedom is not a partisan issue on the floor of the Congress. 
   I believe we proved this Tuesday with the Free Flow of Information Act what we will prove the day the Broadcaster Freedom Act comes to this floor, that every time freedom gets an up-or-down vote in the House of Representatives, freedom wins. 
   So I urge my colleagues, but especially those who supported broadcast freedom earlier this year, sign the discharge petition for H.R. 2905 and bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor of the Congress; 218 Member signatures will make it possible for the American people to have their say and send the Fairness Doctrine forever to the ash heap of broadcast history where it belongs. 
   Let's bring the Broadcaster Freedom Act to the floor. Let's let freedom reign, and let's do it together as we did this Tuesday, Republicans and Democrats, standing for the freedoms enshrined in the first amendment, the freedom of the press, the freedom of speech, the Broadcaster Freedom Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (CALLING ON UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL TO CHARGE IRANIAN PRESIDENT WITH CERTAIN VIOLATIONS BECAUSE OF HIS CALLS FOR DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding and for her extraordinary leadership on that area of the world about which I have some responsibilities as the ranking Republican on the Middle East Subcommittee. 
   And like the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), I too wish to congratulate the principal author of H. Con. Res. 21. There is no greater or more eloquent advocate for that precious relationship between the free peoples of the United States of America and Israel than Congressman Steve Rothman of New Jersey. And I commend the gentleman for his leadership on this measure and would echo the gentlelady's remarks about the force and eloquence of his presentation. And I will not seek to emulate that today, nor compete with it. 
   But I will take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to reflect on the importance of this resolution and the facts and the wisdom underpinning the need for Congress to be heard on the issue of calling on the United Nations Security Council to charge Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with violating the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the U.N. charter because of his calls for the destruction of the state of Israel. 
   The United Nations, in a very real sense, was formed when history failed. History and the international institutions on the planet failed to prevent barbaric action by fascist Nazi and Axis powers against the free world. And in every sense, genocide, the genocide that we saw perpetrated by the Germans against indigenous Jewish people and other ethnic populations, the genocide perpetrated by certain Japanese forces on mainland China, was part and parcel of the reason for the formation of the United Nations. And therefore the United Nations charter and the aforementioned Treaty on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide are all tied up one with another. 
   And so for this Congress, as the legislature of that nation which sits on the Security Council, to call on the United Nations to live up to its historic commitment to prevent and confront genocide is, as we say in Indiana, not a stretch. This is at the very essence of what the United Nations was created to do, and the need for action by the United Nations Security Council when one considers the facts in this case truly speak for themselves. And let me lay those facts out. 
   The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, commonly known as the Genocide Convention, defines genocide as, among other things, ``the act of killing members of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group with the intent to destroy in whole or in part the targeted group.'' 
   Now, let's see if some of the statements by the leadership of the nation of Iran against the people of Israel qualify as calling upon the act of killing members of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group with the intent to destroy in whole or in part that group. 
   Also, the Genocide Convention bans the conspiracy or incitement to commit genocide and states that violators shall be punished ``whether constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals.'' 
   133 member states of the U.N. have ratified the Genocide Convention, including Iran. 
   Article II, section 4 of the U.N. charter, also to which Iran has agreed, requires all member states of the United Nations ``to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.'' 
   Now, let's get to the facts because that's what the U.N. requires, that's what the treaty requires, that's what the Genocide Convention requires, that's what the U.N. charter requires. 
   Well, let's start with October 26, 2005. Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called for Israel to be ``wiped off the map,'' and described Israel as a ``disgraceful blot on the face of the Islamic world,'' and declared that ``anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic nation's fury.'' 
   12 December 2006, that same leader, Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, addressed a Holocaust Denial Conference in Tehran and said that Israel would ``soon be wiped out.'' 
   15 December 2000, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i stated that ``Iran's stance has always been clear on this ugly phenomenon'' referring to Israel as the ugly phenomenon. He went on to say, ``We have repeatedly said that this cancerous tumor of a state should be removed from the region.'' 
   Iran, as we know, has aggressively pursued a clandestine effort to arm itself with nuclear weapons. Iran funds, trains and supports terrorist groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah, which have murdered Americans, Israelis and non-Israeli Jews, and seeks to destroy Israel. 
   14 December 2001, the President of Iran's Expediency Council and former leader of Iran, Ali Rafsanjani, threatened Israel with nuclear destruction saying, and I quote, ``if one day the Islamic world is also equipped with weapons like those that Israel now possesses, then the imperialist strategy will reach a standstill because the use of even one nuclear bomb inside Israel will destroy everything, while it will merely harm the Islamic world.''  
   Men and women, these are comments made by the leaders of a sovereign nation that is in a headlong pursuit to obtain nuclear weapons, and has, by international consensus, already obtained missile technology that could deliver such weapons within the theater of the Middle East. 
   History teaches no truth more clearly than this: nations should take tyrants at their word. For the United States of America to fail to call on the institution of the United Nations to take the tyrants in Iran at their word would be a grievous historical error and one for which future generations of Americans like those injured soldiers that I toured through the Capitol earlier this afternoon will likely have to pay. 
   This resolution, authored by Mr. Rothman from New Jersey and Mr. Kirk from Illinois, strongly condemns Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's offensive remarks, contemptible statements, and reprehensible policies directed at the destruction of Israel; calls on the United Nation's Security Council to take up charges against Ahmadinejad for violating the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and article II, section 4 of the United Nations charter. 
   It also calls on the Security Council and all member states of the United Nations to consider stronger measures to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, which would both be in violation of nuclear non-proliferation treaties and give them the potential to eliminate Israel. 
   And it reaffirms, of course, the unwavering strategic partnership and close friendship between the United States and Israel, and reasserts the steadfast commitment of the United States to defend the right of Israel to exist as a free and democratic and Jewish state. 
   The time for this resolution has come. I commend the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman) for his bold leadership, and I pledge my strong support and urge all of my colleagues to make this strong and deafening statement that this Congress and this Nation will take tyrants at their word, and we will call on the United Nations today to live up to their charter.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman and my good friend from Florida for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are come to this floor today, it seems to me, in an important moment in the life of two nations. We are come to this floor at a time when our colleagues in the other body are debating a Defense authorization bill and will be considering amendments about a new course in Iraq. 
   So I do not question the decision of the majority in this chamber to consider these same issues, particularly in light of the release of the initial benchmark assessment report by our military and diplomatic leadership in Iraq. It is a report, I must confess, Mr. Speaker, that is to me frustrating, as it is, I think, to Members on both sides of this aisle. Of 18 benchmarks included in the interim report to Congress, progress on eight of the benchmarks has been characterized as satisfactory, but progress on another eight are unsatisfactory, with it being too early to tell on another two. 
   Two months from now, the Crocker-Petraeus report that Congress has been promised will provide, we believe, a broader assessment. But, frankly, I am struggling, as a strong supporter of our effort in Iraq, with the failure of this Iraqi Government to step forward with progress toward enacting legislation on de-Ba'athification reform, hydrocarbon resources reform, and the scheduling of and planning of provincial elections. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to be transparent about that frustration as much as I was when I met with Iraqi cabinet officials just a short 2 months ago. The Iraqi Government must do more. If there is any unintended benefit of this debate today, my hope is that some of this debate with that message would echo to those people. 
   But that being said, I will oppose this measure, Mr. Speaker, because I truly believe that defeat and an American failure in Iraq is not an option that we can consider. 
   With great respect to my colleagues who would endorse this proposal for a precipitous American withdrawal from Iraq by April 1 of next year, I truly believe that, before we make any decision adjusting our strategy on the ground, we ought to wait to hear from those Americans on the ground in Iraq who have been charged with implementing the strategy the President put into effect in January. 
   I want to reiterate, and I think I speak for many Republicans, Mr. Speaker, as the President said in January, our commitment to this Iraqi Government is not open-ended. But my commitment to an American and Iraqi success is deep and heartfelt. Whether this Iraqi Government can rise to that challenge or not, as the gentleman from Indiana in the other body said, we must find a way to forge agreement to achieve success in Iraq. 
   The good news of the assessment that has come before the Congress is that we have been achieving some progress as a result of the President's surge strategy on the ground. Between May and June, 26 high-level al Qaeda leaders have been killed or captured. 
   I know there are some, even the gentleman who just spoke, who questioned whether we are fighting al Qaeda in Iraq. Our soldiers don't question that. Eleven of those al Qaeda leaders killed or captured were emirs, local al Qaeda leaders; seven were facilitators who smuggled foreign weapons; and five were cell leaders who commanded terrorist units. 
   U.S. operations in the last 2 months, according to the reports released this week, have also uncovered an al Qaeda media network in a nondescript facility outside Samarra. U.S. forces also, I am happy to report, received 23,000 tips during this period of time, which is four to five times the number of tips we were receiving last year. 
   But, again, that goes against the backdrop of disappointing news. While the American soldier performs with courage and effectiveness, the Iraqi government still fails to demonstrate the urgency. 
   So as I struggle, I would just ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who share my concerns about the lack of progress in Iraq, as to this solution you bring to the floor, how will your plan for a unilateral withdrawal keep American soldiers safe? 
   We have 160,000 soldiers there now. The majority of this Congress would call for them to exit Iraq by April 1. Well, in effect it would take 3,000 large convoys, according to some press reports, to evacuate the country down the one road out through Basra and into Kuwait. 
   Also I would ask, how would this plan for unilateral withdrawal decrease the number of terrorist safe havens in that country? And since al Qaeda is clearly in Iraq, how would the plan for unilateral withdrawal succeed in fighting al Qaeda in Iraq? 
   Lastly, I say as the ranking member of the Middle East Subcommittee, how will a withdrawal, a precipitous, reckless, irresponsible withdrawal, make the Middle East safer and more stable? 
   I fear if we lose Iraq, we will lose Israel. We must come together as a Nation to find a way forward to succeed in Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (TOURING IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, on February 28 through March 4, just this past weekend, I participated in a bipartisan congressional delegation to Iraq and Afghanistan. I have written about this extensively on my Web blog, which my constituents should know is located at MikePence.house.gov. But I wanted to excerpt portions today by way of reporting back to the House on our findings in these two countries in which American forces face a war every day. 
   It was a bipartisan congressional delegation, Mr. Speaker, to both Iraq and Afghanistan. In 4 days we took off and landed 20 different times in four different aircraft. We flew to Kuwait in a military jet. We flew into Iraq on a cargo plane. We flew around Iraq and Afghanistan in helicopters and Ospreys. We convoyed in military vehicles throughout both countries. It was a rare opportunity to meet with leaders and locals in both theaters of combat. I am personally grateful to the people of Indiana and our military for making it possible. 
   Our visit also took place against the backdrop of several major events. The Iraq Government announced that Ali Hassan al-Majid, better known as ``Chemical Ali,'' a brutal military henchman of Saddam Hussein, was to be executed later this month. We arrived in the Kurdish region as that news was breaking and as Turkish forces were announcing their withdrawal for military operations in the north. 
   And on the second day, our trip to Iraq coincided with the first official visit by a President of Iran to Iraq since 1952. It was a time of great significance for the people of Iraq in several respects. 
   During our time in Iraq and Afghanistan, one inescapable conclusion emerged. After years of difficulty and setbacks in varying degrees, freedom is making progress in Iraq and Afghanistan. In northern Iraq, known as the Kurdish region, there is security, political process, and economic growth. 
   And even in central Iraq, after years of insurgent violence, following the military surge, al Qaeda and the insurgency are in steep decline and political progress is beginning to take hold. 
   As I saw firsthand in Baghdad and in the al Anbar province, the military surge and Sunni cooperation have resulted in extraordinary progress and security. But those gains are fragile. Violence in Iraq has declined by more than 60 percent since the beginning of the surge and has remained at relatively low levels since November of last year. The Iraqi Parliament has passed legislation that makes further political progress possible. 
   Our visit was, Mr. Speaker, characterized by cautious optimism by American military leaders and ordinary Iraqis on the street. 
   Afghanistan was also equally encouraging; and with President Hamid Karzai, we saw the determination of a leader devoted to his people and to defeating a resurgent Taliban effort to overturn their progress with terrorist violence this spring.     
   In the Kunar province particularly, we convoyed out and witnessed really the greatest threat to the Taliban terrorists who operate on that border with Pakistan, a bridge. A bridge is being built by local Afghanis with American resources. Seeing locals waving at our convoy, greeting laborers at this remote construction site showed me the depth of American generosity and the resilience of this proud people. 
   My summary on my Web site is simply an effort on my part to report point by point, moment by moment on my trip. We speak about each of the days, from the Kurdish region to our time in Baghdad, to our time in Fallujah and our team even on the streets of Haditha, through Afghanistan and through a stop at Ramstein military base to meet with injured soldiers at Landstuhl Medical Center. 
   And again, Mr. Speaker, my Web site is mikepence.house.gov. And my constituents could access that by visiting my blog and gaining that information. I would be grateful for any constituent who availed themselves of our writing. 
   The message that we got from Iraq is clear. The surge is working, but the battle is far from over. Violence is down significantly in the past year. The enemy's abilities have been downgraded in both degree and type of attack. U.S. forces have made measurable progress against terrorist elements in Baghdad and al Anbar province, due to both the military surge and extraordinary expanded cooperation among the civilian population. 
   And while the military surge is working, the good news is the Iraqi Parliament seems to have gone to work too. The adoption of a budget, the passage of a law permitting Ba'ath party members to work for the government and the plan for provincial elections that may well occur by October of this year represent exactly the kind of progress that many in our diplomatic team and many in this Chamber have hoped to see. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the courtesy, especially at the opening of this time on the House floor. 
   I would be grateful if any of my constituents went to mikepence.house.gov, visited our blog and availed themselves of our firsthand account of what we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The progress is real. The progress of freedom is happening. It is fragile. And it is my hope that, by bringing back the information from this bipartisan delegation, that we will be able to find that bipartisan consensus necessary to see freedom win in Afghanistan and Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding. I also want to thank him for his extraordinary and compassionate and principled and eloquent advocacy of life. The people of Arizona who cherish life are extraordinarily well served by Mr. Franks. 
   I come to this well having enjoyed a day, Mr. Speaker, on the National Mall, where over 100,000 Americans by some estimates gathered in the bitter cold 35 years after a Supreme Court decision, and they gathered for one reason and one reason only, because those Americans cherish the sanctity of life and are unwilling to go quietly into that good night, which is an America that walks away from a belief that every life is sacred. 
   100,000 people. Not at the podium. Not with the television cameras on them, as some of us were. Not with the accolades of people in a movement who will write on the Internet or write editorials how they approve of our stand. But in the obscurity of a throng of tens of thousands, Americans came. In the dead of winter. It was extraordinary, Mr. Speaker, I must say, and it gives me great hope about this movement. 
   The sanctity of life is the central axiom of Western civilization. It is, I believe, our commitment to the unalienable right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness that split the atom of the American experiment and has created the freest and most prosperous and most powerful nation in the history of the world. It is because we embrace that ethic that we are endowed by our Creator with the unalienable right to life. And there, 35 years after Roe v. Wade, 100,000 Americans are still standing in the cold for that principle. 
   I rise tonight very humbled to hear the eloquence of my colleagues, but filled with hope after a hurried day in this movement, because I have seen the faces of the foot soldiers of the right to life. I have stood among a throng of young Americans, particularly young women under the age of 30, who are choosing life as never before. In the last 20 years, abortion has declined by more than 20 percent.     
   I believe, as you could see in those relationships today on the National Mall, it's not just because of political debate, but it's because of moral persuasion. In the last 35 years, I believe in the quiet counsels between mothers and daughters, between grandmothers and granddaughters, the truth about abortion is being told. 
   Life is winning in America. 
   I rise tonight simply, Mr. Speaker, to speak a little out of turn, and not just to your chair, but maybe to those that are looking in tonight and to say thank you for standing for life. Your efforts on behalf of the unborn are not in vain, and I do believe in our lifetime, if we will exercise the faith and perseverance and compassion and civility that was in evidence on the National Mall today, we will see Roe v. Wade collapse like the Berlin Wall. It will collapse finally and at last on that day when people on both sides of the debate don't want it there anymore.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American housing market is in turmoil and homeowners are anxious. And let me say from the heart I believe Congress is right to act decisively to cure what ails our housing markets. But with the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act, the cure may be worse than the disease. 
   H.R. 3221 increases the national debt by $800 billion, and it raises taxes on the very entities that we say we are trying to help, putting the money in the pockets of special interests and politically motivated groups. In a time of crushing national debt and rising deficits, we're considering a package that would give a blank check to the administration for bailing out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a time when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and regulators of those entities insist they're solvent and fiscally sound. 
   The most troubling part to me is that whatever we do for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we shouldn't be raising taxes on them. This legislation includes a 4.2 percent tax of basis points for each dollar of unpaid principal balance of total new business purchases. In plain language, CBO estimates that 4.2 basis points could equal a slush fund of $710 million for 2009, $9 billion over 10 years that could go to organizations like ACORN and the National Council of La Raza, which, in addition to being involved in legitimate pro-housing programs, are also unquestionably involved in political mobilization, voter turnout, registration, and the like. 
   Congress can do better than H.R. 3221 to quell the anxious housing markets that beset our Nation today.     
   The American people deserve a housing bill without corporate bailouts, without tax increases, without slush funds for politically motivated organizations. The American people deserve better than the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to this legislation.

   Mr. PENCE. Well, back in Indiana, Hoosier families are hurting. Pain at the pump is harming the vitality of our families, our family farms, and small businesses, and the time has come for Congress to act. 
   Madam Speaker, we've heard from many of our Democrat colleagues that the answer is to go deeper into our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I believe the answer is to go deeper into the reserves that are in the Outer Continental Shelf, in Alaska, and in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   The American people know the only way to lessen our dependence on foreign oil is to lessen our dependence on foreign oil by giving the American people more access to American oil. 
   I joined all my Indiana colleagues this past Monday at a press conference in Hoosier State urging you, Madam Speaker, to bring to this floor a vote on allowing American oil companies access to the Outer Continental Shelf. The President's lifted his executive ban. Now the only thing standing in between the American people and more access to American oil is one up-or-down vote on the floor of the Congress. 
   I urge you respectfully, Madam Speaker, bring the bill to the floor to allow the American people access to the reserves in this Outer Continental Shelf, and that bill will pass. If Congress is allowed to work its will, America will vote to drill.

<DOCNO>Mr. PENCE. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I rise in strong support of the Flake amendment because the American people need taxpayer protection more than we need beach protection. Now I understand this is important legislation that Congress is considering today. And I do not rise to trivialize this bill. It has its moorings in and its heritage in bipartisan foundations. I rise, rather, to say that the time has come for this Congress to get serious in large ways and in small ways about the epidemic of earmarking that has taken hold of the Federal budget process. 
   In fiscal year 2008, according to one estimate, legislation that passed in one catch-all omnibus bill included some 11,610 earmarks in all of those different appropriations bills in the course of the year costing taxpayers some $17.2 billion. It was the second highest number of earmarks any Congress has ever approved. It represented a 337 percent increase above fiscal year 2007. 
   What the Flake amendment says, in effect, is that none of the funds appropriated pursuant to this section may be used for a congressional earmark as defined by the House rules. Now, this is part and parcel of an effort by many of us that I believe, while it is being led by Republicans, I believe there are many in the other party who understand that earmarks is a cancer in the belly of the Federal budget. And we must address it. 
   The Flake amendment seizes this opportunity and this moment of this legislation that says that should the Beach Protection Act of 2007 be signed into law, that at no point in the future may it be used as a vehicle for earmarking. And as the author of this amendment has suggested, we have been assured in the past before that those things pertaining to homeland security, the Department of Homeland Security, would not become vehicles for earmarking, and they have. 
   And for my part, let me say this is not an issue that I am interested in demagoguing, Madam Chairman. For my part, through the course of my career up until very recently, I have requested earmarks and special projects for my district. But I must tell you, having negotiated when Republicans were in charge for earmark reform, having supported Democrat efforts for earmark reform, at the end of last year when I saw a catchall omnibus bill come to the floor of this Congress with hundreds of unexamined earmarks dropped in at the last minute in the dead of night that hadn't been subject to the scrutiny the American people demand, I knew it was time for a change. And so I had to tell the people of my district that I could no longer be a part of this flawed system. And I commend the gentleman from Arizona for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. 
   I want to challenge my colleagues to support the Flake amendment. But  let's just begin there. Let's support a moratorium on earmarking in this Congress. The American people know there is something fundamentally wrong with the way we spend the people's money, especially when it comes to earmarks. 
   Frankly, I used an analogy not long ago, Madam Chairman, of an airplane. When you're flying an airplane through the air, and the meters on the control panel tell you that something is wrong with the engine, the first thing you do is put the plane on the ground and get the hood open and find out what is wrong. Well, many of us who are advocating an earmark moratorium believe the time has come for us to put the plane on the ground in a bipartisan way, embrace an earmark moratorium and reform this system in the way that Congressmen Frank Wolf and Jack Kingston have suggested in their commission format. 
   And let me say, as I close in strong support of the Flake amendment, that there is enough blame to go around on this earmarking business. I recognize earmarking came of age under Republican control of the Congress. And I am not rising here to point fingers. I am, however, rising to say that we need to change the way we spend the people's money. The only way we will do that is by embracing the bold leadership that Congressman Jeff Flake has brought to this Congress in connection with the Beach Protection Act, but it also means embracing a moratorium and coming together, Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and saying we are going to push away from the table, and we are going to bring fundamental earmark reform to the American people. And that's my hope. 
   And I urge support for the amendment as a first step in that direction. 
   I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, our financial markets are in turmoil. The administration was right to call for decisive action to prevent further harm to our economy, but nationalizing every bad mortgage in America is not the answer. 
   This administration's request of this Congress amounts to the largest corporate bailout in American history. I believe Congress should act, but we should act in a way that protects the integrity of our free market and protects the American taxpayer from more debt and higher taxes. 
   The strength of America resides in our faith in God and our faith in freedom, including our economic freedom. To have the freedom to succeed, we must also have the freedom to fail, and any solution to the present crisis must preserve that essential economic liberty. 
   The next Congress should also consider all available options to put our Nation's economy back on its feet. There are no easy answers, but there are alternatives that this Congress can consider. Indexing capital gains to inflation, passing a real energy bill, even regulating the credit default market, as the chief of the SEC requested yesterday, these and other alternatives to a massive Federal bailout must be fully considered and debated before Congress acts. 
   We must address this crisis with forethought and creativity rather than massive Federal resources.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to the Lowey amendment, although I do want to express my appreciation to Chairman Lowey for preserving, as she indicated, the 15 different restrictions that are in this bill on the use of American taxpayer dollars overseas to directly fund abortion. 
   But I want to say respectfully to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, come on. Legislation that disallows contributions to fund abortions in family-planning organizations around the globe ought to also disallow in-kind contributions to those same organizations. 
   Money is fungible. We know that. Organizations that receive commodities can take the r esources that they would have used to purchase those commodities and use it to promote abortion. We all know. We are adults in this room. We all know that we are seeing here a concerted, sincere, and I would like to say respectfully creative legislative effort to undermine a policy known as the Mexico City policy that I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know is broadly supported by the American people. 
   Whatever the view is on abortion in this country, the American people don't want to s ee their taxpayer dollars used to fund abortions at home or abroad. They don't want to see their taxpayer dollars used through the foreign aid program to fund organizations that promote abortion as a means of family planning. And the possibility of making tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars available to organizations that promote abortion around the globe, making it available in the form of commodities is still making resources available to organizations that promote abortion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Stupak-Smith amendment. This amendment very simply ensures that our taxpayer Foreign Operation funds will not be used to support abortion overseas. The Mexico City Policy, which was first instituted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, simply states that any U.S. funding for family planning cannot be used to promote abortions as a suitable option in family planning. 
   As divisive as this issue is among many Americans, this issue is a consensus issue. The American people know whatever your view of abortion, whether it is morally right or morally acceptable, most Americans agree that it is morally wrong to take the taxpayer dollars of millions of Americans who cherish the sanctity of human life and use it to fund and to underwrite organizations that promote abortion overseas.  
   It is precisely for that reason that I rise today in strong support of this thoughtful amendment and urge my colleagues to preserve the Mexico City Policy and vote ``aye'' on the Stupak-Smith amendment.

   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for bringing this creative amendment to the floor. 
   While I address the Chair, let me also acknowledge there may be others looking in. I want to be very clear on the point that what we are asking here is for this foreign operations budget to get by on only a 9 percent increase instead of a 9.5 percent increase. 
   Back in Indiana, we just call this a haircut. But it is a haircut, as the gentlelady from Colorado said, that is a reduction of the increase. 
   As I listened to the distinguished majority leader, who I enjoy and admire more than anyone else in this Chamber, he said if the shoe fits, wear it. 
   I understand the frustration of looking across the aisle and seeing many of my colleagues in my party who voted for an awful lot of government programs over the last 6 years complaining about government spending, but then there is another saying that says if it does not fit, you must acquit. 
   I would offer that for many of us asking for this very small haircut tonight, it does not fit us. We fought these budget increases. We fought the creation of new entitlements. Now we are coming before this majority in a spirit of collegiality and asking might we not do with $171 million less. Might we not do with just, instead of a 9.5 percent increase, how about a 9 percent increase.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, the legislation before us today includes in various ways tens of millions of dollars that would be directed to advancing U.S. interests in areas known as the West Bank and Gaza. 
   Given the recent violent and tragic events in the Palestinian territories and the strong commitment of this body to prevent taxpayer funding from reaching the hands of terrorists, I offer an amendment that reinforces previous prohibitions on funding Palestinian terrorist organizations and offer it for my colleagues' consideration on both sides of the aisle. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply states: ``None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to provide direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, except as otherwise provided by existing law.'' 
   So what is existing law? The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 was amended by the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act last year, in 2006. It was signed into law in December. It states that, ``No ministry, agency or instrumentality of the Palestinian Authority effectively controlled by Hamas'' would be eligible for funding unless it meets the basic preconditions of civil society, namely, recognition of Israel and the renunciation of violence. 
   The purpose of this amendment today is to clarify that assistance may be provided to the Fattah elements of the PA government, assuming such elements are not engaged in the terrorism or compromise by the terrorism of Hamas. Concern about the application of this provision may have led the distinguished subcommittee chairman, Mrs. Lowey, to put a hold and request information from Secretary Rice about her intent to release funding to the PA. 
   Now, these safeguards and other relevant laws are critical because they prohibit assistance to terrorists, including to a Hamas-controlled Palestinian Authority, but they permit assistance to a PA government that is in  compliance with the principles of recognition of Israel, previous peace agreements, and a renunciation of violence. 
   Why is it necessary? Well, because, given the systematic instability, we simply don't know what shape the Palestinian government will take in the coming months. Large portions of the Palestinian territories are in virtual anarchy at this moment. Even worse, Gaza is completely dominated by Hamas, a universally recognized terrorist organization. We cannot permit one red cent of U.S. dollars to find its way to Hamas. 
   After lengthy discussions with the Department of State, including Secretary of State Rice herself, I would like my colleagues to know that this amendment is not opposed by the State Department. In fact, I had a warm and candid conversation today with the Secretary of State, and I told her then that it is critical that we clarify that the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 is still the law of the land and reiterate its intent, namely, to deny funding to terrorist entities within the Palestinian leadership. 
   Mr. Chairman, we cannot permit any ambiguity to exist on this subject. This body should be on the record today, as we have before, that no American tax dollars can be delivered to any authority within the Palestinian territories that is compromised or even tainted by Hamas or other terrorist interests. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Let me thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for her support of this amendment. Let me also say to the gentlewoman that I intend to support the underlying legislation and appreciate her strong work in support of Israel.     
   The reason for bringing this bill, to answer the gentlelady's question, Mr. Chairman, is very simple. In recent days, the State Department has indicated its intent to ``lift restrictions on aid to Palestinians.'' And the Pence amendment today will simply say that any aid that would go to the Palestinian Authority must, with an exclamation point, only go to the Palestinian Authority under current restrictions in current law. That is my sincere intent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, after waiting for months, the new Democrat majority has introduced their plan for Iraq today, and it can be summed up with one phrase, fully funded withdrawal. 
   Seeking to micromanage the war, the Democrats have come up with a plan that attaches strings to troop funding in order to seek American withdrawal from Iraq by 2008. This Democrat plan for a fully funded withdrawal could also be described as a well-equipped retreat. A fully funded withdrawal might well be added to that classic list of American oxymorons that includes plastic glass and jumbo shrimp. 
   Since their election pledge to ``fix the war,'' it has taken our friends on the other side of the aisle 4 months to come up with a strategy in Iraq. But even though their proposal does include funding for our soldiers in the field and our veterans here at home, their latest poll-tested approach for fighting the war in Iraq can best be described as cut and run. 
   For all the Democrats' furtive back-room efforts and tortured explanations, it is not nearly as complex as they describe. In fact, their strategy could be described by George Orwell: ``The quickest way to end the war is to lose it.'' 
   We don't need a fully funded withdrawal. We need to fully fund victory for freedom in Iraq.
