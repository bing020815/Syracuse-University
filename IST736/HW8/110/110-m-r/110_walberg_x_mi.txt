<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (PUT ALL ENERGY OPTIONS ON THE TABLE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, earlier this week I had the opportunity to meet with patients at the Jackson Dialysis Center in Jackson, Michigan, and discuss transportation issues. I heard from patient after patient about how high gas prices are negatively affecting their lives and their health. 
   I also visited the American Red Cross branch in Jackson and learned that service volunteers, men and women who help fire and accident victims, are now using their own money to pay for gasoline because the Red Cross cannot afford to reimburse. 
   I heard about situations in my district and across the Nation like this, yet Congress continues to do nothing. High gas prices demand action from Congress and we need to put all energy options on the table. Just as with the Manhattan Project and the race to the Moon, breaking our dependence on foreign oil should be a national priority. Americans are being stretched to the max, and it is time their elected representatives act on their behalf. 
   I urge my colleagues to sign on to my discharge petition to bring the No More Excuses Energy Act to a vote. So I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Madam Speaker, let's join together and vote to immediately increase American energy production, bring down the price of gas and make American energy independent.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (ENERGY SOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, on Monday I had the opportunity to pump gas for some of my constituents in Battle Creek, Michigan. Experiences like these allow me to truly get a sense of what the good people of my district think about energy solutions. 
   The constituents I spoke with all wanted to know what Congress is doing to lower gas prices. Almost all of them want to see Congress work on an all-of-the-above energy policy. 
   High gas prices demand action. We need to put all energy options on the table: more drilling, more alternatives, more conservation. This Congress needs to get serious and work on a comprehensive plan that includes all of the above and ends our dependence on Middle East oil. 
   Sadly, House leadership refuses to allow any votes increasing American energy production. Last Friday, the Washington Post chided House leadership for stifling floor debate on offshore drilling. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time to engage in a forthright debate that gives the American people a chance to have their voices heard and, most importantly, solves America's energy crisis, ending our dependence on Middle East oil. Let's get it done.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. I thank the gentleman from California, and I thank him for his good words and bringing us really to perspective what is going on here. 
   I wish I could have joined you on the trip to ANWR as well as to Golden, Colorado and seen what you saw up close and personal. But, frankly, I felt it was more important at that time to look for the pictures you would bring back and hear the testimony that you and other good colleagues and friends of mine would bring back, but for me personally to stay back in Michigan, a State that at present is a one-State recession, that has the highest unemployment rate in the Nation, sadly, that was at one time the greatest manufacturing State, and, more importantly, was the motor capital not only of the United States but of the world, a place called Detroit, Motown, Motor City, all of the above, that established the pattern for what transportation was all about and, I contend, still is; and yet is frustrated by a government system, both in the State and here, with the leadership in Congress, Madam Speaker, that will not do what is necessary to allow us to continue to not only keep our faith to our people, not only keep our position as the greatest Nation on this earth in every area, including transportation, but rather at this point in time is willing to say that the process of saving this planet as our Speaker intends to do involves a Democrat energy plan which was stated very clearly. 
   And I bring this with some comedy as we look at the picture, and yet it is a stark, painful reality that this plan will not work. And that plan is what? Drive small cars and wait for the wind. If we do that, as the title of an old movie said, it will be Gone With the Wind. 
   We need to do something, Madam Speaker, now for the people of this great country, for my great State of Michigan, and all of those concerned to produce energy that deals with the reality of what this country needs. 
   I am tired of living in a State right now where our Governor says with great pride that she rides her bicycle to work to the State capitol from her Governor's residence every day with her escort of security people following her on their bicycles as well. The motor capital of the world with a Governor riding a bicycle. Now if that was for conservation purposes, fine, I support that. For purposes of austerity, I support that. But promoting this because of necessity? I can't accept that. 
   This morning I sat on the floor of the House and I looked up. And I looked up to the highest point of this Chamber directly above the Speaker's rostrum, Madam Speaker, and I see engraved there in a stone-carved monument to us this statement. It is a statement by Daniel Webster, and I read from the paper because I can see it better in front of me right now. But Daniel Webster said this many, many years ago: Let us develop the resources of our land. 
   How up-to-date is that? Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also in our day, in our generation, fellow colleagues, freshmen, Republicans, standing here for the defense of our great country, Daniel Webster said, and see whether we also in our day and our generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered. 
   I submit to you that that is what we are doing, standing here tonight. 
   Under an adjournment resolution that will take place sometime in the next 24, 48 hours, sending us home, most likely as it appears without doing anything to give an opportunity for my Governor to get in her flex fuel hybrid Tahoe again, if she determines so, to go to her residence. 
   Well, we can jest about that. I could talk about a lot of statistics. But tonight, while you were in ANWR, I had the privilege of, on five occasions in my district, South Central Michigan, going to various gas stations and pumping gas into constituents' vehicles as they would allow me. I would simply say, ``Hi, I'm Congressman Tim Walberg. If you will share with me your ideas and concerns on energy and the price at the pump, I would be glad to pump your gas while you tell me your stories.'' I came away with plenty of stories. I came away with plenty of pictures. 
   Just Monday afternoon in Battle Creek, Michigan, a mother, single parent, one child, came to the pump with a small mini van. She left it running. And when I questioned her about that, she says, ``I'm afraid it won't start if I turn it off.'' She said, ``I'd be glad to talk to you.'' And I said, ``How much do you want me to fill it?'' And she said, ``$11.'' That's just a little over 2 gallons. 
   She began to tell me her story of how she is working two jobs, and the gas that she was putting into her vehicle that day would get her through 2 days of work and her transportation to each of those jobs and back. Those are stories that talk of reality. 
   Another story that I wrote down came from a lady who said, ``Because I'm a truck driver and the high price of fuel has damaged the economy so badly, my employer started limiting the miles given to older, higher paid drivers such as myself. My income last year dropped a full 30 percent. Then I was injured on the job and denied workers' comp. I finally began receiving my disability payments after 4 months. During those 4 months, however, I was scraping up every cent available to pay for LP gas to heat my trailer home. Because I spent every available cent on heating fuel, food, and electricity, I could not pay the taxes on my paid-for home. I am now in default, and my home will be forfeited in October for back taxes.'' 
   This is reality that we are talking about here. It is not simply price at the  pump; it is lifestyle, it is living conditions. It is keeping a home that is paid for. 
   ``I can't afford a cheaper vehicle,'' she said. ``I can't afford to repair the one vehicle here that would get a few more miles per gallon than the old F-150. I'm a careful shopper, but the rising price of groceries is also directly related to the energy crisis.'' 
   Let me read one last story that was told to me. This was by a wife from Jackson, Michigan whose husband was in sales, which ultimately diminished and ultimately was lost because of the fuel prices. 
   She makes a number of points, but in the last point she says, ``At approximately $175 per week in gas costs, we can no longer afford to send our children to Catholic school. That was a choice, yes, but a choice made specifically for our children's interests. They cannot go to camp, they cannot have the braces which they need. The money I would have put aside for college is now being spent on gas. We cannot tithe to our church, nor can we donate to the myriad of other charities we routinely helped. Every decision is weighed based upon''--and get this again. ``Every decision is weighed based upon the extreme cost of leaving the driveway.'' 
   Now those are life stories. Those are stories that make an impact upon me as a congressman representing South Central Michigan, the Seventh District of Michigan. 
   These are stories that go way beyond the political partisan haggling that goes on here, that goes beyond even making jokes about a plan that will not work, cannot work, and isn't going to be allowed to work to drive small cars and wait for the wind. 
   Daniel Webster said this, again: ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.''     
   I submit to you, my colleagues tonight and, Madam Speaker, that that is what we are attempting to do here and now; not to produce something that we will be remembered about, but something worthy to be remembered, that we fought for, this great country, the resources that allowed us to be blessed, that allowed us to expand our capabilities and allowed us to bless other nations all over this globe because we used our resources, we built up our land and powers, and we have done something worthy to be remembered. 
   I thank you for the opportunity. I look forward to sharing in the banter back and forth about reality tonight. But I think that would be beyond the facts and figures that I could put forth, probably the most important thing I can start with tonight, and I yield back my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. If the gentleman would yield, I'd love to hop on that point there. 
   We talk about those that we pay, and in some cases, even prop up their economy such as Venezuela with Hugo Chavez, who is a dictator who has said that he wants America to be defeated and off the face of the Earth as it were. But we send a check to him of $170 million per day that props up his failing regime, that allows him to continue, and we pay this to an enemy. 
   I would also submit to you, as I mentioned earlier, as I come from the former motor capital of the world, we have a Volt vehicle that GM is producing that has the ability to run 40 miles, whether standing in traffic, in a traffic jam, or going 40 miles straight on electric power. Most people in their commute would allow them to purchase that Volt vehicle and never have to use the gas portion of the propulsion. 
   Now, keeping that in mind, we're talking about drilling and we need to drill, but we're also talking about our plan, all-of-the-above, which includes nuclear power, wind power, solar power. I submit to you that, if we have an electric vehicle like that, it won't be any good if we don't do some of the infrastructure. 
   We need nuclear power to produce that electricity. We need an infrastructure to get it to the box where they have to plug in to recharge. Now, that would allow us the opportunity to expand. 
   And the gentleman from Nevada, you bring up a good point about those that offer alternatives. We have, at present, the founder of Greenpeace on our side about alternative fuels and the specific nature of nuclear power who says nuclear power is the greenest energy that we can have and we ought to be producing more nuclear power, we ought to be putting nuclear plants up. 
   So with drilling, with nuclear power, with wind, with solar, with all of the above, natural gas and others, we can make this country independent from any other country on this Earth and put ourselves back in a competitive position that not only allows us to continue our lifestyle and expand it the world around, but also make ourselves secure.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (VETERANS APPROPRIATIONS BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, as I travel throughout my south-central Michigan district, I have learned over the past few months in town hall meetings, small group meetings, or coffees, that virtually all Americans believe we owe a great debt of gratitude to those who have worn the uniform in service to our country. 
   Unfortunately, Democrat leadership in both Chambers appears willing to make the veterans appropriations bill, which funds our Nation's veterans health care, become part of political gamesmanship in Washington. 
   It appears Democrats may withhold sending this bipartisan veterans funding bill to the President in an effort to ensure greater spending levels for their pet projects. There is a chance Democrats will hold off on final passage of this legislation so they can include it in a massive budget-busting spending bill at the end of the year. 
   Let me be very clear. The funding of veterans should not be a political issue. Congress should swiftly pass this important legislation, and Republicans and Democrats should jointly celebrate when it becomes law.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (OPPOSITION TO H.R. 800 -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, it is clearly and cleverly entitled the ``Employee Free Choice Act,'' but we are about to consider a bill that strips away the very tool that protects the sanctity of a free and open society, the private ballot. 
   Private ballots ensure workers have elections without fraudulent interference, coercion, or intimidation. Confidence will be lost with a system that forces workers to publicly declare their intentions. The AFL-CIO recognized this hypocrisy by expressing support for secret ballots when workers are presented the opportunity to decertify a union. They have argued that private ballot elections ``provide the surest means for avoiding decisions which are the result of group pressures and not individual decisions.'' 
   As a former union steelworker, I believe in the merits of unionization, when appropriate. I also believe that every American worker should have the right to choose freely and privately. Congress has a duty to defeat legislation that strips workers of this important right, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 800.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Ohio for putting up this amendment. It's a very simple amendment that I think does well for us to consider in context with what we have to wrestle with, the consideration coming from the largest tax  increase in the history of the United States being offered, $400 billion on the taxpayers. And I take it into context as I looked here with this amendment offering a $1.3 billion cut in spending, going back to last year's levels, and saying let's live within our means. 
   I come from a Great Lakes State. When we talk about water, I do know about water. I know the impact that it can have, the impact upon all of our way of life. 
   But I also come from a State that's struggling at this point in time with economic conditions that comes from too large government, too much spending, too much taxation. And in the process of trying to deal with that, going the opposite direction of where they should, they're still frustrating what's going on and producing unemployment rates that rival any in history, and frustrating Michigan from having the same type of impact that we see just last week talked about in the New York Times of a 40-State growth rate that goes on with States that not only, because of tax cuts and spending within their means, have seen the ability not only to increase some of their services, set aside rainy day funds, but also talk about further tax cuts. That's what we need to be doing here; not considering spending more in a time in our history when we ought to be considering what comes with the future. 
   If we see a $400 billion tax increase go in place, we see a tax that goes on for working, a tax that goes on if you get married, a tax that goes on if you have a child, a tax that will go on, even if you die. Those are issues of great concern. 
   And so to be fiscally responsible here and use an amendment that simply takes us back to a reasonable standard of expenditures, puts us in a place that we can afford and fund to do the necessary services, we do ourself well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, time is running out to send our troops the funds and resources they need to continue their critical mission in Iraq. 
   The new congressional majority ensured the veto the President promised by submitting a supplemental loaded with pork and a timeline for retreat on our commanders in the field. Now it's time to pass a clean supplemental. 
   The National Intelligence Estimate released in January warned of the perils of an early troop withdrawal, stating: ``If coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq.'' 
   Many on the other side of the aisle urge Congress to heed the words in this document; yet they stare blindly at it as they force a strategy of retreat and defeat. This leads me to believe that the new congressional majority would rather use our troops to make a political statement than work in bipartisan fashion to give our brave men and women in uniform the funding they need. 
   It's time we vote on a clean supplemental and give the troops the support they deserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 6, which will raise the prices at the pumps, discourage domestic energy production, hurt America's working families, and encourage America's dependence on foreign energy. 
   I'm reminded of the family down the road from me back home in Michigan. They are a family with four kids, both their parents work and are struggling to get by; and if this legislation becomes law every time they fill up their gas tank or heat their house it will be an even greater burden on this family. 
   I've always said my number one priority while I'm in Congress is to protect the American taxpayer, that's a promise I made and that's a promise that I'll keep. Never voting for a tax increase is the same promise I made and kept during my 16 years in the Michigan House. 
   This is the first tax increase vote in 13 years and it didn't take the new majority more than 2 weeks to bring it to the floor to punish the American worker. 
   This legislation doesn't just force taxpayers to throw more money to the government, it also has our government tearing up already negotiated private contracts with the government at the same time we're trying to convince Russia, Venezuela and other countries to abide by the rule of law and respect its citizen's property rights. 
   Bottom line, this bill will increase our reliance on foreign oil, decrease our competitiveness and raise the prices at the pumps and the energy bills of working families. I urge my colleagues to vote no on increasing our dependence on foreign oil and yes on lower taxes, less regulation and respect to the rule of law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, this Sunday, when Tony Dungy takes the field as head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, he, along with Chicago Bears head coach Lovie Smith, will become the first African-Americans to coach a football team in the Super Bowl, the National Football League's championship game. 
   This is just one accomplishment in the extraordinary life of this native son of Michigan's 7th Congressional District. 
   Born October 6, 1955, in Jackson, Michigan, Anthony Kevin ``Tony'' Dungy lives his life in a way that truly embodies all the best about south central Michigan. 
   Dungy attended Parkside High School in Jackson, excelling on the football field, basketball court and in the classroom. 
   Tony next starred as the quarterback of the University of Minnesota football team from 1973-76. By the time his collegiate career ended, Dungy finished as the school's all-time leader in attempts, completions, touchdown passes and passing yardage. 
   Dungy played an integral role in the Pittsburgh Steelers' Super Bowl winning season of 1978, when he led the team in interceptions. 
   Following his successful playing career, Dungy spent time as a collegiate and professional assistant coach, before being named head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1995. 
   In 2002, the Indianapolis Colts franchise named Tony Dungy its head coach, and this season is Dungy's fifth in Indianapolis and his 11th as an NFL head coach. 
   Dungy is the first NFL head coach to defeat all 32 NFL teams and became the 35th coach in NFL history to earn 100 career victories in 2005. Dungy also is one of six coaches to win 100 or more regular-season games in his 10 years as a head coach. 
   During the past four seasons, Dungy's Colts have won four AFC South Division championships and compiled the best winning percentage in the NFL. 
   As remarkable as Dungy's career on the field has been, he is perhaps best known for his unique contributions off of it. 
   Dungy and his wife Lauren, proud parents of five, have been involved with multiple organizations in the communities he has coached in, including Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Athletes in Action, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Boys and Girls Club, Basket of Hope and the Prison Crusade Ministry. 
   Through his example of faith and family, Dungy has impacted thousands of men and women of all ages across our great country. 
   On behalf of Michigan's 7th District, I would like to extend congratulations to Coach Dungy, a native son, for his outstanding accomplishments this season and wish both he and his family happiness in the years to come.

   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be part of a broad, bipartisan coalition that is working to implement a strategy for the restoration, protection, and sustainable use of the Great Lakes. 
   In addition to supporting a comprehensive bill that would help stop sewage contamination, prevent invasive species introductions, and restore wetlands in the Great Lakes, I am also supporting H.R. 553, the Great Lakes Asian Carp Barrier Act. 
   Asian carp consume large amounts of food and compete with native fish for habitat throughout the Great Lakes region. Our Great Lakes would suffer irreparable harm if the Asian carp enters Lake Michigan. 
   With other aquatic invasive species already wreaking havoc on our waters, the threat posed by Asian carp is not one Michiganders can afford to overlook. 
   We must act now and construct barriers to protect native fish and wildlife from these large, nonnative predatory fish. It is time for Congress to invest in restoring the Great Lakes, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill vital to maintaining these aquatic treasures essential to both Michigan and the entire Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (FOURTH QUARTERLY REPORT OF THE FRESHMEN REPUBLICANS -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Thank you, Congressman McCarthy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I guess I would express my desires to have Mr. McCarthy campaign for me next time with those type of words. 
   And you read them very well, just as I wrote them for you. 
   It is, indeed, a privilege to be with Members of Congress, in this case 13. We call ourselves the Lucky 13. But we are 13 with ideas, 13 Members who came to Congress, the only freshmen Republicans to come from across the Nation, and every one of us came with conservative principles that said we believe America can do it better. We believe that individual Americans, as we have discussed already, have ideas and abilities that if allowed to be generated and to be creative, they can succeed. We represent them, and what a privilege it is for me personally to represent the good people of the Seventh District of Michigan, a State that is going through very, very difficult times right now because of the lack of leadership, the lack of understanding that when you take more of the resources, more of the liberty away from individual citizens, you frustrate not only the economy which Michigan is suffering through right now, extremely, but you also take away the creative juices that expand the ability and opportunity to do the things that were defined in our Declaration of Independence, promoting life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness or property. 
   That is something that I believe this freshman class of Republicans want to return to, the American solutions from American people committed to doing the best for themselves, their families, and the future of America's wealth. 
   I am interested, as you might expect, my friend from California, I am interested in a key issue to Michigan, known as the Motor Capital of the World for many, many years with the Big Three in the auto industry, with transportation on our mind and under our fingernails, hardworking people of Michigan who made the world run on four wheels and sometimes two, a great heritage that we have that pertains to energy and pertains to how we use it. 
   I appreciate the words of my good friend from Tennessee on the issue of the bill that we just passed today which could be considered the ``no energy'' energy bill. The latest shot, Mr. Speaker, in the Democrat's war on American jobs is this so-called energy bill that was on the floor today, this bill that we have been waiting for quite some time, yet it has no new net energy in it. And there is no way we can tax ourselves to energy independence. Congress can't tax our way to providing a greater supply of energy in America, and we can't just add more government regulations on industry and expect that we will have more energy in the pipeline. It doesn't work that way. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support American energy solutions, starting with expanding domestic supplies, and, two, lowering costs for U.S. consumers and for U.S. manufacturers, which use one-third of our Nation's energy. 
   Access to competitively priced energy helps U.S. communities and citizens compete in the global economy and preserves high-paying jobs here and at home. 
   If enacted, this bill that we passed, this bill will result in higher energy costs, few energy supplies, a weakened domestic energy industry and more job losses for U.S. factory workers, including my factory workers in Michigan. U.S. manufacturers already face a 31.7 percent cost disadvantage when compared to our major trading partners. By increasing the cost of energy, this bill will drive the cost even higher, putting quality American jobs at risk, and I resent that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am strongly concerned about the absence of any meaningful provisions to expand domestic 
   energy supplies. I remain committed to proposals that enhance U.S. energy security and production through increased production of all types of energy: improved conservation and efficiency, yes; more research on technology and alternative energy; increased access to domestic sources with continued environmental protections and improved distribution. 
   I support and have sponsored legislation to foster biodiesel technology. I have cosponsored legislation that would allow us to produce nuclear power. Other countries are doing very well right now with limited waste products that come off of it that can't be used. 
   I have also supported legislative initiatives that would increase our exploration in Alaska and the Outer Continental Shelf for clean power through natural gas, clean coal technology and other things. And yet today, in this piece of legislation where we had the opportunity, there was no energy. 
   So let me cut to the chase here and talk about the specifics of what this energyless energy legislation will do. In Michigan, it will kill jobs, as well as other places in the United States. It creates a confusing set of CAFE mandates. I don't call them standards. These are mandates based upon just human reasoning that says let's put at 35 miles per gallon fleetwide average. These mandates have the goal of dictating to our families, farmers, and small business owners what we can and can't drive, what we can use for commerce and industry. Some aspects are controlled by the National Highway Transportation Agency, specifically fuel efficiency mandates, but this could collide with EPA regulations, tail pipe emissions, which could create an unpredictable set of regulatory mandates. 
   It gives advantages to foreign car companies such as Volkswagen and Kia who don't make trucks, minivans or SUVs. We are not opposed to their cars, but we are not comparing apples to apples in these CAFE mandates. 
   We can do more to encourage energy conservation by allowing more clean diesel technology in cars and trucks, which the Federal Government has discouraged for decades. New diesel technology is clean and efficient and it is quiet. It has been effective in Europe for a long time, and we need to move it here. 
   These are issues that I am concerned with not simply because my State has been impacted very negatively by it. It will cost jobs and it will cost futures for my people, for my family, and it is a further intrusion into the freedoms and creativity that American citizens so deserve. 
   I appreciate the chance to espouse on some of these issues tonight. I know my colleagues have things to say about these issues. But more importantly, the American public needs to speak and we need to say we are interested in American solutions, not just political posturing that does nothing except serve political purposes that ultimately diminish the power and the control and the liberty of our American citizens. 
   So thanks for this time this evening, and I look forward to communicating further as time is available.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Absolutely. I appreciate you bringing it up, and I appreciate my good friend from Ohio for endorsing legislation that I've offered, and to have you as co-sponsors on it as well, that would make permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that have blessed this Nation and its taxpayers well and have allowed this economy to grow at a steady pace for the longest time in history. 
   Again, to say to the family farmer who is able to survive in this economy, by the sound effort, good work, creativity, doing what it takes to compete, and then to say that because they have succeeded, when they pass on that family farm, as it is a real business, and some of it's not a small business anymore, that they will be dinged for their responsibility, as opposed to applauded for what they've carried on for the family. 
   That again brings me back to a broken record on energy as well, because when you're talking to the family farmers who have to use energy to produce food, and the resources from petroleum and otherwise producing fertilizer and all of those costs going up, we've got further tax problems for the citizens of the United States. Bottom line, this energy-less energy bill will not lower gas prices for American families; it will not help American families or farmers dealing with heating costs and drying costs in their granaries this winter. 
   This no-energy bill doesn't include anything to increase domestic energy production. It does, however, and I'm sure you'll all be glad to hear that what was left in this was a $240 tax credit, and we all like tax credits, tax incentives. But this is a tax credit, $240 tax credit that we're going to provide every 15 minutes for people who regularly ride their bikes to work for the  purchase, repair, or storage of their bicycles. 
   Now, my wife and I enjoy mountain biking. We have two bikes. I have a Harley Davidson motorcycle, two wheels, that I enjoy riding. I have a fuel efficient 30 mile per gallon family car that I use for getting around my district. But I also have a three-quarter ton pickup that I use for hauling my trailer, or last Sunday, in fact, in Michigan, hauling three people out of snow-covered ditches. That couldn't have been done by a Prius, my motorcycle, my bicycle or even my 30-mile-per-gallon car.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (FOURTH QUARTERLY REPORT OF THE FRESHMEN REPUBLICANS -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. I appreciate you adding that because that's practical advice and a good example. The American public has grown to associate with our lifestyle all sorts of conveniences that we shouldn't feel embarrassed about. You ought to use them appropriately. We have all sorts of opportunities that other people in other parts of the world would long for. But it's come as a result of ingenuity, creativity, hard work, effort, saving, risk all of that revolved around responsibility so that people can enjoy that Airstream trailer or can use that pickup truck to transport goods and supplies on the farm and to do good deeds of pulling people out of ditches and the snow-covered roads that we had this past weekend. 
   Nonetheless, we, as legislators here in the U.S. Congress, have the privileged opportunity of allowing that to expand and thus bless the world, 25 percent of the world's population here, with over 85 percent of charitable resources that we give to the rest of the world. That is unique. 
   And for that reason, I think that true conservative effort that says we will avoid responsibility and we encourage people to be further responsible, and we don't let government step in the way with taxes or energy-less energy bills that says things that don't work is the way to go. So thank you again for giving me the opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (EDUCATION: THE QUALITY OF OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. I want to thank my colleague and friend and ranking member from California (Mr. McKeon) for allowing this discussion tonight, and to start off I think by portraying reality here of the billions of dollars that have been invested. And I certainly wouldn't say wasted, but the investment of billions of dollars into education certainly has not, according to this chart, and I think reality, shown the impact we would have dreamed of, expected and desired. 
   I think that is why the discussion that we are having tonight is so good, especially centered around reauthorizing a major component that there has been a lot of hopes and dreams about, No Child Left Behind, producing in this country a greater quality and achievement in education. 
   I don't pride myself in being a contrarian, but on this issue, I am somewhat of a contrarian.     
   I hearken back to the Northwest Ordinance, that great statement that is included in many of our State Constitutions that says religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged. 
   And I think that last section, where it says schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged, is where we are interested in tonight. It is our concern. It is our desire to encourage schools and the means of education. 
   That statement, that directive from the Northwest Ordinance is found, as I said, in many State Constitutions including that of my own State of Michigan. 
   The fact of the matter is that as a result of many redundant programs, well meaning though they may be, and yet programs and mandates that are put on our system, we have encumbered education to the point that it is very difficult on the ground in the unique classrooms that we have in every school district, with every student in the classroom who is a different student than the student sitting next to them. 
   Having three children and having gone through the public education system, the private education, and alternative system at some point in time in their educational experience, I know that even those three children from the same family learned in different ways and thankfully had the options available to them that met their needs at each step along the way, at least as much as possible, allowing achievement. 
   So, frankly, as we come to reauthorizing No Child Left Behind, it would be my preference that we would not; that we would end No Child Left Behind and turn it back to the States, turn our dollars and our interests toward giving opportunities for higher education, which in this country sets the standard for the rest of the world. Industry and business technology, working hand in hand with higher education, then to be an assist to establish patterns for our elementary and secondary education to bring them to the point of a completion, at least to that point, so that they can go on into higher education, trade schools, or in industry and business, and achieve, knowing reality and to a point as well, I understand that No Child Left Behind will most likely be reauthorized in some form. So, for that reason I would certainly plead for flexibility. 
   Having done that, I have cosponsored legislation that has been given the name A-PLUS, which would allow that flexibility for States to be brought forward, that would allow States that had taken a purpose statement to produce schools and the means of education that would foster growth in our government, in our society, in our educational classrooms, that would give opportunities for States to opt out of No Child Left Behind having proven that they had in place a plan for providing data that was good, evaluation that was quality, and an educational program that was moving toward excellence. 
   For example, I was the product of public education all the way through and even entering into university. My mother and three aunts were public school educators, beginning most of them in one-room schools teaching, and then moving into the Chicago public school system. 
   My daughter-in-law is a public school teacher on the south side of Chicago, a gifted teacher, a teacher who her first year taught as a full-time substitute because of the need in a special needs classroom where the teacher, out of frustration one day, got up, walked out of the class, and never came back. My daughter-in-law was given the opportunity to work with these young people who needed an education, needed someone who would invest themselves in their little lives, a fourth grade classroom. 
   My daughter-in-law Erin absolutely loved her first year of teaching as a substitute, a full-time substitute. She had the freedom without some of the paperwork, some of the criteria, both of the Illinois and Chicago public school systems, but also No Child Left Behind. She saw achievement with the opportunity to meet with parents, to provide expectations, but also the opportunity to work in partnership with them and working with these special needs students to see improvement along the way. 
   Thankfully, she received a full-time appointment to that same classroom the next year as a full-time teacher, and soon found out that, with the weight of paperwork and regulation that was redundant upon each other coming from the Federal on down through the State and through the Chicago system as well, she was greatly frustrated to the point of wondering whether she was cut out to be a teacher. Fortunately, with good counsel from her administration and, I must admit, from my wife and myself as well, she continued and saw impact. And yet, the frustrations of not having the flexibility to deal with individual needs almost scuttled her attempt at teaching. 
   One final point I would make, Mr. McKeon, is from my own experience in going through seven No Child Left Behind hearings across my district in each of the seven counties, and having teachers, administrators, school board members and parents speak to the issue of No Child Left Behind and reauthorization, speak to the issue of highly qualified teachers and the frustration that that produces in some of our smaller school districts, rural school districts in trying to deal with that, yet having qualified teachers who are achieving well in the classroom, and yet because of the requirement for highly qualified that No Child Left Behind puts in place, the frustration that comes. 
   I stood in a special needs classroom at a local intermediate school district, and I watched a young man who, as I understand it, had no mental difficulties but great physical difficulties to the point that the only way that he could be administered a test was by verbal administration of that test from his teacher. And with his blinking of his eye once for yes, two for no, he took the test. But then I watched as the teacher went through that same test a second time to make sure that she had achieved answering right according to what he had indicated. Now, that adds time. And when you add redundancies and lack of flexibility all the way from the Federal Government on down, it frustrates education and it takes away the opportunity of some of these great teachers out there and committed parents, school boards, and students to meet the needs of their students, in their classrooms, in their communities. 
   So my friend from California, I would applaud you in pushing further that, not only would we most likely reauthorize, but that we would produce the flexibility that allows creativity to abound in our classrooms, parents to be involved, teachers who want to teach and not just be social workers or mother confessors at times, but to be in the role of teaching and working side by side with parents and the flexibility that can only come by understanding that schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. I thank the ranking member for the opportunity to stand today in strong opposition to the ENDA Act. I use that acronym because I believe it is mistitled, that this is not a nondiscrimination act but rather a discrimination act, a reverse discrimination in many ways. But it certainly doesn't achieve what I think ought to be part of this society because it is a radical transformation of workplace discrimination law that stomps on the rights of private employers, adds new unfunded mandates and opens the judicial gates to a herd of endless litigation. 
   Pitting a newly protected class of individuals based on sexual orientation against our longstanding foundation of religious liberty will force job makers to walk a legal tightrope over which law to follow and which law to violate. 
   A business with as few as 15 employees will be slammed as new unfunded Federal mandates will provide additional protections for some employees, protections that may conflict with the ability of other employees to freely express their personal and religious convictions, again, without attempt to discriminate or treat wrongly. In fact, this legislation is so poorly written and broad, it will immediately serve as another way for trial lawyers to make a quick buck at the expense of small business owners. More lawsuits against jobs creators in my home State of Michigan, especially with recently passed tax increases, are the last thing employers in south central Michigan need to grow, prosper and thrive in a competitive environment. 
   ENDA is a fundamental departure from the longstanding principles of religious liberty as well, principles our country was founded upon. In fact, this will directly discriminate against people of traditional values and long-held faith principles. Rather than reducing discrimination, this legislation will instead reduce religious freedom and increase litigation. 
   The Founders of this great democratic Republic would invariably run afoul of this legislation if they were alive today. If you want to make a stand in favor of increasing lawsuits and penalizing small business owners at the benefit of trial lawyers, then by all means support this bill. If you want to chill the exercise of personal religious freedom, support this bill. 
   Madam Chairman, I, for one, am choosing to stand for the basic principle of religious freedom and nondiscrimination. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Bipartisanship. You hear this expression tossed around quite frequently in political circles, so much so that perhaps it has almost become a cliche. 
   Sadly, we don't see genuine examples of bipartisan cooperation in this Chamber enough, and this no doubt disappoints the American people. Over 140 days ago, Democrats and Republicans worked together to pass one of the largest necessary spending increases in the 77-year history of the Department of Veterans Affairs. To ensure the health and well-being of our veterans, this bill is a needed investment veterans care about and the care they need to receive. 
   Eight weeks ago, a similar version passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis. Instead of allowing the House and Senate to iron out minor differences yesterday, the House leadership insisted that veterans funding be held hostage for a wasteful, pork-barrel spending bill that would increase the deficit by $10 billion. 
   No doubt this shameful game further disappointed the already jaded public perception of Congress. 
   Let's get back to bipartisanship and swiftly pass this important legislation in its original form. Then together, on behalf of our veterans, we can all celebrate when it becomes law.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor today to pose an important question to this House, and that question is this: Do we really need race, ethnic or gender-based preferences for roads? 
   Today I am offering an amendment to the transportation bill we are currently debating that would stipulate no funding in this bill may be used by the Department of Transportation to discriminate based on race, ethnicity or sex. 
   Though this policy may be motivated by good intention, I agree with Justice Clarence Thomas about the DOT's affirmative action programs where he states, ``The paternalism that appears to lie at the heart of this program is at war with the principle of inherent equality that underlies and infuses our Constitution.'' 
   Last fall in my home State, Michiganders voted overwhelmingly, 58 percent to 42 percent, in favor of amending our State constitution to outlaw racial preferences in public education, employment and contracting. Like my constituents in south-central Michigan, I oppose any and all forms of discrimination. But I also support nondiscrimination, the practice or policy of refraining from discrimination. 
   My support of nondiscrimination compels me to state on this floor that every American deserves equal treatment when competing for business contracts, and our Federal Government should treat all applicants for such contracts on an equal basis. The Federal Government should never view any American as part of a group, but rather look at them as an individual. By granting the Department of Transportation the ability to discriminate based on race or sex, this House would essentially create affirmative action preferences for our Nation's highways. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and ensure that all American businesses competing for public works projects are given a fair, nondiscriminatory opportunity. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time

   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to go further on it. I think it is rather self-explanatory that we are talking here of just assuring the practice that we don't commit discrimination in the process of our hiring and contracting practices. 
   We in the State of Michigan labored long and hard during the last election cycle, from both sides, to indicate what value there was in making sure that under the context of our Constitution and the laws that have been put in place to enforce that Constitution, that we are each given rights to benefit from those unalienable rights, namely the right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness or property. If we were to bridge that with any discriminatory practice, we take that away from one, and we can take it away from all. 
   For that purpose, this amendment is offered. I would appreciate the support of my colleagues.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT EXPANSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, in considering tonight's legislation, I am reminded of a quote from the great communicator himself, Ronald Reagan: ``The government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And it if stops moving, subsidize it.'' 
   I find it ironic that we sit here this evening debating a clause to provide millionaires with Federal funding in the name of spurring investment when the majority party constantly supports to tax private investments out of business. 
   The best way to encourage innovation and investment in the marketplace is to reduce financial and regulatory impediments. The key is reducing regulation. Congress must support tax measures that have proven to stimulate the economy, such as extending the capital gains and dividends tax reduction beyond 2010. These commonsense tax reductions have a proven track record of producing greater wealth and encouraging further investment in the economy. 
   Instead, the majority in Congress has stood in the way of providing tax relief by supporting and passing a budget containing the largest tax increase in American history, which would result in a $3,000 tax increase for the average taxpayer in Michigan and in every other State. Now the majority wants to subsidize millionaires with funds that would be better used to assist the middle class. 
   Title III of the bill before us creates a brand new program in the Small Business Administration to promote so-called ``angel investors.'' Angel investors are those financial backers who provide venture capital funds for small startups or entrepreneurs. 
   Among other things, this new SBA program will provide funds of up to $2 million to qualified angel investors. These millionaire investors will take taxpayer dollars to finance their own small business. This begs the question: Who exactly are these angel investors? Do they have halos? Do they really need government money if they are already millionaires? 
   According to the regulations referenced in this bill, a qualified angel investor would be ``any natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net worth with that person's spouse exceeds $1 million.'' 
   In other words, to even qualify to receive government money, these angels already have to be millionaires. 
   According to the University of New Hampshire, angel investments totaled $25.6 billion nationally, up 10 percent over the previous year. I don't know about you, but it appears angel investors already are having financial success, and I question whether they need help from the American taxpayer. 
   Title III of the bill also includes a new grant program to help develop new angel investor groups; in other words, a taxpayer-subsidized grant program to help millionaires get together and make investments. One can only wonder if these programs come with a complimentary tin of caviar. 
   My motion to recommit would simply strike the two sections of bill that authorize taxpayer funding for these angel millionaire investors. Congress does not need to enact another Federal  entitlement program to help millionaires decide what to invest in. The focus in this debate should be on lowering taxes for every American to encourage investment and personal wealth to create entrepreneurship and allow job creators to thrive. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to stand with men here who have served with distinction and consistency on this issue and the most important issue, as I understand it, as a new Member of Congress, taking that oath of office for the first time on January 4 to uphold the Constitution of the United States, which gives us the primary responsibility, number one responsibility, for security and defense of this great Nation not only for its people but for the impact that this Nation has given and continues to give worldwide. 
   We are the greatest bastion of hope for liberty, for individualism, for opportunity. And for us to be now in an arena that, frankly, with my colleagues I can't say that I have been there yet. I look forward to being over in the arena of this war and having the opportunity to sit with our heroes, our warriors over there who understand the process. I look forward to that experience to be able to hear directly from them in the field. But until that time, I have to resort to memories, including a memory my wife and I will never forget in sitting on the parade grounds in Fort Knox, Kentucky, watching my son graduate with the rest of the young recruits, troops that volunteered, all volunteers to serve their country, all of whom understood that in signing up for this austere and wonderful choice of patriotism, yet also put their lives on the line potentially. 
   And I will never forget watching my son, who had 
   changed before my eyes during the course of the past number of weeks at Fort Knox, and had become a man with an understanding, as he was preparing to be a combat medic. That was unique. And meeting with his fellow soldiers and understanding that they had a purpose in mind, what an encouraging thing that was. 
   And now to look back on that and realize that not only have numerous of his fellow comrades gone to the arena, some who have come home with the impact of that time on their life never to leave them. Others have not come home alive and have given the supreme sacrifice. We would do well to honor them not only by our words but by our actions. 
   I have stood at Walter Reed Hospital on numerous occasions now, with my wife alongside several times, and I have met these troops, these fallen warrior heroes. I have prayed at their bedside. I have thanked them. I have had the opportunity to hear from them: Mr. Congressman, don't thank us. It was a privilege to serve. Don't thank me, though I appreciate your being here, but I want you to go back and tell your colleagues that we would appreciate their unquestioning support, that they would stand with us, that they would encourage us, that they would support us with the necessary resources, both armaments and financial resources, to complete this passion that we have, to stand for the defense not only of Iraq and its citizens who long to be free, but stand for our fellow citizens at home so we don't have to fight this war on our home turf as well. They understand this. 
   I don't understand why many of my colleagues, whom I respect highly, yet don't seem to understand, on the other side of the aisle, that we are fighting so it doesn't come home here as well. 
   I have also had, and I call it a distinct honor, though difficult as well, to speak to families who are now dealing with the impact of the war. I think of Travis Webb from Adrian, Michigan, who is still at Walter Reed, who came home missing two legs but not missing his heart, and still with a passion for his comrades back in the field and expressing the desire that we stand firm with them, thanking him and hearing him say ``I wish I could go back.'' 
   Just a week ago, I called the mother of Daniel Courneya of Vermontville, Michigan, and expressed my sincere sympathy to her. Her son has not come home alive. He along with three other of his fellow troops were killed with an IED explosion, and three of his troops are still missing. We have read about them in the media. And we pray for their safe return. We know also that they have given their service for a cause. And I will be at the funeral of Daniel Courneya this coming Friday, in fact 2 days from now, and will stand proudly and yet humbly, recognizing the sacrifice that they have given for a cause greater than all of us even on this floor tonight. 
   Mr. Speaker, 108 days ago, on February 5, President Bush requested from Congress funding for our troops in Iraq. And even though current funding for our troops is set to expire at the end of May, and I say this as a new Member and I guess I say it as a Member that doubts until I actually see the bill in front of me to vote on, this funding is set to expire at the end of May. The new leadership in the House of Representatives has yet to put in front of me a bill that even comes close to properly financing the troops. And I say that saying until proven otherwise, it hasn't been in front of me to vote yet, and that is a shame. 
   Our American commanders need an opportunity to implement the new strategy. We are handcuffing our generals on the front line. That is not the  way it ought to be. New House leadership first introduced a bill in March that not only micromanaged the troops but also contained millions of dollars of unrelated pork-barrel projects to buy a few votes for bad legislation. That is not what I understood that I signed up for in supporting our troops and protecting and defending this great country.     
   The bill was a salad bar of egregious earmarks: $25 million for payments to spinach producers; $120 million to shrimp industries, $74 million for peanut storage; $5 million for shellfish, oyster and clam producers are just a few examples. And again, as a new Member of Congress, I couldn't believe that, that we were dealing with that type of funding with a war going on. 
   This bill was rightfully vetoed. In response, House leadership scrambled, and now we see supposedly that there is a bill before us. 
   I heard my colleague, the gentleman from Georgia, express appreciation that we have a bill now that we can vote on that will fund our troops. But again, I haven't voted on it yet. And so I say, let it come before us. No wonder this body, this Congress, this great symbol of American freedom has a 29 percent approval rating, when we mess around with the lives of our troops and the freedom of our citizens. 
   House leadership seems to have finally relented, and hopefully has decided to provide the necessary funding for our brave men and women. I am glad to hear that we will put aside any plans to go on break until a clean funding bill will pass, and I trust that that will take place tomorrow, to support our men and women in combat. Our troops deserve this respect. 
   Recently, the Iraqi Government, after complaints from myself and other Members of Congress, decided to forego its plans for a 2-month summer recess so important decisions such as the development and distribution of Iraq's oil and how to deal properly with sectarian violence can be made and laws can be passed. 
   This Congress similarly has decided not to go home for more than a week and leave our troops in limbo until we finish this job. We have to stay here and finish our job so our brave troops, our men and women in uniform, can finish theirs. 
   House leadership needs to allow Members to vote as early as possible tomorrow on a clean bill, devoid of wasteful, nonmilitary spending. We need a bill that doesn't handcuff our generals, but instead gives our troops the resources they need. Setting timelines on American involvement in Iraq is good policy, but not publicly in front of our enemies. Our military commanders need to have control of the situation, and not the terrorists. 
   The Congress needs to give General David Petraeus, the new Commander in Iraq, who was confirmed unanimously by the Senate, a chance to fully implement the new strategy instead of telegraphing surrender to terrorists. 
   In the Anbar Province, one of the most dangerous areas in Iraq, violent crime is dropping, and 20 of 22 tribal leaders of that area now support the U.S. and Iraqi forces against al Qaeda. Granted, the level of violence remains high, and the hot spots are numerous, and many challenges persist. But the wounded soldiers I've met at Walter Reed and Bethesda deserve our support. They have indicated that our Armed Forces can secure Iraq enough so that an Iraqi Government and a security force there can take over. 
   Time is running out. Congress needs to move past political posturing and partisanship and allow the men and women serving in Iraq the opportunity to crush the terrorists in the Middle East so our families will have a more secure future here at home. 
   I want us to win this war. There are only two options, as we mentioned tonight already, only two options: One, victory; and the other, defeat. I do not believe that Americans countenance, by and large, the option of defeat. 
   I am asking my fellow Members of Congress, those that I am proud to stand with here on the floor tonight, as well as those who have wavered and waffled at times, to buck up. FDR called our America to a strength of sacrifice together, to win a war as brave people that sustain this great world as well. We, as well, have the privilege tonight, as Members of Congress, to call our Nation by first standing together, calling them to sacrifice in support of our troops, calling them to bravery and courage in standing for this country, calling them to one decision, and that being the decision for victory. 
   Memorial Day is upon us. I will experience this Memorial Day like I have experienced no other Memorial Day, because I have stood next to these wounded heroes. I have defended these brave troops. I have spoken with them. I have had family members, including my son, sign up to do that brave duty. And I will say to the troops who may hear us tonight, God bless you. We stand with you, and we will support you.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (THE A-PLUS ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Constitution Caucus, I am convinced that today, at a time when our Nation lags behind other countries in math and science testing and the Federal Government has a larger role in education than ever before, this Congress must find a way to give our schools greater flexibility, reduce the bureaucracy involved in education, and ensure these opportunities really are being given to our children. 
   In years past Congress has attempted to solve problems in education by simply throwing piles of Federal money into the education system. The original purpose of No Child Left Behind was to return some education policymaking authority to the States. Unfortunately, during the process of crafting, passing, and enacting this legislation, No Child Left Behind took the form of a massive spending bill that increased the Federal Government's presence in classrooms. 
   As a December 22, 2006 editorial in the Detroit News stated, ``What our Federal legislators come up with in the Nation's Capital doesn't always translate well into the classroom.'' 
   The editorial continues: ``Michigan should have the flexibility to decide how and when to measure student progress.'' 
   My daughter-in-law is a hardworking and talented teacher who has experienced firsthand the problems No Child Left Behind creates for teachers, parents, and students. As a classroom teacher forced to teach to the tests required by local, State, and No Child  Left Behind, she actually considered quitting because of the paperwork and restrictions imposed upon her. She struggled to have time to give individual attention to each of her ``special needs'' students. 
   Ironically, she obtained her teaching position due to her performance the year prior as a permanent substitute teacher in a classroom. Because she was not required to fill out all the forms and paperwork required by No Child Left Behind, she excelled and the school offered her a permanent position. 
   In its origin, No Child Left Behind attempted to provide greater school choice and reduce Washington's involvement in education. But instead this expensive and largely unsuccessful legislation has broadened the scope of the Federal Government's role in education. 
   Enshrined in our Constitution is the 10th amendment, which reads, ``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved for the States respectively, or to the people.'' Federal control of education is listed nowhere in the Constitution. And in accordance with the 10th amendment, education should be the responsibility of State and local governments. 
   Because I believe each child's educational path should be determined by a child's parents and not by the Federal Government, I am an original cosponsor of the A-Plus Act. The A-Plus Act would give States, teachers and parents the freedom and authority to determine what educational path a student should take. 
   As part of this legislation, States can opt out of Federal programs, and State leaders can decide how to use Federal education funds to improve student achievement. 
   We all are seeking the best possible educational opportunities for our children, and the way to achieve this is to let States and local communities be accountable for academic achievement and educational reforms. 
   With that, I yield back, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (WE MUST SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENACT REAL REFORM -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, let me read you a line from today's Wall Street Journal: ``The latest Los Angeles Times-Bloomberg survey finds that Congress' approval rating is down to 27 percent, with 63 percent of the public saying Democrats are practicing `business as usual.' '' 
   The frustration of the American people is real and growing. Every weekend I hear it in the voices of my constituents, regardless of their affiliation. 
   Almost all south central Michiganders have the same message: control runaway government spending, maintain the highest of ethical standards, and put an end to wasteful pork barrel spending. 
   The actions of Congress this week not only continue the culture of corruption currently plaguing the capital city, but also are an insult to an American public that longs for transparency and accountability. 
   Together, Democrats and Republicans must seize this opportunity and use it to enact real reform that values how taxpayer dollars are being spent. 
   I believe that by limiting the size and scope of government and making certain taxpayer dollars go to meaningful programs, Congress can restore public trust and build a better, brighter future for our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, this week I am introducing the Tax Increase Prevention Act, legislation that would make permanent tax relief passed in 2001 and 2003. 
   My bill simply takes away all the sunset provisions of these tax relief packages that passed Congress and provided American families and job creators the certainty to provide for the future. This tax relief passed by Congress is working, and States are much more likely to take fiscally responsible moves and tighten their belts instead of hiking taxes. States that were once in recession are now brimming with tax revenue. 
   The few States that are struggling, such as my home State of Michigan, have hope for a turnaround in the future because these tax cuts are creating jobs and leaving more money in the pockets of taxpayers. 
   Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress are choosing to ignore the advancements made possible by these tax cuts. In their most recent budget bill, the House Democrats' budget plan included a $400 billion tax increase that will cripple current progress in our economy. 
   By making tax cuts permanent and continuing to grow our economy, this Congress can go a long way in restoring the trust of the American people and build a better, brighter future for our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, today is National Ride Your Motorcycle to Work Day, and just a few minutes ago, I proudly rode a Harley Davidson Roadking to the steps of the Capitol building. 
   Motorcycle riding has been a passion of mine for many years, since my 20th birthday, and a proud member of the American Motorcyclist Association I am, as well as the Harley Owners Group. I can attest that responsible riding has many unique recreational benefits for millions of Americans. 
   During this session of Congress, we are looking for ways to break our dependence on foreign oil, develop alternative fuels, and increase domestic conservation. Motorcycles are excellent alternatives to current forms of transportation because they offer both fuel efficiency and greater enjoyment for the commuter. 
   I encourage all Americans to learn more about the recreational and environmental benefits of responsible motorcycle riding by visiting American Motorcyclist Association's Web site and availing themselves of the motorcycle rider safety training program.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks Americans across our country have taken time out of their busy schedules to complete their 1040s, 1099s and W-2s by the April 17 deadline. 
   They did so in many different ways. Some planned ahead and mailed in their forms well before the deadline, while others are scrambling to finish work on their taxes until late tonight. 
   Today, taxpayers in south central Michigan are still working to meet their tax obligation for 2007. While tax day may be today, the average Michigander will have to work until April 29 of this year just to pay his or her individual tax bill. 
   The $400 billion tax increase recently passed by Congress represents the largest tax increase in American history and could lead to a crippling economic recession. 
   Americans know best how to spend their hard-earned money, and rather than increase the tax burden, Congress needs to make tax relief permanent for hardworking American families. 
   By putting our fiscal house in order, this Congress can go a long way in restoring the trust of the American people and build a better, brighter future for our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (COMBUSTIBLE DUST EXPLOSION AND FIRE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   This motion to recommit is simple and straightforward. It maintains our  commitment to safety. And it does nothing--I repeat nothing--to prevent OSHA from developing a combustible dust safety standard. 
   This motion is simply a way for us to tell our constituents, the hardworking families who are struggling with the rising cost of living and an uncertain economy, that we're sensitive to their concerns; that we recognize that rising food costs, in particular, are a difficult burden to bear for many families; and that we know that in these difficult times, the very last thing we should be doing is driving up the cost of food for our children and our families. 
   The motion I have offered makes clear that the new mandates included in this bill will not be imposed on food grain production until we have determined that it will not cause an increase in prices at the grocery store. 
   During today's debate, we heard numerous objections to this bill, including its impact on the grain and feed industry that is so integral to food production and distribution in this country. I know that Members on both sides of the aisle have heard directly from the grain industry on this measure, and many of us have wondered how we can enhance worker safety without unnecessarily driving up food costs. 
   The answer, Madam Speaker, is to pass this motion to recommit. 
   By voting ``yes'' on this motion, OSHA will still be required to begin immediate development of a combustible dust standard. By voting ``yes'' on this motion, there will be no delay in implementation of these new rules for facilities that do not handle food grains. And lest anyone be concerned about the workers at facilities producing the grains we eat, if we pass this measure, these workers will continue to be protected as well under the same standard that has already produced a 60 percent reduction in grain facility explosions. 
   Feed, corn, and flour mills are already covered by existing OSHA grain-handling regulations. As a member of both the House Education and Labor Committee and Agriculture Committee, I understand that the food manufacturing industry is affected by combustible dust as much as any other industry. 
   Reregulating and duplicating existing Federal regulations on American family farmers and small rural businesses could seriously impact commodity prices and drive up the cost of everything from a loaf of bread to a gallon of gasoline. 
   I find it ironic that at the same time the leaders within the majority party are advocating for up to $300 million in additional spending for international food aid in the supplemental, these same folks are simultaneously considering legislation that could further drive up the price of food here at home. 
   My motion to recommit ensures we conduct a thorough economic analysis on the impact of H.R. 5522 on food prices. This MTR will ensure we do not unnecessarily cause irreparable harm to family farms, agricultural producers and American consumers by driving up the price of food because of another unintended consequence in the majority's continued rush to regulate first and ask questions later. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong opposition to this cleverly entitled College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. Under the guise of saving money and paying down the deficit, Democratic leaders are using the budget reconciliation process as a vehicle to create a host of expensive new Federal bureaucracies rather than making tough decisions to restrain entitlement spending and balance the Federal budget. 
   Mandatory spending programs consume the largest portion of the Federal budget, and their share will only increase as Social Security and Medicare costs explode in coming years. Unfortunately, this action comes as no surprise. After reclaiming the majority under the claims of fiscal accountability, House Democrats have already voted to approve a massive $400 billion tax increase on working families and small businesses, and may I add, that amounts to over $3,000 on average tax increase for these students who we are attempting to help. 
   Now we are considering a piece of legislation that will create nine new entitlement programs resulting in $18 billion in new spending. The explosion in new, unchecked entitlement spending is another unfortunate step backwards for the American taxpayer. I agree that Congress must remain committed to ensuring affordable access to post-secondary education. But instead of focusing the bulk of need on increasing access to higher education for low-income students, the bill increases aid to colleges and universities at the expense of students who receive Pell Grants. H.R. 2669 only targets $4.9 billion towards Pell Grants, increasing the maximum award by only $100 per year for 5 years. Pell Grants have proven to be effective in helping low-income students attain higher education. This bill will not prioritize Pell Grants. 
   I do wish to take a moment to thank Chairman Miller for working with me to remove section 201 of his bill in his manager's amendment. I was happy to work with our State's Governor to make this change. This action withheld funds from the Leveraging Education Assistance Partnership, known as the LEAP, if a State reduced the average amount of funding it has provided over the last 5 years. This so-called maintenance of effort provision is a bold and unprecedented overreach of Federal authority designed to dictate State budgets.     
   This is particularly true because the Federal Government provides little direct assistance to States or higher education institutions. Low-income and financially needy students should not have to struggle because of a State's budgetary shortfalls. My home State of Michigan continues to suffer from a struggling economy and difficult choices must be made on how to most appropriately fund the State. However, needy students should not have critical financial aid yanked away because the State cannot afford the same financial commitment it has made to the LEAP program in more prosperous years. 
   I was also prepared to offer an amendment to the House Rules Committee concerning the Upward Bound program. I appreciate that the chairman's manager's amendment removes a section that earmarked $30 million for prior Upward Bound grantees who submitted low-scoring applications, bypassing 107 new applicants who submitted competitive proposals. 
   But despite these small improvements, the College Cost Reduction Act contains dozens of poison pills that mark another step towards unchecked spending. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the so-called College Cost Reduction Act.

   Raising taxes nationwide by $400 billion, including an on-average $3,000 per tax increase per American citizen? The Democrat majority says, ``not guilty.'' 
   Withholding the passage of veterans health care bills for political purposes? The majority again says, ``not guilty.'' 
   Granting illegal immigrants health care benefits and taking Medicare Advantage benefits away from our seniors and putting them in waiting lines for wheelchairs? The House leadership pleads ``not guilty.''

   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, all of us in this Chamber agree, our recovering veterans deserve hospitals that are clean, secure and sanitary when they return home from the battlefield defending our great Nation in the name of liberty. 
   The recent findings at Walter Reed Army Medical Center are a grave breach of trust to those who shed blood on the battlefield fighting for our freedoms. This Congress must work with the administration to implement a comprehensive evaluation of conditions at Walter Reed and hold those in charge accountable for these deplorable conditions. 
   The bipartisan commission created by the President to determine whether similar problems exist at other military and VA hospitals is also a necessary and appropriate course of action. Going forward, we must ensure world-class standards and patient-centered efficiency for our veterans. Better oversight is clearly necessary to ensure military facilities exemplify our soldiers' honor and courage. 
   As hearings on the conditions at Walter Reed are held this week, this Congress must reaffirm its commitment to our wounded soldiers and veterans to ensure they are provided first class medical care.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Department of Defense appropriations bill that is straightforward, as the amendment simply states this: ``None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to award a grant or contract based on the race, ethnicity, or sex of the grant applicant or prospective contractor.'' 
   I was glad a similar amendment passed unanimously last week on the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill, with the acceptance of the Chairman of Appropriations. 
   Government contracts and grants should be awarded on the basis of work, quality and cost, and all firms should have an equal opportunity to compete for taxpayer-funded projects. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the concern of the chairman. However, it is a fact that this cuts out none of the minority contractors, small business contractors. They still have the great number of programs that they can use in the process of contracting. 
   Throughout the government, contracts and grants are awarded with preference given on the basis of race, sex and ethnicity instead of on the basis of work, craftsmanship and cost. 
   Though this policy may be motivated by good intentions, I agree with Justice Clarence Thomas about preferences in government contracting based on race, sex, and ethnicity when he stated, ``The paternalism that appears to lie at the heart of this program is at war with the principle of inherent equality that underlies and infuses our Constitution,'' as well as, I might add, the quality of our armed services. 
   The Federal Government continues to engage in these preferences via set-asides to contractors. 
   Last fall, in my home State, Michiganders voted overwhelmingly, 58 percent to 42 percent, in favor of amending our State Constitution to outlaw racial preferences in public education, employment and contracting. 
   Like my constituents in south-central Michigan, I oppose any and all forms of discrimination, but I also support nondiscrimination, the practice or policy of refraining from discrimination. 
   Once again, the Federal Government is behind State governments in creating equal opportunity for all Americans, as Michigan followed California and Washington banning discrimination in education, contracting and hiring. 
   My support of nondiscrimination compels me to continue working against discrimination in government policies because every American deserves equal treatment when competing for business contracts, and our Federal Government should treat all applicants for such contracts on an equal basis. 
   This amendment would require the Department of Defense to make contracting decisions based on the quality of work of a firm, the cost, and equality among firms. It should be noted that this amendment has no impact on programs directed at small business operated by veterans and those with disabilities. 
   I believe this commonsense amendment will help ensure that all American businesses and individuals competing for public work projects are given a fair, nondiscriminatory opportunity, and I urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Thank you for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to come before you today and join my distinguished colleagues to address an issue close to my heart. My initial entry into politics came as a member of a right-to-life organization, my home county of Lenawee, Michigan. I am proud to say that during my 16 years in the Michigan House of Representatives, I established a 100 percent pro-life voting record. 
   As I begin my first term in the U.S. House with the same ardent commitment to the sanctity of life, I want to preface my remarks by saying I wholeheartedly support stem cell research in all cases except one, any form of research that requires the eradication of human life. 
   The legislation this Congress is considering not only destroys human life and could ultimately lead to human cloning, but also is antiquated. Embryonic stem cell research has seen consistently disappointing and with fruitless results, while nearly every month more studies come out showing that ethical, adult stem cell research continues to flourish. 
   Just this week my wife and I were heartened to learn about stem cells derived from amniotic fluid and placentas. It is time for Congress to catch up with the remarkable and ethical developments taking place in the scientific community. 
   In truth, this debate isn't really even about the science of stem cell research, but rather how such research will be financed. Taxpayers should not be expected to fund this research, especially when it continues to be illegal in the private sector, though unsuccessful to date. 
   On behalf of the men and women in my district and across the pro-life districts of the country, I urge my colleagues to cast a vote for both the sanctity of life and fiscal responsibility. 
   This vote was made even more personal and poignant to me this past Sunday when I read an article talking about a couple who will be giving birth to a child this next week as a result of having an embryo saved 2 weeks after Katrina hit, where literally National Guard troops, the Governor of Louisiana, troops from Illinois as well, moved literally hell and high water to save not only this couple's embryo, but 1,400 other embryos. 
   The question comes, if we are going to talk about discarded embryos, or those not wanted, which ones of those 1,400 that were saved as a result of moving hell and high water by our government would be the ones that we would discard? 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to support life and to support good science and vote against this proposal.

   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I stand here today to say that it's amazing, as I listened on my TV in my room and then came over here and heard complaints about cutting just .5 percent. I heard talks about runaway rugged individualism. And I had to think that what we're talking here is concern runaway rugged individualism versus a nanny state regulatory state, a nanny state that says we can't do for ourselves what we could and should do for ourselves. 
   And to talk about cutting this miniscule cut that would at least start to establish for our taxpayers that we have heard to some degree, and .5 percent is what we could take away and indicate that if we want to move in that direction, not only will we say to the taxpayer, you will do well if we keep moving that direction, but I think we can prove to the regulatory mentality here that we can live without some of that. 
   We're talking about myself in a State of Michigan, where we are hurting for certain, and it's not because we don't have too little government. It's not because we don't have too little regulation. We've got too much. We've got too much taxation. We've got too much spending. We've got too much regulation that continues to break down what we should and could do for ourselves. 
   So I thank the gentlelady from Colorado for sponsoring this very reasonable amendment that just simply says, come on. We're still going to have a significant increase. Let's move forward. And I thank you for offering it.

   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I support renewing SCHIP to aid children in low-income families. But the bill that the Democratic leadership plans to bring to the floor this week is an absolute train wreck that will lead to a nanny-state, government-run health care system. 
   This bill would cause 3.2 million seniors in 22 States, including over 14,000 in my district, to lose their Medicare Advantage benefits. The Congressional Budget Office says this bill would shift 2.1 million children who are currently in private health care plans to less effective, government-run health care. 
   Additionally, this bill guts several fiscal responsibility measures designed to keep Medicare spending in check, encourage illegal immigrants to apply for SCHIP and Medicaid benefits by eliminating the requirement that persons applying for such services show proof of citizenship or nationality, and makes it possible for people 25 years old to receive SCHIP benefits. 
   In summation, this bill takes a program designed to aid children of low-income families and instead expands our welfare state and sides with bureaucracy rather than the needy children and seniors. 
   Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose this form of legislation.

   In March of 2005, the then Democratic minority in the House released a report accusing the then Republican majority leadership of abusing their power through parliamentary tactics designed to suppress dissent. The same leadership that published that report over 2 years ago pledged, at the beginning of this very year, to run the ``most honest, most open, and most ethical Congress'' in history. 
   Yesterday these leaders attempted to change a 185-year-old House rule to dramatically increase taxes and government spending against the will of the minority party and the American people. Is this really the way to run the self-proclaimed most honest and most open Congress in America's history? 
   While House leadership may suffer from amnesia, the American people most certainty do not, and bending the rules to pass egregious tax-and-spend policies will not stand in this people's House.

   This week I will introduce legislation, the Energy Independence through Bio-Diesel Act, that will continue the process of moving our country towards energy independence. 
   Creating a national standard for bio-diesel will encourage the technology and economies of scale necessary to make America the leader in renewable sources of energy. 
   The Energy Independence through Bio-Diesel Act would create a 2 percent standard for bio-diesel and amend the Clean Air Act to require that within 5 years all diesel fuel sold contains a 2 percent industry average. 
   Fifty-five billion gallons of diesel were consumed in 2005, and a 2 percent standard would create a 1.1-billion-gallon market. This standard will help spur the necessary investments in facilities and technological advancements needed in this alternative fuel industry.

   It has been estimated that teachers and school officials have spent an additional 6.7 million hours completing the cumbersome paperwork required by No Child Left Behind. 
   As Congress considers the future of education policy in America, we must find a way to give our schools, communities and parents greater flexibility, reduce the bureaucracy in education and ensure the best educational opportunities are being given to our children.

   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3123, legislation that would extend by 1 year temporary protective status for all Liberian refugees living in the United States. 
   I also count it a privilege that this is a bipartisan piece of legislation. I appreciate the efforts of Congressman Kennedy and others in working on something that is the right thing to do. 
   Currently, all Liberian refugees living in the United States under temporary protective status have until October of this year, and then they'll be forced to return to Liberia. 
   As someone who had the privilege, and I say that sincerely, of helping a Liberian refugee start a brand new life in America, living in my home, forcing these Liberians out of our country is the wrong policy. 
   Liberia has been torn apart by two long civil wars over the past 2 decades, and while civil war finally ceased in 2003, Liberia is still years from developing the infrastructure needed for Liberian refugees to return. 
   Liberia's path remains very difficult. With an unemployment rate of 85 percent, shortages of running water and, according to the United Nations, a mere 26 physicians practicing medicine in a country of 3.4 million people, Liberia cannot absorb the estimated 3,600 Liberians who would be required to return. 
   Some of the estimated 3,600 Liberian refugees who are here legally in the United States came to our country when civil war broke out in Liberia in 1991, and they're now raising children born in America. 
   This legislation addresses an urgent situation faced by Liberian refugees who have legally come to America, many over 15 years ago, established careers, bought homes, raised American-born children and become valued members of their communities. 
   One of the unintended consequences of the temporary protective status is it did not foresee that civil wars would continue many years, leaving refugees in America stuck in a state of flux. 
   The United States Government must allow these law-abiding, hardworking Liberian refugees the chance to not only continue contributing to American society as they do, but also to continue playing a pivotal role in furthering Liberia's recovery from years of strife and turmoil. 
   This is the right thing to do. It's an opportunity that we have. It's an opportunity for resources to a foreign country that is a friend of ours that costs us very little because they, the refugees, are the ones primarily giving back. 
   And so I ask, Madam Speaker, that we, as a Congress, roll up our sleeves in this way and support this legislation to give one simple year to remain for this country to move ahead

It's clean, it's green, it doesn't add to the greenhouse effect, it's safe. We ought to be using it. 
   We have the opportunity, if we'll just take it right now, and I'm encouraging people, Mr. Speaker, that are of goodwill of this country, who want to continue on the wonderful situation, the lifestyle we have in this country that has been a blessing not only for us but for the rest of the world, to contact Members and encourage them to sign this petition to move forward, quit talking about it. 
   Last night I was shocked to get on my Blackberry a contact from my staff noting a point that was per program, Capitol Hill, that House Democrats, responding to President Bush's call for Congress to lift the moratorium on off shore drilling, in fact offered their approach of saying we ought to have nationalized refineries. 
   Now, this is the same country that runs Social Security, runs the VA hospitals, runs Medicare, and gives awful sorts of problems to the United States taxpayer. Now we're going to take over refineries and run those? 
   Hasn't that been tried in other countries without effect? Didn't Chavez take over refineries in his country, just by matter of fact say they are no longer use, private sector. They're mine? 
   That's not the direction we want to go. We need to use the resources we have. 
   Just this past weekend, I'll tell my colleagues, an interesting story. I have Michigan International Speedway in my district, in fact, 6 miles from my house. Dale Earnhardt, NASCAR race, first of the season at Michigan International Speedway, won the race. But he won the race on fumes. In fact, he ran out of gas going across the finish line. Now, he did that by choice. He used his resources well, to the point that he knew if he stayed on the track he would finish, even though he'd to coast across the line. He won. 
   Unlike America right now, we have the resources, we have the gas, we have the fuel, but we've chosen to turn it off. We've chosen to stop the race. We've chosen to go to the pit row. We've chosen to have our hot dogs instead of finishing the rays and having victory. We can do it. 
   On the other side of the ledger, the Governor of the great State of Michigan, and it is a great State, de Tocqueville, it's alleged, called us the wolverines and that's where we got the title because we don't have a wolverine in our State. But we were called the wolverines because anyone who could put up with the mosquitoes in the swamp infested region of Michigan had to be a wolverine of tenacity. 
   Well, 2 weeks ago the Governor made mention of the fact that she was now riding a bicycle to work from her residence to the Capitol each day, with her security detail following on their bicycles as well. 
   My wife and I enjoyed a bicycle ride this past weekend on our mountain bikes. We enjoyed it. It's good exercise. 
   But the Governor of the motor capital of the world riding a bicycle, that's not what we should push our citizens to do. 
   We have the resources. No more energy, No More Excuses Energy Act would be one of those things. 
   And Mrs. Bachmann, I ask tonight that we encourage citizens, we encourage our colleagues, we encourage the action to take, to sign that petition, to get that bill that MAC THORNBERRY from Texas has sponsored that says, let's just get it done. Explore here, explore now, pay less. Drill here, drill now, pay less. Use the resources we have, and this country cannot only be great for ourselves, but we can also continue to be the resource for the rest of the world. 
   I thank you for the time you've given me. I wanted to give that commercial. 
   And Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity. And I give back my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (MICHAEL W. SCHRAGG POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of naming the Marshall, Michigan Post Office, a prominent post office in my district, the Seventh District of Michigan, the Michael W. Schragg Post Office. 
   Michael's life story has been recounted to some degree by my colleagues thus far, but he is one that is beloved in his community, family, and the American postal service. Michael served as Marshall's postmaster for 23 years and was the force behind the creation of the Marshall Postal Museum, the second largest postal museum in the United States, behind only the Smithsonian, as has been represented thus far. 
   Michael was born in Calhoun County and raised on the family farm in Ceresco, Michigan. He attended a one-room country school, the Francisco School in Ceresco, through the seventh grade, and he then went on to graduate from Marshall High School. Michael met his wife, Loretta, while working at the Robinson's department store as he attended Kellogg Community College. 
   Michael enlisted in the U.S. Army Post Office in June 1967 and served in Germany for 3 years. Michael and Loretta went on to have three children, two of whom embarked on postal careers of their own. 
   Michael started his postal career in Marshall, Michigan, as a substitute clerk carrier and quickly earned a promotion to supervisor. The following year he became the postmaster for Olivet, Michigan, only to return to Marshall, serving as the town's postmaster for 23 years. During his tenure in Marshall, the U.S. Postal Service named the Marshall Post Office an All-American Post Office. 
   Michael Schragg has been active in the Marshall community throughout his lifetime. He is a past president of the Marshall Rotary Club and continues to serve on the Marshall Historical Society. Michael's most noteworthy accomplishment is the creation of the Marshall Postal Museum. It is second only to the Smithsonian Postal Museum in size and is housed in the basement of the historic Marshall Post Office. 
   The Marshall Post Office building, a Greek revival architectural style with copper roof, was constructed in 1932 out of Marshall sandstone. The idea for the downstairs museum occurred during Marshall's 1987 Historic Home Tour. At that time Postmaster Schragg displayed a number of old postal artifacts throughout the building, which was on the historic tour that year. Many people thought the entire post office was a museum rather than an official working U.S. Post Office. After the tour Michael began organizing the collection of postal antiques in seven rooms in the basement and in an annex building behind the post office. 
   The Marshall Postal Museum has since become one of the cornerstones of the annual Marshall Historic Home Tour. It was part of a New York Times article about places in America worth visiting, and Michael and the museum have also been featured in Michigan Magazine. 
   Michael has taken some of the museum's displays on the road and, as has been mentioned, toured numerous States. Michael drove a vintage 1931 Model A mail delivery truck in President George W. Bush's first inaugural parade in Washington, DC. 
   Because of Michael's countless hours of work on the Marshall Postal Museum, his years of service to the United States Postal Service in Michigan, and his dedication to the Marshall community, naming the Marshall Post Office in his honor is a fitting tribute, and I urge the House to join me in support of H.R. 3446.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, in my home State of Michigan, we have hit some hard times, and recently things have become worse as Michigan's Governor and tax-hiking State legislators inflicted a massive tax increase on the people of Michigan. 
   While in Congress, I am going to do all I can to aid Michigan's comeback, providing incentives for manufacturers and their employees to innovate, grow and expand. For example, American auto manufacturers spend $20 billion a year on research and development, and such investment and innovation among American automakers should be encouraged. 
   One positive step Congress can immediately take to continue similar innovation is to make permanent the research and development tax credit. This legislation would keep high-tech, high-paying jobs in America by maintaining important incentives and enable American companies to grow, become more competitive globally, and ultimately result in additional high-paying American jobs. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2138, the research and development tax credit, and encourage further investment and growth in our great Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, since 1992, Michigan has not been able to control the millions of tons of trash entering our State from Canada, and the problem continues. Every day, over 400 trucks from Canada dump trash into our State. These trucks come barreling across the border without inspection and examination, raising a viable national security threat. 
   At this time, our State government has almost no say in whether or not Michigan should accept the over 4 million tons of trash and hazardous waste from Canada every year. Michigan instituted laws banning Canadian trash in 1988, but the Supreme Court struck down these laws a mere 4 years later and ruled that Congress has not granted such authority to our State. 
   For too long, Michigan has had its hands tied by the Federal Government, and it is time to let the decisions about the integrity and the safety of our land be made by those who inhabit the land. As a proud cosponsor of H.R. 518, I urge my colleagues to support the International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act and empower Michigan to make certain the beauty and safety of our land remains intact for generations of Michiganders to enjoy in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (TAXPAYER FREEDOM DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity tonight to be on this floor to speak on an issue that is near and dear to a lot of our hearts, and certainly a lot of our constituents' hearts, because tomorrow, April 23, is Taxpayer Freedom Day. It's an opportunity, for the first time this year, for taxpayers to start working for themselves and not simply for their government to pay taxes. 
   On April 15 we paid our taxes. On April 23, days beyond that, we come to a point where it is no longer an issue of working to pay just the taxes that each taxpayer needs to pay, but now we go on to do for ourselves what we can and should do that would allow us to do things for others that we would like to do as well, to benefit them, to meet needs that cannot simply be met by government, that can be met in special ways by ourselves. 
   This morning I had the privilege of being at a Big Brothers, Big Sisters breakfast fundraiser and hearing an outstanding speaker who was from business and industry, a leader in her own right with a major corporation in my district, and yet appealing to the fact that in the private sector, in charities and special functions, that there is a place for finding ways to do it better, quicker, faster, more efficiently and cheaper in the process, that there needs to be ways to collaborate in such a way that organizations that sometimes are redundant and overlap come together, if not to join forces as the same group, but to join forces in providing resources to each other that they don't have to duplicate. I said to the speaker afterwards, you know, that's, indeed, what government ought to be doing as well. 
   The only way we will do that, though, is by forcing ourselves to do things appropriately to allow the engine of our economy, that being the private sector, individual worker, entrepreneur, risk taker, business person, industry, to do for themselves only what they can do. And to do that, they certainly need to have the resources in place that will enable them to function successfully.     
   By having to work until April 23 just to pay taxes, that's not the right approach to accomplish that. 
   I recently was hooked on the HBO mini-series ``John Adams,'' a mini-series on the take-off on the book written by David McCullough, a noted historian on the Framers of our way of life here in the United States, our governmental system, the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and all that makes this country great. And I was again impressed by the character of the Framers of our system of government who saw freedom and liberty as the ultimate priority and saw that freedom and liberty ultimately flowing from individual property rights, individual rights to use resources that they had, and the opportunity ultimately in the Revolution to break away from the King and be able to control more of one's own largesse, limited or great as it might be. 
   I was impressed by the character of these gentlemen and those behind them, the men and women who supported them. I was impressed with the fact that they believed in people, in individuals, in their ability to make good decisions, their ability to choose well, their ability to spend their resources more wisely, more efficiently, and better, certainly, than a larger body known as the government. 
   They were also appreciative, Mr. Speaker, of the fact that these individuals, in greatness of their own hearts, could reach out and meet the medical needs, meet the security needs, meet the housing and care needs of individuals, and go beyond just themselves because they had ability to do that, if their government allowed them the liberty and freedom of choice because they had resources to do that as well. 
   I believe that our Framers never ever would have envisioned what we've come to today. They would have never envisioned that we, as individual taxpayers, would work until April 23, after paying taxes on April 15, just to pay the taxes that we paid on April 15. That is what they revolted for, that lack of liberty and choice in using their own resources. 
   Someone far more significant than I once said, ``The ability to tax is the ability to destroy.'' I can't talk about other States, and I'm delighted to have another Member with me on the floor tonight to discuss this issue as well, my friend and colleague and the freshman class president, of which I'm part, Bill Sali from Idaho. I can't talk, Congressman, about your State, but I can talk about Michigan, a great State, a great State of natural resources, surrounded on three sides by the Great Lakes if we count our upper peninsula, and I would not forget the Upers, surrounded on three and a half sides by the Great Lakes, with natural resources in the ground, growing on top of the ground, and with natural resources known as human resources that would be second to none. A State that has a history of producing things, of manufacturing, leading in manufacturing, developing the auto industry. The district of which I represent, right in the heart of it was where Henry Ford developed the whole process that has become the assembly line approach to the auto industry. 
   And yet this great State at this point in time sits at, sadly, the number one worst unemployment rate in the Nation. According to CEO Magazine last week, we rank the 49th worst business climate in the United States. We have people moving out of the State to find jobs. We have our friends in Indiana recruiting jobs from Michigan and doing it far more easily because of what we have done in our State. A State that truly is being destroyed by the ability to tax. 
   Most recently, the State legislature and our Governor went the wrong direction and frustrated any type of turnaround by increasing income tax, by putting a tax on services for the first time, and then putting a new business tax in place. And then having the cry come up from the taxpayer about the service tax, they rescinded that and put a surcharge on top of the business tax. And then we have the chutzpah in ads and otherwise that say that we are open for business. 
   I love my State. I love the people of my State. And I think we are Wolverines because we're tenacious, as de Tocqueville said. But we are frustrating the engine of the economy by the excessive taxation that we have put on. 
   I want to talk more about it, but I know Congressman Sali has much to say on this as well because, Congressman, you are known, first and foremost, as a man of principle, but a friend of the taxpayer, a man who came to Congress because of that agenda to provide less frustration and more opportunity for taxpayers. And I know that tomorrow you will rejoice that we have reached Taxpayer Freedom Day. But I know as well, my friend, that you wish it was far sooner than April 23. 
   I yield to my friend from Idaho.

   Mr. WALBERG. Reclaiming my time, if I could just pose a question on that, why would you say that government should not be flexible and mobile enough in order to deal with the changing of times? The right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness was the envisionment of the Framers of this wonderful country, this wonderful system of government as well. But as time went on and problems developed with a much larger country, what would you answer to the person who says we should be mobile and we should be flexible to meet the needs of people as it develops? I pose that to you knowing, I think, what your answer will be. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. WALBERG. I appreciate those thoughts. I think you got to the nub of the question. It's not the fact that we don't want people to have those entitlements, we don't want them to achieve, we don't want them to have the opportunity that is afforded to all of us here in the United States. But it's based upon the fact, first and foremost, that there is liberty for us to choose, there's liberty for us to be responsible, there's liberty for us to fail, even. And that is quite a liberty, when you think about it. But when we succeed, the liberty to keep and benefit from what we have, and in order to not only care for ourselves, but then voluntarily assist others, and what a liberty that is. 
   It was said of the Athenians, I read one place, that they desired most freedom, security, and prosperity. And in the end, they lost all of them because they weren't willing to keep liberty first and foremost. 
   So I appreciate your comments tonight on this eve of Taxpayer Freedom Day, where government often times says why celebrate that? It's your duty to pay the taxes, it's your privilege to pay taxes. Well, I do thank God that I have the opportunity to live in America and I have the opportunity to earn and I have the opportunity to pay a certain level of tax to support a certain level of government that is needed. But I am frustrated that we have gone way beyond that and lost liberty in the process. 
   I'd like to turn over now some time to another good friend and colleague from Tennessee. David Davis has been an outspoken friend of the taxpayer, and I think evidenced by his willingness to battle for the taxpayer and to continue to support prosperity that has blessed his State of Tennessee, and continues to, and sadly, has become home to a number of my Michiganders as well, who have gone for places of employment, and have benefited there. Congressman Davis, we hope to bring some of those back to Michigan. 
   In the meantime, I appreciate you taking the opportunity to talk about the issue of taxes, Tax Freedom Day, and your concerns with it.

   Mr. WALBERG. Well, I have a lot of comments on that, but you said it so well. I appreciate the commonsense approach from a place where Davy Crockett roamed. I know that for a fact. 
   Again, we are talking about, Congressman Davis, we are talking liberty. We are talking about people who say I am not asking for anything except the opportunities. I am willing to be responsible. Generally speaking, I am willing to be held accountable. If I have the resources to use, the resources to spend, if I have the resources to save, to invest, and take the risks as necessary, if I have a job that I can produce those resources and move further, all it says is that I get more liberty and I get full use of it. If I am tied to April 23 as my time when I can say I finished paying taxes for this year to the Federal Government, now I can buy for myself, but I have got to start thinking about paying taxes next year April 15 as well, it ties me back. 
   None of us here on the floor aren't saying there is some tax base that is necessary. But what we are saying is we have gone way overboard. When you pointed out that if the majority proposal Democrat budget goes through and it's paid for as they intend with a $683 billion tax increase, which was passed, which does away with all of those tax relief issues that we had in 2001 and 2003, and have benefited this great country since that time, and then it adds other things to it like the marriage penalty back into it, does away with the ending of the AMT, alternative minimum tax, an onerous regressive tax that's strapping down more of our taxpayers than ever were assumed to be in it. If we put all that in place, we see less liberty, less freedom, more opportunity for abuse by government that doesn't know how to say no.     
   We end up frustrating ourselves again, don't we.

   Mr. WALBERG. I thank my friend. I only have to think about the fact that to the taxpayer in my State, that if this $680 billion tax increase goes through to pay for additional spending, deficit spending, in a budget that goes way beyond what is necessary, it means that on top of the burden that my State government has given to the hard-working taxpayers of Michigan, it gives a $3,000 per taxpayer increase on January 1, 2011, automatically. And, like you, my taxpayers that I meet with each weekend back in the district and in the 140 town hall type meetings I have held since January 4th, they are not saying, Mr. Congressman, please give us more taxes. Please give us more gas tax. Please raise the cost of our fuels. They are not saying that at all. They are saying, give us some freedom. Give us some liberty. Give us some relief. Let us do for ourselves what we can and should do, if we have the resources to do it. So you hit it right on the head. 
   I am privileged tonight as well to have another good friend and colleague, a member of our freshman class, an outstanding spokesperson for the taxpayer, for all things that people like John Adams and Jefferson and Washington and others spoke for when they framed all that we are pleased with in the United States, the Congresswoman from Minnesota, Michele Bachmann. 
   I am sure you have significant things to say about this great event we have tomorrow, Tax Freedom Day. But looking on the other side of the picture, why in the world we have to have that type of a day so late in the year? 
   I yield to the Congresswoman from Minnesota.

   Mr. WALBERG. Well, it is very similar, if I might add, to see how large expenditures go out with so little oversight, and so much statement that, oh, well, it has to be done. If we don't do it, who will? And there are so many needs. 
   Well, there are. I mentioned earlier this evening I had the opportunity to attend a breakfast fundraiser for Boys and Girls Clubs in my area. They do a great work, and they are doing it on the basis of individual contributions, corporate entities that give not only financial support, but also human support as well. 
   The speaker, a president of a major industry in my area, she said it so eloquently, that it has come to a point in time where we have to find ways to reduce the cost by drawing together and not having redundancies that add cost, but become more efficient and more effective doing not only the same work, but more work for less cost as a result of the effort that is shared. 
   In government we have to get that concept. We have to understand that there is a person called the taxpayer, and a taxpayer that is not of unlimited resources, especially if we want to keep freedom around so that our children and grandchildren and great grandchildren will enjoy the benefits we have. If we are to pass it on to them in such a way that they will have equal or better freedoms than we had, we have to get on the stick. 
   So, absolutely, I have been floored since coming here that it is so easy to spend money in this Chamber without thought of actually who will generate those resources, and we frustrate the engine of the economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. It can't continue. If it does, we have lost it all. Jefferson said the government that governs best governs least. And it wasn't simply govern least to allow people less opportunity, but it is to give them more freedom; to give them more of their own resources to make better decisions for themselves, making better decisions on basic needs. 
   That was the genius of what we had here in a capitalistic system, a system that said we will offer freedom and opportunity. You make your choices, you determine your lifestyle. And, in turn, as we also encouraged through supplementing what went on in the home, what went on in the school, what went on in the church and making it a common theme that we are our brother's keeper, but it is with our own resources, with our own choices, the opportunity that we have to expand and meet needs of others. 
   Ultimately in doing that ourselves, we are also blessed. We also felt the warmth of saying I lifted someone up that was falling, and I also know that there are plenty of others who would come to my aid, individuals who are family members, who are community members right from my own area that would reach out, and, at last resort, if necessary, maybe there was something in the government. 
   But it is reversed now, where the first place we go is the government. Of course, that causes the ramp-up of costs that now results in the largest tax increase in the history of the United States being offered and passed just recently.     
   And, if allowed to be completed and my legislation isn't put in place to make permanent those tax relief issues of 2001 and 2003, we will have a $683 billion tax increase over the next 5 years, and on January 1, 2011, the taxpayers in my State and across the country, generally speaking, will pay upwards of $3,000 more the day after December 31 than the day before. That is not the way to go. We have to stop it. The taxpayers out there, whether they be in Tennessee, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, or Indiana, are all saying the same thing; they just want us to hear an answer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. And I appreciate that fact. There are good pieces of legislation, whether it be setting a cap on spending or setting a moratorium on earmarks, and looking at a way to get control of that so we are not wasting dollars. These are common-sense issues that taxpayers generally look at and say, what is the problem? This ought to be just common sense, to have a line item veto, to have a balanced budget amendment. All of the above speaks to the common taxpayer, which I am one and you are one and all of us who have spoken tonight are one. It speaks common sense to the taxpayer saying, this just ought to be the way it is, because we are willing to do for ourselves if you leave us the opportunity. 
   So I certainly appreciate your passion on this issue and the fact of your awareness of tax issues having been a tax attorney and understanding that, while there are taxes necessary, that we have gone way beyond the limit. We have gone beyond reality. 
   There is little debate right now on Capitol Hill about whether the American economy is struggling. That is just there. We recognize the fact. And some of us who are in States that are struggling even more so, like my own wonderful State of Michigan that has all of the resources available, and yet we are frustrated. The real conversation in living rooms across the country is about how to get our economy moving again. 
   Essentially, this debate boils down to one question, the question that I was asked in conversations in town hall meetings that I have in various ways, and that question is: Should America promote economic growth and job creation, or raise taxes to destroy jobs and economic opportunity? 
   Right now, Republicans, our colleagues are asking all House Members to decide which side of this debate they are on by forcing votes on a bill that I introduced that we have referred to tonight, that is the Tax Increase Prevention Act, House Resolution 2734. House Members have to choose whether they support Speaker Pelosi's budget proposal that in total is the largest single tax increase ever promoted in the history of the United States, a $3,000 per taxpayer tax increase overnight. 
   With so much money already being wasted in Washington, I believe it is wrong for Congress to try and take more money out of the paychecks of hard-working Americans. My bill, to make more point about it, would make permanent the tax relief of 2001 and 2003, and stop tax increases on raising children, earning money, saving and investing, operating a small business, adopting a child, paying off college loans, and even dying. 
   Consider the implications of the Democrat's proposed $680 billion tax increase in 2011 alone. Marginal income tax rates will increase by anywhere from 9 percent to 50 percent, with the lowest tax bracket receiving the highest tax rate increase. That is not talking to the rich and wealthy, that is talking again of the lowest tax bracket. Capital gains rates for individuals will increase dramatically, punishing saving and investing. Restoration of the marriage penalty tax, that is a punitive tax that thankfully we got rid of, and now they want to put it back. The child tax credit will be slashed 50 percent, raising taxes by $500 per child. The death tax will go from 0 percent to 55 percent. 
   I have always held the conviction that the American citizen should keep as much as their hard-earned money as possible. With Americans facing rising health care costs, high energy prices, and economic instability, the last thing families need is to be hit with a massive job killing tax increase. 
   Every week in my home State, I meet with Michiganders, as I did this weekend, who are working harder than ever before and at best breaking even. Michigan families and businesses have, unfortunately, felt firsthand the powerful negative impact of tax increases. These working families' wages have been slashed by higher taxes on income and on small businesses. During our Governor Jennifer Granholm's administration, Michigan has experienced job  losses, declining personal incomes, diminishing home values, and the highest unemployment rate in the Nation, sadly. By proposing a massive $3,000 per taxpayer tax increase, Democrats in this Congress are following the same failed blueprint that has threatened to ditch our economy in Michigan and destroy Michigan jobs. 
   Instead of working on tax hikes that ultimately make America less competitive, I believe Congress should stop this $683 billion money grab from taxpayers. Congress could better spend time eliminating ineffective and inefficient government programs, making health care more affordable, and passing any energy legislation to move America toward energy independence and reduce energy prices. 
   The debate over whether to raise taxes is just the beginning of a long battle over America's economic future. By making tax relief permanent and continuing to grow our economy, Congress can go an awful long way to restore the trust of the American people, build a better and brighter future for our country, and avoid the economic suffering now felt in States like Michigan. 
   It doesn't have to be that way. And I certainly appreciate the fact that there are those of us who are fighting for taxpayers' interests. I know the 13 of us who came in as freshmen came in for a reason. That is the smallest freshman class in the history of the United States, probably. But we came in resolute that the taxpayer was to be served; that taxpayers were paying too much, not too little; that we were regulating too much, not too little; that we were destroying the incentives of private hard-working citizens, risk takers, entrepreneurs to do the job that they can only do. Government doesn't do that. And that is why 13 of us came while others lost and weren't sent back because of overspending and overtaxing. 
   And it is sure a privilege to join with the both of you here in the room tonight. I guess I would offer opportunity for any final comments before we are forced to close this interesting conversation this evening, hopefully of benefit to the taxpayers out there on this eve of tax freedom day. Hopefully it has been interesting, but more than that, it has been something that would stir them into action as well to say: Enough is enough, and we stand for freedom.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (TAXPAYER FREEDOM DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. And, again, I trust this has been helpful for taxpayers to hear at least some that will defend. And there are others in this Congress. It has been said that we are red state, blue state, totally divided in this country. When you get to the common-sense issues, the virtues that people see as common sense, we are not divided, we are not red state, blue state. We are a common based unified people that believe in common sense things. 
   Jonathan Witherspoon, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, said: A Republic once equally poised must either preserve its virtue or lose its liberty. Virtue of hard work, the virtue of risk taking and entrepreneurial spirit, the virtue of accountability, of responsibility, of honesty, of integrity, those are virtues. And they go all into what makes our country great and what our taxpayers generally commit themselves to on a common base. And when we break down those virtues and give those away, we destroy ourselves and our liberty in the process. 
   So let's fight together to stop this $683 billion tax grab that will frustrate this country and take it back as opposed to pressing it forward. I thank my colleagues for spending this time with me tonight. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise with my colleague from Vermont to voice strong support for H. Res. 1020, which expresses the commitment of this Congress to our injured heroes, ensures they're receiving the highest quality of health care available and encourages all Americans to show support and appreciation for our veterans. 
   Today, I want to take time to thank all of the servicemen and -women and their families for their sacrifices. I know the pride of having a son serve in the United States military, and my wife, Sue, and I pray every day for the safety of our fighting men and women abroad and here at home. 
   When our soldiers go into battle, we can all agree that they deserve the best training, equipment, and necessary resources to accomplish their mission. Congress has an obligation to care for America's wounded heroes when they return home from the battlefield. I believe the least we can do is to provide the highest quality medical care to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces when they're injured defending the freedoms that we enjoy. 
   Right now, we have more wounded warriors returning home than ever before because of improved medical technology and advanced equipment to transport our sick and wounded. The thousands of men and women serving in the military who have been wounded serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and other wars deserve the best treatment and care available. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in a nonpartisan manner to make sure Congress delivers on our responsibility. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 1020 and support our wounded warriors.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (THE FEDERAL BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Right now, taxpayers in south central Michigan are making tough choices every day to ensure their family budgets are balanced. They do so by cutting spending and having fiscal discipline. It's time we make these same commonsense choices on a Federal level. 
   This week in the House, we will begin debating a budget plan for the fiscal year 2008. A budget proposal introduced by my colleagues on the opposite side  of the aisle would impose the largest tax increase in American history, nearly $400 billion over the next 5 years. Their plan would institute a $3,000 tax increase for every typical Michigander and put off needed entitlement reform for at least another 5 years. 
   Congress needs to pass a balanced budget bill without raising taxes. We need to make tax relief permanent for hardworking American families and reform unsustainable entitlements. The American people long for a Congress that puts our fiscal house in order on a Federal level, but they want this done without expanding the size and scope of the Federal Government. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose any budget plan that proposes a ``spend now, reform later'' mentality.

   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to draw attention to an honor recently received by my home community back in Lenawee County, Michigan. America's Promise--The Alliance for Youth, a foundation formed in 1997 to help children and youth from all socioeconomic sectors in the United States, recently named Lenawee County one of the 100 best communities for young people as part of its 10-year anniversary celebration. 
   The criteria for winning included strong community support of children and youth, possessing valuable resources for children and youth, youth and child outcomes, overall progress within communities, and innovations in the areas of policy, practice, and resources. 
   Communities in 38 States received this award and Lenawee County is one of the five communities in the Great Lakes State to be named a winner. This recognition is a tribute to all of the police officers, local officials, firefighters, outstanding teachers, community leaders and civil servants that make Lenawee County and south-central Michigan a great place to live.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud Michigander today to express my profound respect and appreciation and admiration for the life and public service of our 38th President. 
   President Gerald Ford was a man of impeccable integrity and ethics who served valiantly in World War II on the USS Monterey, where he came close to losing his life in December of 1944. After returning home to Michigan, his calling remained in public service to his country. He ran for the Grand Rapids area congressional seat against an incumbent Republican congressman. Nobody thought he could win. But with a strong conviction and a clear contrast between the two, he won two-to-one in the primary.     
   President Ford went on to serve 25 years in the U.S. House and was voted in 1961 by the House membership as a ``Congressman's Congressman.'' Rising to the rank of Republican leader, he was known for his modesty, his intelligence and thoughtfulness throughout his career. After Ford became President, his decisions that he made, though costing him politically, healed a fractured Nation. Today, we thank him for putting our country ahead of his own political success. 
   May we never forget this great Michigander, and may the Lord's blessings be upon his family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, like the majority of my constituents, I believe that any and all attempts to enact immigration reform must not include amnesty for lawbreakers. 
   My constituents are tired of empty promises from Washington, DC, and we must address our Nation's immigration problems in a way that produces real results. 
   Many Americans are divided on what immigration reform should entail, but on one point almost all Americans agree. We must secure our borders. With a secured border, we can build on solutions to strengthen our country and maintain our heritage of embracing legal immigrants. 
   We need to create a work permit program that meets the evolving needs of today's agriculture industry. Serious reform is also needed to bring an end to the massive amount of bureaucratic red tape in our immigration system. 
   The crafters of the immigration bill currently being debated in the Senate are misguided on how to fix America's immigration problem. And on behalf of the American people, I urge my colleagues to secure our borders and enact commonsense immigration reforms.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   And just to make sure that my constituents know that I have not changed States, it's Michigan. It starts with an ``M,'' it's up north, it's cold, generally. I can understand that. But I'm sure proud to represent Michigan, and more importantly, the Seventh District of Michigan in this great House of Representatives. 
   Tonight I am committed to talking about an issue that is of extreme importance to my constituents, and in fact from what we read, constituents of all of our districts all over this great United States because we are in a time and place and setting right now that, frankly, we aren't used to. 
   And may I submit tonight to all who would listen that, frankly, I don't think we should ever get used to it for America is too great of a Nation and has been the ambassador of great blessing to the rest of the world in many cases. It has set the course, has charted the way toward greater economic achievement, standard of living, advances in technology, business, industry, education, medicine, and transportation. 
   I happen to come from the district where Henry Ford had his home, made homes and schools for his employees in a great part of my district, used the resources from that district, including during some wartimes some Sassafras trees just three miles from my house that were used to make a light but strong frame for his motor cars with the absence of steel at that point in time because of the war effort. 
   I come from the State that has been known as the Motor Capital of the World, Michigan. Detroit has set the standard that the rest of the world has followed, emulated, copied, and sometimes even expanded upon, and yet still America, Michigan, the Motor Capital, charts the way. 
   Just the other day--I tell this story for a purpose, but just the other day I had something of an experience happen to me that has never happened before, nor did I expect it to happen. I filled the tank of my Harley Davidson motorcycle, which has a 5-gallon tank, and it cost me over $20. Now, for those of you that have ridden motorcycles, it is almost unbelievable to think that a vehicle that gets great gas mileage, that has a small tank like that would ever cost double digits, let alone over $20 to fill. But that's the place we're in right now with gas today on average across the United States at $4.04 a gallon. My Harley happens to take premium. So I paid $4.27 a gallon for that 5-gallon tank fill.     
   Less than 2 years ago, very seldom, if ever, would I double-digit fill my tank, even if it were on empty. Now, I don't ride my Harley Davidson for transportation anymore. 
   It's primarily for recreation, but 38 years ago when I started riding my first motorcycle it was for transportation, to get to and from my work.  Over the course of successive years, I would use my motorcycle in the better seasons of the year, the warmer time, to ride to work and enjoy that experience but also as commuting. I don't do that anymore, but we're paying gas prices now that should not be part and parcel of what America is. 
   We talk a lot about energy independence and being willing to compete and make sure that the rest of the world has to compete with us, as opposed to the other way around. And yet, up to this very day, in the outcome of what has gone on in Congress, it has been just talk and no action. 
   Last week, I heard the governor of our great State of Michigan announce on a major radio talk show that she was now riding a bicycle to the Capitol from her governor's residence each day, and when the host expressed concern about her safety, she said, oh, no problem, my security detail are following me on their bicycles as well. 
   Now, that's a nice story. I don't give any negatives toward our governor for being efficient in her use of energy resources, but you've got to understand that, when I heard that, it shocked me. And in fact, if not angered, it frustrated me to think that the governor of the motor capital of the world was riding a bicycle to work, even though she has an energy efficient, flex-fuel vehicle that I've seen her use and seen her actually fill the gas tank with fuel. 
   Right now, more importantly, getting to the real world of real people, people who pay those gas prices each day, people who pay their taxes, that includes supporting this Congress in what we do, right now most Michigan families that I know of, as I go back to my district each weekend, are giving up things like nights out eating at restaurants or family vacations or traveling to family events in order to cover the rising cost of gasoline. If Congress does not take action soon, families will be giving up much more than that. They will be giving up very specific needs, necessities in their life. And in fact, what I've heard in many town hall meetings, some are already giving up even necessities of their life in order to pay for the gasoline to get to their workplace the next day in order to sometime hopefully pay for some of these necessities. 
   Just this past weekend, AAA announced that the nationwide average gas price finally reached over $4 per gallon. It's been much higher in Michigan for several weeks. High gas prices are affecting families, truckers, farmers, small business owners. I met a small business owner in my office today who said the cost of transporting copy machines, office equipment to and from her client is getting almost prohibitive. Emergency services, public safety, and numerous other entities in Michigan's Seventh District and all over this U.S. are being negatively affected by the high cost, and I say the unnecessarily high cost, of fuel. 
   Despite fuel costs at levels previously only seen in Europe, leadership in this Congress refuses to increase American energy production. Instead, Speaker Pelosi and leading House Democrats would rather increase taxes on domestic energy production and increase our reliance on OPEC or, as suggested last week, sue OPEC for what all that's worth. 
   On a related note, the United States Department of Commerce recently announced the U.S. trade deficit reached its highest level in 13 months in April. Our trade deficit also increased by $4.1 billion between February 2007 and February 2008. 
   This is why our country is facing a rising trade deficit, even though American-made exports grew by 12 percent in 2007. The issue related to energy and the cost of energy has a direct influence on this. This is why we need to provide incentives to increase America's investment in alternative energy and overall production of energy. 
   The United States imports around 12 million barrels of oil a day, and a barrel of oil has gone from $70 to $140 over the last year, dramatically increasing our trade deficit. Our reliance on imported oil and increased oil prices means we are sending even more money to foreign countries and some that don't like us very much at all and certainly don't share our interests. 
   For both economic and national security purposes, and again, I want to reiterate that, national security purposes, Congress needs to finally get serious about an energy plan that truly lowers prices at the pump, reduces our dependence on foreign oil, and makes real progress towards energy independence. Instead of increasing our dependence on OPEC, America needs to return energy production to the United States. Doing so will create American jobs and provide needed economic stability and transportation that's efficient and usable to our American taxpayer. 
   The answer to our current energy crisis must be multi-pronged, and I have cosponsored legislation to provide incentives along those lines for solar, wind, cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel and other green alternatives. We must increase domestic energy production through carbon-free nuclear power and clean coal technology as well. I'm also cosponsoring legislation that would encourage conservation with tax credits for green buildings and legislation that would spark a revolution in clean hydrogen technology. 
   There are many sources where we can move toward if we're willing to dig down deep and do what's necessary and walk away from those unnecessarily strong, critical, excessive environmental forces that don't speak to the welfare of this great country. 
   Today, I introduced a discharge petition, something that isn't done regularly in Congress, something that isn't successful regularly but has been. I trust that this discharge motion will be. As of this point in time, with just a few hours with that discharge motion being on the floor, 93 of my colleagues have signed on, moving toward the 218 that are necessary. 
   This petition, if effective with 218 signatures, will force a vote on Congressman Mac Thornberry's No More Excuses Energy Act, an Act suitably entitled, legislation to increase U.S. energy production and invest in alternative sources of energy as well. 
   This appropriately named legislation would impact the price at the pump and lower electric bills. It would encourage the construction of new refineries, boost alternative energy, supplemental energy development by extending the wind production tax credit for 10 years, giving some certainty that if I were to invest in wind energy production, I would have a reasonable amount of time to see a return on my investment. 
   It would increase American oil production by allowing environmentally sound drilling in Alaska, the Outer Continental Shelf and the Gulf of Mexico, and it would help increase our supply of electricity by encouraging the construction of new nuclear power plants. Even leaders, in fact, one of the founders of Greenpeace, have come out strongly encouraging the use of nuclear power as being clean, green energy, not given over to continuing production of greenhouse gases. 
   Rather than increase taxes on domestic energy production, as some in Congress have proposed, I'm working to pass sound legislation that will bring down the price of gas and reduce our dependence on Middle East oil. Legislation like the No More Excuses Energy Act of Mac Thornberry would increase the supply of American energy and increase the number of good paying jobs in this country and in my district, the Seventh District of Michigan. 
   Policies such as a 23-year moratorium on exploring and developing offshore production of clean and green natural gas need to be lifted in order to lower prices and reduce our dependence on foreign gas. Natural gas provides 23 percent of our Nation's energy. It should be more. And America is the only developed Nation that prohibits offshore production and exploration of this clean, green, clean burning resource, and Americans are paying higher electricity and heating bills as a result of this. 
   Like all of you, I'm tired of paying these high prices. Whether it's for my motorcycle, whether it's for my car or whether it's for my pick-up truck, I'm tired of paying this because it's unnecessary, as we've done nothing to change that except talk, and it's time to put action into place. 
   I know high prices are affecting all of us. This is unacceptable. It is unacceptable for America to put up with this. The good people of south central Michigan, the good people of Michigan, the good people of the rest of the States in this wonderful country who depend on gasoline or diesel to get to work, drive their kids to baseball practice and visit family members deserve better.  
   The volunteers who offer to drive veterans to VA hospitals in my district and other districts in other States deserve better. 
   The volunteers who offer to drive Meals on Wheels to needy senior citizens deserve better than this. 
   Our churches and synagogues, our places of worship all across this great country that will be looking at looming fuel bills that many will be unable to pay this coming heating season deserve better than this because America doesn't need to be in this situation. 
   So I'm delighted that tonight I'm joined by a number of my colleagues who will add to what has been stated already, probably more eloquently, with points of experience that come from all over this country. I appreciate their commitment to doing something more than talking about energy independence, doing something more than talking about resuming America's position of leading the world in all areas, including the area of energy production and usage. 
   We have blessed the world with our standard of living, with our technology and with our energy, and it is time to get about that project again. 
   So at this time, I would like to ask my good friend and colleague from Georgia, Dr. Paul Broun, to add to what has been said. I appreciate you taking the time to be with us this evening.

   Mr. WALBERG. And for those nations that love America and appreciate America, we're not standing in a  strengthened position that we can afford to them the assurance that America will be there when necessary because we can take care of ourselves, we're independent. And I think those are issues you bring up. 
   I'm delighted that we have the Dean of the Michigan delegation here, Congressman Fred Upton, who has been here through a lot and I'm sure has taken a lot of grief on this issue. 
   And Congressman Upton, before I turn to you, let me just, for the record, state, as you and some of my longer serving Republican colleagues are chastised for not getting this done in the House, you have attempted to get it done on numerous occasions. If we look back at the last decade, by the numbers, votes on ANWR exploration: House Republicans, 91 percent support it; House Democrats, 86 percent opposed. 
   Coal-to-liquid: House Republicans, 97 percent support it; House Democrats, 78 percent opposed. Oil shale exploration: House Republicans, 90 percent supported every vote on that in the House; House Democrats, 86 percent opposed. 
   Moving to the Outer Continental Shelf exploration, where right now foreign countries like Japan, China and Mexico are within 44-50 miles of our shores, and they are drilling and taking out natural gas and oil. On these votes, House Republicans, 81 percent support it; House Democrats, 83 percent opposed. 
   And then finally, refinery increased capacity, and now that we're offering the ``no-more-excuses'' Energy Act, the opportunity to put them on abandoned military facilities, government lands, House Republicans, 97 percent support it; House Democrats, 96 percent opposed. 
   Who is willing to take action? Who has evidenced that by their votes in this great body, this House of Representatives? Republicans, 91 percent, when you put it all together, of House Republicans have historically voted to increase the production of American-made oil and gas while 86 percent of House Democrats have historically voted against increasing the production of American-made 
   oil and gas. 
   And so why do we see an ``energy-less'' energy bill that you talked about that gives incentives for bicycle riding and not energy? I think we have to say it's a leadership problem. So I thank you for bringing up those points. 
   Congressman Upton, from my home State of Michigan, I want to turn it over to you as well for a little perspective.

   Mr. WALBERG. If my colleague could yield just a moment here on one point that ties into that. We heard yesterday from one of our Senate colleagues from a northern State, a northeastern State, say that what we ought to do is buy one million barrels a day from Saudi Arabia. That would reduce the cost at the pump by about 50 cents. Well 50 cents right now would be great. But why not take that from ANWR? We can get one million barrels per day from ANWR right now, we are told, at least that, if we are to take it from there, and not have to buy it from any other foreign country, have it shipped to us from any other foreign country, and use it exactly like you said down here to make this great country run on its own fuel as opposed to buying from someplace else.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer a few thoughts as regarding the importance of National Bible Week as well. It has been thrilling to hear my colleagues from both sides of the aisle refer to the importance of Scripture, and especially encouraging to hear the distinguished Representative from Illinois (Mr. Rush), who represents the district I was born in. I appreciate the sincerity of your message this evening. 
   As a pastor in a previous life myself, I can unequivocally say that the Bible has deeply influenced my life every day in every way. Sadly, I haven't followed it every day in every way. But when it has been followed, it has influenced to the good. 
   The Bible is the best selling book of all time. It is a book that has touched countless numbers of lives. Along with being the main influence, many decisions have been made of by the billion, most importantly and most personally, my life and my faith in my Savior. 
   In 1940, a group of business and professional leaders got together and founded the nonprofit, independent, educational National Bible Association. Their goal was to encourage Americans to read the Bible in every sector of society, regardless of religious or political distinction. Every year since 1941, the National Bible Association has sponsored National Bible Week as a time to remind us of the importance of the Bible in our daily life. 
   Our Nation's traditions lie in the principles set out in the Bible. In 1951, an amazing book was published by the National Education Association and it was entitled, ``The American Citizens Handbook.'' The book's author and publisher said that ``This volume should be in every home library and on every teacher's desk. It may well be used as a text or reference book in the schools,'' and it was. 
   In fact, in that book, it had a grade-by-grade chart that included the following: 
   Second graders were to memorize the Lord's prayer: ``Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.'' 
   Third graders were to memorize Psalm 23: ``The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.'' 
   Seventh graders were to memorize the Beatitudes: ``Blessed are the poor in spirit, the merciful, the hungry in spirit.'' 
   Ninth graders were to memorize Psalm 1, that beautiful Psalm that says, ``Happy is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law he meditates day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth fruit in his season. His fruit shall not wither.'' 
   Those are principles that were put forth in this book. High school seniors were to memorize the entire chapter of Romans 12, which begins by saying, ``I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God.'' 
   Those were patterned after the Founders of our country. Fifty-two of the 55 signers of the Declaration of Independence were deeply committed Christians, and the other three believed in a God who personally intervened in the lives of mankind. The same Continental Congress formed the American Bible Society, of all things, and purchased 20,000 copies of Scripture for the people of the Nation. 
   Patrick Henry's famous ``give me liberty or give me death'' speech actually  came at the end of this statement, where he said, ``An appeal to arms and the God of hosts is all that is left us. But we shall not fight our battle alone. There is a just God that presides over the destinies of nations. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone. Is life so dear or peace so sweet to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, almighty God.'' Patrick Henry understood the power and the content of Scripture. 
   Jonathan Whitherspoon, who was a minister and signed the Declaration of Independence, said ``A republic, once equally poised, must either preserve its virtue or lose its liberty.'' Jonathan Whitherspoon knew that that virtue came from the Holy Scriptures, the Bible. 
   This Chamber and all the institutions of this great Republic are surrounded by images and phrases from Scripture. In this very Chamber is a portrait of Moses, the first lawgiver. The Supreme Court also holds several images of Moses. The south frieze prominently displays Moses holding Ten Commandments. In the Library of Congress stands a large statue of Moses alongside a statue of the Apostle Paul. The Great Reading Room of the Library is filled with Scriptures. 
   So today, to be able to stand here in the Halls of Congress and to call attention to the impact of Biblical authority, what a great opportunity that is. I thank the God of Scripture for that opportunity, and I thank my colleagues for bringing this to the floor tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Chairman, after months of bipartisan work in the House Agriculture Committee on a farm bill that meets the needs of American farmers without raising taxes, House leadership is inserting a 600 percent tax increase on U.S. subsidiary manufacturers in the 2007 farm bill. Democrats want to slap manufacturers, who employ 5.1 million American workers and pay $325 billion in wages, with a massive tax hike. 
   As representative of a State and a district where the agricultural and manufacturing industries account for a larger share of employment on average than in the rest of the Nation, this is a double slap in the face. 
   Many are not aware that Michigan, the auto capital of the world, is second in the Nation in agricultural diversity. Not only do I feel like the months I spent canvassing my district meeting with farmers and members of the agricultural community were for naught, I am also deeply worried about the impact of this proposed tax hike on south central Michigan.     
   In the Wolverine State, U.S. subsidiaries play a vital role in supporting jobs and employing 201,000 Michiganers. 
   I just inquire of the other side: Why are we moving away from policies that encourage job development and investment? And what is a tax increase on manufacturers even doing in the farm bill? 
   The Ag Committee put aside partisan differences and worked together on a bill that meets the needs of American farmers without raising taxes. The House should be voting on that bill, crafted in a bipartisan manner, that meets those needs without foisting this on the public.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2419, FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule. For several months, the House Agriculture Committee worked in a bipartisan manner to pass a bill that would make historic investments in conservation, nutrition and renewable energy, while maintaining strong support for American farmers. The committee put aside partisan differences and worked together on a bill that meets the needs of American farmers, without raising taxes. 
   Today House leadership has brushed aside months of hard work by Republicans and Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee and decided to insert a 600 percent tax increase on manufacturers who employ 5.1 million Americans workers and pay $325 billion in wages. Additionally, the anticompetitive Davis-Bacon provision included in this bill would drive up the  cost of building ethanol plants and discourage alternative energy production. 
   Yet today, this rule does not allow Members a vote on striking these provisions. Right now, governments throughout the world are cutting taxes for job traders to attract investment. The Democratic proposal will drive investment and jobs out of America and greatly diminish America's competitiveness. 
   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I strongly oppose this rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (ENERGY SOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. I thank the gentlelady from Minnesota for hosting this hour and leading us in it. And you're absolutely right. Michigan is hurting. People are angry. They are fearful. They're worried about things that they seem to feel they have no control over. And this is an issue that is number one on their mind. The bottom line is, they do not agree with the Democratic majority that says that their strategy right now on lowering gas prices is ``to drive small cars and wait for the wind.'' 
   That very week that that statement was made, I was spending some time back in the district, and I had the opportunity to pump gas. I would walk up to a car in a gas station and say, hi, I'm Congressman Tim Walberg, and if you'll allow me to pump your gas for you, I would like to hear what you have to say about energy, your ideas, your comments, your concerns. 
   And the talking points came right from my playbook without even indicating to them where I was standing on the issue. The people of Michigan in my district that I talked to, one after another, these were just general random picks at the gas station, said, we need to drill now. We need to drill the Outer Continental Shelf. We need to drill ANWR. We need to use nuclear power. We need to conserve. We need to use biofuels. We need to use wind, solar energy. Across the board, they get it. 
   And so our agenda as Republicans has been, and I think it needs to continue to be until we get relief and get the answer, agree to, that is to hold a vote to increase the production of American-made energy before we go home for our break. It's the only thing that we ought to do. The people are asking for it. And the leadership, Mr. Speaker, needs, needs to let us have these votes that will allow it. 
   I talked to a lady at the gas station that I was pumping. And she first said, do you really want to hear my concern? I said absolutely. And she said, I work at the University of Michigan Hospital. I drive from Adrian, Michigan, to Ann Arbor. And I have had to choose now, and it has worked out with the hospital that I go only 2 days a week. I work two 8-hour shifts back to back each of those days so I don't have to drive as much and I can spend the time at home with my family. Then she turned and she said, my daughter here is 13 years old. She was in the car with her. She said, when I was 16 years of age and got my driver's license, on Friday nights generally I had a battle royal with my father arguing why I should be allowed to have the keys to the car to go out with my friends. And then her face saddened as she said to me, my daughter won't have that opportunity to argue with me, because when she asks for those keys, the only answer is, we don't have the fuel to do that. And she said that is a part of childhood, that is a part of the teenage years. That is just traditional. And we are giving that away, along with many other things we have talked about tonight. 
   So what are we going to do about it? Well, we don't just talk about it. There are at present bills in committee that would do all of the above that we have talked about. There are five discharge petitions on the floor of the House at this point in time, one that I have offered that would bring out of committee for a vote the No More Excuses Energy Act that simply says get it done, use anything that we can here in this country to be totally independent. That has not been agreed to yet. We have another discharge on expanding American refinery capacity using closed military installations. It makes all good sense to get on with refinery. The third one that is on the floor is to repeal the ban on acquiring alternative fuels like shale oil, tar sands and coal-to-liquid technology. It's amazing we won't bring that bill to the floor to vote on. The people want it.     
   A fourth that is on the floor is the Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Act which makes all good sense because that also can be used in our fighter planes. 
   And a final one that came on this week was the Fuel Mandate Reduction Act of 2007 which says let's suspend the boutique fuels, the special blends that add additional costs when they come to the pump. 
   People in my district, which is the largest ag district in the State of Michigan, are frustrated with the costs that go into food and its production, and all of the above, and they are saying the time is now, not drive small cars and wait for the wind. 
   I know my good friend, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. McCotter) has a different district than I have, but I bet that your people are saying basically the same thing.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (A QUARTERLY REPORT CARD -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Thank you, Congressman McCarthy. I certainly appreciate the opportunity to bring not only an update on Michigan, but to talk to the American public about concerns that I have about the budget and what goes on in these great halls. 
   Indeed, it has been a wonderful privilege to serve here. As I listened to colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the hour preceding, I would agree that it is a privilege to serve with men and women of sincerity, of character and commitment and of passion. And although we have disagreements, we serve in a body that has tremendous impact and tremendous history. 
   Yet even as I say that, I recognize that we are simply temporary custodians of the seats we hold in Congress, representing districts of people, taxpayers, citizens with great concerns. But even more importantly, as I have heard discussed maybe a bit too often about the extent of abilities that reside here in the Halls of Congress in each of our Members and the background and the training and the expertise that we share, yet I think that misses the point because indeed the greatness, the ideas, the generation of the economy and impact upon this world does not necessarily come from us, although we are part of it, but it flows from the people we represent. 
   That's the greatness of this country that allowed great men who journeyed from afar like de Tocqueville, to say America is great because America is good. But when America ceases to be good, it will cease to be great. I think de Tocqueville understood that goodness was not simply in the high morals of a country that he noticed here, it wasn't simply in the great work ethic of the people he saw on these shores. And as he walked across Michigan and came away, and it is reported that he called our State the Wolverine State because he indicated that any citizen who could put up with the swamps and the mosquitoes of Michigan at that time had to be a wolverine in tenacity. Hence, the Wolverine State. 
   Yet our great country of citizens have to be tenacious as well when we have a government that has grown too large, too grand, and too costly for them to keep up. The greatness of this country is not big, expansive, expensive government, but rather, the greatness of this country is its people. 
   And so this week we came to Tuesday, April 17, and it was imperative to us, and it was significant in its gravity that it was tax day again, a day that strikes fear and even anger in the hearts and minds of many, if not most, of our taxpayers. We sat here in Congress in these hallowed halls of constitutional responsibility having just come through passing the largest tax increase in the history of our country, $400 billion over the next 5 years. And we let our taxpayers go through another tax day paying more for big government. 
   Right now, taxpayers in south central Michigan, the district I am privileged to represent as the temporary custodian of its seat in Congress, people who are hardworking, people who have committed themselves to the task of being good stewards of the wonderful resources we have in the Great Lakes State, of being the former arsenal of democracy, of being a major manufacturing State and agricultural State and State of higher education, and yet a State that is struggling right now, I am sad to say, because of an administration that continues to push higher taxes and more excessive government regulation. We are saddled again with looking at what Congress has potentially done to us by passing this massive spending package called a budget with a $400 billion tax increase over the next 5 years. 
   Taxpayers in my district of south central Michigan are making tough choices every day to ensure their family budgets are balanced. They do so by cutting spending and having fiscal discipline, a concept we would do well to emulate. 
   It is time we make these same commonsense choices on a Federal level. The budget proposal introduced by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and, in fact, passed by them imposes the largest tax increases, as I said, in American history: $400 billion over the next 5 years, $400 billion that the taxpayers of this country will pay, that the businesses will have impact upon them and their ability to give jobs and security to the taxpayers and their workers. 
   Like the Democrats', as I would call it, ``insecurity supplemental'' that telegraphed their plan for defeat to our enemies, this budget telegraphs their plan for economic failure if we continue down that path for this great country. Their plan institutes a $3,000 tax increase for the typical Michigander in my district and embraces a spend now-reform later mentality. 
   You just have to go to some of the basic concepts of their proposal. The Democrat budget would hit 115 million taxpayers with an almost $1,800 tax increase in 2011. In addition, 26 million small business owners would see their tax bill rise by almost $4,000 that year. Marriage penalty relief would be eliminated for 23 million taxpayers, who would see their taxes increase on average by $466 by 2011. Raising taxes on families with children, it would hurt 31 million taxpayers who would see their taxes increase on average by $859 by 2011. 
   Those are just highlight scenarios of what is going 
   on with that tax increase. 
   Congress needs to pass a balanced budget bill without raising taxes. We need to make tax relief permanent for hardworking American families and implement a commonsense policy for the future. That is why I was proud to support the Republican alternative budget proposal. 
   The benefits of our proposal, just a few highlights, 113 million taxpayers will see, if this were passed, their taxes decline by an average of $2,200. A family of four earning $40,000 will receive tax relief of over $2,000. More than 5 million individuals and families will see their income liabilities completely eliminated. Forty-five million families with children will receive an average tax cut of almost $3,000. Fifteen million elderly individuals will receive average tax relief of almost $3,000. Twenty-seven million small business owners, the breadbasket of the economy in my district, will save on average $4,700. A total of 7.6 million new jobs would be created under this proposal. An average of 168,000 new jobs a month could be created as well. 
   I think the message is clear, Mr. Speaker. This is the direction we need to go for this great country that has taken on challenges not only within our borders, but to continue doing what we are accustomed to doing as the greatest and most benevolent nation on this Earth because of what we have done to encourage wealth and prosperity and responsibility and accountability and benefits from all of that. That blessing that goes beyond our shores and makes an impact upon people that I had the privilege of seeing, whose beneficiaries came from sources that I talked with in Walter Reed Hospital today, the young men and women who served valiantly for us, who sacrificed for us to continue the progress and continue the benevolence of this great people. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people long for a Congress that puts our fiscal house in order on a Federal level, but they want it done without expanding the size and scope of Federal Government. 
   They are asking for the greatness to continue within the people of this great country which would include this great government if we would indeed recognize where that greatness comes from. 
   So what a privilege again to be a temporary custodian of this seat in Congress, but what a huge responsibility to stand firmly for principles that will, if enacted, as we have seen historically 100 percent of the time, expand the economy, expand the opportunity, and offer freedom, opportunity and prosperity for our citizens and others all around this Earth. 
   Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, and the gentleman from California, Congressman McCarthy, thank  you for putting this Special Order together this evening.

   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding and for putting this together. 
   And I would agree with my colleague from Ohio. And it is tough for a Michigander to agree with anyone from the Buckeye State. We have wonderful rivalries that go on. But he is absolutely correct. We are talking about the future. We are talking about our kids. 
   I have a grandson, Micah, that I want to invest for by leaving a country that he indeed can have invested in for himself from his parents and the opportunity for them to use their resources to provide for him and provide for others in the process. 
   I have become greatly concerned with the concept that we have heard from the other side of the aisle too often about investing in our great economy. And ``investing'' in their vernacular means tax increases, spending more of government dollars which, in fact, are taxpayers' dollars. 
   We need to get away from that and allow our taxpayers, the generator of the economy, of a small business, of the manufacturer, the entrepreneur to be able to invest in themselves to make this great country stand not on its government but stand on its independence, its freedom. Because, Mr. Speaker, I am sure you and I would agree on this, that our responsibility here, as Members of Congress, is to fight for and defend and continue the freedom of this great country. And that comes with the ability for people to invest, to save, to spend, to enjoy their property, to be responsible and experience the virtues of hard work, of loyalty, of faithfulness. 
   I believe Jonathan Witherspoon said, ``A republic must either preserve its virtue or lose its liberty.'' 
   It is a virtue for this country to reward its citizens for being responsible. It is a virtue for this country to applaud people who work hard, who save, invest, who create the economy. And it is a virtue for that same group of people, our citizens, to say to a government, we respect you for leaving that responsibility to us. That is freedom. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I am deeply, deeply indebted to the people of my district for giving me the privilege to fight for that very thing along with colleagues like you have heard tonight on this floor.

   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, several years ago, my wife and I had the privilege of having a Liberian refugee stay in our home for almost a year. 
   This gentleman came from dire circumstances in his homeland, as his wife was brutally assaulted, and he was beaten and forced to leave his country. He still has scars from being beaten with the blunt end of a rifle. 
   Like thousands of other Liberians forced to leave their homeland, our  friend came to the United States under temporary protective status. One of the unintended consequences of the temporary protective status is it didn't foresee that civil war would continue in Liberia for several years, leaving refugees in America stuck in a state of flux. 
   Currently all Liberian refugees living in the United States under temporary protective status have until October of this year, and then they will be forced to return to Liberia. 
   The Liberian Refugee Immigration Protection Act of 2007, a bipartisan bill introduced by Representatives Kennedy, Ellison and myself, would allow Liberians in the United States on temporary protected status the opportunity to apply for permanent residency status. 
   This bill addresses an urgent situation faced by Liberian refugees who have legally come to America. 
   I urge co-sponsorship and passage of H.R. 1941, the Liberian Refugee Immigration Protection Act of 2007.

   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, this week, news reports came out indicating our Federal budget deficit has continued to drop and our economy continues to grow due to tax relief policies passed by Congress in 2001 and 2003. 
   In spite of that good news, Democratic leadership in Congress is discounting advancements made possible by this tax relief by trying to slap U.S. taxpayers with a $400 billion tax increase that will slow our economy and its current progress. 
   Additionally, Democrats piled $6 billion in new spending onto January's omnibus budget bill to finish the 2007 appropriations process, passed a budget for 2008 that is $20 billion more than the President's budget request, and added billions in extra spending to the few appropriations bills the House has passed. 
   Raising taxes hurts American families, discourages innovation and hinders job creation. Let's work together in this Congress to make tax relief permanent and continue to grow our economy. Together, this Congress can foster further prosperity and build a better, brighter future for our country.

   As Abraham Lincoln said famously in his second inaugural address: ``Fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.'' As Americans we are reluctant warriors, but throughout our rich history, whenever our troops have been in  harm's way America has supported the men and women in uniform and made certain our troops have the necessary resources to accomplish their mission. 
   Without a doubt, mistakes have been made, and these mistakes are important to acknowledge, but we must go forward with a new strategy in Iraq based on quantifiable goals and measurable results. We must not retreat. At this critical time, the American people long for true leadership and resolve. 
   I urge my colleagues to put aside political posturing and partisanship and ensure our troops have the resources and support needed to complete this mission. Victory is the only option.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, throughout our Nation's rich history, we have reached moments where we arrive at what President Ronald Reagan described as a time for choosing. Today is such a day. 
   This week, the House is asking ourselves a simple question: Will we choose to go forward with the resolve and determination needed to win the war on terror by supporting our brave troops, or will we retreat and wait for the fight to return to American soil? 
   It was Winston Churchill who once said, ``Never believe any war will be smooth or easy or that anyone who embarks on a strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter.'' 
   With this in mind, I acknowledge that the war in Iraq is not going as well as we all had hoped or wanted. Mistakes have been made. Thousands of precious lives have been lost, and there are likely more tough times to come. 
   My wife and I pray for the men and women in uniform and grieve for every loss of life and injuries inflicted on these heroes who proudly serve our Nation. I, as much as anyone else speaking today, want this war to be over. But this resolution essentially tells these soldiers to give up because the cause they have nobly served is no longer worth the courage and vigor necessary, and protecting the American people and keeping terrorists off American soil are no longer national priorities. 
   As Americans we are reluctant warriors, but throughout history, when our troops have been in harm's way, America has supported them and made certain our troops have the necessary resources to accomplish their mission. 
   In a cynical way, this resolution says America has already lost and the leaders of our country no longer believe our troops can achieve victory. It tells other nations that we are unreliable as an ally, and they can no longer count on us in times of distress. 
   My son proudly served in the Army. And during this time of service, I got to know many of his peers in uniform. I am not prepared to say to these men and women, nor to the young man fallen in battle, that I will go to right after this speech at Walter Reed Hospital, that I support you but I don't support the mission you serve, and the blood you shed on the battlefield was in vain. 
   I am not prepared to call for a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq that will leave the Nation ripe for terrorism and ultimately bring the war on terror back to American soil. 
   My neighbors in south central Michigan and across the country deserve to be protected from enemies of freedom. And they ought to have a Congress that doesn't shirk its responsibilities to soldiers and sailors and airmen sent into harm's way to ensure this war is fought off American soil. 
   So we come to this time of choosing today. Are we willing to abandon our troops as they implement the new strategy based on quantifiable goals and measurable results? I hope not. 
   I challenge my colleagues to honor America's brave men and women serving in the name of freedom and oppose this resolution of retreat.

<DOCNO>Mr. WALBERG. (ROE V. WADE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and good friend from Arizona for the opportunity to speak tonight. I just came back from Iraq and Afghanistan this past week, and on the way back from Kabul to the airport, I looked out of our window of the vehicle we were riding in and I saw two young children running alongside the vehicle, as children will do, having fun together. They were racing each other and racing our vehicle. I looked in their eyes, and I saw nothing but what I would see in normal little children's eyes having fun, except these two young children had smudged faces and tattered clothes that they were playing in, in a war zone. And I thought to myself, these two little children could be just like a number of children we have read about, through the barbarism of individuals for a particular philosophy would have ammunitions strapped to them, and then, in a barbaric, gruesome way, their lives taken. 
   On this day, the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we live in a civilized country, well educated, cleaned up, sanitized, and yet, because of a lie, there are innocent women, and indeed birth fathers, as well, who are caught in a lie and a trap that causes them to, in a sanitized way to some degree, yet the ultimate outcome is the same, to snuff out innocent lives for no reason that justifies that taking place. Today marks the 35th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Since that time, nearly 50 million abortions have been performed. That is a staggering number which intensifies when we recognize each abortion consists of one innocent life snuffed out and at least one other life that is wounded. 
   While I respect the fact that others may disagree, I believe that human life begins at conception. That means that almost 50 million lives have been extinguished since 1973. Because of Roe v. Wade, we have learned that a reckless majority on the Supreme Court can visit untold destruction and pain on us as a Nation if they search for results in individual cases that are outside the scope and text of the history of the Constitution. 
   We have learned that the activist justices can find ``penumbras, formed by emanations'' in the Bill of Rights as a basis for establishing new constitutional rights that are not found anywhere in the text or history of the Constitution, as Justice Douglas ridiculously claimed in the case of Griswold v. Connecticut, a precedent for Roe v. Wade. 
   Sadly, unelected activist judges with lifetime appointments continue to make law rather than to apply 
   the law as it is written. As elected officials, it is our right to make law, and it certainly is not the right of judges and justices to do so. Rather, they must follow the law as we, the accountable decision makers, have written it. 
   We have engaged in a long struggle and must continue in that struggle to ensure that the Supreme Court and our lower Federal courts are stocked with people who abide by the text and the history of the Constitution instead of acting as super-legislators in making new law. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, on the 35th anniversary of that tragic ruling, my heart is grieved; yet, it is heartened. Though we mourn for lives that could have been, we see significant progress in the fight to defend human life. Just today, a bipartisan majority in the Michigan Senate voted to ban partial birth abortion. Abortions have declined by nearly 20 percent in the past 15 years, and every year Americans have become increasingly pro-life. I, along with millions of Americans, remain committed to saving the unborn and upholding the right to life our Nation was founded upon. Perhaps the tide is finally turning. 
   I also call, Mr. Speaker, for an all-out effort of compassion for the women and the birth fathers who have been caught in the lie of abortion and have had their lives altered. A loving God offers forgiveness and hope and healing, and we, His people, can offer no less. 
   I pledge to continue to work every day to bring back the sanctity of life to our Nation. And it is heartening to stand here with my colleagues tonight and with hundreds of thousands of individuals today on the Mall and speak for life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, this past weekend I met a single mother in my South Central Michigan district who drives an hour each way to the hospital where she works. Because of high gas prices, this woman recently requested and received permission to begin working back-to-back 8-hour shifts 2 days per week so she doesn't have to make the hour-long commute each day. Unfortunately, situations like these are becoming more and more common as gas prices continue to rise and congressional leadership continues to resist action. 
   High gas prices demand action from Congress, and we need to put all energy options on the table. We need more production of American energy, more energy from alternative fuel sources, and increases in innovative solutions like coal-to-liquids technology. Just as with the Manhattan Project or the race to the Moon, breaking our dependence on foreign oil should be a national priority. Unfortunately, House leadership will not even let this House vote on an energy plan that increases American energy production. Important bills like the No More Executions Energy Act are ready to help American families. And my constituents, Madam Speaker, call for a vote on these bills now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts), and in support of this evidence-based approach to reducing the spread of HIV and AIDS. 
   The AIDS epidemic in Africa is a serious problem that demands serious results. However, I also ha d the privilege of seeing firsthand the success of Uganda's ABC program when I traveled to Uganda a couple of years ago to visit my daughter who's a missionary there and also a health educator dealing specifically with HIV/AIDS. Also meeting with who has now become adopted into our family, Mama Nabali, who is a young woman with three children who has HIV as a result of behavior issues related specifically to a husband who was unfaithful in many, many ways. 
   It has been interesting to note that in Uganda as well as other countries that are now using the ABC program authorized and pushed by the First Lady and the President, President Museveni of Uganda, in each of those cases there is a significant decline in reported numbers of sexual partners, that's the behavior portion of it, and a significant decline in the numbers of unmarried youth who are sexually active, which is the abstinence portion of it. 
   Authorizing legislation that requires 33 percent of prevention funds to be spent in abstinence-until-mar riage programming is the best way to address this problem because it's a proven, successful method of reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. There is growing evidence that partner reduction is the single most important factor in reducing HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. 
   According to the PEPFAR Third Report to Congress, ``Of the countless developments taking place in the global fight against the AIDS pandemic, perhaps the single most important in recent years is the growing number of nations in which there is clear evidence of declining HIV prevalence as a result of changes in sexual behavior.'' 
   Furthermore, no country with a generalized epidemic that has relied on condom prevention alone has reported a decline in HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. Because studies have shown that the abstinence-until-marriage method is producing the best results, I urge my colleagues to consider the merits of the Pitts amendment and support this important and, need I say, life-changing and lifesaving legislation.
