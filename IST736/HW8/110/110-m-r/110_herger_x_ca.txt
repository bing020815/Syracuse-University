<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (RELATING TO THE HOUSE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN SECTION 803 OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the strongest opposition to this dangerously irresponsible resolution. 
   For over 40 years, millions of seniors across America have enjoyed longer and healthier lives as a result of the health care provided through the Medicare program. Yet as a result of demographic changes and rising health care costs, Medicare is now in dire financial straits. The numbers are absolutely staggering. According to the most recent report by Medicare's Board of Trustees, Medicare's unfunded obligations have surpassed $85 trillion. That's more than six times the annual output of our entire economy, and more than fifteen times the current federal debt held by the public. 
   We have a choice to make: Are we going to take action now to save Medicare for the future? Or are we going to ignore the problem and hope that it just goes away? I understand that many members might prefer not to deal with this issue in an election year. But the Medicare funding warning trigger was designed precisely to force Congress to confront an issue that many would rather ignore. And that's what the American people sent us here to do: confront the tough challenges facing our country's future. Even when that means taking some political risks. 
   The President has proposed some fairly modest reforms to begin shoring up Medicare's future. I personally thought his suggestions made sense. But under the trigger rules, the Majority was entirely free to reject the President's ideas and develop their own proposal for reining in the growth of Medicare. Instead, the Majority has chosen to take the easy way out and do nothing. Today, we are sending a message to the American people that this Congress is simply not up to the task of solving our nation's problems. 
   The truth is, Mr. Speaker, we are gambling with our future. I believe we have an obligation to do our best to leave America better off for the generations that will follow us. I urge every member of Congress who feels the same way to join me in voting ``no'' on this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. I thank the gentleman. 
   I commend the House leaders for coming together in a bipartisan way on today's tax relief bill. But I believe we must do much more to truly foster business certainty, economic expansion, and a prosperous America for workers and their families. 
   The doubled small business expensing and bonus depreciation tax relief in this bill will help employers invest in their businesses, retain the workers they already have, and hire new employees in 2008. 
   It would be even more beneficial if we were focused on permanent relief. Even today, U.S. industry is looking 2 and 3 years down the road and making investment plans based on the expectations of the massive Democrat tax increases. Absent predictable, low rates on capital formation, tax increases will take a toll on economic activity and growth, meaning fewer jobs, lower wages and tougher times for families in the future. 
   Such a hit to our economy would far outweigh any static revenue loss we would see from enacting big-picture tax relief. 
   Mr. Speaker, we should also focus on putting our employers on an even tax footing with countries around the globe. Currently, the United States has the second highest business tax rates among world market economies. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we are to encourage a sound and prosperous American economy tomorrow, we have to begin by planting the seeds of prosperity and growth today.

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, when our constituents tell us to ``do something'' about gas prices, they don't mean ``Make them higher.'' This bill has some attractive elements, but they're overwhelmingly weighed down by bad policy, creative accounting and tax increases, none of which gets close to fixing the energy problem we face. 
   Record high gas prices are due to growing demand, constricted supply, and over-reliance on oil from unstable regions of the world. Yet this bill penalizes U.S. producers. 
   Mr. Speaker, families in Northern California won't see reduced prices at the pump if Congress raises billions in new taxes on those who discover, refine and deliver our gas.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle want to help U.S. workers during this period of economic uncertainty. Yet, the question has always been: How do we best provide this assistance? 
   Under the proposal before us today, workers in States with historically low levels of unemployment would receive 13 weeks of Federal unemployment benefits, on top of their current 26 weeks of regular State unemployment benefits. This means that workers in States like Iowa, that have a documented labor shortage, would receive 39 weeks of unemployment benefits. This makes no sense. 
   Instead of creating an untargeted expansion of unemployment benefits, we should be focusing on growing the economy. We want to see every State have a job surplus, not a surplus of extended unemployment benefits. 
   Today's legislation will result in higher taxes on our small businesses, resulting in slower job creation. This won't help U.S. workers. 
   The best way to help our workers is to foster economic growth that creates jobs. We can do that by passing pro-growth tax policies that keep our businesses competitive globally, and provide them with certainty to make important investments in our economy with our work, without worrying about a massive tax increase. 
   We can also help our workers by passing our fair trade agreements, which would create tens of thousands of jobs here in the United States. 
   And if we really want to help workers, we also need to be confronting rising gas prices so people can afford to get to work. We should remove our self-imposed embargo on domestic energy production, which will make energy more affordable and create more jobs. 
   These are the policies that Congress should be talking about here today. These are the types of policies that are going to create a strong and growing economy that will provide our workers with the jobs they need to support their families. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today is the wrong approach. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (EXTENDING TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 3375, a bill to extend the Trade Adjustment Assistance program by three months beyond September 30th, when it would otherwise expire. 
   I introduced this bill to allow Members adequate time to review and carefully consider the range of existing and forthcoming proposals to reform and expand this very complex and important program. As part of this review, our  Committee must consider whether any expansions would create duplicative federal programs and how any such expansions to the TAA program would be covered under the ``pay-go'' rules. 
   TAA can be a valuable tool for retraining people and helping return them to work quickly, but the program is in need of reform to do that job better. Moreover, TAA is an expensive federal program, costing taxpayers nearly $1 billion each year, but providing assistance only to some 54,000 workers per year, amounting to $18,000 per worker. In light of this, any expansion of TAA must be done in a cost conscious manner focusing on actual results. 
   At the same time, we must be mindful that TAA is just one tool in a larger policy toolbox to help workers, families, and communities adjust to the new global economy. TAA is not the proper response to all job loss. 
   Today, billions of dollars are provided annually through various Federal programs, including TAA, to help Americans who lose their jobs so that they can adapt and return to productive jobs. However, TAA and these other decades-old Federal programs need to be reformed to improve the services that they provide to address job loss due to trade, globalization, technology, and other reasons. 
   I look forward to working with my Republican and Democratic colleagues in an effort to develop an effective, fiscally sound, and comprehensive approach that would help more American workers, regardless of the reason for their job loss, get retrained and re-enter the workforce as quickly as possible so they can better adapt to the changing global economy

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (IRAN COUNTER-PROLIFERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1400, as amended to strengthen its goals and effect. 
   The Iranian regime supports terrorism. Iran's President has called for Israel to be, and I quote, ``wiped off the map.'' Iranian special forces are fighting a ``proxy war'' against U.S. troops in Iraq and are training Iraqi Shiite extremists. Iran's uranium enrichment continues to fly in the face of several United Nations resolutions, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, reports that Iran could develop nuclear weapons in as few as 3 years. 
   A multilateral strategy will most effectively block Iran's dangerous ambitions. The U.N., in particular, must adopt additional, stronger measures to stop this hostile regime dead in its tracks. I am also very encouraged by the recent statements of French President Sarkozy calling on France and the rest of Europe to adopt ``international'' and ``multilateral'' economic sanctions against Iran, in coordination with U.S. efforts. 
   As I have said on this floor before, I question the effectiveness of unilateral sanctions because they often disturb the very multilateralism that we currently see taking shape against Iran. Careful drafting, however, can alleviate the disruption, and the Ways & Means Committee strengthened H.R. 1400 by inserting provisions that will preserve this growing international coalition. 
   More specifically, H.R. 1400 maintains the President's discretion under current law not to impose import restrictions, if refraining would best serve the foreign policy purpose. To that end, Section 307 of this bill clarifies that the full ``authorities'' of IEEPA are implicated in Section 6(6) of the Iran Sanctions Act, not just the authority to impose import restrictions. A parallel rule of construction is included in Section 201. 
   In addition, my Committee was careful to clarify in Section 202 that the bill's import restrictions apply only to the current regulation, so the President retains needed flexibility. Finally, Section 406 of the bill as introduced and reported was stripped and replaced with a new funding source. 
   For these reasons, I urge support of H.R. 1400, as amended.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, like everyone else in this Chamber, I'm concerned about rising unemployment, but this legitimate concern does not justify Congress making poor policy. 
   I'm concerned that H.R. 5749 significantly departs from the long-standing Federal policy that workers should have meaningful employment before collecting extended unemployment benefits. By excluding the minimum 20 weeks of work requirement, this legislation would allow someone with as little as 2 weeks of work to qualify for up to 52 weeks of unemployment benefits. This moves away from the core purpose of unemployment benefits and towards a welfare-like system. 
   In addition, such expansive benefits may force States to raise payroll taxes, resulting in slower job creation and further squeezing workers' wages. This won't help current workers or unemployed workers in search of new jobs. 
   I believe expecting at least 20 weeks of work in exchange for 52 weeks of unemployment benefit is fair to U.S. workers and would limit any negative impact on job growth and workers' income. 
   Unfortunately, today's legislation doesn't include this common-sense requirement, even though Democratic Members were nearly unanimous in supporting this requirement in the legislation creating the 2002-2004 temporary extended benefits program.     
   As a result, while I'm concerned for workers in my district and across the Nation during this period of economic uncertainty, I must oppose this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' so we can bring this bill back to the floor in a form that all Members can support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word for a colloquy with the gentleman from Washington. 
   Mr. Chairman, over the past several years, we have seen the rise of a very disturbing trend on Federal lands: the creation of a billion-dollar international drug trafficking ring. Organized criminal gangs, headquartered in Mexico, have illegally entered our country and have established large scale marijuana growing operations in our national forests and national parks. 
   Gang members guarding these illegal ``pot gardens'' have been armed with automatic weapons and given orders to shoot to kill anyone who trespasses in the area. Hunters, recreators, and Federal employees in my district and others have been shot at when recreating or working on Federal lands. Eight of the Nation's 10 worst national forests in terms of illegal marijuana production are located in California. Three of those eight problem areas are located in my congressional district of northern California: the Shasta-Trinity, the Klamath, and the Mendocino National Forest. 
   Our Nation's national parks are also victim to illegal occupation by Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Regrettably, my home State of California suffers the worst of the infestation on Park Service lands as well. This includes a very serious problem at the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area in my district where illegal marijuana grows have been discovered within a few hundred yards of popular boating and fishing areas.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Madam Speaker, I am pleased we're discussing the growing problem of America's dependence on foreign sources of oil and gas, and the high prices that consumers are paying here at home. In the 109th Congress we made great strides in promoting energy independence through tax incentives for oil and gas exploration, improvement of outdated infrastructure and added research into renewable resources.  
   But while the goal of ``energy security'' is a good one, I am concerned that today's bill moves us away from that objective. I frequently hear from constituents concerned about our growing dependence on foreign supplies. And rightly so--when we experienced the first ``energy crisis,'' foreign countries provided one, third of our energy needs. Thirty years later, that reliance has nearly doubled. 
   H.R. 6 does not address this problem. Quite the opposite: Through increasing taxes, the legislation makes it more costly for U.S. firms to develop domestic supplies. This means our over-dependence on foreign supplies will increase even more. The policies we have already put in place are working: American production of natural gas is up 407 percent, and deep water oil production is up 386 percent. And billions of dollars that would otherwise go to hostile nations have been invested in renewable energy developed from open-loop biomass, geothermal and other resources. 
   Madam Speaker, my constituents want a forward-thinking energy strategy that seeks new ways to meet our needs. Everyone agrees we should pursue ``energy independence.'' H.R. 6 moves us farther from this goal.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back myself so much time as I may require. 
   I rise in support of this extension of the Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA program, for 3 months beyond its expiration of December 31. The TAA program provides important training,  health care, and other benefits to American workers adversely affected by trade. While this bill will continue the program for 3 months, I believe 6 months would be better and would allow the Senate sufficient time to pass the TAA reauthorization bill. 
   Also, the Senate and House must work together to develop what I hope will be truly bipartisan legislation that helps workers affected by trade and globalization get retrained and back to work sooner. Unfortunately, the House-passed Democrat bill was not the product of a bipartisan approach as I had hoped and did not include key Republican reform proposals. 
   In light of this, an overwhelming majority of the Republicans did not support it, and the bill drew a veto threat from the administration. In contrast, a TAA reauthorization bill that committee Republicans offered in an alternative on the floor was supported by 95 percent of all House Republicans and 11 Democrats. This strong support reflects the meaningful reforms in our 5-year TAA reauthorization, such as an increased health coverage tax credit. 
   As debate moves forward, I hope that at least some of the key TAA reforms in our bill will be considered and adopted. Several critical reforms in the House Republican TAA bill were not included with the House-passed language. They include providing more flexible training options to get people back to work sooner, such as training before layoffs, part-time training, and providing training scholarship for workers to use over 4 years, provisions to enhance the capacity of training providers, primarily community colleges to provide effective training programs, new accountability measures for TAA program funds, an extension and modernization of the Workforce Investment Act that will better integrate it with TAA to expand services to all workers and additional flexibility for States to operate UI programs that would help workers get back on the job faster. 
   I also want to reiterate my opposition to how the majority paid for the House-passed bill, and I hope we can revisit this issue as the process moves ahead. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I believe we should discuss TAA expansion in the context of initiatives that would expand trade opportunities for U.S. workers, farmers, and producers. We must pass all of our pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea and reauthorize trade promotion authority that allows the President a stronger hand to negotiate these beneficial agreements in the first place. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

In our pursuit of this provision, I join with my California colleague, SUSAN DAVIS, to introduce a stand-alone legislation on this issue, and I thank her for her leadership. 
   Currently, several States are allowed to issue what are called Qualified Veteran Mortgage Bonds, which are tax-exempt bonds. In California, the CalVet Home Loan Program uses the proceeds from these bonds to help pay for low-cost mortgages for our Nation's heroes returning from war. For our State and Texas, however, until this provision today, only veterans who ended their military service before 1977 were allowed to receive these low-cost home loans using proceeds from qualified veterans mortgage bonds. Now all veterans, regardless of when they serve, will be eligible under the QVMB-financed program. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his administration deserve credit for their unwavering support of this change. 
   This provision has been several years in coming. I am very pleased to say that it will help many recent California servicemen and women purchase their own home, regardless of when they served.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   I'd like to begin by just mentioning the last speaker, the gentlelady from Ohio, the Independent International Trade Commission estimates that Ohio's exports to Peru will grow by some 38 percent. And that 38 percent is in such areas as machinery equipment, chemical products, transportation equipment, computer and electronic equipment and plastic and rubber products. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members, I wish to express my strong support for H.R. 3688, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act. The Peru TPA will eliminate or significantly reduce Peruvian tariffs and address other trade barriers to U.S. goods. That Peru TPA also is an important means to promote democracy and stability in Peru and will further strengthen our relations with this strong partner of ours. 
   Today, nearly 6 months after reaching the May 10 bipartisan trade deal, we consider the Peru TPA on the House floor. I'm pleased for our farmers, ranchers, businesses, workers and consumers that this long-promised day is now a reality. 
   The Peru TPA will provide significant reciprocal market access benefits for these constituent groups. The International Trade Commission estimates that the Peru TPA will increase  U.S. exports to Peru by $1.1 billion. But U.S. imports from Peru will only increase by less than half that, or $439 million. 
   The ITC also estimates that the Peru TPA will add $2.1 billion per year to the U.S. gross domestic product. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Peru TPA's many benefits include the following: 80 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial goods will be duty free immediately, and all remaining tariffs eliminated within 10 years. 
   More than two-thirds of U.S. farm exports to Peru will become duty free immediately, including beef, wheat, soybeans, tree nuts, such as almonds, and various fruits and vegetables, such as peaches. 
   U.S. services firms will have substantial market access across Peru's service sectors, with very few exceptions. Almost all U.S. exports of information technology products will be duty free immediately, and there will be important protections for U.S. investors, intellectual property rights, worker rights and environment. 
   In my home State of California, the Peru TPA will offer tremendous market opportunities for our exporters. In 2006, California's farmers and businesses exported roughly 180 million in goods to Peru, including computers and electronic machinery, metal products and agricultural products. The elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers will help support the nearly 20 percent of manufacturing jobs and roughly 135,000 agricultural-related jobs in California alone that depend on exports. 
   The Peru TPA will also lead to a more substantial and reciprocal trading relationship between Peru and the United States. The current Andean trade preferences given by the United States to Peru have been important to its economic development and stability, but they provide little benefit to the U.S. exporters. 
   Today, for example, 97 percent of Peru's exports to the United States are already duty free. But only 2.8 percent of Peru's tariff lines are duty free for U.S. exporters.     
   The Peru TPA will level this uneven playing field. Given the importance of the Peru TPA as well as the pending free trade agreements with Panama and Colombia, I was pleased to participate in a recent bipartisan fact-finding trip to the region led by U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. This trip underscored to me that the Peru TPA will move our economic relationship to a new level and help make us even closer strategic allies. 
   I want to close by reminding my colleagues that our work is not done today. The May 10 bipartisan trade deal was designed to pave the way for a new bipartisan approach to trade policy and consideration of all four pending FTAs, not just the Peru TPA. In fact, the May 10 deal amended all four pending FTAs, not just the Peru TPA. I urge the majority to now act on the commitments made with the May 10 deal and move the three pending free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and Korea. 
   We must not let this unique moment pass us by, especially when the E.U., China, and other countries are strengthening their trade ties in Latin America and Asia and threaten to pull ahead. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield 3 minutes to my good friend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel). I want to thank the chairman, Mr. Rangel, for your strong work and your leadership along with Chairman Levin of the Trade Subcommittee and the Democrat members on your side for working to have this bill come through the Ways and Means Committee with a unanimous ``aye'' vote. I commend you and for your many years of working in this area of fair trade. 
   With that, with the addition of the 3 minutes I yield, I yield back my time for this evening.

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage every Member of Congress to ask their constituents one simple question: Are your health insurance premiums high enough yet? Because this bill will make them even higher. We all want to improve access to mental health treatment. But the legislation before us could force some employers to drop mental health benefits altogether. Under this bill, plans are actually prohibited from covering treatment for depression, or potentially even a program to help someone quit smoking, unless they agree to cover literally everything in the book. 
   I am especially concerned by the offset that effectively bans physician investment in hospitals. I am concerned that this provision could have a devastating impact on access to high quality health care. For example, there are just two hospitals in the city of Redding, California, in my northern California district. One of them nearly shut down a few years ago. It was bought by a company that specializes in turning around failing hospitals. 
   Part of their strategy was to give the physicians who work at the hospital a partial ownership stake. They were successful. As a result, a vital community hospital is still open in a largely underserved area. This so-called ``offset'' would subject it to crippling new regulations, and it could doom other struggling hospitals to closure. 
   Vote ``no'' on this legislation.

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 78th anniversary of perhaps the most disastrous economic legislation in our Nation's history, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1928. It set off a chain reaction of retaliatory tariffs that caused a sharp decline in global trade. Modern economists largely agree that it deepened the Great Depression. 
   Unfortunately, today this lesson seems to have gone largely unnoticed, judging by the isolationist course the Democrat House leadership is currently embracing. Expanded trade is critical to job creation and economic growth, it levels the playing field for U.S. workers, and is crucial to keeping our Nation as the world's number one economic trading powerhouse.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, losing a job is one of the most disruptive events that can occur to a worker and a family. 
   We should be helping these individuals to get back to work as soon as possible. That's why I support the trade adjustment assistance and why I introduced a short-term extension of the program to assist workers displaced by trade through December.     
   Unfortunately, I cannot support today's bill. In addition to expanding the TAA program, which already costs the American taxpayers nearly $1 billion each year, the majority shuts out numerous Republican suggestions that would have instilled accountability and increased flexibility for workers. One provision of their bill eliminates a State's ability to choose the best employees to administer TAA by requiring so-called State merit-based employees to run the program. This means that the 25 States that currently use local employees or outside contractors like nonprofit or community-based groups to operate a more efficient and effective TAA program will no longer be able to do so and will be required to hire more government workers. 
   I'm also amazed that the majority rejected our proposal to increase accountability by requiring States and organizations that receive TAA to meet performance measures. It should be the goal of all Members to see that taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely, and the lack of such measures is a fundamental shortcoming of the bill. This provision is included in the Republican substitute that we will offer later today. 
   Far from forcing workers into just any old job, Republicans have worked to find constructive ways to increase TAA program flexibility so workers could have more options to train for a new job and have greater access to employment services. But, again, these suggestions were rejected by the majority. 
   We all want to help unemployed workers to get back on their feet quickly. But TAA improvement, and especially an expansion of this magnitude, should have been considered in the context of expanding trade opportunities for all Americans through our pending free trade agreements, including Colombia, Panama and South Korea, and reauthorization of the trade promotion authority. Regrettably, we have no commitments from the majority on these important measures, despite months of work. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 3920.

   H.R. 3920 contains some TAA training reform, but it is largely geared towards keeping people in TAA longer, and is costly. In contrast, this amendment provides much greater individual choice and more flexible access to training through a new approach designed to get people into training sooner and better equip them to get back to work more quickly. For example, this amendment would improve TAA participants' access to training and education by: one, providing New Economy Scholarships of up to $8,000 that a participant can use over a 4-year period in a range of training programs; and, secondly, authorizing $50 million for new capacity building grants for community colleges and other training providers to offer enhanced training to more TAA participants. 
   This amendment also would provide TAA participants with more flexible training options that are not available under current law, including allowing participants to combine full-time work with either full-time or part-time training, or combine part-time work with either full-time or part-time training; and allowing training programs that lead to a license, certificate or community college degree and are linked to a high-demand occupation, as well as apprenticeship programs. 
   Moreover, this amendment would enable TAA participants to begin training sooner, even prior to layoff. This amendment also allows workers to focus on a job search sooner, while receiving income support, without also having to be in training or obtain a training waiver, which is required today. This amendment also would encourage better allocation of current training funds for the States, which have not been fully used, by requiring the Department of Labor to report to Congress every 6 months on this funding allocation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe this amendment makes meaningful training reforms to TAA that would provide more flexible options to participants and better enable them to gain the skills they need to return to work sooner. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment in the nature of a substitute.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the alternative budget before us now and the Democrat budget. The Democrat majority party seems intent on raising taxes and increasing spending. American families, seniors, and small businesses would all experience major tax hikes. Virtually no American would be spared. 
   The budget before us ignores the benefits of the tax relief passed since 2001. This tax relief has spurred economic growth and created literally millions of new jobs. Meanwhile, tax revenue to the Federal Treasury is surging, helping to reduce the deficit. Their budget also ignores the out-of-control growth in entitlement spending. This is deeply irresponsible. The tax-tax/spend-spend philosophy supported by my friends across the aisle is bad economics and bad for the American people. Vote ``no.''

No lawsuit reform to prevent frivolous lawsuits from radical environmental groups intent on playing political games. 
   The only thing they're saying ``yes'' to is an $85 billion tax increase. It would include unfair penalties for States that simply can't adjust to federally mandated one-size-fits-all renewable electricity standards.

   Mr. HERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this phony tax extender bill. After months of negotiations, the Senate finally reached an agreement on extending critical tax relief for individuals, businesses, and energy security. The Senate passed that agreement 3 days ago by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 93-2. With Congress preparing to adjourn, time is of the essence. 
   And yet here we are back at square one considering a proposal that the Senate has already rejected on four separate occasions. 
   I am especially disappointed that the legislation before us today drops a provision to extend the Secure Rural Schools Program through 2011. This program is vital to small counties in my district and across the West. 
   Madam Speaker, my counties depend on these payments to provide the most basic services like education for their kids. I would like to insert in the Record a letter from the National Education Association emphasizing the importance of including Secure Rural Schools in this legislation. 
   Several of us from the West have been working all year to get this program reauthorized, and we finally got a 93-2 vote in the Senate for a bill that would get it done. But now we have blown up a good bill and rural counties are getting lost in the shuffle. 
   I understand that some of my friends on the other side of the aisle feel that the Senate bill doesn't raise taxes enough. And, frankly, there are some things in the Senate bill that I don't like either. It is a compromise. But taking this approach virtually guarantees that we won't get this tax relief done at all. 
   No more R&D credit, no more tax relief for higher education expenses, no more incentives for renewable energy production. 
   I urge a resounding ``no'' vote on this futile exercise, and I urge this House to pass the Senate's bipartisan compromise and get this done.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, in 2001 President Bush and Congress worked to enact the most important tax relief since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. 
   For individuals and families, we reduced marginal tax rates on personal income, doubled the child tax credit, reduced the unfair marriage tax penalty, phased out the onerous death tax, and significantly lessened the impact of the alternative minimum tax. We also provided essential tax relief on investment income. 
   Far from taxpayer protection, as this bill's title suggests, we are now hearing proposals from the other side that would do away with the tax relief of the last 6 years. Contrary to the naysayers, tax relief has played a critical role in revitalizing our Nation's economy. 
   Over 7.5 million new jobs have been created since 2003. The national unemployment rate has fallen to a very low 4.4 percent. Economic growth has been steady and strong. Our investment markets are no longer bursting; they are booming. 
   American families and small businesses did not just sit on the $1.1 trillion that we returned to them. They put much of it back into our economy through investment and consumption. The result: Tax revenues are up 35 percent and deficits are much lower than CBO anticipated. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we observe tax day, to truly protect taxpayers, Congress should talk about ways to make the tax relief we have permanent. Regrettably, the majority party and its budget anticipate the opposite.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the minimum wage increase. Not only is this legislation detrimental to small business growth and job creation, but it has been brought to the floor outside the normal committee review process without the ability to consider an alternative. 
   I have long stood against minimum wage hikes, which increase government  interference in the labor market. Economists agree that when the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for employers to hire new workers.     
   Unfortunately, the burden of wage increases falls on small businesses which produce an estimated two-thirds of all new jobs in the United States. Minimum wage job seekers, often first-time employees looking to get their foot in the door, are most harmed by such increases. It is troubling that this bill gives no thought to softening the financial impact of our engines of new job growth when we could easily combine a wage increase with tax relief to help small businesses stay competitive and keep our economy growing. 
   One provision not included in the minimum wage bill would extend small businesses expensing. Over the last few years, Congress has increased the expensing limit which allows firms to write off equipment purchases immediately. This allows small businesses to expand faster and hire new workers. I continue to support a permanent extension of this provision. Without extension, expensing will soon revert from its current $100,000 back to $25,000. 
   Other relief not permitted in this is the elimination of the unnecessary 2 percent unemployment surtax. I joined my friend Jim McCrery in the 109th Congress to end the surtax and stimulate job creation and higher wages for those same workers who might lose jobs due to a minimum wage hike. 
   Finally, discounting relief from the 41 percent minimum wage increase, the bill ignores other side effects, such as impacts on the workfare participants. Current law determines how long welfare beneficiaries may participate in workfare, which helps recipients develop good work habits. As the minimum wage rises, recipients have access to less work, even if that is what they most need to prepare for a new job. 
   Mr. Speaker, by dismissing alternatives, the majority has generated a bill whose benefits to the American workers will be negligible, side effects real, and impacts on job creation palpable. I urge my colleagues to reject this measure.

   Mr. HERGER. Madam Chairman, we are now in year two of the Democrat majority. For the second year in a row they're proposing a budget that calls for the largest tax increase in American history, $683 billion significantly more than last year's budget. For our constituents, this means eliminating the lower marginal tax rates, a new penalty on marriage, a lower child tax credit, and new taxes on investment and retirement savings. 
   In California, taxpayers can look forward to an additional $3,331 in taxes. Meanwhile, anticipating a tax hike, our Nation's employers would think twice before hiring that next worker or  investing in new infrastructure. Madam Chairman, we need permanent tax relief, not higher taxes. What's more, this Democrat budget fails to address the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare. 
   Every year we do nothing, as prescribed in the budget before us, our future debt goes up by another $2 trillion. Without reform, our three largest entitlement programs will keep growing until they crowd out everything else in the Federal budget, from national defense to transportation, to assistance for the poor.

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, every time I visit with constituents, like most of you here in Congress, I hear about high gas prices. And they're right. Gas prices are too high. Prices in our free market are governed by supply and demand. Record high prices result from, among other things, the fact that we don't produce enough of our own supply domestically and are therefore at the mercy of unpredictable and often unstable foreign producers. 
   Thirty years ago, when we had our first oil crisis, we were dependent on  foreign sources of oil for only about one-third of our supplies. Today it is roughly two-thirds of our supply. A sure way to fix this situation is to encourage environmentally safe oil exploration and production here in the United States. 
   But this is the opposite of what today's legislation seeks. In fact, today's bill proposes to raise taxes on domestic oil and gas exploration by nearly $12 billion. This discourages investment in U.S. supplies and will, over time, increase our dependence even more on foreign sources of fossil fuels. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote against higher gas prices and against H.R. 2776, this ill-conceived energy legislation.

Some say tax relief costs too much, but history since 2002 shows otherwise. Lower rates have unlocked billions in gains, boosting Federal revenues far beyond Congress' projections which were made based on higher tax rates.

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, we all know this bill is purely a political exercise. Congress will eventually pass an AMT patch that does not contain permanent tax increases. All we are doing today is postponing final action and risking a repeat of last year's delay that created major headaches for taxpayers. 
   I believe we shouldn't be expanding the federal government's share of the economy by pairing temporary extensions of tax relief with permanent tax increases. I've heard a number of concerns from small businesses about one of these offsets, a new reporting requirement for credit card transactions. Last week, when the Ways and Means Committee considered this bill, we were told by the Treasury Department that they have not done a cost-benefit analysis on this proposal. I fear we are going  down the same road as we did two years ago with the 3 percent withholding requirement, which we've now learned will cost the government far more than it will raise in revenue. 
   On top of that, this bill raises taxes on American energy producers. This does nothing to reduce gas prices--in fact, it will only make them higher. And there's simply no justification for a provision that penalizes U.S. producers but doesn't affect subsidiaries of foreign-owned firms. This legislation just doesn't make sense. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I'm troubled by the housing catch-all bill before the House of Representatives today from a commonsense, pro-American taxpayer position. 
   The bill would enable the already troubled FHA to take on an additional $300 million in distressed mortgage liabilities, loans that have a good chance of going into default. This effectively transfers risk from those holding bad loans to those taxpayers who made prudent decisions in the first place. 
   More than nine out of 10 mortgage holders make payments on time. They would now be on the hook for the bad mortgage debt, as will renters saving for a first-time home and those who own their own homes outright. This bill sends the signal that there are no real consequences for poor lending or borrowing practices, and encourages more of the same behavior that led us here in the first place. 
   Further, to offset some of the tax giveaways in the bill, the Democrat majority proposes billions of dollars in what amounts to a retroactive tax increase on American employers with operations in foreign markets. What our economy really needs is tax policies that foster greater, not less, competitiveness for the U.S. employers. 
   Finally, it is truly disappointing that the Democrat majority has chosen to bring this bill up in a lock down, unamendable manner. I urge my colleagues to reject this measure.

Kathleen Lopez of Marysville, California, writes, ``I chose a Medicare Advantage plan because I receive Social Security benefits less than $700 net per month. This plan encourages preventive care, has some vision and dental coverage. This type of plan eliminates costly monthly expenses for health coverage.'' 
   In addition to slashing Medicare Advantage, this bill contains massive expansion of SCHIP that takes kids from middle-class and even upper-class families off private insurance and puts them into a government-paid program. 
   All of us support reauthorization of SCHIP. Everyone supports health care for low-income children. But what we are debating here today is whether to turn this successful anti-poverty program into an open-ended entitlement with effectively no limits on eligibility. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a choice. We can move towards a 21st century patient-centered health care system driven by competition and innovation, or we can go backwards towards a system of socialized medicine like the one that the Canadian doctors come here to escape.

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the ``CHAMP Act.'' I do support averting the 10 percent cut in physician payments scheduled for next year, and I am pleased that the bill reforms the Medicare geographic cost payments index for California and holds rural counties harmless through 2010--although I would have preferred to see a permanent fix so that the physicians I represent do not face the prospect of a 5 to 7 percent cut a few years down the road. 
   However, I am very troubled by the overall thrust of the CHAMP Act, which is to expand big government health care at the expense of competition and consumer choice. This bill would effectively destroy the Medicare Advantage program, especially in rural areas like the district I represent. 
   I would like to read to my colleagues from a letter I received just the other day from one of my constituents, Kathleen Lopez of Marysville, California. Kathleen writes, ``I chose a Medicare Advantage plan because I receive Social Security benefits less than $700 net per month; our annual income hovers around $20 thousand. This plan encourages preventive care, has Plan D Medicare, has some vision and dental coverage. ..... This type of plan eliminates costly monthly expenses for health coverage as well as prescription drug coverage.'' Over 4,500 other senior citizens in my district are receiving similar benefits. Most--if not all--of them will lose their benefits under this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, not only does this bill sharply reduce incentives for Medicare Advantage plans to offer coverage to low-income rural seniors like Kathleen Lopez, it also imposes new constraints and regulations to prevent Medicare Advantage plans from offering better deals. The message of this bill is ``Washington knows best.'' Instead of promoting competition and choice, we are going to push everybody into a one-size-fits-all plan. 
   That message is reinforced with the massive expansion of SCHIP that takes kids from middle-class and possibly even upper-class families off private insurance and puts them into a government program. Mr. Speaker, all of us support reauthorizing SCHIP. Everyone supports providing health care for low income children. But let us be clear: That is not the question we are discussing today. What we are debating is whether to turn SCHIP into a massive new entitlement under which every child in America--even if their families are well-off, even if they already have good health coverage--can become eligible for health care provided by the Federal Government. 
   Don't be fooled--this bill is the first step toward the Federal Government taking over health care. Some members who were closely involved in writing this bill have even openly stated their support for creating a government-run health care system and literally banning market-driven health care providers. We have a decision before us: We can move toward a 21st-century, patient-centered health care system driven by competition, choice, and innovation. Or we can go backwards toward a system of socialized medicine, like the ones that are crumbling in Europe or the one that Canadian doctors come to our country to escape.

   On May 23, 2007, the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, reported that Iran is continuing to enrich uranium in blatant defiance of three U.N. resolutions. The IAEA also concluded that Iran could develop nuclear weapons in as few as three years. Iran's President has called for Israel to be, and I quote, ``wiped off the map.'' The prospect of this extreme regime developing nuclear arms represents a grave threat to the United States and its allies in the Middle East, Europe, and globally. 
   I believe the international community must stand united against Iran. We and our allies must do everything possible on a multilateral basis--diplomatically, politically, and economically--to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear arms capability. The United Nations, in particular, must adopt additional, stronger measures to stop this hostile regime dead in its tracks. 
   Although I question the effectiveness of unilateral sanctions, I believe that drafted correctly, they can occasionally provide a useful supplement to multilateral efforts. H.R. 957 is one such occasion, as it maintains the President's discretion under IEEPA to consider on a situation-by-situation basis whether the imposition of unilateral sanctions would be the wisest course.

While the Andean trade preference program provides important economic benefits to exporters in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, it is not a substitute for moving toward a reciprocal arrangement that also provides benefits to U.S. exporters. Congress has already taken the first step in this process by passing the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement.

   Mr. HERGER. Madam Speaker, in closing, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, today we are voting on the Andean Preferences, but the U.S.-Colombia TPA is far superior to the Andean Trade Preferences in several very important ways. The Andean trade preferences program provides duty-free access for imports from Colombia, but not for U.S. exports to Colombia, which face an average duty of over 11 percent. As a result, U.S. exporters are at a major disadvantage. 
   Here are just a few of the examples in which imports from Colombia receive duty-free access to the U.S. markets and the significant tariffs U.S. exporters currently face which would be eliminated upon implementation of the U.S.-Colombia TPA: U.S. wheat, fruits and vegetables; soybean meal; paper products; aircraft; turbines; diesel engines; and tractors. 
   Passing the U.S.-Colombian TPA would level the playing field for U.S. exporters. However, the longer we wait, the worse the situation becomes. Currently, several countries, including Argentina, Brazil and Chile, have preferential access into the Colombian market. Canada and the EEU are close to completing trade agreements with Colombia that would provide their businesses with a competitive advantage in the Colombian market. All of these countries are major competitors with U.S. exporters. 
   Failure of Congress to pass the U.S.-Colombia TPA does not preserve the status quo. It exacerbates and magnifies disadvantages already faced by U.S. exporters. 
   Madam Speaker, the facts are clear: The U.S.-Colombian TPA is far superior in every way to the Andean Trade Preferences program, and Congress should use the next 10 months to pass the agreement for the benefit of U.S. businesses and U.S. workers. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, today's bill is eerily reminiscent of legislation we saw back in August, modest renewable energy tax incentives, which I have long supported, mixed with a reformulation of billions of dollars in new taxes on America's predominant energy manufacturers. 
   Apparently the majority is more interested in scoring political points than in providing anything close to an energy plan. The Democrats even make sure to preserve a carveout that will enable Hugo Chavez's Venezuela state-owned oil company to claim a U.S. tax deduction. 
   When our constituents ask us to do something about gas prices, they don't want us to raise them. Yet by increasing taxes on U.S. energy manufacturers by more than $17 billion, this bill creates a significant disincentive for domestic production, decreasing our energy security and increasing our overreliance on uncertain foreign supplies. 
   Expanding the diversity of our domestic supplies is one step. That will be accomplished over time through tax incentives such as the energy investment and production tax credit for resources like forest, biomass, geothermal and solar energy. 
   But we can't possibly hope to meet demand by raising taxes and making  U.S. production even more costly. While it may make a nice talking point, taxes won't help our constituents or make energy less costly.

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Tax Collection Responsibility Act. This legislation would unwisely eliminate an IRS program which collects otherwise uncollected tax debts, refusing as much as $2.2 billion in Federal revenue. In addition, this partisan measure does a disservice to the overwhelmingly bipartisan effort to repeal the 3 percent withholding burden before it takes effect. 
   In less than 4 years, 3 percent of all payments made by a government to a business or individual providing goods or services will be unfairly withheld as a prepayment on taxes. This will needlessly reduce cash flows for thousands of small businesses across the U.S. Today's bill merely delays 3 percent withholding implementation for 1 year, but that does not solve this real and pressing problem. 
   What Congress should do is follow the broader proposal my friend KENDRICK MEEK of Florida and I have introduced, repealing this withholding tax outright. Pairing a scaled-back 1-year delay with the majority's repeal of the private collection agency program wrongly splits the bipartisan, broad-based full repeal initiative. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Meek-Herger proposal has 219 cosponsors from both parties. Further, the closed rule prohibits a Republican substitute that would have provided for consideration of the full 3 percent withholding repeal alone and on its own merit.

   The other body agrees, going so far as to call this nonoffset AMT patch the ``Tax Increase Prevention Act.'' Insisting on PAYGO brings us down the path of massive tax increases over the next decade. We need to stop this PAYGO charade and pass AMT relief without burdensome new taxes on the American people.

   Mr. HERGER. Well, I want to thank my good friend, Mr. Dreier, for setting this up this evening. 
   This is so incredibly important. It's important to our Nation, it's important to our workers at a time when we're seeing our economy dipping, when we need to be able to produce jobs. And we look at how we produce jobs. Since last year, some 27 percent of our increase in gross domestic product came from exports. It's projected that just this year of our increase in gross domestic product, some 40 percent will be again from exports. 
   And I wish it weren't true, but it seems like perhaps the best kept secret in our Nation today is that the United States is the largest trading nation in the world. We're the largest exporting nation in the world. 
   I represent, as my good friend knows, a very rich agricultural district north of Sacramento in northern California.

   Mr. HERGER. One of the richest agriculture areas in the world, second largest rice producing district. Some 60 percent of all the dried plums in the world, prunes, are grown there, walnuts, almonds, these specialty crops. And America cannot consume all that we produce. As a matter of fact, one-third of all that we produce we need to be able to export. And to be able to see, again, talking about Colombia, what this does for American workers, we just heard about Caterpillar from our good friend from Illinois (Mr. Weller) just earlier in his district, the thousands that it affects. And so it affects in the district I represent. 
   Right now, because of our duty free status for the Andean nations, which we've gone in to try to help Colombia, Colombia was not always this great nation where some 42,000 former paramilitary, as we were talking about earlier, have gone from fighting the country to now being part of the country and supporting them. As we know, it wasn't always that way. And so some years ago we gave these Andean nations, including Colombia, Peru, Panama, and others, the ability to be able to export into the United States duty free, duty free, but yet we still have export duties, some as high as 60, 70 percent, going into their country. 
   And what this free trade agreement would do is it would be able to give us the same access to their markets that they currently have to ours, to our rice, to our walnuts, to our wheat, to our corn, to other commodities that are so very, very important. 
   So it is important what we're doing. It's important not only for, we were discussing the change in Colombia itself, which is our strongest ally in South America; we cannot turn our back on them, we cannot slap them in the face. 
   And Madam Speaker, I would like to place into the Record some of these editorials that you were speaking about, Mr. Dreier, for the Record.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE AND SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Madam Speaker, as Americans send their checks to the IRS today, they have a number of concerns. There are the dozens of tax provisions that expired last year and have not yet been extended adding to economic uncertainty. There is the inefficiency of many Federal agencies resulting in waste of hard-earned tax dollars, and there are the entitlement programs that threaten to double the Federal tax burden over the coming decades if they are not reformed. All of these issues Congress should be considering this Tax Day. 
   One complaint I have never heard from my constituents is that the IRS doesn't ask them for enough information. Yet the legislation before us would impose burdensome new reporting requirements on 5 million Americans with health savings accounts. Although Congress has held no hearings to determine whether misuse of HSA funds is a real problem, these requirements would make HSAs less convenient for consumers and could lead financial institutions to stop offering HSAs. 
   Ironically, this bill would also repeal a program that collects bad tax debts. The majority's message seems to be that if you're not paying your taxes, we will let you off the hook, but if you follow the rules, we will increase your burden of compliance. 
   Madam Speaker, that is the wrong message to send this Tax Day. I urge a ``no'' vote.

   Mr. HERGER. Madam Speaker, Federal law requires local governments to cooperate with the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Local law enforcement authorities may turn over individuals who have been apprehended if the police believe they are not legally present in the United States. 
   Unfortunately, many local governments flaunt this requirement and openly boast that they refuse to cooperate with the Federal Government in helping to enforce our immigration laws establishing an irresponsible precedent and frustrating our shared goal of having safe and secure borders. 
   As you know, taxpayers all across the country subsidize local governments through a provision of Federal law that permits States and localities to issue debt that is exempt from Federal taxes.     
   The motion presents the Members of Congress with a simple question: Is it reasonable to put some strings on this subsidy? 
   If adopted, the motion would clarify that the Federal tax subsidy does not apply to new debt issued by States or localities that declare themselves by statute or other manner to be a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants. In other words, having self-helped themselves out of helping the Federal Government address the growing burden of illegal immigrants, then they should not expect American taxpayers to subsidize their debt. 
   Madam Speaker, on April 15, we are reminded again about the many Americans who are playing by the rules, yet still feel the squeeze on their family budgets, particularly at tax time. Isn't it only fair that we ask our city mayors and county boards to do the same? 
   This brings me to the second piece of our motion to recommit. Many American families benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit. It has helped millions of low-income families help make ends meet, though its cost to the Treasury is not insubstantial. Studies have often showed that the earned income tax credit is overclaimed by as much as 30 percent. In other words, many of those who receive the benefit are not actually entitled to it.  
   As the underlying bill includes a provision directing the IRS to conduct outreach to inform individuals that they may be eligible for the earned income tax credit, the motion would add language directing the IRS to improve its efforts to identify individuals who may be ineligible for the EITC on account of their citizenship status. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this motion to recommit. While I am greatly concerned about the message sent by the underlying bill that somehow we are going to take away an effective tool to ensure we all pay our fair share of taxes, this motion helps correct that wrong-headed tilt by trying to prevent tax benefits from going to illegal aliens and cities and States who shelter them from our immigration laws. 
   I urge passage of the motion. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I want to express my support for the tax relief included in today's legislation, provisions such as the research and development tax credit and the active financing exception that help our employers stay competitive and the extension of the renewable energy tax incentives. 
   However, I cannot support this bill as written. First, it continues the negative trend the Democrat majority has followed by permanently increasing taxes to pay for temporary extensions of existing tax law. Given the wide-ranging tax relief that is set to expire in the coming years, the Democrats' PAYGO logic would require us to raise taxes by more than $3.5 trillion between now and 2018. 
   Secondly, the bill ``dodges'' extending the middle class alternative minimum tax patch, without which 24 million taxpayers will pay an average of $2,400 in AMT taxes in 2008 alone. We waited until the 11th hour to extend this relief in 2007. We cannot do so again. 
   Tragically, the House Democrats refuse to work on these issues on a bipartisan basis. Their tax increase approach has been tried and tried again, and for what we have seen in the other body and from what the White House has said, it will fail again. The longer we delay passing a realistic extenders bill, the longer American employers and taxpayers go without this critical tax relief.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (THE SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SELF-DETERMINATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. I thank the gentleman, my good friend from Oregon, Mr. Walden. And I thank the work that Mr. DeFazio is doing and the others in this incredibly, crucially important issue that affects those of us in rural areas of the West, particularly, and in these forested areas. 
   Like both of you, I have a heavily forested district and I understand the challenges that our rural communities face because of the large Federal presence in our area. 
   Many of our fellow citizens, and even some of the Members of this body, do not realize that the presence of Federal lands places a burden on nearby communities. I am so pleased to join you tonight in shining the light on that fact and reminding our colleagues that the Secure Rural Schools program has expired and is in need of reauthorization. 
   In my district of Northern California, school boards, county officials, and sheriff departments are currently in crisis mode. For example, Siskiyou County is looking at a 91 percent loss in school funding. In Tehama County, library hours, music, art, and physical education classes will be dramatically cut. 
   And this crisis extends well beyond education. County road safety programs will be decimated as well. Sheriff departments will also bear the brunt of these cuts. In total, eight of my 10 counties are experiencing drastic budget declines because Congress has not extended the Secure Rural Schools program. 
   It is important to point out to our friends who represent urban areas that this crisis is not the fault of rural counties. It is the fault of Federal policies that are out of their control, specifically the failure of Congress to address that burden by extending the Secure and Rural Schools program. 
   In my home State of California, close to half of the land area is owned by the Federal Government. And in my district that number is considerably larger. In one of my counties, nearly 90 percent of the land is under Federal ownership. This large Federal presence has placed the counties I represent at a severe economic disadvantage. Acreage that would normally be privately owned and, therefore, generating tax revenue to help fund essential local services, is, instead, locked away by the Federal Government. 
   President Teddy Roosevelt and our predecessors who served in the 60th Congress recognized this problem and addressed it with a promise which was enshrined in the law in 1908, that the Federal Government would pay its fair share of local costs by sending a percentage of national forest revenues to the counties that are home to Federal lands. 
   This promise acknowledged that the rural counties we represent would not be able to fund vital services like rural education, road maintenance and emergency care as long as enormous tracts of land within their boundaries were locked away under Federal control. 
   We need to be very clear about the nature of the promise that was struck between Congress and rural forested counties. These funds were not designed to be a handout, and they are not part of any federally sponsored rural development program. They are an obligation. They are part of a compact between the Federal Government and the people of rural America in recognition of the difficulties created by large Federal ownership. This compact must be honored by the 110th Congress that we are currently in.     
   The rural counties I represent, and I know this is true in other areas throughout the West, have sacrificed a great deal playing host to America's national forests. I don't think it is too much to ask for this Congress to set aside a fraction of our $2.9 trillion budget in order to keep our word to rural America. We need to act immediately to extend the Secure Rural Schools safety net so our rural counties can get out of crisis mode, and then we can all get back to working on a long-term solution to our forest health problems. 
   Again, I would like to thank my colleagues here tonight for your efforts to extend the Secure Rural Schools program. I am committed to working with each of you until we are successful, and I ask other Members of the House to recognize the incredible hardships that will result if this legislation is not renewed.

   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, there are a number of provisions in this bill that I believe will improve our national security. For instance, I support increasing protections at our most important infrastructure facilities, like dams and power plants, and improving the Homeland Security grant allocation process so that it is truly risk-based. I also agree with the provisions in the bill that would strengthen sanctions on countries that participate in the proliferation of nuclear materials, equipment and weapons technology. 
   However, I do have concerns with the bill's cargo inspection provision. We need to arrive at a system that ensures that all cargo entering the U.S. is safe. I believe the best way to approach supply chain security is through a risk-based approach, as endorsed by the SAFE Ports Act, which became law last fall. In particular, the SAFE Ports Act establishes a pilot program to test a system of 100 percent scanning at three ports. Then, based on lessons learned from that program, we could deploy a broader functioning inspection system. 
   Although the goal of today's legislation is laudable, I am concerned that it imposes an arbitrary deadline for its new requirement for 100 percent scanning in all ports without first considering the effectiveness of such a proposal or our ability to carry it out. We must also consider who will pay for this new program--both inside and outside the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I remain committed to working with others in the House to see that the provisions of last year's SAFE Ports Act are implemented, and believe that the feasibility of any new measures and mandates should be demonstrated before they're passed into law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) for leading this talk this evening on this incredibly important issue of the taxes that are about to be raised if we do nothing here in the U.S. Congress. I might mention, it was interesting listening to my friend talking about all the individuals that he knows of that will have their taxes raised. I have to give some of my background. My reason, I grew up in Northern California in a rural area just south of Yuba City, Marysville, in a dairy community, born in 1945, so raised during the 1950s and 1960s. Our family also had a small business which I worked in. My reason for becoming involved politically and running for office was not what government was doing for me, but rather as a small businessman and small rancher what they were doing to me. So this evening, I want to discuss something that is more that they seem to be wanting to do to us. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you earned the same amount of money last year that you do this year and you write a bigger check out to the IRS this year than you did last year, you have just experienced a tax increase. The expensive alternative minimum tax measure recently introduced by the Democrats and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Rangel, threatens to take us down the path of staggering tax hikes that will impact nearly every  taxpayer. In fact, if that proposal were to be enacted, over the next 10 years, more than 120 million Americans would pay more than $312 trillion in additional taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have consistently supported doing away, outright, with the alternative minimum tax and am a cosponsor of legislation by my good friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. English) that will be speaking in 
   a few minutes that will do precisely that. But the Democrats' ``mother of all tax hikes'' is the wrong approach on the American taxpayer. Ten years ago, most Americans had never heard of the AMT. Today, more and more middle-class families are becoming ensnared in this alternative tax regime. 
   The AMT was created almost 40 years ago, in 1969, to make 155 of our Nation's wealthiest individuals, who were not then paying taxes, pay at least some level of tax. Yet, the income entry level for the tax were never set to be adjusted for inflation. So if Congress doesn't act soon, the number of taxpayers paying the AMT will rise from 4 million, now mind you that is up from 155, from 4 million last year to 23 million this year alone. In other words, an additional 19 million middle-class taxpayers could pay an average of $3,800 more in taxes this year. 
   House Democrats would have us raise taxes elsewhere to the tune of nearly $312 trillion over the next 10 years to do away with this AMT that was never intended. They claim this massive tax hike is necessary to offset, or make up for, the tax revenue that is lost with the termination of AMT. For a married couple with two children and an income of $45,000 a year, as well as some typical deductions, this could mean a new $1,500 tax bill. How is this possible if the Democrats' bill assumes that the landmark tax relief of 2001 and 2003, which we put through the Ways and Means Committee in this Congress and signed by President Bush, will expire 3 years from today? Including the lower marginal tax rates and the $1,000 child tax credit. 
   Under this scheme, more than 94 million Americans with income between 20 and $200,000 will see a major tax increase. I am seriously concerned about how these new taxes will affect taxpayers in my own Northern California congressional district. In 2005, just over 2 percent of all taxpayers in my district paid the AMT. If we fail to extend AMT patch, some 54,000 Northern Californians will have to pay the AMT this year alone. Again, this was a tax meant for only 155 of the wealthiest Americans who weren't paying any taxes in 1969. 
   But what really troubles me is that the majority party's mother of all tax hikes would eliminate the AMT for this 2 percent and merely substitute it with higher taxes for almost every other taxpayer. This kind of pro-tax-increase thinking is simply unacceptable. We should do away with the AMT altogether. But the majority party's ``tax Peter to pay Paul'' approach is wrong and ignores a reality that the AMT was never intended to capture these Americans in the first place. 
   I would like to thank, again, my friend, Kevin Brady, the gentleman from Texas, for hosting this important Special Order this evening and encourage all my colleagues to stand up for the taxpayers in their congressional districts and oppose the majority's proposed massive tax hikes.

   Mr. HERGER. Madam Speaker, the alternative minimum tax was never meant to reach down and ensnare middle-class taxpayers. It does so because it was never indexed for inflation. The AMT was created in 1969 to capture 155 of the wealthiest taxpayers in America. If we don't pass this legislation today, it will increase taxes on not 155, but 23 million mostly middle-income families this year. A clean AMT patch is the right policy for taxpayers. There are no new taxes in this bill to comply with the so-called PAYGO tax increase budgeting. PAYGO can't control spending, and it really only makes tax relief virtually impossible. So I'm pleased that we're not falling for the PAYGO trap on this temporary patch. 
   No new taxes also means that we're not dipping into the economy for revenue. This is good, since we're facing rough economic waters due to the mortgage situation. Although I'm concerned our delay in passing this patch could result in added waiting time for tax returns from the IRS, this inconvenience is minor compared to the alternative, tens of billions in new taxes to offset temporary tax relief. 
   I strongly support House passage of this clean AMT patch and urge an ``aye'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I support this short-term extension of the Andean preferences. 
   U.S. trade preferences for Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia have furthered important economic development and political purposes, including creating incentives that shift from production of illegal drugs to legitimate products, increasing economic growth in these countries and strengthening democracy in the region. 
   The Andean trade preference expires on June 30. I believe that extending these preferences is very important, but only as a short-term bridge to implementing bilateral free trade agreements with these countries. Such FTAs are reciprocal, open up more trade opportunities, and provide permanent tariff reductions for U.S. interests as compared to the temporary tariff reductions provided to Andean interests by the preferences. 
   For example, the pending FTAs with Peru and Colombia will greatly enhance our economic and trade ties to the benefit of the Andean and U.S. industries and workers. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, once the Colombia and Peru FTAs are implemented, one, 80 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial goods will immediately be duty free, with another 7 percent duty free within 5 years and our remaining tariffs eliminated within 10 years. 
   Two, a substantial amount of U.S. farm exports will receive immediate duty-free treatment. 
   Three, Colombia and Peru will provide substantial market access to U.S. service providers with very few exceptions. 
   Four, all U.S. information technology products will enter duty free. 
   And five, U.S. investors and intellectual property right holders will receive important protections. 
   From the perspective of Peru and Colombia, these FTAs will expand their trade opportunities with the United States. The FTAs, with their permanence and, in many cases, immediate tariff reductions will provide more certainty for their own industries and workers. 
   Moving to FTAs with our Andean trading partners also will greatly build on our growing overall trade relationship with these countries at a time when the EU and other countries are looking to strengthen their own trade ties in the region. We must act now before the EU and other countries pass us by. 
   At the same time we need to be wary over how Ecuador and Bolivia react over the 8 months. We have been generous with preferences, but I'm very troubled that the response in those countries has been a lack of respect for the rights of U.S. investors. Our generosity has its limits. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support the extension of the Andean preferences being considered today which will allow these important benefits to continue. At the same time it is important for us to remember that we have the unique opportunity now to go beyond the Andean preferences and expand our economic and trade ties to Peru and Colombia through the pending FTAs. Therefore, I look forward to House consideration of the Peru FTA in July, and then moving through the other pending FTAs. 
   The time is now to solidify our relationship. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   I rise in support of H.R. 6309, the Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act of 2008, designed to address the serious health hazards that high levels of lead have on children in their home environment. 
   In 1992 the Congress passed the landmark residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act to address what was at the time an epidemic of childhood lead poisoning. In conjunction with Federal efforts to limit the use of leaded gasoline and lead in food and juice cans and in drinking water pipes, this law has been remarkably effective in reducing the incidence of childhood lead poisoning. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report, Healthy People 2010, the decline in childhood lead poisoning in the United States represents a major public health success. 
   The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act directed HUD to establish regulations for the evaluation of lead hazards. In its regulation, referred to as the Lead-Safe Housing Rule, HUD established an environmental intervention blood level of 20 micrograms per deciliter for a single test or 15 to 19 micrograms per deciliter for two tests taken at least 3 months apart. 
   H.R. 6309 will require HUD to issue new regulations that adopt the level of 10 micrograms per deciliter. Eliminating lead exposure greater than 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood among children by the year 2010 is one of the national health objectives established by the Department of Health and Human Resources. 
   Mr. Ellison is to be commended for his commitment to strengthen the definition of a child's elevated blood lead level, and I recommend my colleagues support this legislation.

   Mr. HERGER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself so much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6560. This bill extends the existing Generalized System of Preferences for 1 year, provides additional benefits to sub-Saharan African beneficiary countries, and improves U.S. implementation of the Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. 
   The GSP program is an important development tool for poor countries and allows U.S. manufacturers and consumers to obtain products at competitive prices. The additional benefit for the African countries will help spur job creation in these countries at a time of significant economic uncertainty. Most importantly, the improvements to CAFTA demonstrate how fair trade agreements benefit American workers. 
   Three years ago, many Members of Congress opposed CAFTA, fearing that it would result in outsourcing of U.S. jobs. We now know that those fears were greatly misplaced, and instead, CAFTA has been a tremendous success for American workers. CAFTA leveled the playing field for American-made products by going from a one-way preference to reciprocal, two-way free trade. 
   The CAFTA countries already had access to our market, but we did not have access to their markets. CAFTA opened these growing markets to exports of American-made products. As a result, U.S. exports of manufacturing products to CAFTA increased by 33 percent since 2004. 
   In 2007, the United States had a manufacturing product trade surplus of $1.1 billion with CAFTA, moving us away from the pre-CAFTA deficit that we had with these same countries. This agreement has become an important example of how American workers benefit from fair trade agreements. As of May of this year, the United States had a trade surplus in manufactured products with all our agreement partners combined, including Canada and Mexico. 
   This legislation before us today will create further incentives for U.S. manufacturing exports to the region. It is completely noncontroversial and supported strongly by the U.S. textile industry. 
   However, Congress should not stop here. We can create even more opportunities to expand exports of American-made products by passing the U.S.-Colombia Fair Trade Agreement. Like CAFTA, the Colombia Fair Trade Agreement would level the playing field for U.S. workers by giving the products they make the same access to the Colombian market that Colombian exporters already have to the U.S. market. 
   According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, U.S. exports of manufactured products and the American workers who produce them would be among the biggest beneficiaries of the Colombia Fair Trade Agreement. According to the ITC, U.S. exports of paper products would increase by 28 percent; chemical and plastic exports would increase by 23 percent; metal products by 56 percent; motor vehicles exports would increase to these countries by 44 percent, and machinery and equipment exports to these same countries by 15 percent. The growth in these exports would support good-paying American manufacturing jobs. 
   CAFTA provided American workers an advantage over their competitors in other countries. If Congress doesn't act on the Colombian agreement, American workers will be even further disadvantaged than they are now. Canada has already completed a trade agreement with Colombia, and the EU is negotiating an agreement at this moment. If these agreements go into effect before the U.S.-Colombia Fair Trade Agreement, American workers will lose out to their competitors in Canada and the EU. 
   Madam Speaker, passing this bill today will help American workers, but Congress must also take the next step and pass the U.S.-Colombia Fair Trade Agreement to create even more opportunities for American workers. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation. The truth is that the ``Big Three'' didn't get into this position overnight. They are suffering from decades of poor management decisions, uncompetitive labor agreements, and failure to stay at the cutting edge of innovation. And while this bailout may provide some short-term relief for these companies, it doesn't fix their fundamental problems. 
   My constituents want to know why their tax dollars should be used to bail out companies that haven't been willing to make the necessary changes to stay competitive. They also want to know where we will draw the line. Lots of businesses are hurting because of this recession. How many more bailouts will they be asked to pay for? We all know that this $14 billion is only the first installment. Until these companies are thoroughly restructured and modernized, they will just keep coming back for more taxpayer money. 
   As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I'm also concerned by the last-minute inclusion of a provision that requires the federal government to insure certain leases that the IRS has ruled are illegal tax shelters. Taxpayers who play by the rules certainly don't want to see a bailout for agencies that participated in questionable tax deals. The collapse of AIG does raise some difficult issues, but this provision needs more consideration and should not be in this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an all-around bad deal for the taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to keep the alternative minimum tax from reaching out and ensnaring an additional 19 million new taxpayers, saddling them with an additional $2,000 tax bill. 
   I have long voted to limit the reach of the AMT. In my Northern California congressional district, 54,000 people will pay the AMT in 2007 if Congress fails to act. But today's bill is in the wrong direction. Tragically, this legislation institutes permanent tax increases to pay for extending temporary tax relief. 
   The AMT was originally intended to reach 155 of our country's wealthiest Americans who were not paying taxes and compel them to pay at least some level of taxes, but that original intent never included dipping down into the middle class. The AMT now collects taxes it was never intended to collect. It would be absurd to ``pay for'' extending this temporary fix for another year. 
   Even worse, today's bill sends a clear signal to American families and individuals that the Democrats plan to allow the tax relief of the last 6 years disappear, raising taxes by trillions of dollars on millions of taxpayers. This includes marriage penalty relief, the higher child tax credit, and lower rates on investment income. 
   The House should reject this Democrat pro-tax increase approach to patching the alternative minimum tax.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, counties and schools in my district need a lifeline. They don't need partisanship. They don't need a talking point. They need leadership, which will result in an actual law being passed to help them. 
   Secure rural schools has rested on hard work by grassroots supporters and bipartisan efforts in Congress. So why are we moving a bill that divides our coalition by removing PILT and tying secure rural schools to a controversial offset that we know will fail in the Senate? 
   This bill does nothing to help our counties and schools because it has no chance of becoming law. Yesterday, there was an effort to rescue this legislation with a compromise that would extend a lifeline to rural counties and every American through new domestic oil production and lower gas prices. That proposal was rejected because we were told the majority will not allow consideration of any bill that increases domestic oil supplies. 
   America and our counties and schools deserve better. I urge a ``no'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Madam Speaker, all of us support SCHIP and we all want to reauthorize it, but we need to put low-income kids first. 
   This bill would expand the program to families making more than $60,000 a year. That is not low income. It is a majority of the households in America. There is a better way. Reauthorize  SCHIP and keep it focused on truly needy children, and then tackle rising health care costs that are squeezing middle-class families. 
   Tax credits could help 10 1/2 million kids from middle-income families gain or keep their health care coverage. Millions more would benefit if families could purchase less expensive health plans from across State lines. Let's defeat this motion and get to work on making health care more affordable for all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4. The fundamental question in today's debate is what produces better results, the free market or the Federal Government? Medicare part D was founded on a belief that free markets get results. It is a system in which private companies compete with each other to meet the needs of our senior citizens. These private companies negotiate with drug manufacturers to get lower prices, and the results have been impressive. 
   When the Congress created part D, we expected the average premium to be around $35 a month. Yet, thanks to the power of competition, Medicare beneficiaries actually paid an average of $24 per month, and that number is going down to $22 in 2007. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope we can stop and think about what that means. In every other area of health care, costs are rising far faster than inflation. Where else have we seen an actual decrease in health care cost? 
   At the same time, we can also see the results of a system in which the government imposes price controls or as today's legislation basically proposes.     
   In Canada, a government-run health care system has resulted in long waiting lists for medical care and a massive exodus of talented physicians. In our own country, our brief experiment with price controls in the 1970s ended with disastrous gasoline shortages. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope this Congress will consider the results and vote for the system that gets proven results. 
   I urge my colleagues to soundly reject this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Madam Speaker, I wish I could share the enthusiasm of my colleagues about tonight's bill. I truly do. But right now Americans need to know their jobs will be around tomorrow. Regrettably, this evening's bill doesn't have much in the way of tax relief to spur job creation and should have gone much further. 
   What concerns me more is the expanded redistribution of money through tax rebates that will, I believe, have next to zero positive effect on our economy in the short or long term. And, unfortunately, at more than $100 billion, it can hardly be called ``free money.'' In Congress's hurry to act in reaction to negative economic news, we have truly missed a golden opportunity to enact lasting, pro-growth tax relief. Such relief would benefit all Americans, create new jobs, and drive economic prosperity. 
   I support tonight's legislation, but I believe we can and must do more as a Congress to foster economic growth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I intend to support the conference report; however, I want to share my serious concerns over a provision requiring all foreign ports to scan 100 percent of commercial cargo destined for the United States. 
   First, this policy was not recommended by the 9/11 Commission. Instead, it called for selecting the most practical and cost effective ways of improving security focusing on areas of greatest risk. I believe 100 percent scanning would undermine our current risk based approach as endorsed by the SAFE Port Act last fall, which I supported. 
   We are also putting the cart before the horse given the ongoing SAFE Port Act pilot project that tasked 100 percent scanning at three foreign ports. This is testing our technological ability to scan all cargo and the effectiveness of doing so. Implementing 100 percent scanning could significantly disrupt trade flows and lead to similar mandates or other actions against U.S. exports in our ports. 
   Finally, I wonder who will pay for this mandate inside and outside the United States. We must monitor developments leading to the implementation of 100 percent cargo scanning in 5 years and assess if legislative changes are needed. 
   I also will be watching to see how U.S. shippers, importers, retailers, and our trading partners are able to comply with the mandate.

<DOCNO>Mr. HERGER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Madam Speaker, I hope we all can recognize the profound importance of our mission in Iraq. History surely will. The mission in Iraq will impact our national security for decades to come. 
   The United States seeks a region of stability and peace to create a more secure world for our children and grandchildren. Al Qaeda seeks a region of terror and bloodshed. 
   The President believes victory in Iraq is key to victory on the war on terror. Al Qaeda believes our defeat in Iraq is key to its vision of violent Islamic rule. Our security is clearly at risk. 
   Americans are frustrated by the current situation in Iraq. We have witnessed the removal of a historic dictator, yet our men and women in uniform remain at risk. We have witnessed historic democratic elections, yet those elected have not yet brought security. We have been told about the progress we have experienced in training Iraqi security forces, yet violence continues to rage. 
   With growing uneasiness, we have watched a back and forth tug of war between progress and setback, and we mourn the loss of every single brave American who has fallen during this mission. 
   Madam Speaker, I share this frustration and sorrow. Yet I believe we must not allow our frustrations to blind us to the need for victory over radical jihadists. This House must work together in addressing the challenges in Iraq, because the outcome will be closely linked to our own national security for years to come. 
   Regrettably, the resolution before us does nothing to enhance this security. It does not offer a solution to the challenges in Iraq. It does not recognize the magnitude of the failure. And it does not recognize the nature of our enemies. For these reasons I strongly oppose it. 
   Madam Speaker, we know terrorists friendly to bin Laden are among the enemy in Iraq. Even before the fall of Saddam's regime, the terrorist mastermind Zarqawi had sought refuge in Iraq. His network of terror grew rapidly. Bin Laden's top deputy applauded his actions and counseled him on achieving dominance in the region. Although Zarqawi himself can no longer do harm, al Qaeda in Iraq remains a threat to our security. 
   An American defeat in Iraq would embolden the terrorists like no event before, bolstering bin Laden's view that America is weak. Al Qaeda would enjoy more than just a morale boost; they would have a new operational base to plot attacks against Americans and train new recruits. An American defeat in Iraq would almost certainly bring forth a government that turns a blind eye towards terrorism. This, Madam Speaker, would be catastrophic to our national security. 
   An American defeat in Iraq would also generate unspeakable chaos in the Middle East. The dangerous regime in Iran is already seeking to capitalize on what it perceives as our weakness. Iran is well on its way to developing nuclear weapons, and its fanatical president has publicly said that he wishes to destroy America and Israel. Syria would also take advantage of a power vacuum in Iraq, further destabilizing the Middle East. What is good for hostile regimes like Iran and Syria can be devastating for America's security. 
   In closing, Iraq is a central front in the war on terrorism, and its future will greatly influence our future security. An American victory would foster stability in a volatile region and provide a resounding defeat for terror. 
   For these reasons, we must give the President's new plan in Iraq a chance to succeed. Our resolve must override our frustrations. Our support for the remarkable members of our Armed Forces must be unwavering. And our determination in fighting radical jihadists who want to kill us and our families must never run dry. Madam Speaker, that determination must never run dry

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, this procedural vote, if it is successful, Congress would be rebuffing the Colombia agreement through technical gimmicks and rejecting a level playing field for American workers. 
   Colombian workers and producers already have free access to the U.S. markets, but we don't have reciprocity. Our manufacturers and farmers need this agreement to sell their products, create jobs, and compete against foreign producers. A vote for this rule is a vote against American workers, period. 
   Since the agreement was signed nearly 500 days ago, congressional Republicans and the White House have tried to work with the Democratic majority to approve this agreement. We reached a bipartisan consensus nearly a year ago to ensure congressional consideration of this agreement. 
   In sending up the agreement, the President said that he was open to continuing discussions with the Democrats. The Democratic leadership, through this rule, has firmly shut the door to any discussions. 
   Members should be keenly aware of the very negative foreign policy ramifications of this vote. This rule would be cheered by belligerent leftist guerillas abetted by Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez who seek to undermine the democratically elected Colombian government with menacing ramifications. 
   This rule is a public slap in the face to a loyal ally at the epicenter of a philosophical war between democracy and totalitarianism, capitalism, and socialism. 
   President Uribe made it very clear that the best way to support Colombia's struggle for economic and political security is to pass this agreement. Today's action would trounce that plea and embolden the foes of democracy. I urge a ``no'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1199, the Drug Endangered Children Act. The Drug Endangered Children program is critically important to my congressional district and others that have been plagued by the meth scourge. Thanks to the outstanding leadership of Susan Webber-Brown, Butte County, California, was one of the first jurisdictions in the country to create a Drug Endangered Children team to focus on the safety and protection of children during law enforcement operations. However, due in part to a lack of federal support, the state of California terminated DEC grant funding in 2003. Since then, Butte and other counties have struggled to keep their programs up and running. 
   As a former chairman of the House subcommittee dealing with child welfare and foster care issues, I have heard countless heartbreaking stories of children trapped in some of the most awful living conditions imaginable as a result of their parents' or guardians' involvement with illegal drugs. The Drug Endangered Children program helps rescue children from these dangerous environments, provide for their immediate physical and psychological needs, and give them hope for a better life. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to reauthorize this vitally needed program.
