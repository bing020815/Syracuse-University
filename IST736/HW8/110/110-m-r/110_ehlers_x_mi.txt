<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. As has been stated, this is a labor of love for me for many years. But a few years ago I began noticing or realizing that we were approaching a major inflection point that we should be worried about. 
   As you heard from the principal author of this amendment, that it was in the 1960s that John Kennedy asked for us to go to the moon, proposed this advanced and wild notion, and that inspired a whole generation of Americans to become involved in aerospace. 
   Those individuals are now retiring. And because we hired so many in NASA at one time, they are all retiring at about the same time, which is going to leave us bereft of talent if we don't take action. 
   Because of this, 2 years I introduced a bill which was passed which established an interagency aerospace revitalization task force within the Federal Government. I would have liked to have it be more broad, but I couldn't persuade my colleagues to make that giant leap at that point. 
   But since then that task force which involves, I believe, 17 different Government agencies has worked together. The 2008 report of the Interagency Aerospace Revitalization Task Force was released earlier this year. I spoke at the release. And I was astounded at the number of people in the room. It was a local hotel. The room was overflowing with people concerned about aerospace employment and how we keep the aerospace effort going. 
   This amendment is intended to reinforce what we've talked about for the past 2 years, but it does something very important. As I mentioned, my bill simply addressed the interagency governmental work. But we also have to involve universities. We have to get students excited about aerospace again, and that's what this amendment will do. It will require that NASA reaches out beyond Government agencies, beyond its own boundaries and work with everyone possible to improve STEM education in America, get the young people of today excited about the opportunities in science, particularly in space. 
   So I thank the gentlewoman from California for initiating this amendment. I believe it's going to be very, very important to the future of NASA and for the future of our country, because if we don't get our kids back into math and science education, we are going to become a second-rate Nation. 
   Twenty years ago the nation of China and the nation of India both decided that their economic futures lay in developing highly skilled workers who understood mathematics and science. It worked, and they have gone ahead with leaps and bounds, while our students are still mired where they were 20 years ago. 
   At all levels, from kindergarten on up, we have it take note of that and we have to do a much better job of teaching our children mathematics and science, not just for the sake of NASA, although that's very important, but for the sake of our Nation if we wish to remain competitive with other countries. 
   I will reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding, and I especially thank him for bringing this issue to the floor. 
   I also thank my colleague from California, who works with me on the House Administration committee, for her very perceptive comments on this problem. 
   I would just like to add a little historical insight. I was asked by the new Speaker, Newt Gingrich, some years ago--in 1995 to be exact--to take charge of setting up the new computer system for the House of Representatives. It was a formidable task. And one issue I emphasized over and over was the need for adequate security.     
   We did the best we could at that time. And I was very proud for a number of years that although the White House got hacked, the Pentagon got hacked, the Senate got hacked, we did not get hacked. Those days are over. And every Member of this House of Representatives has to recognize that. 
   This is going to involve, first of all, the best possible technology fix. There's no question about it. But there's another aspect that was mentioned by my colleague from California, and that is training Members and staff on how to deal with this threat and this danger. That is not easy. 
   When I computerized the House, I had to educate my colleagues about computers. It was hopeless. I eventually taught computer classes myself to my colleagues to try to get them interested and to begin using computers. We are going to have to be that direct, that formidable and persistent in ensuring that our colleagues and all our employees understand the threat and that they learn how to deal with the threat and especially learn how to prevent incursions by the actions that they take with their computers and the way they handle their equipment. 
   This is a major issue. I will pledge, as my colleague from California does, that we will attempt our best to address this on the House Administration Committee, and we will certainly do everything possible to solve it. But it is going to require the vigilance of every employee of the House of Representatives and the Senate for that matter.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Chair, I'd like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding to me to speak on this legislation. 
   First of all I'd like to respond to his comments earlier about greening and also the comments of the subcommittee Chair. I have been involved  in environmental issues even before the first Earth Day. And I also, with all the discussion about fluorescent lights, it's more than 15 years ago that we installed fluorescent lights in the most heavily used parts of our house. We have saved immense amounts of energy and, above all, have avoided having to change light bulbs very often. It's certainly a good thing to do, and we should do it here. 
   Also, in connection with the comments made about the carbon footprint of the House, let's recognize the most important thing to do is to start by conserving energy, and that is key. You can gain more energy and greater results by increasing efficiency of the use of energy than any other single thing you can do, not just in the Capitol but, frankly, anywhere. And every reduction in a kilowatt of energy is a reduction in carbon emissions. So you can do two things at once. 
   And I applaud the emphasis on the carbon issue, but that's part of it. Include energy too, that's a very important part. So I encourage the full view. Simply buying credits from someone, if we ever do, and I don't think we should, is not really the answer. We have to reduce the amount we use, and there are many, many ways we can reduce the use of energy in this complex. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) for the compliment on that issue. 
   The main reason I rise today is to express my concerns with many of the administrative provisions in this bill that infringe on the jurisdiction of the Committee on House Administration. These could hamper our ability to provide meaningful and effective oversight of the offices and operations within our purview. 
   I recognize full well I am no longer the chairman of the committee, but I am the ranking Republican. And Mr. Brady, whom I think very highly of, is in total agreement on these issues. 
   Initially, when I saw these, I thought of taking the route of moving points of order against these issues, but I'd prefer to work this out with the Chair and ranking member of the subcommittee. 
   Let me share just a few of the matters that have raised concern among members of the Committee on House Administration. I have also shared these with Mr. Brady and with Mr. Wamp, and I know that Mr. Brady shares my concern. 
   In the section titled ``Legislative Branch-wide Matters,'' the report language states in regard to policies governing contracts with women and minority-owned businesses that ``all agencies shall provide a copy of policies to the Committee on Appropriations of the House and Senate within 60 days of enactment of this act.'' 
   It goes on to say that ``the committee further directs all agencies provide an annual report of their compliance with this policy.'' One of the key reforms in the last decade or so has been giving the Committee on House Administration authority governing use of accounts within the House. The oversight provided by the House Administration Committee was designed to prevent financial abuses and also extended to the creation of procurement guidelines, since procurements are made from House accounts. 
   Those reforms were put in place to guarantee open competition in the procurement process and to ensure that the House would get the best value for the taxpayers' dollars. 
   This bill essentially creates a reporting relationship to the Appropriations Committee that circumvents the Committee on House Administration and damages our committee's ability to perform the vital oversight function that is within our jurisdiction. 
   And I would appreciate it if I could have the attention of the Chair because I'm going to ask a question about this in a few minutes. 
   In the section titled ``Culinary School Students,'' the Appropriations Committee requests that the Chief Administrative Officer contact culinary schools and explore the possibility for culinary school students to enhance their skills and make appropriate arrangements for the students to participate on a rotational basis among the participants in an on-the-job training or similar program. 
   While I certainly appreciate the interest of the Appropriations Committee in training students and creating a more enjoyable dining experience for Members and staff, the House Administration Committee has already tried to do this in the past and found that no culinary schools were interested because of the unpredictable hours of operation. Again, by circumventing our committee's authority, the Appropriations Committee has added another layer of bureaucracy, created a duplication of work for the CIO, and created a conflict of oversight authority. 
   Similarly, in the section titled ``Disability Access,'' the language includes a directive to the Chief Administrative Officer of the House, with the assistance of the Architect of the Capital, Government Accountability Office, and the Office of Compliance, where necessary to do a comprehensive assessment of the Capitol complex regarding disability access. 
   In fact, as required by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, the Office of Compliance conducts biennial ADA inspections of the legislative branch. Most, if not all, of the corrective actions to be taken are under the purview of the Architect of the Capitol. The AOC works closely with the OOC to develop abatement plans and includes cost estimates for that abatement in their annual budget submissions. The CAO is not equipped to conduct this type of study and does not have authority to examine the entire Capitol complex. 
   Just to conclude, while each of these issues are troubling on their own, together with the other concerns I have addressed with Chairman Brady, they carry even greater significance as a symbol of an emerging pattern whereby report language is being used to establish administrative policy that was never intended to be a matter before the Appropriations Committee. If continued, this creates a duplicative oversight function, threatens to severely hamper the oversight ability of the House Administration Committee. 
   We've often heard the term ``the power of the purse strings,'' but in this case the power's being used to grant oversight authority to the Appropriations Committee in a manner that will create additional bureaucracy and cause undue harm, particularly to the jurisdiction of the Committee on House Administration. 
   I would like to yield time to the Chair of the subcommittee to respond to this. I hope that we can resolve this amicably, and that's why I did not make an issue offering points of order to strike language, et cetera. I don't want to make a do-or-die issue of this, but I would appreciate assurances from the Chair of the subcommittee that we can amicably resolve these jurisdiction issues between ourselves and perhaps with the help of the Parliamentarian. 
   And I know that Mr. Brady shares my concern. I believe he's had some conversations with you as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Britt ``Max'' Mayfield on an exemplary career of service to his fellow citizens, and to wish him well in his much-deserved retirement. 
   In his 34 years of service to the Nation, Max Mayfield has personified the dedication and excellence that make the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service one of the crown jewels of the Federal Government. 
   Since he began forecasting weather for the Air Force in 1970 and over more than three decades with the National Weather Service, Max has helped push forward the science of forecasting to help make our Nation a safer place. But just making better forecasts has never been enough for Max, because a forecast does no good if no one hears it. Mr. Mayfield has also dedicated his career to making sure that his always-improving forecasts got out quickly, as quickly as possible, to the people who need them. He understands not only the science of forecasting hurricanes, but the science of communication. 
   There is no doubt in my mind that Max Mayfield's exemplary efforts and those of his hardworking staff at the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Prediction Center have helped communities prepare for impending disasters and have saved lives in communities around the country and around the world. 
   I am not alone in my esteem for Mr. Mayfield. The American Meteorology Society, the National Association of Government Communicators, ABC Television, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, the National Hurricane Conference, the Department of Commerce, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and President George W. Bush have all presented Max with formal awards for his outstanding achievements and service to his craft and to society. And those are just the formal awards. They do not include the many personal ``thank yous'' that he has received from the very people he has spent his life serving, and from the people whose lives he has helped save. 
   My colleagues, in Congress we think we are busy, and, indeed, we are. But I understand that in the thick of storm season, Mr. Mayfield sometimes did more than 100 interviews in 1 day. Now, that is busy. I am certain he is looking forward to retirement. 
   I am pleased to express my deepest gratitude to Max Mayfield and to his endlessly supportive family for sharing him with us for this time. 
   Max, God bless you and the work you have done. I wish you calm weather and smooth sailing in your retirement.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (RECOGNIZING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN SPIRITUAL AS A NATIONAL TREASURE -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 120, recognizing African American spirituals as a national treasure. 
   Simply defined, spirituals are the songs created and first sung by African Americans during the times of slavery. These songs should be celebrated as a part of the American culture today, for they are the source from which gospel, jazz and blues evolved. The lyrics of these songs are tightly linked with the lives of their authors and were inspired by the message of Jesus Christ and the Gospel of the Bible.     
   The most pervasive message conveyed by spirituals is that of an  enslaved people yearning to be set free. The slaves believed they understood better than anyone what freedom truly meant in both a spiritual and a physical sense, and I believe they were correct in believing that. 
   The Old Testament Scriptures that are referenced in their songs spoke of deliverance in this world, and they believed God would deliver them from bondage just as he had delivered the people of Israel. 
   These spirituals are different from hymns and psalms, because their creators used them as a way of sharing the hard condition of being a slave while also singing about their love and faith in God. They used the songs to teach their young, to record their history, and to heal their pain. These songs awakened possibilities in their lives and inspired so many to dream. 
   Because the slaves were forbidden to learn how to read and write, they had to find ways to communicate secretly. The spirituals were a medium for several layers of communication and meaning. 
   Throughout the 20th century the spirituals experienced a renaissance as African Americans documented their struggles for equality. During the 1950s and 1960s, before and during rallies for civil rights, demonstrators often sang spirituals such as, ``We Shall Overcome,'' and, believe it or not, ``This Little Light of Mine,'' one of my favorite songs in my childhood. 
   The lyrics of these new spirituals dealt with improvement and with a new kind of freedom. Many of them were inspired by social problems such as segregation, drug and alcohol abuse, and a basic lack of human equality. Today the congregation of my church in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and so many other churches in our community and across the country, continues to sing these spirituals. They inspire in us the human struggle for freedom and remind us of the lessons of history. 
   I am honored to stand here today in support of House Resolution 120 to express the deepest gratitude and recognition to the former enslaved African Americans for their gifts to our Nation, including their spiritual music and oral history. I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   It always amazes me how the Lord manages to turn evil to good. And this is a good example of that; how under the terrible abuse and sin of slavery came the beautiful spirituals that we are honoring in this particular resolution. It is a real national treasure. It is something that I grew up with. 
   I recall my family, in which we had a number of musicians. Very frequently we were singing Negro spirituals, and in groups at church we would sing Negro spirituals, and yet look where this music came from, out of the terrible black mark on the history of this country when we had slavery over half the Nation. And yet the human response guided by God came out of these people and produced this beautiful, beautiful music. It is a heritage we all have, it is a heritage we must enjoy and, above all, a heritage that we must honor, as we are honoring in this resolution today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise in support of House Resolution 99. This resolution honors the top-ranked University of Nebraska women's volleyball team for their victory over the second-ranked Stanford University Cardinals. The Huskers rallied to defeat Stanford 3-1 for their third NCAA Division I women's volleyball championship in front of a record crowd of 17,209 fans at the Quest Center in Omaha. 
   Led by four All-Americans, including national player of the year Sarah Pavan, the Huskers won the school's ninth Big 12 title in 11 years with a 19-1 Big 12 record, and a 33-1 overall record. This is the second national title that the team has won with head coach John Cook leading the team. 
   I extend my congratulations to Coach John Cook, all of the hardworking players, the fans and the University of Nebraska. I am happy to join my good friends and colleagues, Representatives SMITH, FORTENBERRY, and TERRY, in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments, and wish all involved success in the future. 
   My only regret, since I enjoy playing volleyball myself, is that I never had the opportunity to watch them play in person. But it would have been a real pleasure, had I been able to. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.

That is certainly true, except for one time when I was invited to speak to a conference at the University of Nebraska. At this conference, I was speaking on teaching better mathematics in elementary schools. Then I saw a huge billboard as I was driving into Lincoln to give the speech, and I saw how badly they needed my speech on mathematics, because there was a big billboard that announced ``Welcome to the University of Nebraska. Home of the number one football team in America.'' Well, that year, of course, Michigan was the number one team, but Nebraska refused to concede that.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (NATIONAL STEM SCHOLARSHIP DATABASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National STEM Scholarship Database Act, H.R. 1051. I thank my friend and fellow physicist, Congressman Rush Holt, for introducing this important legislation; and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this excellent bill. 
   For several years, Congressman Holt and I have worked tirelessly to improve our Nation's math and science education. It has been wonderful to have a Member from the other party sharing my concern about the quality of math and science education in this country and the limited number of young people who are pursuing math and science-related degrees. In fact, I'm very pleased that Representative Holt and 115 other Members have joined the STEM Education Caucus that I founded in 2004. 
   Of course, I'm sure by now everyone knows that STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It's very important to make that clear, because tomorrow we'll be debating a few stem-cell issue bills on the floor, and this bill has nothing to do with that. 
   This year, an estimated 111,000 students in Michigan will graduate from high school and may face the pricey but critical investment in their future known as paying college tuition and fees. In Michigan, the average cost of tuition fees is about $6,200 per year at a 4-year public university and $13,250 at a 4-year private university, according to the Chronicles of Higher Education. 
   Unfortunately, data have shown that some students do not attend college or graduate school because they think they cannot afford it. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, science and engineering students who had taken out loans as undergraduates were more likely to indicate a cost-related reason for not applying to graduate school, compared to students who had never borrowed funds. 
   Unbeknownst to some students, significant financial aid resources are available. The Federal Government alone provided about $80 billion in student financial aid this fiscal year, with States providing almost $8 billion in additional financial aid. Also, the private sector provides significant financial aid resources. 
   The National STEM Scholarship Database Act will provide students with better information about available financial aid resources related to the STEM fields. It simply establishes a database to be accessed on the U.S. Department of Education's Website. I am very hopeful that this database will link students with available financial aid resources, and I particularly hope this will encourage more students to enter STEM-related careers by entering graduate schools related to the STEM fields. 
   This is an excellent bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I again thank Congressman Holt for his work on improving STEM education and urge all of our colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 475. I will not go into any detailed explanation of it because the Chair of the committee has already given that. 
   But before I begin my remarks on the legislation before us, I want to express my gratitude to all the dedicated young people who come to serve the House as pages. We are blessed to have such a talented group of young people who are willing to leave home and come here to work for us and for the people of this Nation. 
   I still recall the first page that I appointed during my first term in the Congress. She was a wonderful young woman, and she served here well. She then went on to college, then to medical school, and is now in residency and has established an outstanding record. Both here in the Congress as a wonderful page and academically, she has done very well. I am certain she will be a wonderful doctor as well. This is typical of the types of people that we have in this Congress as pages. 
   This legislation is certainly no reflection on any problems that they have created, but rather a reflection on problems that Members have created. We believe that pages who serve here should feel nothing but pride for the important role they play in the daily operations of this House and in the legislation that we present. The legislation before us is meant to improve the way that we as adults conduct our oversight of the page program. 
   Sadly, the sordid revelations of last fall were not the first time the House had demonstrated a failure to protect the young people who come here to serve in the program. 
   In July 1982, following allegations of sexual misconduct involving Members of both parties and their involvement with pages, the Democratic Speaker and the Republican leader of the House appointed a Speaker's commission on pages to study the page program, its usefulness, and to determine what changes needed to be made to better protect America's youth during their  service to the House of Representatives. 
   Many of the commission's recommendations were adopted by the House, including the creation of a leadership-appointed page board responsible for overseeing the page program. That was certainly a step forward, and today's legislation restructures the board that was created then. It has not been the fault of the pages that we had the incident this past year. It is not even the fault of the page board; but, in fact, rather, it was the fault of not engaging the full page board to deal with the problem that made the problem even worse. 
   This legislation before us will improve the board, make it more effective, and enable it to better carry out its important responsibilities. The pages who work here provide tremendous service to Members, staff, and the operations of the House of Representatives. They gain an invaluable experience, a superb education and improved insight into the workings of their own government. 
   We owe it to them to ensure that we are doing everything possible and to ensure that they are able to have a positive, healthy, and beneficial experience. We must ensure that we are taking good care of and protecting the young people who have been entrusted to us. 
   The legislation that is before us will help us meet our important obligations. I believe that adding an additional member and making it truly bipartisan with no party dominating will be a truly positive change. 
   I believe that adding a former page to the board will be a positive change. In the past at times we have had Members serving on the board who were serving as pages. They performed that function. But by specifically naming a former page to the board, we can ensure that their input is heard. 
   Furthermore, having a parent of a former page or, perhaps, even a current page serve on the board will be an asset to us as we consider the operation of the page program, their education and all the regulations pertaining to them. 
   I hope this legislation will help us meet our important obligation in this regard, and I ask all the Members of Congress to support this excellent piece of legislation.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I continue to support H.R. 3690, after its amendment by the Senate. This bill would provide for the merger between the Library of Congress Police and the United States Capitol Police. The Senate has returned this bill with minor technical changes and clarifying language regarding the computation of annuities for retiring police officers with prior service. These changes are both accurate and appropriate, and I thank my colleagues in the other body for their work on this bill. 
   As I've said before, I'm confident that while the Library of Congress Police and the U.S. Capitol Police Force have different protocols and objectives, this merger will leverage the institutional knowledge of the Library staff with the expertise of the Capitol Police for the benefit of both organizations. 
   I look forward to partnering with Chairman BRADY, who's done yeoman work on this issue, to ensure that the committee maintains ongoing communications with the Library and Capitol Police so that going forward both organizations have the resources and assistance they need to successfully integrate their law enforcement divisions. In particular, we wish to provide the Library and the Capitol Police with a means to communicate with the Congress on the progress of the merger and consider any guidance or resources that they require to achieve long-term success. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, as amended; and it will ensure that the Library's treasures are protected from harm and preserved for generations to come.

   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program both were created to stimulate technological innovation, encourage the use of small businesses to meet Federal research and development needs, and increase private sector commercialization of innovations developed from Federal research and development. I believe both programs have been very successful and should be continued, and, on that basis, I support the legislation before us, although I disagree with some aspects of it. 
   The Science and Technology Committee has a long standing interest in promoting innovation and development by small businesses. Through these two competitive programs, the Small Business Administration is charged with ensuring that the Nation's small innovative businesses are a significant part of the Federal Government's research and development efforts. Currently, 11 Federal departments participate in the SBIR program, including the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Transportation, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics Space Administration, and the National Science Foundation. Of these 11, five departments also participate in the STTR program, awarding $200 billion to small high-tech businesses. 
   The original legislation for SBIR was developed based on the Small Business Innovation Research program of the National Science Foundation. The NSF program was designed to encourage proposals from small science and technology firms in NSF program areas. The current Federal-wide program mirrors the original NSF program, which was also organized in three phases to ensure the most efficient use of resources. 
   Phase I was an opportunity to develop research on important scientific and engineering problems. Projects that were found to be promising after the phase I research stage were given phase II awards to further develop the research project. Phase III is a transition phase that involves commercialization of the products or processes developed in the first phases. 
   Similar to SBIR, STTR is also a highly competitive three-phase program that reserves a specific percentage of Federal research and development funding for small businesses to work in partnership with nonprofit research institutions to help move ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace, to foster high-tech economic development in the United States, and to help to meet the technological needs of the Federal Government. Since the implementation of this program in 1983 through fiscal year 2006, over $20.7 billion has been given in awards for more  than 94,660 projects. The Government Accountability Office, which has been charged with assessing this program, has generally found that these programs have achieved the goal of enhanced participation of a small business in research and development fields. 
   Given the interest of the Committee on Science and Technology on the research and development of new technology, our committee has a unique interest in this bill. We have long been concerned about how America competes with the rest of the world in these areas. Many initiatives that have been passed by our committee in this Congress have focused on the need to improve our competitiveness in the world through funding of science education programs and public outreach efforts. I view this legislation as one more way we can reach out to the public to assist American innovation. 
   My only regret with regard to this legislation is that I do not believe it was able to receive the proper attention it warranted by the Committee on Science and Technology. Our committee shares jurisdiction on this legislation, primarily concentrated on the areas of science itself and the amount of science funding. 
   However, the full committee was not given the opportunity to consider this legislation and have its voice heard with regard to its continuation, primarily because there was a great hurry to bring this bill to the floor. Had regular order been provided, I believe we would be bringing a different bill to the floor today. And in view of that, I have offered an amendment that I believe will strengthen the bill, make it sounder in funding, preserve the funding of other resources and other research in the Federal Government, and also provide an opportunity to increase the funding for SBIR and STTR in the future by bringing up the funding for the other agencies of which these two organizations receive a percentage. 
   But I believe the approach in the bill of simply arbitrarily increasing the funding for SBIR and STTR hurts our research efforts in the Nation, and I will speak later on that topic when my amendment reaches the floor. 
   The second reservation is voiced by Mr. Gingrey of Georgia and, if we have time, we will enter into that discussion later and I will give him an opportunity to speak. 
   I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a member of the Small Business Committee, for 3 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Chairman, the substance of the bill is good. I support the general intent of it. 
   I am very concerned about several aspects. One of those is the size of the increase of the allocation, which is going to hurt our Nation's research effort in its totality. Secondly, the issues raised by Dr. Gingrey which involve giving perhaps too much control and power to the venture capitalists. And, third, the issues relating to the other issues that Dr. Gingrey brought forth regarding category I and category II funding, and the interplay between the two. 
   If we can solve these problems I would hope to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I appreciate the recognition. 
   This amendment is very important in terms of the total research effort of our Nation. H.R. 5819 would increase the Small Business Innovation Research program set-aside from 2.5 percent to 3 percent, a 20 percent increase. It would also increase the Small Business Technology Transfer program set-aside from 0.3 percent to 0.6 percent, a 100 percent increase. My amendment would remove these increases and keep the current set-asides in place at 2.5 percent for SBIR and 0.3 percent for STTR. 
   This is an extremely important issue. The Science and Technology Committee has worked very hard during the last few years to get the America COMPETES authorization bill signed into law. It has now been signed into law. It establishes a funding doubling path for several agencies under Science Committee jurisdiction, several of which are SBIR and STTR funding agencies. However, finding the money to fund these authorizations has not been so easy, and in fact these increased authorizations have not been appropriated. 
   Several of my colleagues have expressed the opinion that an increase in the set-aside for these two programs was justified by the authorized funding increases in the COMPETES Act. However, as I said, these have not been appropriated. 
   My concern and my purpose behind my amendment is to make sure that we are not robbing Peter to pay Paul. If we increase the SBIR and STTR program percentages while other agency's funding remains flat, we begin to severely erode our fundamental research base. I would much rather see us fight over extra funding for our basic research programs, our fundamental research programs, of which a percentage would then transfer into SBIR and STTR. 
   I should point out that my amendment is supported, first of all, by Mr. Obey, who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. He has spoken to me about it, and asked me to specifically mention that he supports my amendment. 
   I believe it is also supported by a large number of Members, as well as the Association of American Universities, the American Association of Medical Colleges, the Biophysical Society, the Campaign for Medical Research, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, the National Association of State and Land Grant Colleges and the Small Business Administration. 
   To quote the President of the Association of American Universities, the change ``would translate directly into cuts in both nominal and real terms in the budgets of most Federal research agencies.'' 
   In real terms, the proposed changes would remove approximately $650 million that is currently provided to researchers, especially those at universities around the country. At the National Institutes of Health, which I believe everyone in this body supports very strongly, if we do not adopt this amendment, the NIH budget would be reduced by $185 million. That is a severe cut. 
   So I urge the adoption of my amendment. I think it actually will improve things. I hope that in the next few years we will get substantial increases in the amount of funding for the various research agencies and SBIR and STTR would receive substantial increases to the percentage that they will continue to receive. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, while not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition.

   Mr. EHLERS. I would just like to offer a few closing comments. 
   First of all, I thank you for your offer to work on this problem together. As you know from working with me on this so often, I totally support research in all areas. My concern in this case is that we would be giving some money to one agency and taking it from others. I think we should work together to increase the funding for both, and all boats will rise. If we manage to give the appropriate amount of money to the research institutions, then SBIR and STTR will automatically increase because of that. So if we work together from that standpoint, I think we will be in total agreement. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, I just would like to thank Mr. Ehlers for his commitment. I look forward to our working together to address the issue of the limited resources. 
   With that, I am prepared to accept the amendment.

   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and would like to comment on this amendment. 
   I have no great objection to it, but I am not terribly excited about it, either. Let me comment. 
   I personally would prefer, if we are going to show preferences here and use the money for that purpose, I would really prefer that we use those funds to give preference to those organizations that submit proposals for doing research and developing areas that will reduce carbon emissions. I think in the long run that might be better for the Nation than simply rewarding those who have taken steps within the organization rather than developing new ideas and inventions that can apply to everyone in the Nation. 
   So, as I said, I will not oppose it, but I did want to make that suggestion.

   Mr. EHLERS. I am not necessarily in opposition to this amendment, but I  just have to express a concern, and that is that we have been going round and round on this issue for a couple of years on venture capital getting involved. I always like the emphasis in this to be on the ``S,'' the Small Business Innovation Research Program, and I worry about getting two venture capital companies involved together on a project. With 500 employees each, you are talking about the equivalent of a company with a thousand employees. How many will fit in this category? For example, even though I have an industrial community, there is no company in my district that would be considered funded by venture capital and that would have that number of employees. 
   Does this then disadvantage smaller communities like mine? Mine is not that small, a few hundred thousand. But nevertheless, we wouldn't qualify at all in this category. 
   My concern, if I may express it, and perhaps you can reassure me on this, my concern would be that the money would tend to flow to those areas of the country that have the large venture capital companies, and areas such as Michigan, which as you know is in a one-State repression, would not be able to put together programs that would fit this particular part of it. I am really concerned about keeping all small businesses in every part of the country fully involved in this. I wonder if the gentleman can give me some reassurances or an explanation on this. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Ehlers, I understand your concern. But I will say that at a time when we are facing an economic crisis in our country where so many small businesses have been impacted because of the lack of access to capital and the credit crunch, this is the time when this amendment makes sense. 
   We are allowing for small businesses and SBIR companies across the country to have the ability to secure venture capital so they can continue to provide innovation and the new technologies that are so needed in our economy. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. EHLERS. Thank you for yielding. 
   I just have to express some concern. We already had a preference earlier for organizations that have exhibited concern about their carbon footprint. And I don't object to the one about veterans, but I worry about getting too many preferences involved here. And Uncle Joe, who's trying to build a widget in his barn, may just fall in the cracks because he doesn't meet any of these preference categories. 
   I don't particularly oppose this one about transportation. Everyone knows we need improvements in that. But there are so many different areas, I don't want to bog down the SBA in dealing with these requests by having to worry about preference after preference. 
   So basically I'm issuing a warning here. Let's watch it in the future, and let's make sure we don't add too many preference requirements or it becomes very, very cumbersome.

   Perhaps the best part about this particular bill and our action on it is to inform us once again how important it is to remember those who have served this country well and have passed on, and to not forget them, because in this case, an entire community, after a period of 145 years, forgot the significance of this individual. 
   I rise today in support of this bill to designate the Ionia, Michigan, Post Office, located in my district, as the ``Alonzo Woodruff Post Office Building.'' 
   Earlier this year, students from Ms. Maureen Powell's eighth grade American social studies class at Ionia Middle School heard about Alonzo Woodruff and the fact that the community had neglected him. They raised private funds, with the assistance of VFW member Commander Denny Craycraft, to place a monument honoring Alonzo Woodruff in front of the Ionia Courthouse.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2830, COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, as an environmentalist and a protector of our Great Lakes, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2830's ballast water management requirements and its stated goal of eliminating aquatic invasive species from our waters.  
   Ballast water management and the broader issue of aquatic invasive species is a matter that has received far too little attention, given its dramatic impact on the economy and the environment. 
   For several years, I have strongly supported a comprehensive approach to stopping the influx of aquatic invasive species, and this bill provides a very, very good start. 
   Although aquatic invasive species enter into ecosystems through many different pathways, such as natural migration, attaching themselves to ships, and aquaculture, the most common pathway is through ballast water. Ballast water is pumped on board a ship to control its stability at sea. Ships often take on ballast water at an initial port and discharge it at their destination port. When a ship pumps harbor water into its ballast tanks, it usually also sucks up aquatic species from that harbor. When those ballast tanks are emptied, those aquatic species are introduced into a new ecosystem and they become invasive species. 
   Since some ships are capable of holding millions of gallons of ballast water, the potential for spreading invasive species is large. Once an invasive species takes hold in a new environment, it has the ability to disrupt the balance of an ecosystem and cause significant environmental and economic harm. 
   In the United States, invasive species cost tens of billion of dollars each year. For example, Zebra mussels have cost the various entities in the Great Lake's basin an estimated $5 billion for expenses relating to cleaning water intake pipes, purchasing filtration equipment and so forth. Sea lamprey control measures in the Great Lakes cost approximately $10 million to $15 million annually. And on top of these expenses, there is the cost of lost fisheries due to these invaders. For these reasons, combating aquatic invasive species is a central element of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration strategy to protect and restore the Great Lakes. 
   However, invasive species are not just a problem in the Great Lakes. Invasive species also affect coastal regions throughout the United States. From the Chinese mitten crabs in the North Pacific, to Asian sea squirts in New England, to New Zealand boring pill bugs in the Pacific Northwest, to Asian carp in the Mississippi River, to Zebra mussels across the United States, these foreign invaders cause significant economic and ecological damage throughout North America. 
   If we do not pass this bill into law, we are just opening the door for many more invasive species to arrive via ballast water. The goal of H.R. 2830 is to eliminate invasive species in ballast water by 2015. To meet this goal, the bill requires vessels operating in U.S. waters to be outfitted with ballast water treatment systems that meet interim standards starting in 2009, with more stringent standards starting in 2012. 
   This is an excellent bill. I urge everyone to support it and vote for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   I rise to raise an issue about Small Business Innovation Research funding and also Small Business Technology Transfer Research funding. This bill which is coming up before us increases SBIR by 20 percent and increases STTR by 100 percent. These increases seem totally out of line to me, particularly since that money comes out of the research budgets of the other agencies of the Federal Government. I have offered an amendment, which I am very grateful to the Rules Committee for making in order, which would remove those increases. 
   Let me explain why it is important to remove those increases. It is because the money for those is taken away from the current fundamental research programs of the Federal Government. In fact, these increases will remove $650 million from the other research funds at various agencies. Just to give an example that we are talking about real money here, note that just for NIH alone, at a time when agency funding increases are below inflation level and we are simply not putting enough money into health research, this particular change in SBIR and STTR will reduce the NIH budget by $185 million. 
   Now we would not think if a proposal came to the floor to directly reduce NIH and NSF funding, we would not even think about bringing it to the floor or even bringing it up for a vote. Yet this particular provision was put in the Small Business bill without the full consent of the Science Committee. It was presented to us in such a short time span, we couldn't even have a meeting of or mark-up by the full Science Committee, which happens to have jurisdiction over this particular payment. We managed to have a hearing before a subcommittee, and that was the extent of the Science Committee's involvement. 
   I think this was done without full thought and I don't believe any of my colleagues are interested in reducing the funding for the National Science Foundation, or the Department of Defense, or the NIH at a time like this. 
   So I thank the Rules Committee again for putting this motion in order. I also wanted to say my amendment is supported by the Association of American Universities, the American Association of Medical Colleges, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, the National Association of State Land-Grant Colleges, and also the National Academy of Sciences. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE DUMPING OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE INTO THE GREAT LAKES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this issue before us first came to my attention 9 days ago in a July 15 story published in the Chicago Tribune entitled ``BP Gets Break  Dumping in Lake.'' Shortly after that I went into a meeting which Mr. Oberstar was chairing, and I alerted him to the issue, because I know he loves the Great Lakes as much as I do. 
   That article highlighted the wastewater discharge permit granted by the State of Indiana to British Petroleum for its refinery facility in Whiting, Indiana, on the shores of Lake Michigan. The new permit allows BP to discharge an average of 1,584 pounds of ammonia per day, up from 1,030 pounds per day, a 54 percent increase above the old limit. The new permit also allows BP to discharge 4,925 pounds of total suspended solids per day, up from 3,646 pounds per day, a 35 percent increase. This level of discharge is extremely disconcerting to me and the entire Great Lakes region. 
   Let me provide a little background information. The BP facility in Whiting was built in 1889 by John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company. Today, it is the fourth largest refinery in the country. It employs 1,700 people and supports another 1,500 contract workers in producing gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. It is a major, major refining operation not just in northwest Indiana, but, indeed, the entire Midwest. 
   BP plans to spend more than $3 billion in upgrading and expanding the facility so it can process more heavy crude from Canada. I support the expansion of refinery capacity to help address our immediate and pressing need for fuel in the Midwest, but I know that the switch to refining more Canadian crude will inevitably lead to more waste from the facility. 
   No one is accusing BP of subverting the regulatory process. The permit went through the regular public comment period, although I must say that the time between the notice and the final issuance seems to me a very short period for a project of this magnitude. According to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, the permit was issued in full accordance and compliance with State and Federal environmental laws. If that is true, and I don't doubt that it is, there is something wrong with State and Federal environmental laws. 
   The benefits of this project should not come at the expense of our most precious natural resource. The Great Lakes are the world's largest freshwater system and serve as a source of drinking water, food, jobs and recreation for more than 40 million Americans. It is critical that we enhance our restoration efforts for this vital resource. It is already polluted enough, and we certainly do not want to degrade the condition of the lakes even further. 
   All the communities and States around the lakes have tried to improve their practices. My own town, my city of Grand Rapids, Michigan, has spent several hundred million dollars improving its wastewater treatment system to help clean up the lake, and that is the story in many cities around the lakes. 
   President Bush 2 years ago issued an Executive Order calling together the mayors and the Governors of the Great Lakes regions, the Members of Congress, the environmentalists and the tribes to work together to develop a solution to the pollution in the lakes. Over 1,500 policymakers and stakeholders came together in a collaborative process to develop a long-term strategic action plan for protecting and restoring the environmental health of the Great Lakes. I was proud to participate in that process as the congressional representative, and I have a bill in process which will make the collaborative's recommendations come into law. 
   The discharge of harmful pollutants that is proposed by BP and permitted by the State of Indiana is totally inconsistent with the goals of Great Lakes restoration. Ammonia and TSS, suspended solids, promote algae blooms that can suffocate fish, destroy fish habitat, deprive plants of sunlight and oxygen, and trigger beach closings. We cannot allow for more of these kinds of problems in the lake. 
   For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I would urge both the EPA and the State of Indiana to take a second look at this permit and find a better means of disposal. I also urge BP to look at other means of disposal. Certainly if they can afford to pipe crude oil from Canada thousands of miles through pipelines, they certainly should be able to find a better solution for disposal of wastes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Speaker, I will be pleased to offer some comments to close, particularly in view of the previous speaker. 
   As I said in my earlier comments, I emphasized I was not condemning British Petroleum for their actions; although, I wish they had taken the lead in demonstrating the environmentalism that they often advertise that they have. But I do deplore that the State of  Indiana was willing to give them a permit. I do deplore that the Environmental Protection Agency was willing to give them a permit. 
   This is contrary to everything that we have been trying to do to clean up the Great Lakes, at huge expense. All over the Great Lakes, communities have tried to clean it up, and my preference would be not only that BP does not add to the load they're putting in the lake, I would prefer that they say, we're going to find a different method, and we're not even going to dump in the lake what we're dumping in now, because they are already dumping a substantial amount in. 
   The goal here is not to drive BP away. It's not to stop the refinery project. I'd emphasize that over and over. The goal is to make sure that we can maintain the purity and cleanliness of the Great Lakes. And Lake Michigan, of course, drains into three of the other Great Lakes and with a smattering going into Lake Superior. So this is a very important issue. 
   The gentleman talked a minute ago about drinking water out of the lakes. Forty million Americans draw their water out of the Great Lakes, their drinking water. That is a huge number of people. We are very worried about cleaning up the mercury that already exists in the lake, also the toxaphene and other contaminants, because people are drinking that water, and they are getting ill. 
   The goal here is not to stop BP. The goal here is to make certain they find an alternative method of disposing of the ammonia and the total suspended solids that they are proposing to dump in the lake, and I would hope they also, while they're doing that, stop dumping what they are dumping, and make sure all the ammonia, all of the total suspended solids get disposed of elsewhere. Perhaps they can use a waste landfill, perhaps something else, but certainly we do not want them to be dumping any additional contaminants into the Great Lakes system. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. EHLERS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of S.J. Res. 25, the appointment of John W. McCarter as a citizen regent of the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents. 
   The previous speaker, the Chair of the House Administration Committee, has pointed out the outstanding record of Mr. McCarter and what he has done. He is the ideal appointee to the board of the Smithsonian.     
   Mr. McCarter combines extensive experience as director of the Field Museum, which is a responsibility very similar to that of the Smithsonian Museum, although perhaps on a smaller scale. His experience in the day-to-day operations of the Field Museum will hold him in good stead on the Smithsonian Board. Furthermore, he has considerable experience in the private sector, and that experience will also be most helpful in the operation of the Smithsonian. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have had some problems with the Smithsonian during the past few years, with both the previous secretary and with some of the enterprises the Smithsonian has engaged in. I would volunteer that Mr. McCarter is precisely the sort of person we need to straighten out the operations of the Smithsonian, to serve with his unique knowledge in the field of museums, and also his role in business. I believe he is going to make an outstanding addition to this board. I am very confident that we should appoint him, and that he will be a well-qualified, highly capable addition to the board charged with protecting the Nation's Attic, as we fondly call the Smithsonian. I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 5159, which establishes an Office of the Capitol Visitor Center under the organization of the Architect of the Capitol. 
   As the Chair of the committee has pointed out, this has been a long progress, probably longer than it needed to be, but it started at the time I was the Chair of the committee. Unfortunately, the original ideas which we advanced were not accepted by all parties involved, and it has taken a considerable amount of effort to reach the point we are at today. However, what we have today is a good suggestion, a good document, a good organization, and I am very pleased with it, largely because it is very similar to what we started out with more than a year ago. 
   This new Office of the Capitol Visitor Center will be headed by the newly appointed Chief Executive Officer for Visitor Services, Terrie Rouse. Ms. Rouse has done a superb job in bringing together her management team to make sure that the Capitol Visitor Center is fully operational and prepared to receive visitors as soon as the building is ready to be occupied. 
   The legislation we are considering today provides a framework for the effective management and administration of the CVC, while at the same time ensuring that Members of the House and Senate have a definitive role to play in governing the operation of the CVC. 
   This marvelous building, which will be enjoyed by Americans for years to come, will operate in a way that, with this structure, will serve greatly to strengthen the safety and security of the Members, staff, and visitors to the Capitol, but above all, will create an unparalleled visitor experience for the millions of Americans who visit their Nation's Capitol each year. 
   In addition to being a significant administrative step in the operations of the CVC, this bill is also an important milestone as we move closer toward the facility's opening. In just a few short months, at least we hope they are a few short months, the first visitors to the CVC will have an opportunity to experience the majestic displays that highlight significant accomplishments made by the legislative branch that contributed to the development of our Nation's rich history. Though some visitors may be hundreds or even thousands of miles from home, they will remain connected through interactive kiosks that feature biographical data about their Member of Congress, and they will learn how to contact their Member. 
   For those Members who have not yet had an opportunity to tour the CVC, or for Members who took a CVC tour several months ago, I urge all those Members to take the time to take a new tour of the facility in its current state so that each and every Member may  experience the facility as it will appear to our constituents. 
   As we complete the final steps before the facility opens, I thank Chairman Brady for his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor. As I said earlier, this bill has a unique history with considerable difficulties, and I commend Chairman Brady for managing to steer this bill through the pitfalls and rapids that often encumber bills, and he has presented an excellent bill to this Congress. 
   This bill will ensure effective management and administration of the Capitol Visitor Center with oversight by the Committee on House Administration and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Chairman Brady as we continue our oversight activities over the Capitol Visitor Center, and as we near its November 2008 opening date and far, far beyond. I once again thank the chairman for his good work on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT MEMBERS' CONGRESSIONAL PAPERS SHOULD BE PROPERLY MAINTAINED -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 307, which expresses the sense of the Congress that congressional papers should be properly maintained and encourages Members to take all necessary measures to manage and preserve these papers. 
   This is a very important issue, and one that I am also delinquent on, as I suspect most Members are. At various times I have encouraged my staff to be certain that we take proper care of papers, that we maintain them, and that they are available for archiving once we leave office. But yet, it is a very difficult task to do this on a day-to-day basis and remember to do it. 
   Let me also bemoan the fact that the executive branch has been subjected to lawsuits on this isssue, and the courts have declared they must save every little piece of paper, every message, and they are open to scrutiny and subpoena at any time in the future. The net effect of this is that the White House puts hardly anything down on paper, a practice that was developed in the previous administration as well. That is unfortunate. We should have the freedom to express our thoughts freely and make certain that they are preserved in a fashion that prevents them from being used improperly in future times. 
   As Members of Congress, we are routinely faced with an abundance of notes, letters, and other papers that cross our desk each day. For each of us, there is a temptation to rid ourselves of today's notes and papers and begin each day anew, free from the scourge of clutter. And I know my office certainly should be more free of clutter. It would be easiest to discard these items along with rest of the day's castoffs, but as history has shown us, it is often these mundane items that have painted the most accurate and detailed picture of our Nation's history. 
   These papers and their contents separately may tell us very little about the place and time in which they were created, but they are threads that, when woven together, create the fabric of our democracy. 
   While congressional papers are the property and responsibility of the Member, the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate stand ready to assist Members of Congress in the disposition and handling of these materials. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in the effort to retain congressional documents, and in doing so, preserve a piece of history for the sake of our individual and collective posterity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (OUR RICH HISTORY OF FAITH -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding, and I especially thank him for organizing this discussion together. 
   My comments are going to be a bit different from some of the others because I'm going to talk about an event in my hometown this week which brought home to me how far we have strayed from our complete understanding of the Constitution of the United States. 
   Let me quote the first amendment, and this amendment is first because the 13 colonies decided this was the most important amendment. ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,'' et cetera. 
   The event I'm going to talk about that happened in my hometown received extensive coverage. A graduating student at a local public high school was asked to give a speech. This is a model student. He had done well, he was respected, and he was asked to talk about his life experiences. And in that talk, which he had to submit for approval ahead of time, he discussed his life experience, including his religious life. That was judged improper, and he was removed from that particular duty that day. 
   Now, I fail to understand how anyone reading the first amendment of the Constitution would think that the Supreme Court has ruled that a student discussing his life experiences could not mention his religious life. And yet that is how far we have come in this Nation in our misunderstanding of our origins and what it should be. 
   I come from a religious community. In fact, our community is sometimes called the ``City of Churches,'' Grand Rapids, Michigan.     
   Last week, we dedicated a Hindu temple; a few years ago, a Buddhist temple. And we also have a Muslim mosque, actually, fairly close to my home. 
   We meet the test of the first amendment. We do not prohibit the free exercise of religion and the founding of various religious establishments. But I have to say, with this particular high school, I would not be able to give a commencement speech there because I would not be able to give a commencement speech without speaking about my life experiences and what I thought the students were going to face, and what they would need to face their life experiences. 
   I find it fascinating in the Capitol, we start with prayer every day, we have a chaplain, we have a Prayer Breakfast once a week, we have Bible studies in the Capitol. No one raises a feather against this and says this is wrong, this is unconstitutional. And if it's permissible in the Capitol of the United States, why is it not permissible across the Nation? It should be. Everyone should be free to discuss their beliefs and their religion and  their faith in God. That's what the first amendment is all about. 
   And let's not get hung up about Supreme Court decisions, ACLU lawsuits, et cetera. Let's recognize the clear language of the first amendment and let's let our citizens have the freedom that the founders of this Nation intended in the area of religious belief and the government's role therein.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (ESTABLISHING DUTCH-AMERICAN FRIENDSHIP DAY -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a cosponsor in strong support of H. Res. 89, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a day should be established as Dutch-American Friendship Day, to celebrate the historic ties of the United States and the Netherlands. 
   My district in West Michigan has some of the deepest roots of Dutch-American history and heritage in the country. Dutch explorers, traders and settlers were a significant part of the earliest European exploration of the New World, especially in New York and New Jersey. However, the first major wave of Dutch immigration began in the 1840s with the Dissentings (later on known as Calvinists), a new group of religious people in the Netherlands. Like so many of the original settlers here in America, they wanted more religious liberty than they experienced in their home country. They were also seeking prosperity in a time of economic downturn and agricultural hardship in Europe. So the Dutch pilgrims dared the journey across the Atlantic to New York and then moved across northern New York and finally settled near the shores of Lake Michigan. Waves of Dutch settlers soon found Grand Rapids and Holland, Michigan, to be the places of job growth and the religious liberty they were seeking. 
   I am proud to report that the traditions of a ``Dutch work ethic'' and religious devotion still permeate Grand Rapids and the West Michigan region today. Generations of Dutch immigrants have enriched our area with the unique customs and traditions of their ancestral homeland. They are a people that have given the world great artists, celebrated philosophers, noted theologians, and leaders of international business. 
   The Dutch-American Friendship Day called for in this resolution would be an honorable response to annual celebrations in the Netherlands. Every year, the Dutch-American community in the Netherlands commemorates the bilateral relations between the Netherlands and the United States. Celebrated on April 19, the Dutch-American Friendship Day remembers the day that John Adams, the second president of the United States, was received by the States General in The Hague and recognized as an ambassador of the United States of America. It was also the day that the house he had purchased at Fluwelen Burgwal 18 in The Hague became the first American Embassy in the world. Today, the diplomatic ties between our two governments are the longest continuous ties between the U.S. and any other country in the world.  
   This long history of diplomacy, cooperation and friendship should be lauded as an example for all nations. I congratulate my colleague from West Michigan, Peter Hoekstra--himself a Dutch-American--for introducing this resolution. I am proud of my family's and my wife's family's Dutch roots, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (AUTHORIZING USE OF ROTUNDA FOR CEREMONY TO AWARD CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO DR. NORMAN E. BORLAUG -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H. Con. Res. 164, which authorizes use of the rotunda of the Capitol for a ceremony to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug. 
   Through a lifetime of research and development aimed at curing world hunger, Dr. Borlaug has exemplified how science and humanitarianism can intersect to address the needs of developing countries that have been ravaged by the effects of hunger and poverty. By introducing high-yield, disease-resistant varieties of wheat to India, Mexico and Pakistan, Dr. Borlaug developed sustainable, renewable food sources that are frequently estimated to have saved over a billion lives. 
   The results of Dr. Borlaug's research were remarkable, yet not surprising given the commitment of this man of science to find practical, applicable solutions to the world's problems, not, as he put it, chase academic butterflies. Dr. Borlaug's efforts to apply science to stimulate agricultural yield have been frequently credited as being a major milestone of the Green Revolution, and he himself has often been cited as the father of that movement. 
   In 1970, Dr. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in India and Pakistan, and for his role in the Green Revolution. When he was advised in October of that year that he had won the enormous honor, Dr. Borlaug was where he spent many of his hours--in the farm fields of Mexico. When his wife drove an hour to reach him in the fields and advise him that the media was waiting for his reaction, Dr. Borlaug declined to return to the house, saying that he and his assistants still had much more work to do, as he continued to record data on his test plots. It was there that the TV camera crews found him 2 hours later. 
   In addition to the Nobel Prize, Dr. Borlaug has been recognized with the 1977 U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 2002 Public  Welfare Medal from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the 2002 Rotary International Award for World Understanding and Peace, and the 2004 National Medal of Science. He has also received numerous honorary degrees from around the world. 
   Though he has received many accolades, Dr. Borlaug has been quick to point out that his work alone will not be enough to cure world hunger. In 1986, Dr. Borlaug created the World Food Prize, an international award recognizing the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by continuing to improve the quality, quantity and availability of food in the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to support H. Con. Res. 164 to authorize use of the Capitol rotunda to honor Dr. Norman E. Borlaug as he receives the Congressional Gold Medal. It is fitting that such an honor be bestowed upon a man who has done so much, for so many.  
   The concurrent resolution was agreed to. 
   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I have rushed down to the floor to support this amendment, and a little history is helpful at this point. 
   When No Child Left Behind was written, it removed Eisenhower funding from the program. We had been putting in over $400 million per year for Eisenhower funding, most of which went to math and science education. I had written a formula into the bill as it left the House which put Math-Science Education in great shape and maintained roughly the same funding that the Eisenhower program had. However, the Senate removed that provision, and ever since then we have been funding math and science education at considerably lower figures than we did before No Child Left Behind was written. 
   In this particular bill, the Department of Education has received a substantial boost, No Child Left Behind has received a substantial boost, but the funding for math and science education has remained level, and that just doesn't make sense. 
   We know from the statistics and the measurements, and the international tests that have been made, that our students are not able to compete with students from other countries at the 12th grade high school level. We are far behind, and we have made a valiant effort in this body to improve that situation. 
   I have started the STEM, Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, Education Caucus. Well over 100 Members of Congress have joined us because they support the need for improving math and science education. If we are serious about competing with other countries in innovation and development, and getting our manufacturing up to snuff, we have to improve our K-12 education, and that is what this amendment is all about. 
   I very strongly support the amendment, and I urge the body to adopt this amendment. With that, I yield back.

   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Chairman, I would like to remind everyone that not too many years ago when America was just getting into the space program, we were very excited about launching the first satellite into space when the Russians launched Sputnik. This was a national disgrace. President Eisenhower had to go on national TV to apologize. He set in place a large number of science and math programs to get us caught up with the Russians. 
   The Eisenhower programs continued for many years until we decided to write No Child Left Behind, and we killed the Eisenhower funding, which was in the neighborhood of $450 million a year to teach teachers how properly to teach math and science. 
   In its place, we adopted a Math and Science Partnership Program, which operates within the Department of Education. However, the funding, which was authorized at $450 million, which matched the Eisenhower funding of the era before, was never appropriated at a level near that. It has gone up slightly each year. 
   But this year, even though the appropriations bill increases the No Child Left Behind funding by $8.6 percent, it held the funding for Math Science Partnerships flat, exactly where they were last year. My amendment would increase the Math Science Partnership funding by precisely the same percentage as the entire No Child Left Behind Act was increased. 
   The offset for this I selected is from the Department of Labor in an area that was funded far above the President's request. I believe this is a reasonable offset. Apparently the CBO agrees. They have scored my amendment as a $10 million savings overall. 
   So, here I am, proposing an amendment which will improve our math-science education effort in this Nation. I think it will be very advantageous for our teachers and our schools. Furthermore, the offset is appropriate, and the entire amendment saves the Federal Government $10 million. 
   I strongly urge the adoption of this amendment. I believe it is reasonable and appropriate. 
   Madam Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt).

I am simply asking that it be increased the same amount as No Child Left Behind. I am quite willing to trust the judgment of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and others in conference to make appropriate adjustments to the Labor Department or wherever else adjustments are needed, but I would certainly appreciate bringing the Math and Science Partnership funding up to exactly the same level that No Child Left Behind has been increased because it is part and parcel of No Child Left Behind.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. Con. Res. 67, which will establish the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. 
   As everyone in this Nation knows, we are in the midst of an election year. It is a particularly exciting election year because it is the first time since 1952 that we do not have a presumptive heir apparent, and we have had considerable activity and considerable citizen interest. We are now at the point where the public is in the process of deciding between Senator McCain, Senator Clinton, or Senator Obama; and we will continue to have considerable interest in November. In fact, I can almost guarantee that the public will be tired of the election process come next November. 
   But then we enter a new phase, a new phase of great excitement, and that is the inauguration of a new President of the United States of America. The inauguration of the President of the United States is not only an event that fills our own citizens with pride, but one that also demonstrates the power of democracy to the world. 
   As Chief Justice Roberts swears in our 44th President, the inaugural ceremony will once again prove that in a free society, no matter the size of its army or how mighty its leaders, a peaceful transfer of power is possible, a peaceful transfer engendered by the choice of the people. 
   Since 1901, all inaugural ceremonies at the U.S. Capitol have been organized by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. This committee was formed to ensure that the activities surrounding President William McKinley's second inauguration were carried out smoothly on the Capitol Grounds, and it has been re-formed every 4 years since. 
   The current reconstitution of the JCCIC with each Presidential cycle is integral to the success of one of the most powerful and humbling symbols of our Nation's commitment to freedom from tyranny. It is a marvelous occasion, and I am struck by it particularly this week as another great nation, Russia, is going through the presidential election process, almost without campaigns, because the winners have been pre-selected. I am proud to be part of a Nation that does not do that, but that encourages all citizens to consider the candidates and elect a citizen and a President of their choice. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the formation of this important joint committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this rule for a number of reasons. Yesterday I testified to the Rules Committee regarding my amendment to allow the U.S. Department of Education to continue its evaluation of the Upward Bound program. I am astonished that, because of the Rules Committee action, the full House is not given an opportunity to consider this amendment. 
   Let me first of all make it abundantly clear, I am a very strong supporter of the Upward Bound program. There have been some preliminary studies in the Department of Education that indicate the program may not be living up to its potential. I am not sure I believe those. But currently the Department of Education has announced a rigorous, random assignment study, that is considered the gold standard of research methodologies, to evaluate the Upward Bound program's impact on students most in need of services. I believe this is a very important study to determine exactly what works best in Upward Bound and how we can improve it. 
   Unfortunately, during the Education and Labor Committee's consideration of the College Cost Reduction Act, the committee adopted an amendment by voice vote to prohibit this important evaluative study of the Upward Bound program, not so much because they were against the program, but because of an ancillary aspect of it that the amendment was aimed at. My amendment would have left the ancillary program out in the dust, but would have allowed the study to go forward. As a scientist and a strong advocate for research funding, I know it is imperative that we conduct rigorous evaluations using the most sound, scientifically robust methodology to identify best practices in Federal programs, and I wish that my amendment had been made in order. 
   It is unfortunate that this bill does not promote good evaluation, which is critical to ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and effectively. It also ensures that students are benefiting from proven services. 
   Finally, I want to express my dismay that the manager's amendment strikes the two amendments that I offered during committee consideration, which were adopted by voice vote and are noncontroversial. In particular, I am dismayed that an amendment I offered about sustainability programs at universities is removed by the manager's amendment. 
   I thought with Speaker Pelosi's high priority on environmental improvement and saving energy, that the new majority would accept that amendment, as they did in committee, and would let it remain in the bill so that we can wake up some of our higher educational institutions and get them to adopt sustainability programs and also establish academic programs so that future students can be educated in sustainability principles, so that we in fact as a nation can ``go green'' much more rapidly. 
   For these reasons, I will vote ``no'' on this unfair rule.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 62, a resolution congratulating the Grand Valley State University Lakers for winning the 2006 NCAA Division II Football National Championship. 
   Head Coach Chuck Martin and his team have helped to bring national reknown to GVSU's campuses in Allendale, Grand Rapids and throughout West Michigan with their excellence on the field. Over the past five years, the Lakers have won four National Championships in their division, a feat that has been duplicated at no other level of college football in the same time span. 
   The senior class of this team compiled a four-year record of 52-4, making them the winningest senior class of football players in NCAA history. Led by quarterback Cullin Finnerty, Eric Fowler and Mike McFadden--each of them named first-team Little All-America players by the Associated Press--the Lakers dominated their competition to an undefeated 15-0 season, culminating in a 17-14 championship victory over the Northwest Missouri State University Bearcats on December 16, 2006, in Florence, Alabama. 
   The game was witnessed by 7,000 fans in the stadium and by a worldwide audience including our soldiers in Iraq and elsewhere, who watched the game on the Armed Forces TV Network. One GVSU official, my former press secretary, Chris Barbee, reported hearing from two soldiers in Iraq congratulating the team on its victory. 
   The Laker football team is emblematic of Grand Valley State University as a whole--a thriving, bustling university in West Michigan with more than 23,000 students and nearly 2,000 faculty and staff. The university, led by its new president Thomas J. Haas, is striving for excellence at all levels academic and athletic alike. 
   Congratulations again to Grand Valley State University, Coach Martin and his staff, and all the players, support staff and fans who made this championship a reality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Head Start conference report and I thank Representatives MCKEON, CASTLE, MILLER and KILDEE for their work on producing an agreement with the Senate. 
   For several years, I have worked to improve Head Start's academic and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start provisions. 
   For thousands of children, Head Start serves as their first formal learning experience. Three- and four-year-olds are open to learning about the world around them, and they should be presented with a wide range of early academic concepts. I am very pleased that this conference agreement includes provisions to ensure that these children are exposed to math and science. I certainly do not intend for Head Start to teach ``rocket science,'' but rather for its teachers to equip Head Start preschoolers with the extremely basic concepts of math and science. Perhaps it will spark the imagination of some kids, and lay the foundation for them to become rocket scientists many years later. 
   With regard to Migrant and Seasonal Head Start, I joined with Representatives GRIJALVA, HINOJOSA and SANCHEZ in securing a 5 percent funding floor for Migrant and Seasonal Head Start in the House version of the bill. For far too long, funding for Migrant and Seasonal Head Start has lacked parity with other Head Start programs. I am disappointed that the conference report abandoned the House- and Senate-passed 5 percent floor, but I recognize the difficulty conferees had in finding a workable formula. I hope that Members will join me in supporting funding for Migrant and Seasonal Head Start in the future since it is a sorely needed program for workers of our fields and their children. 
   I urge Members to support the conference report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. 
   We've heard a lot of discussion, pro and con, on this bill. It is a good bill. Now, it spends more money than I would like. It actually lists more money than we will ever spend. This is an authorization bill; it is not an appropriations bill. And I know from 14 years of trying to get the appropriators to spend more money on science research that they will not appropriate anywhere near the money that we are authorizing in this bill. So, please don't think because it's a bigger bill than we expected that it's actually going to result in those expenditures. 
   Let me also comment about the investment aspect. I get tired of the word ``investment'' here. Everyone says we're going to invest money in this, we're going to invest in that, when actually we are just spending money. But this is a bill where we're clearly investing money, and there is a return on the investment in this money, because we are investing in research with a return on it. 
   When I first came to the Congress I was commissioned by Chairman Sensenbrenner and by Speaker Gingrich to write a report on where we should be going in science in this country. I did so and I examined this investment issue. I tried to pin it down. 
   There are lots of expert estimates on the return on investment on scientific research. The lowest figure I found was 25 percent annual return. The biggest number I found was 4,000 percent annual return. Take your pick between, but it's better than any other investment you can do. There is substantial return on science investment. 
   Let me give you one example. Years ago, when I was a graduate student, a friend of mine, Charles Townes, now a Nobel Prize winner, developed a laser. We all knew the principles of it. We knew he would likely succeed at some point. He operated with government funding, through a research contract. I don't know the exact amount, but I doubt if it was a great deal more than $10 million in the dollars of that day. He did develop the laser. 
   Today, the laser has created a multi-, multi-, multibillion dollar industry. The clothes you are wearing were cut out with lasers. Many of you have had laser surgery in hospitals or in doctors' offices. Every pipeline laid in this country is laid with directional laser beams. Every ceiling hung in this country and throughout the world is hung with the use of lasers. 
   The first laser I had cost about $1,000. I used it for research in the lab. Today, for $15.00 I can buy an equivalent laser in the gift shop in the Longworth building to use as a pointer. All of that, this multibillions of dollars simply from a $10 million Federal grant. That is the type of return we're talking about here. 
   This bill is a blueprint for the direction we want to go. We will by no means do all the projects in here. We will by no means invest all the money that is authorized here. Science is a progressive field. We will do the research. We'll find what pays off, and what doesn't pay off. This progressive process of science will allow us to efficiently allocate our resources as we determine the results. 
   Now, there are some things in this bill I don't think are that good. ARPA-E receives a lot of mention. I don't know if it will work. It worked fantastically in the Defense Department when we did it there. Will it work here? We don't know. We'll find out. If not, we kill the project. 
   We spent a lot of money here in the first years the Republicans took over this majority in doubling the investment in the National Institutes of Health. The amount of money we put into the National Institutes of Health alone during that period is greater than the total sum of money authorized in this bill. We put it in. It has paid off. Better health products, better analytical techniques to determine illness, to find cures. Very rarely, if you do the science carefully and it's peer-reviewed, very rarely do you find out that it is a bad investment. 
   Another aspect, we are losing out to other nations in international competition. We are losing out in science and math education. We're losing out in innovation. We're losing out, obviously, in manufacturing because of outsourcing. 
   If you look at the proof of that, simply examine the scores of our students in 12th grade classes in math and science in international tests across the entire world. Where do we come out? You've heard Chairman Gordon mention some of that a little while ago, but we are not proud of the results. 
   In physics, we are last of the developed countries in our student scores in 12th grade physics. We are second from the last to all developed nations in the scores for mathematics in 12th grade. We are about fifth from the bottom in general science, just a composite of science subject. In the PITA studies which were completed recently in mathematics comparing students in developed nations, the United States was last out of 21 nations. 
   We cannot compete in this world if we don't improve. We have to teach our students better. We have to train our teachers better. We have to train the teachers coming out of college so that they can teach in the high schools. We have to train the teachers who are already teaching, who from my experience I know want to teach better, but they have never been properly taught science and math or how to teach it. That again is part of this bill. 
   America is based on competition. We are a competitive Nation. We survive on competition. We thrive on it. Give us a chance. Give our kids a chance by properly training them to be able to do the scientific research and the technical work that this world needs. 
   We have to conquer this manufacturing problem we have now. We talk about jobs going overseas because there are cheaper wages. I have talked to manufacturers. I have a manufacturing district. That's not it. They're going overseas to get the talent, not to get the cheap salaries. 
   With our cutback on H-1B visas, many of my manufacturers are being forced to go abroad to get the work done. I don't like it. They don't like it. And if we do the job right, we will once again bring those jobs back to this country. 
   Finally, I just want to mention the huge number of endorsements this bill has received. The Chamber of Commerce has endorsed it and is scoring it. The National Association of Manufacturers has endorsed and is scoring it. And I've a list here and Chairman Gordon has also handed out a list of some 30 different scientific organizations supporting this bill. 
   This is not a fly-by-night bill. It may be more expensive than we want, but we won't spend all the money, I can guarantee that, because the research will be thriftily done and through a progressive scientific method of handing the money out and doing the research step by step.  
   This conference report represents the culmination of years of work by many people. Expert reports from the National Academies, Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers and Business Higher Education Forum--just to name a few--kept telling Congress that the federal government must increase its investment in basic research and in science and math education, and must ensure that the funds it invests are spent on programs that will keep the U.S. competitive in the global economy. These reports had an enormous impact on the White House's thinking about competitiveness, and resulted in the President's introduction of the ``American Competitiveness Initiative''. Congress has responded to the recommendations about precisely what steps the government should take in the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007 before us. 
   Beginning in 2006, the President's American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI), launched a three-pronged approach to competitiveness by strengthening research at the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science at the Department of Energy, and the laboratories and construction of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This bill fully supports the ACI-requested improvements as well as strengthens programs focused on teacher training and education in science, technology, engineering and math. 
   The 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007 also includes some new ideas, such as the establishment of a DARPA-like agency at the Department of Energy. While I have been skeptical of this idea, it did originate with the experts at the National Academies, and, if it is able to achieve its goals of overcoming some of the great technology hurdles needed to  solve our energy problems, it would be revolutionary. The conference committee recommended $300 million to get this idea off the ground, a much lower amount than was originally proposed. 
   Last but not least, the bill also addresses the long-term problems facing our nation's manufacturers by broadening and strengthening manufacturing extension services and reviving manufacturing innovation through collaborative research and development. Although manufacturing has experienced tremendous technological gains over the last few years, international competition has exacted a toll on our nation's manufacturers. There is no evidence that these pressures are likely to go away, but this bill takes steps to help our manufacturing workforce grow and innovate. 
   It is clear that our nation is at a crossroads. The U.S. will either invest in innovation or witness the gradual erosion of our economic position and, quite possibly, the quality of life to which Americans have become accustomed. I recognize that many of my colleagues are concerned that this bill spends more than $40 billion dollars over the next three years. If there is ever an investment that will guarantee an economic return, this is it. To quote from the executive summary of the National Academy of Science (NAS) report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future:  
   Having reviewed trends in the United States and abroad, the committee is deeply concerned that the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength ..... [W]e are worried about the future prosperity of the United States ..... We fear the abruptness with which a lead in science and technology can be lost--and the difficulty of recovering a lead once lost.  
   Science and technology are the fundamental movers of our economy, and if we want to remain globally competitive, this bill is the sure fire way to guarantee results. The dividends paid by training scientists, engineers, and teachers will multiply throughout all sectors of our economy. 
   I want to thank Chairman GORDON and Ranking Member HALL for working on all of the bills that have become a part of the 21st Century Competitiveness Act. I hope my colleagues will support this investment in our nation's future.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2272, AMERICA COMPETES ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   You heard one speaker say this was a bad bill and should not be passed. You heard another one say it is a good bill and should be passed. There are good points on both sides of that argument. But I would point out that I have never seen a perfect bill reach the floor of this House; and, on balance, I believe this bill is good and should be passed, and I will be supporting the bill and presumably the rule that is presenting it to us. 
   I do this in spite of the fact that Dr. Gingrey and Ranking Member Hall, whom I have great respect for, have serious doubts about the bill. 
   Let me explain why I am supporting this. America is in trouble. It is in trouble in several areas. It is in trouble in science, and it is in trouble in education, manufacturing, outsourcing. Let me examine some of those. 
   Just an example, science education. Had I the time I could give you chart after chart after chart showing you where American students stand on the international scale compared to other high school graduate students: 
   In physics, dead last of all developed nations. 
   High school mathematics graduates, second from the bottom of all developed countries.  
   General science, about fifth from the the bottom. 
   In the PITA studies, United States last of 21 nations in mathematics. 
   We think we are the leading nation. We think we are doing a good job of educating our students. We are not, and we must face that. This bill addresses much of that problem by improving the education and training for teachers, both incoming teachers and existing teachers. It will improve the curricula, it will help students achieve better, and we must achieve higher levels again. 
   China and India recognized this issue 20 years ago, that the future belonged to the nations that educated their children in mathematics and science. China did it the dictator's way: You will learn math and science. India did it through inducements. But, as a result, they are now ahead of us, and we are now losing jobs to those nations because we have neglected our math and science education. 
   In our research efforts, we have always been the leader in scientific research for half a century, ever since World War II. We are losing ground. Believe it or not, South Korea is starting to put more than we are, as a percent of GDP, into basic research efforts, and that is being joined by other countries as well. 
   Manufacturing is a tremendous problem. We are losing jobs to other countries. And it is not just the wage base. I come from a manufacturing district. I have many conversations with manufacturers. It is not just the wage base. They are getting better quality, more highly educated workers abroad for lower pay. That is a hard combination to beat. And we really have to work hard in this Nation to improve education and improve manufacturing. 
   Now, how does that affect this bill? This bill is designed to affect and improve all of those areas. It does not do it ideally. I disagree with a number of things in the bill. I join my Republican colleagues in doing that. But, on balance, it is a start. If this were an appropriations bill, I might have some reservations, but it is an authorization bill. We get another bite of the apple each time we decide which programs we are actually going to fund. 
   I could mention ARPA-E in here. I am less than enthusiastic about it. If it works, I am delighted. I am skeptical. But why not authorize it, let the appropriators work with us, and decide whether or not we should fund it. 
   America as a Nation is based on competition. We are not afraid of competition, and this bill will engender competition. It will give us the opportunity to compete face-to-face at level-to-level with other countries and give us an opportunity to restore our manufacturing base, improve our science education, improve our manufacturing facilities and really do a better job. 
   You have heard before, this is endorsed by many major organizations in this country, all of whom have a deep interest in improving manufacturing and improving our competitiveness. This bill was suggested by President Bush in his American Competitiveness Initiative in his State of the Union speech last year. This is not a fly-by-night idea. This is something that I have been working on for almost every year since I came here 14 years ago and particularly the last 10 years. It is coming to fruition. 
   I have worked with the White House on it. I have worked with many scientific societies, and much of the genesis of this comes from the the National Academy of Sciences and The Gathering Storm Report, which is headed very ably by Norman Augustine, one of our leading industrialists and scientists. 
   It is not a perfect bill. I wish it were, but it is not. But in this process this is the best we can get, and it gives us a base to build on. And through appropriate use of this authorization and the appropriations bills, we will strengthen our Nation, we will strengthen our manufacturing base, we will strengthen our schools, we will strengthen our math and science education, and we will have a better Nation and a stronger Nation as a result. 
   One last comment. We spend a tremendous amount of money on defense, a tremendous amount of money on defense. We have always managed to succeed in situations like Iraq because of our superior knowledge, our superior research, and our superior resources. We are in danger of losing that edge. And I have met with people from the the Pentagon suggesting scientific ideas to them that they can use to improve the situation in Iraq. We need that kind of interaction between the scientific community and the military community, and I hope that will also result from this and give us a stronger Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (GREAT LAKES--ST. LAWRENCE RIVER BASIN WATER RESOURCES COMPACT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S.J. Res. 45, the Great Lakes--St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. This resolution represents the culmination of efforts, which started nearly a decade ago, to create a framework to govern water withdrawals from the Great Lakes Basin. 
   The Great Lakes comprise the largest source of freshwater in the world--20 percent of the Earth's total and 95 percent of the surface freshwater in the United States--and they provide drinking water, transportation and recreation to tens of millions of people in the United States and Canada. Although the Great Lakes contain copious amounts of fresh water, less than one percent of the water in the Great Lakes is renewed every year through rain, snow melt, and groundwater recharge, with the remaining ninety-nine percent remaining in the lakes each year. In other words, the Great Lakes are a non-renewable resource that is currently at jeopardy from large-scale water diversions outside the Great Lakes Basin. 
   The catalyst for the creation of a Great Lakes Compact came in 1998 when the government of Ontario granted a permit to a private Canadian company to ship up to 160 million gallons of water per year to Asia. Thankfully, the public outcry was so strongly opposed that the deal died. 
   In the wake of this incident, Congress included language in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2000 which prohibited the export of Great Lakes water from the basin unless the request for withdrawal received unanimous approval of all eight Great Lakes governors. WRDA 2000 also encouraged the Great Lakes states, in consultation with Canada, to develop and implement a compact that would govern withdrawals of water from the Great Lakes Basin. 
   In 2005, the 8 Great Lakes governors, in collaboration with the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, local governments, and other stakeholders, endorsed the Great Lakes Compact and referred it to the state legislatures for consideration. 
   On July 9, 2008, my home state of Michigan became the last Great Lake state to approve the Compact--sending it to Congress for final ratification. 
   The Senate passed S.J. Res. 45 by unanimous consent on August 1 and the House Judiciary Committee approved a similar House version (H.R. 6577) by voice vote on July 30. I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 6577. 
   The Great Lakes Compact prohibits new or increased out-of-basin, large-scale water diversions except under special circumstances, and it requires all of the Great Lakes states to develop water conservation and efficiency programs. 
   With respect to small-scale water diversions (containers less than 5.7 gallons), such as for bottled water, beer, and canned foods, the Compact allows states to choose how to regulate these small transfers. For instance, Michigan regulates bottled water under the Compact by requiring producers to obtain a state permit for new or increased water withdrawals of more than 200,000 gallons per day. Under Michigan law, a permit may be granted if, among other requirements, there are no individual or cumulative adverse impacts, the water withdrawal is reasonable under common law principles, and the producer has certified that it is in compliance with water conservation measures. 
   Although some have voiced concern over this ``bottled water exemption,'' I believe these small-scale withdrawals are better left to the states to regulate. In addition, much of the bottled water will likely remain the Great Lakes watershed, and changing the agreement now would mean the entire process must start over. With water predicted to become the oil of the future, it is imperative that we pass this agreement now so that we ensure the water in the Great Lakes Basin stays within the basin. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me, the Great Lakes governors, state legislatures, the U.S. Senate, and President Bush in supporting the Great Lakes Compact. Vote for S.J. Res. 45.

   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I'm very pleased to speak on this bill. 
   Actually, this is a happy day for this Chamber that we are discussing this bill after 7 years of work, very hard work. 
   In the midst of all of the difficulties we've had in the past few days, the arguments, the debates, the disagreements, to take a brief pause and pass a bill or a conference report that we almost all will agree on is a good piece of work for our Nation. It's a good piece of work for the people of this Nation. It will help in innumerable areas.     
   I am especially pleased that we have addressed some of the problems in the Great Lakes which have been too neglected in the past. We have taken good care of the Everglades, the Chesapeake and Louisiana areas, lots of other water-filled areas, but not the Great Lakes, where 40 million people depend on the lakes for their drinking water, for their industry and so forth. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also want to commend Mr. Oberstar, who grabbed hold of this as soon as he became chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and made a total and complete commitment to getting this bill out. He deserves credit for having done so. 
   I want to publicly express my appreciation to him and, of course, to Mr. Mica, who is the ranking member on the committee and worked equally hard on this. Richard Baker of our committee also put in many, many hours putting this bill together. So thank you to one and all.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation Manufacturing and Stimulation Act of 2007. 
   I certainly want to thank the Chair of the subcommittee for working very, very closely with us in producing this fine bill. 
   This bill provides a 3-year authorization for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, familiarly called NIST. Since 1901, NIST scientists and engineers have worked directly with American industries to address their needs for measurement methods, tools, data and technology, the building blocks that allow industry to grow and prosper. 
   NIST is one of three agencies targeted by the President's American Competitiveness Initiative. The ACI aims to double the Federal investment in physical science and research over the next 10 years to ensure that America remains technologically competitive in the global context marketplace. Yesterday this body passed an authorization bill for one of the other ACI agencies, the National Science Foundation. I am very pleased that today we are supporting a second ACI agency by authorizing NIST labs at a rate that would double the budget over the next 10 years. 
   H.R. 1868 is a bipartisan bill that incorporates recommendations from the administration for some of NIST's programs. However, earlier this week, the administration sent up a critical statement about H.R. 1868, and I want to clarify some misunderstanding that may have arisen from that statement. 
   H.R. 1868 does not underfund the NIST labs, contrary to the statement and the administration's comments. H.R. 1868 provides a 10 percent increase above fiscal year 2007 for the NIST labs and sets the NIST lab budget on a path to double over the next 10 years. This is entirely consistent with the President's overall stated goal for the American Competitiveness Initiative. 
   H.R. 1868 does not fund or subsidize management consulting services. H.R. 1868 fully funds the highly successful manufacturing extension partnership, better known as the MEP program. 
   MEP helps businesses improve manufacturing processes, reduce waste and train workers to use new equipment, which keeps high-paying manufacturing jobs here in the United States. This House has already twice passed this MEP authorization in both the 108th and 109th Congress. 
   Another comment, MEP receives one-third of its funding from the Federal Government, one-third from the States, one-third from fees charged to participating small manufacturers. MEP has over 350 manufacturing extension offices located in all 50 States and Puerto Rico. 
   H.R. 1868 creates the Technology Innovation Program based on recommendations from the administration. This bill is very clear that only small and medium-size companies can apply for Federal funding. 
   Universities partnering with this small company can apply for funding, actually expanding the role of university participation, not limiting it as the administration's letter suggests. 
   The program's sole goal is to accelerate the development and application of challenging high-risk, high-reward technologies in areas of critical national needs, thus, targeting major societal needs that the administration's letter asserts are not part of the bill. 
   H.R. 1868 authorizes an important investment in our Nation's future economic competitiveness. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Gordon and Technology and Innovation Subcommittee Chairman Wu for working with us on this important piece of legislation. 
   I also want to acknowledge the hard work of the gentleman from Georgia (Dr. Gingrey) to improve this legislation. 
   I also want to make an additional point. At times, some have considered this as being improper legislation. In particular, the President's statement indicates that is the beginning of an industrial policy. 
   That is simply not true. For those who are critical of this particular proposal, I want to ask them, first of all, do they oppose the current agricultural extension program, which has been in effect for nearly a century, which has been of inestimable value to our farming communities and to our farmers. 
   No one would think of ending the cooperative extension service in the agriculture department. It has been extremely valuable to this country. I have been in this body for 14 years. I have never heard anyone offer an amendment to defund the cooperative extension program, even though it costs $400 million a year and benefits less than 2 percent of the workforce in this country. 
   At the same time, I have met a number of people, and apparently including some in the administration, who want to kill the MEP program, which is only $100 million a year and benefits industries that employ 14 percent of the workers in this Nation.     
   Now, how can it make sense to want to keep a $400 million program that maintains a workforce of less than 2 million, and kill a program that costs one-fourth as much and helps about eight times as many workers? It doesn't make sense. So that argument is simply out the window. 
   If we do like the Cooperative Extension Service, we should approve the manufacturing extension partnership, which is of exactly the same nature and is designed to help small- to medium-sized manufacturers develop more jobs in our economy. 
   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to briefly address a topic which I have not heard discussed here, although I have heard it discussed numerous times within the committee itself. I am very unhappy with the resulting bill that came out this year. The issue I wish to discuss is Head Start programs operated by faith-based institutions. 
   What has happened in this bill is that we basically have reversed the Civil Rights Act, which provides that faith-based institutions may discriminate in hiring by hiring people of the same faith as the institution. If it is a church, for example, they can hire people who are members of their church or denominationm without violating civil rights laws. That is specifically legal under the Civil Rights Act. This bill prevents an institution from doing that; if they wish to operate a Head Start program, then they are not allowed to hire on that basis. So this bill is actually a reversal of the Civil Rights Act. 
   Now, why is this important? Why do churches need to do that? A perfect example was given last year during the debate on this bill in committee, when Representative Tom Osborne, better known as Coach Osborne, related an example in his district where a small church which had a small staff decided to operate a program similar to the Head Start program. They wanted to hire someone who could serve on their staff half-time and also operate the  educational program during the other half of their time. But they needed someone of their faith to do the church work. But this bill would prohibit that person to also teach in the school, but they were hired on a religious basis. 
   There is so much misunderstanding on this issue, and it really puzzles me, because I have very good friends over on the other side of the aisle whom I know have a deep religious faith. But why they are so anti-religious on this subject, I do not understand. They seem to believe that they have to prevent anyone with a religious belief from operating within a program of this sort. 
   I have to keep reminding everyone, this is not a case of churches trying to proselytize by having someone of their own faith running the program and teaching the kids that faith. That is not it. 
   The point is simply that faith-based institutions, by virtue of their faith, are determined to help people in the community who need help. It doesn't matter whether it is a Head Start program, whether it is a food program, as we operate in my church back home, or many other programs. They are doing it as an expression of their faith. 
   Now, is this wrong? Do we have to say, I am sorry, you can't run this program because you are a member of this church and you might express your faith? That is not what they are trying to do. So why do we have to go to great lengths in this particular bill to stop people from doing that, to prevent churches and other faith-based institutions from operating a Head Start program, unless they hire people from outside their church? That, to me, is grossly unfair. Frankly, I think it violates the Constitution, and I am strongly opposed to that practice. 
   Other than that, I think it is a wonderful bill and I would like to support this bill, but I am terribly disturbed by this anti-religious altitude that I have seen manifested here. I hope we can change this in this bill.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to join the speakers in rousing approval of this bill, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007. As a scientist, I have been familiar with the National Science Foundation almost since its inception. It is an outstanding American institution. It is the best science research institution in the world in terms of their strong peer review and the good results. 
   Just a few weeks ago, we had the announcement of the latest round of Nobel Prize winners. All of the Nobel Prize winners this year in the sciences were from the United States, and one of them was formerly funded by the National Science Foundation. 
   The National Science Foundation has now provided funding for 170 individuals who have gone on to win the Nobel Prize. By far, we are the leader among all the Nations, and it is not just our population. It is our ability to engage in meaningful and good research, research that results in earth-changing results, and that is extremely important to the foundations of science. 
   The National Science Foundation has done so many good things since its inception, and as I said, it is one of the leaders in the world. 
   It also has received awards from the Office of Management and Budget just within the past few years as the most efficiently run government agency. Now, that is indeed an important prize. I understand we are going to have a few amendments to try to reduce the budget of the National Science Foundation, and I think it is absurd to punish the best-operated government agency while we are continuing to fund other agencies which do not do as well, and we are not reducing their budget. 
   Another factor is we often talk in the Congress about investments. Sometimes I think we never spend a penny of our money; we invest it all because everyone talks about their particular project as a good investment. Well, let me tell you, if we are investing money here we will get a higher rate of return on the money that we invest in the National Science Foundation than in any other government agency, except perhaps NIH, simply because the results are so astounding and so ripe for development by the manufacturing sector. 
   I could give many, many examples, but let me just mention one. A friend of mine, Charlie Townes, a number of years ago, decided that he could develop a laser. Now, LASER stands for lamp amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. The initiative for that discovery came originally from Einstein in the early 1900s. In the 1930s, a theoretical physicist predicted that stimulated emission would result from a photon hitting an excited atom, yielding two photons of the same wavelength and the same phase traveling in the same direction. Mr. Townes decided he could build a laser out of this, and in fact, he did. 
   I do not know what types of grants he had, but I think the total was probably less than $10 million. Today, the laser industry is a multi, multi, multibillion dollar industry. 
   Every sewer that has been laid in this Nation and most parts of the world for the last 30 years has been leveled with a beam of laser light. Every suit, every piece of clothing that the people in this room are wearing has been cut out by a laser light, not scissors, but lasers guided around, cutting out the patterns before they are sewn together. I could go on and on with many other examples, including medical examples, by the way. 
   So that small investment of about $10 million resulted in thousands and thousands of billions of dollars in our economy. That is why it is totally absurd for anyone to think about reducing the budget of the NSF. If anything, we should increase it because the payback on our investment there is so good, so strong, that we should be increasing NSF funding, not decreasing it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007. I appreciate the kind words offered by Mr. Baird and Mr. Gordon, and frankly, producing this bill was a lovefest. I am very impressed with the work they did on it. I am very appreciative of the very hard work that they did in putting together a bill, including direct interaction with members of NSF, talking to scientists who were familiar with the NSF, scientists who had received funds from NSF, and out of all that, we have written a bill that I think is a very good one.     
   My colleagues and I on the Science and Technology Committee have introduced a strong reauthorization bill for the National Science Foundation. It is a straightforward 3-year bill which provides authorization for the various research and education activities of the National Science Foundation. 
   I am pleased that this bill establishes a pathway to double the total budget of the Foundation. In 2002, Congress wholeheartedly supported a 5-year doubling path for the Foundation, and I strongly supported that and was very pleased to vote for it. 
   Unfortunately, appropriations have fallen far short of that target. Last year I had consultations with the President, and partly as a result of those consultations, the President introduced a plan known as the American Competitiveness Initiative that sought to double the research budgets of the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over the next 10 years. In other words, twice as slow as the previous decision of the Congress. 
   I would prefer the faster increase, but I recognize realities and the tough financial conditions we have. So I am pleased to sign on with doubling over 10 years. 
   The National Science Foundation was included in the ACI because it conducts world-class research in areas that support new, innovative technologies, which, in turn, lead to advances in telecommunications, homeland security, alternative energy and other areas of great importance to our Nation. 
   I have the utmost confidence that the National Science Foundation will use the authorized funds in the most prudent manner, as NSF consistently earns the highest possible score in the annual Office of Management and Budget ratings of financial and budget performance. 
   The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007 will support the education and training of more than 225,000 scientists, engineers, teachers and students. In addition to discipline-specific research, NSF activities include cross-cutting initiatives on nanotechnology, networking and information technology, climate science change and the International Polar Year. 
   It also supports the construction of major research facilities that are shared within and across many disciplines of the scientific community.  NSF research and activities touch every State of this Nation and provide tremendous support at all levels of education. 
   NSF is a unique agency because it is the only agency with a primary mission of supporting fundamental scientific research, as well as engineering research. Unlike some of our other science agencies, NSF is not a mission agency in the sense that it has an established program to target. In fact, it solves many problems through the process of fundamental research, often in a serendipitous manner. 
   As Nobel Prize winner Theodore Svedberg remarked, as he accepted his reward in 1926, ``A glance at the history of science and technics shows that it is precisely the search for truth without any preconceived ideas, research for the sake of knowledge alone, that in the long run has most benefited humanity. The investigations which have seemingly been the most purely abstract have often formed the foundation of the most important changes or improvements in the conditions of human life.'' 
   It is challenging in this day and age to support this type of research. The U.S. has many pressing needs that require solutions on very short time lines, particularly related to national security and the health of our aging population. For this reason and others, we have seen companies decrease their investments in long-term research projects. Nevertheless, economists have confirmed the accuracy of Dr. Svedberg's statement that fundamental research has, indeed, paid the highest dividends to humanity over the years. 
   Estimated return on investment in research and development is difficult to calculate, but generally ranges from 20 to 400 percent. That is an incredible payback. Furthermore, past investments in NSF have contributed greatly to major technological advances in areas and industries that are critical for U.S. economic growth such as biomedical applications. 
   The former Director of the National Institutes of Health, Harold Varmus, is well-known for his following statement: ``Medical advances may seem like wizardry. But pull back the curtain, and sitting at the lever is a high-energy physicist, a combinational chemist or an engineer.'' 
   Continued support for fundamental research lays the groundwork for innovations in other disciplines that directly impact the lives of every American. We are here today to authorize a continued investment in this type of NSF groundbreaking work. 
   I thank Chairman Baird and his dedicated staff for their work on preparing this bill in a bipartisan manner, and encourage my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  
   These are always very difficult questions, and I have learned long ago never to judge the research by the title of the proposal. These are complex issues, and I don't know if the gentleman was here earlier when I spoke about the rate of return on research at the National Science Foundation. The best estimate is that the rate of return is a minimum of 20 percent and a maximum 400 percent on individual research projects.     
   Now, I challenge anyone in this Chamber to find investments that will year after year give you that rate of return on the investment. 
   Another point I would like to make is, as I said, you can't always judge the full proposal by the title. This was evident a few years ago when we went through exactly the same charade when discussing the National Science Foundation budget. Some of my colleagues came down to the floor to amend the NSF appropriations bill, and one offered an amendment to remove grants for the study of ATM. This person gave a magnificent speech why we should not spend money at the National Science Foundation or the Department of Energy to study ATM. His argument was, let the banking industry do the research on ATMs. What he didn't know is that the proposal was not on automatic teller machines but the proposal was on studying asynchronous transfer modes, which involves the way computers talk to each other. This research led to a substantial change in the speed at which computers were able to talk to each other. This is a good example of why it is dangerous to just look at titles and make a judgment. 
   I would also pick up on the comment of Mr. Baird about cultural studies. I think one of the basic problems in Iraq, and I have told this to people in the White House, is that there were not enough people in the White House, perhaps even in the State Department, who understood the culture of the countries we were dealing with, and we failed to realize what would happen once we moved into that country. A good NSF-funded study beforehand would have been invaluable in determining what would happen. 
   Another example: a few years ago there was a grant on game theory. Once again, one of our colleagues rushed to the floor and said we have to eliminate funding for that. In fact, game theory is extremely useful in calculating the operation of nuclear reactors. 
   So I urge defeat of this amendment. It is very easy to sit on the House floor and pontificate about these issues. But if we are going to cut the budget, there are much more fertile fields in which to cut. Why would we cut the one agency that gives us a guaranteed rate of return on our investment when there are many other areas we can cut where we are getting little or no payback at all?

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I just want to respond to the statement that we can't fund every proposal that comes along, and that is absolutely true. The National Science Foundation funds a small fraction of the proposals that come through, and that is why we are beginning to slip as a Nation compared to other nations, because we are simply not, as a Congress, providing sufficient funds for the National Science Foundation. And I forget the current figure, but I think it is in the neighborhood of 20 percent of the grant applications are being funded; 80 percent are not being funded. It's a tough business, and these are all peer-reviewed grants. I cannot defend them individually without looking at them. As I say, you can't judge a proposal or a grant by its cover.

   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First of all, I'll make a deal with you; I won't make any judgments about medical research if you don't make judgments about NSF research. 
   The point of this really is that you cannot predict what will result from the research; that is the idea behind basic research. 
   Years ago when I was a graduate student at Berkeley, we were spending tremendous amounts of money to examine the behavior of elementary particles, protons, neutrons, mesons, and so on. And no one, even in the scientific community, could ever imagine any practical use for that. But later on the results from doing that research led to the development of a CAT scanner and  the MRI. Now, who would ever have thought that elementary particle physics would lead to major findings in medicine which every doctor relies upon today?

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  
   I will try to be brief. We have beat this subject to death, but I find it ironic that we talk about cutting the funding of the one agency that returns more on its money than any other agency does. 
   If we're talking about cutting the NSF by 1 percent, we should cut everything in the budget by 1 percent. And I might even vote for that if you are willing to cut defense by 1 percent; Cut every department, cut Social Security by 1 percent, and so on down the line. Then you might have something that would be worth doing. But to attack something that actually benefits this Nation, increases our health and wealth, and is allowing us to at least try to keep up with what other nations are doing, is utterly unrealistic. 
   I would point out, and I can show you graphs indicating that we are falling far behind other nations. We occupied the premier spot in research for a number of years. But now South Korea, as an example, is very rapidly getting very close to what we are spending on research as a percentage of GDP. I expect them to pass us in a few years. 
   It is incredible to me that we are supposed to be the brightest, most powerful Nation in the world, and yet we are losing ground compared to nations such as South Korea. If we are serious about competing with other countries, we absolutely have to keep investing our money in research, whether it's the National Science Foundation or whether it is the Department of Energy or the National Institutes of Health. 
   In addition to that, I would mention that the National Science Foundation is just about the lowest-cost research institution. We spend a lot less money in the National Science Foundation than we do in the Department of Energy, than we do in National Institutes of Health or that we do on NASA. One of the lowest costs with the highest rate of return, I don't see any reason in the world to cut the NSF. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will yield to the gentleman from California.

   Just briefly, I want to comment on a comment made by my friend from New Jersey about health care, a very, very important issue. But the only way we are going to be able to offer better health care to everyone is by reducing the cost. 
   One huge element of cost in health care is cancer treatment. Today at lunch I met with the latest seven Nobel Prize winners all of whom happen to be from America because we support this research.

   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Just to continue, today the Science Committee had lunch with the latest Nobel Prize winners, all of whom are from America because we try very hard to provide funding for the research. They, I might point out, did the research a number of years ago. I hope we can continue to provide Nobel Prize winners by adequately funding the National Science Foundation and others. 
   But in speaking to the gentleman who got the award in physiology and medicine, he talked about his discovery and the impact it is going to have on cancer treatment. That is very likely to cause a substantial reduction in the cost of the treatment of cancer using his approach. 
   What does his approach depend on? That is the Human Genome Project which we started a number of years ago in NIH and were the first Nation to do that. 
   It is always amazing to me how discoveries that we find in one area can have application, and no one, I think, dreamed that when we did the Human Genome Project that we might find the cure of cancer there rather than in medicine. So it is very important that we continue funding the fundamental basic research so we can continue to enjoy the fruits of their research.

   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First, to the gentleman from Arizona, I totally agree with your comments about earmarks. I have fought hard here to keep this body and the other body from providing earmarks for scientific research, because all grants should go through the peer review process. 
   I might also add parenthetically that when the gentleman from Arizona was on the antiearmark bandwagon a few years ago, I believe I voted with him more than most Members of the House, because I oppose earmarks in general, but particularly in scientific research. 
   I would also comment that the fact that industry supports us is not indicative of the National Science Foundation doing industry's research. National Science Foundation does the basic research, the fundamental research, which has no apparent immediate use. Industry picks up on that and says, okay, let's see whether we can develop something out of that. In other words, industry does not do very much research, they do a lot of development. NSF does almost totally research and essentially no development. So it's a very good symbiotic relationship. 
   As I mentioned earlier, before most of the people here were on the floor, the rate of return on our research money in the National Science Foundation has been incredible. Any accountant looking at this would say this is the best investment that the United States Government makes because it has great results in our economy. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise with some reluctance to speak against this amendment, because I like the idea of what the gentlewoman from California is trying to do. But my concern is twofold. First of all, this will cut into the funding that the NSF already has. It's an added requirement for them. 
   But my major objection is, I have taught at the university level and have taught at the college level. I have always felt this is the responsibility of the colleges and universities to do, and they shouldn't need an NSF grant to do this. 
   The job of the colleges and universities is to teach. What this is proposing is that the NSF will be responsible for teaching these students how to communicate their research. 
   I always tried to do that with my students when I had graduate students. I think that's an integral part of the education program. So I reluctantly urge defeat of this amendment, simply because I think we ought to make it clear to the universities and the colleges that this is part of their responsibility.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to address a particular problem with this amendment. We have, for some time, had activities within the National Science Foundation aimed at teaching future teachers, teaching them how to teach math and science, and this generally fell into the rubric of a math-science partnership, because the Foundation itself did not teach the teachers but rather responded to grants submitted by professors at various institutions who were pleased to set up programs to teach these future teachers or existing teachers how better to teach math and science. These have been very successful programs and are commonly referred to as the math-science partnership. 
   Recently, the Department of Education has developed programs involving professional development for teachers in elementary and secondary schools to try to bring them up to speed on the latest developments in math and science and how to teach them. They ended up calling it the math-science partnership. 
   This has resulted in a problem because some in the administration decided to cut the budget of the National Science Foundation because they felt this was a duplication of programs. It is not. 
   The National Science Foundation concentrates on doing research. The Foundation's model is designed for competitive grants to spur innovative programs that will be peer reviewed and evaluated to enhance research on effective math and science education, whereas the Department of Education ensures that this knowledge is disseminated to as many school districts as possible. Knowledge gained from the competitive foundation scholarships, in other words the National Science Foundation math-science partnerships, can be used and is used to prove and enhance State investments in programs developed by the Department of Education. 
   In other words, these are two programs that happen to have the same names. They are very symbiotic. The discoveries out of the research at the National Science Foundation transfers directly over to the Department of Education, and is there applied to instructions in the classrooms and for teacher training programs.     
   Another reason I come to offer this amendment is because the other body, the Senate, is working on this same issue, this same bill, and they have added an amendment which clarifies the difference between the National Science Foundation programs and the Department of Education programs. I am offering essentially the same amendment so that when we go to conference with the Senate, this will be preagreed to. It's a necessary and important clarification of the functions of the two, and I urge the adoption of my amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also want to thank my colleague from Michigan for his kind words. He and I have worked on a number of Great Lakes issues together, and it has been a pleasure to work across the aisle on something that really benefits the people of this country. 
   I am very pleased today that we are taking up this bill. It is another great day for the Great Lakes. Today we renew and expand upon one of the most effective Federal environmental cleanup programs ever, the Great Lakes Legacy Act. 
   All of us have heard about Superfund and all of the tremendous cost overruns of that program. When we wrote this original Legacy Act some years ago, we made sure to keep the issues out of the courts, and make it a very efficient program, and that is exactly what has happened. 
   The Great Lakes, we all know, comprise the largest source of fresh water in the world--20 percent of the earth's total and 95 percent of the surface fresh water in the United States. The Great Lakes also provide drinking water, transportation, and recreation to millions of people. Approximately 30 million people drink the water of the Great Lakes in the United States and Canada. 
   However, the Great Lakes are endangered by contaminants from years of industrial pollution that have settled into the sediments of the tributaries, the rivers and streams, that flow into the lakes. These pollutants degrade the health of both humans and wildlife, and they disrupt the beneficial uses of the lakes. The longer we take to clean up these areas, the greater the likelihood that the sediment will be transported into the open waters of the Great Lakes, where cleanup is virtually impossible. 
   To address this problem, I introduced the original Great Lakes Legacy Act in the 107th Congress. With bipartisan support, the Congress passed and the President signed this bill in 2002. 
   The Great Lakes Legacy Act authorizes the EPA to clean up contaminated sediments in designated areas of concern in the Great Lakes. These areas of concern are designated by the EPA and are defined as any ecologically degraded geographic area that requires remediation. Currently, there are 43 areas of concern throughout the Great Lakes and 31 of those are either wholly or partially located within U.S. waters. 
   The Great Lakes Legacy Act has made tremendous progress in cleaning up contaminated areas. Of the 31 areas of concern in U.S. waters, four remediation projects have been completed, one project is underway, and six more are currently being monitored and evaluated. Since 2004, the EPA estimates that almost 1 million cubic yards of contaminated sediments have been removed from our Great Lakes tributaries. These sediments are saturated with toxic substances such as mercury, arsenic, chromium, cadmium, polychlorinates, better known as PCBs, and lead. 
   However, more cleanup work remains. The U.S. Policy Committee for the Great Lakes has identified 75 remaining contaminated sites. The Great Lakes Legacy Act expires in just a few days. In order to ensure this vital cleanup continues, Congressman Jim Oberstar and I introduced this bill. The bill has 45 bipartisan cosponsors and passed the Transportation Infrastructure Committee by voice vote. 
   In order to speed up efforts, this bill triples the authorized funding level from $50 million to $150 million per year. If fully appropriated, this has the potential to delist all of the U.S. areas of concern within the next decade. These funds will continue to be leveraged with a 35 percent non-Federal cost share with locals, businesses, environmental groups, and so forth. 
   The bill also makes a limited number of changes to the original Legacy Act that were jointly recommended by involved parties, and will vastly improve the bill.

   I also want to thank staff members Ryan Seiger, Ben Webster, John Anderson and Jon Pawlow, and also Ben  Gielow on my staff. It has taken a lot of hard work, but it is a great bill and I am proud to present it. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill.

   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I feel very strongly about this issue, and I want to echo the words of the previous speaker, the gentleman from Tennessee who, of course, because of his background, has a deep historical interest and feeling about genocide. 
   I have been appalled at the lack of advancement of the nations in dealing with genocide, particularly the current genocide in Darfur. There is no reason in the world that our Nation, coupled with the other nations, could not have stopped this earlier. And because of the niceties of diplomatic relations worldwide, we have not done so. I believe that is a mistake, and I feel very strongly about this. Genocide should not occur. As the gentleman before me commented, that we are the only creatures who deliberately kill large numbers of our own kind. And it is not new. It started with Cain and Abel, the killing of a brother. 
   We must pursue genocide worldwide. We must insist that it not take place. And we must punish those who commit genocide. There is no reason on God's good Earth that we should permit genocide. And we, along with the other nations, have the power to stop it and we should do so. 
   So I rise with great gratitude to the sponsors of this bill and those presenting this bill on the floor. This is one small step forward in what we really have to do, and that is to totally and completely outlaw genocide worldwide and act expeditiously to stop it wherever it occurs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his kind words and particularly for his leadership on this issue and finally bringing it to fruition. As he said, it has taken far too long. But now it is here and we are doing it right. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 3690, the U.S. Capitol Police and Library of Congress Police Merger Implementation Act of 2007, which will provide for the merger between the Library of Congress Police and the United States Capitol Police. 
   While bringing together two law enforcement bodies may seem like an easy proposition, whenever you have two entities with existing cultures, established protocols, and disparate missions, it is important to conduct a merger of those two groups thoughtfully and with due diligence. This, we have attempted to do. 
   While the Library of Congress Police and the U.S. Capitol Police both serve and protect the Congress and its assets, they do so in very different capacities. The U.S. Capitol Police are primarily charged with securing the Capitol buildings, Members of Congress, staff and visitors and providing an emergency planning and response function in the event of a terrorist attack or other unplanned activity.     
   Its core mission is too important to set aside even in the interest of completing this merger. The Library has a mission to serve the Congress and provide essential materials to enable Members and staff to get the information they need to craft effective legislation and perform other essential duties. One very important yet incomplete undertaking within the Library is to conduct a complete inventory of its collection, not only to have an accurate record of what materials are in its possession, but to also create a baseline for measurement of its inventory control efforts going forward. The committee is working closely with Library staff to ensure that progress continues to be made on the inventory of its collections, despite the additional work and effort required to unite these two law enforcement bodies. 
   The Library and the U.S. Capitol Police have studied the effects of this merger on executing their core operations and how problematic aspects might be mitigated. I am confident that both organizations will continue to carry out their core functions with the level of excellence that the Congress has come to expect. 
   Over the past 4 years, through numerous hearings and countless meetings with staff of both organizations, the Library and the Capitol Police have exhibited a commitment to apply the law enforcement expertise of the U.S. Capitol Police to the unique needs of the Library, creating an organization that will be greater than the sum of its parts. They have worked to put in place policies and procedures that will ensure that this union is successful and that it achieves the desired objectives of both organizations. Still, this merger marks a beginning, not an end. 
   As ranking member of the Committee on House Administration, I look forward to working with Chairman Brady to make certain that, going forward, both organizations have the resources and assistance they need to successfully integrate their law enforcement divisions. In particular, we wish to provide the Library and the Capitol Police with a means to communicate with the Congress on the progress of the merger and impart any guidance or resources that they require to achieve long-term success. I urge our colleagues to join me in supporting this bill which will help ensure that the Library's treasures are protected from harm and preserved for generations to come. 
   I want to once again thank Chairman Brady and the other members of the committee for their hard work on this very, very difficult issue. It seemed easy, but it wasn't, and I'm pleased that we finally have achieved this good result. 
   I also want to thank Chief Morris of the U.S. Capitol Police who has handled this very well and gone through some very delicate negotiations. In addition, the administration of the Library has been very helpful in trying to reach agreement, and they, of course, have very legitimate concerns about their needs to protect their collection, and they, one and all, have been very helpful in working with us. 
   Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (REAPPOINTMENT OF PATRICIA Q. STONESIFER AS A CITIZEN REGENT OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Speaker, as the ranking member of the House Administration Committee, I'm pleased to support the reappointment of Patty Stonesifer as a citizen regent of the Smithsonian Institution. 
   Six years ago I stood at this very microphone in a slightly different role as a member of the majority recommending Ms. Stonesifer for her initial appointment. I was very impressed with her qualifications at that time. She has not disappointed us. She has done very well. 
   In her role as chief executive officer of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Ms. Stonesifer leads the foundation in their mission to help all peoples of the world lead healthy, productive lives. At the end of last year, under the leadership of Ms. Stonesifer, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had an endowment of approximately $33 billion, and remains one of the largest charitable foundations in the world. 
   In developing countries, the foundation focuses on improving people's health and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to ensure that all people, especially those with the fewest resources, have access to the opportunities they need to succeed in school and life. For all three of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation program groups, Patty Stonesifer sets strategic priorities, monitors results and facilitates relationships with key partners. 
   Before helping Bill and Melinda Gates launch the Gates Learning Foundation in 1997, Ms. Stonesifer was a senior vice president at Microsoft, where she was responsible for an $800 million business activity focused on interactive entertainment, news, information and service products. She is active in a number of other charitable endeavors, and has served as a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on AIDS. 
   As Chair of the Smithsonian's Governance Committee, Ms. Stonesifer led the board's efforts to implement best practices in the nonprofit sector, and helped develop and implement the recommendations from the independent review committee designed to strengthen the board's oversight of the institution and reform its operations. In June, the board formally adopted the Governance Committee's 25 recommendations, and they are on target for completion by early 2008. 
   She has performed incredibly well in all of these areas, and the problems that we have had at the Smithsonian are well underway to conclusion simply due to the work of Ms. Stonesifer. The reforms include a reexamination of compensation, compliance with the Freedom of Information Act, and restructuring senior management to create a stronger reporting relationship with the board. Once implemented, these strengthened government practices will be an important step towards restoring faith in the Smithsonian and its management structure, and they demonstrate the positive impact of Ms. Stonesifer's leadership in this area. 
   After meeting once again with Ms. Stonesifer, I'm confident that her unique blend of business and philanthropic experience will continue to be a most valuable factor on the board  that is charged with overseeing the Nation's attic, our fond description for the Smithsonian. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a very capable person, Patty Stonesifer, for reappointment to the Smithsonian's Board of Regents. 
   Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I will not object, but I would like to make a few comments. 
   I am proud to support S. Con. Res. 71, which authorizes the use of the Rotunda of the Capitol for a ceremony to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Michael Ellis DeBakey. 
   A pioneer in the field of cardiovascular surgery, Dr. DeBakey became chairman of the Department of Surgery at Baylor University College of Medicine in 1948. Over the last half century, he has created a number of medical devices, techniques, and procedures that have saved countless lives. He is perhaps best known for his pioneering efforts in cardiovascular surgery, as he was one of the first physicians to ever perform coronary bypass surgery. 
   Additionally, Michael DeBakey is credited with developing the concept for the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, or M.A.S.H., units which were used in the Vietnam and Korean War to treat injured soldiers, saving even more lives. 
   An adviser to nearly every President for the past 50 years, Dr. DeBakey has served the public through his vast knowledge on a variety of medical issues. He has published more than  1,300 medical articles and has performed over 60,000 cardiovascular procedures. He is a beloved educator, so much so that in 1976, his students across the globe worked together to establish the Michael E. DeBakey International Surgical Society in his honor. 
   Dr. DeBakey has received numerous awards for his work, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969 and the National Medal of Science, which was awarded to him by the late President Ronald Reagan in 1987. 
   I am extremely pleased that this bill will enable us to bestow another honor upon Dr. DeBakey as he receives the Congressional Gold Medal in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5493, which would establish that the pay date in the House be determined by Committee on House Administration  regulations. However, I want to make clear that, while I support the committee establishing its authority to determine the House's pay date, I do not necessarily support alteration of the current House pay schedule at this time. 
   Along with the obvious administrative challenges that would impact the CAO, there are a number of cultural implications within the House population that must be addressed prior to making such a change. 
   Many employees pay their mortgages, utility bills, and other financial obligations in concert with a monthly pay schedule. To change a system that has been in place for such an extended period of time will have a pervasive impact and must be considered and communicated thoroughly before it is instituted. 
   This bill is the first step on a very long road, and it should be followed by hearings and surveys to allow House employees to express their opinions. 
   However, I fully support the efforts of Chairman Brady to ensure that the committee take a decisive role in determining whether or not changes to the House pay schedule are made. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR SECURE ELECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss this bill and, first of all, to commend Mr. Holt for his efforts and his concerns. 
   He is sincerely and extremely concerned about accuracy in voting, and what can be done to make certain that the results are accurate. He expressed that in his first bill, H.R. 811, which did not receive committee consideration. 
   I spent considerable time with him trying to work out the details of that bill, but we simply could not reach agreement or even come close to agreement. 
   I commend Mr. Holt again for his concern and his persistence, as he authored H.R. 5036. When I reviewed it with him I thought this might be a much better basis for agreement and, that by working together, we might be able to achieve that. 
   Unfortunately, we have not achieved full agreement on it, although we did get it out of committee. I supported it out of committee because I thought it should reach the floor for floor debate. I anticipated that it would be taken up under a rule where we might have the possibility for an additional compromise, but that has not happened. 
   There are a number of issues that still remain. I agree with Mr. Holt that we should have some type of redundancy in our recording systems. I disagree that it has to be paper. I think there are other methods of achieving redundancy. 
   Recently we had an exposition in the House Administration Committee room where we had demonstrations of equipment which shows redundancy in an electronic fashion, and I think would be fully as reliable as redundancy in paper. 
   Another area where we disagree is in the hand counting of ballots. I have enough experience with elections in local politics to recognize that hand counting is not as accurate as almost any machine counting that I have seen. 
   There are ways of achieving what Mr. Holt wishes. I think the optical-scan method is certainly a valid one, and that is what the State of Michigan uses. Other States are beginning to go use that. 
   But the final blow to our efforts was the judgment of the CBO that it was $685 million for 1 year. I realize that Mr. Holt had estimated that would be the cost in his original bill. In fact he had included it as an authorization in his original bill. 
   But having the CBO report that large sum that casts a pall over this particular bill in respect to the opinions of the Members of this body, and I am afraid that is likely to be the death knell. 
   In summary, I certainly commend Mr. Holt for his concerns. I commend him for his efforts. I just don't think we have achieved enough agreement to effectively make this a bipartisan bill. Therefore, I suspect it will not pass, and I will have great difficulty supporting it at this point. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FOR SECURE ELECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. We have no further speakers. If you have none then I will make some concluding remarks. 
   I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We've heard a good deal of discussion on this bill. Some of you may recall Parkinson's laws from some years ago in which he commented that when there's a debate on a subject, the more the people know, the longer the debate. And I suspect we could go on considerably longer if we had more of the Members of Congress here simply because all of us have experience with elections. 
   I would like to point out a few items. First of all, the comments about the integrity of the system. I agree totally. The objective should be the complete integrity of the system to insure that every vote is counted accurately, and that every voter can be assured that their vote is not cancelled out by someone who has illegally voted the wrong way; in other words, through fraud or through mistakes by the machine. 
   I believe that the audits that Mr. Holt has proposed are very important and should be developed. It should be developed with the help of the Secretaries of State and local election officials to develop a system that works, so that we can ensure that the count is as accurate as possible. 
   I also want to comment that the White House also has taken a dim view of this. They've issued a SAP this afternoon, somewhat to my surprise, that indicates that they oppose this bill and urge Members of the Congress to vote against it. 
   But I do want to look at this from the historical perspective, and as an older person, I've been around a while, and I've seen a lot of different elections. Recalling the early history of our country, all balloting was with paper. But because there was too much miscounting on opportunity for fraud, machines were developed: the iron monsters, as they called them, meaning the lever machines. And those were used for years, even though their error rate also was note zero. And then we've gone to many other voting methods over the years. 
   Now we're using high tech approaches with computers, and we have encountered some of the same difficulties. 
   I am not saying that you can't make a perfect machine. I am saying that as long as people are involved in operating them, there are likely to be mistakes. 
   And one of my classics that I remember is from the presidential election in 2004, when in Los Angeles County there were something like nine candidates for President listed on the ballot. This was an optical scan ballot. Over 3,600 voters crossed through the oval for candidates other than President Bush and left his blank. 
   Now, how is one to interpret that? Did these voters think they should leave the Bush oval blank because that was who they wanted to vote for? Or were they saying ``Anyone but the President? Who knows. As long as those types of mistakes are possible, they will be made. And we have to do our best here to work diligently, with, and I emphasize ``working with'' very strongly, working with the local elected officials, the State-elected officials, and continue to do as best we can to perfect the best possible voting system. 
   And with that, I will yield back.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1068, which would permit military liaisons who are assigned to official duty within the House of Representatives to join the House Staff Fitness Center. The center has been a welcome benefit to many House employees since it opened in December of 2005. Located in the southwest corner of the Rayburn building, the fitness center covers 11,000 square feet in which gym members can take advantage of health screenings and fitness assessments, take part in health wellness workshops and seminars, and receive individualized exercise programs, in addition to using the state-of-the-art exercise equipment. 
   While membership in the House Staff Fitness Center will prove a convenient and useful operation to those military personnel who work in the House campus, I think it's also important to recognize that these gentlemen and women are part of the military. They must remain in shape because they may be called into active duty at any time. 
   And so I believe this is a good bill, and I thank Chairman Brady for his work on the bill. 
   I yield back my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CHEMISTRY WEEK -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Speaker, today I am pleased that we are considering this resolution recognizing the 20th anniversary of National Chemistry Week, which was established by the American Chemical Society to teach children about the chemical sciences. This year, the National Chemistry Week theme is ``The Many Faces of Chemistry,'' emphasizing the diversity of chemistry careers and the diversity of the individuals working in chemistry professions. 
   Ensuring that our science and engineering workforce accurately reflects the diversity of our population is necessary for our country to succeed. But right now we are falling short. For example, Hispanic Americans constitute 12 percent of the population yet they represent less than three percent of the engineering and scientific community in the U.S. 
   Last week the Research and Science Education Subcommittee heard testimony from a number of witnesses on the topic of gender equity within science and engineering faculty. Freeman Hrabowski, the president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore Campus--a campus noted for recruiting and retaining both minority students and faculty--remarked, ``Producing well-prepared scientists and engineers for our increasingly diverse workforce is perhaps our most important and lasting contribution to the Nation's economic development and national security.'' Furthermore, a 2004 survey of the ``top 50'' science engineering departments at U.S. universities revealed that there are few tenured and tenure-track women faculty in these departments in research universities, even though a growing number of women are completing their Ph.D.s, and that underrepresented minority women faculty are almost nonexistent. 
   Clearly, we have a problem. I have often said that we are throwing away more than 40 percent of our workforce if we do not actively encourage more women and underrepresented minorities to consider these fields. The American Chemical Society is helping to draw more attention to this issue with the choice of this year's National Chemistry Week theme. ``The Many Faces of Chemistry'' recognizes the important contributions of chemical educators, scientists and engineers to technological progress and the health of many industries. 
   I commend the American Chemical Society for stimulating the interest of ALL of our Nation's children in the chemical sciences so that they will consider careers in these fields and potentially discover the innovations of the future, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution recognizing the goals and ideals of National Chemistry Week.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (PERMITTING DESIGNATION OF INDIVIDUAL TO DISBURSE CAMPAIGN FUNDS UPON CANDIDATE'S DEATH -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3032. 
   This has an interesting history and it attracted my attention as soon as Mr. Jones spoke to me about it because I had worried myself about what might happen to my campaign funds if something should happen to me. And as a matter of fact, as I was getting wills prepared, I had an attorney draw up a letter that I might sign so I could designate who would be the person to make a decision about my remaining campaign funds. 
   As you know, by law we are limited to certain dispositions of campaign funds, but the law does not specify how they must be disposed of and in what quantities. And when Mr. Jones approached me, I said, well, that's good because I solved it for myself, but we really should solve it for everyone. 
   The bill, I think, is an excellent bill, which simply provides that each Federal candidate would be allowed to designate an individual who, in the event of the death of the candidate, would be authorized to make arrangements for the disbursement of campaign funds. He speaks from personal experience in his family, where his father passed away and there was some difficulty deciding how the funds should be disposed of, but also, all of us could face that possibility. 
   Under current campaign laws, it is understood today that the treasurer can decide what to do with the money and hand it out willy-nilly, whichever way he or she wishes, without any consultation with the family. We think it's very important that the candidate, him or herself, specify very clearly precisely how they want their campaign funds disbursed. 
   Also, we have made an additional provision in this bill because it is very well possible that a candidate's position may change, or the person he has designated may have passed away, and therefore, a candidate may propose at any time or file with the FEC a statement at any time changing the designation that he or she as a candidate may have made earlier.  
   We have given a lot of flexibility in this bill. Individuals, candidates, or Members are not required to file such a statement if they don't wish to, but we're simply giving them the option of doing so and of changing it at any time they wish in the future. 
   At this point, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION FINES AUTHORIZATION EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to support H.R. 6296, which would amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to extend through 2013 the authority of the Federal Election Commission to impose civil monetary penalties on political committees that file reports late or not at all rather than going through the traditional enforcement process. This bill is necessary because that authority, which they currently have, expires at the end of this year. 
   This bill is not a glamorous one. It will not capture the attention of voters who look to Congress to lower the price at the pump, even though we would all like to do that. Nonetheless, it is an important program designed to protect our Nation's campaign process from being thwarted by insisting upon the utmost transparency if an individual chooses to seek public office. 
   The administrative fine program, which was established in 2000, permits the FEC to assess fines if a candidate is found to be in violation of mandatory Federal campaign finance reporting requirements. Since its inception, the administrative fine program has proven successful in its two objectives: 
   First, the program frees up commission resources for more complex and higher profile enforcement matters. This is especially important now that the commission has formed and its important work can continue in a bipartisan fashion. Second, it reduces the number of financial reports filed late or not at all, which furthers the goals of the commission as a whole. 
   As of March 2008, the FEC had collected over $2.1 million in civil penalties for over 1,600 cases processed under the program. The fines collected are turned over to the U.S. Treasury, ensuring that there is no monetary gain to the FEC for applying such penalties. By implementing such a structure, there can be no calls of falsely using the fine program as a way for the agency to line its own coffers, thereby increasing confidence in the FEC's enforcement actions. 
   Without this bill, as I mentioned earlier, this successful program is scheduled to end on December 31, 2008. I am pleased to be able to join with my colleague in the House Administration Committee, Chairman Brady, as a cosponsor of this bipartisan measure. I  urge my colleagues to join us in supporting H.R. 6296 so that we may continue to monitor the success of this important program for the next 5 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (SOWING THE SEEDS THROUGH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise with pleasure to support this bill. 
   The National Science Foundation for years has been one of the primary sources of research funding for outstanding research in this Nation. In addition, the Department of Energy Office of Science has been a leader in certain areas, particularly high energy or particle physics, but also in a number of other physics areas, including the high energy light sources such as we have at Berkeley and a few other labs. 
   I strongly support these programs, but a difficulty that has developed over the past few years is that we have some early career researchers, some young people just entering the field, and they really have difficulty obtaining funding because the tendency of the reviewers at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy Office of Science is to say well, we have this group of very well-known good researchers. We know their backgrounds and we know they can produce and how well they can do; we should just give them the money because we don't know for sure about the early researchers. Now, I don't think they actually say that, but, unfortunately, I think it is in the back of the minds of the peer review folks as they consider proposals. 
   I experienced this personally with my son, who as a young scientist had trouble breaking into the field and had a number of proposals denied before he finally received funding. Even though he had made some national strides and was well-known in the field, yet it was difficult to get the funding. 
   These programs will be very, very helpful to support the early career researchers. But there is another aspect about which we need some new thinking and some change, and that is the fact that more and more science is becoming interdisciplinary, where you may have biology and physics, or biophysics; and you have relationships between biology and chemistry or chemistry and physics. You can go on and on. There are all sorts of different variations. Sometimes you may need five or six different disciplines represented in the research program to really cover all of the aspects of the research. When you submit a proposal, usually you are required to specify one field and if you specify interdisciplinary, sometimes the other fields are not adequately represented on the peer review panel. 
   I admit these are perhaps exceptions; but, nevertheless, we have to make sure that all of these bright young scientists or those wishing to branch out into another discipline, for example, having a very good background in physics and deciding they can really do some good work in biophysics. So we need to take account of that, and this bill will provide that within both the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. 
   I strongly support this bill. I believe both agencies, I know NSF supports it, and I am sure that the Department of Energy Office of Science also supports this bill because they have also noted the need for these changes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I also rise in opposition to this amendment, although I would say I would be delighted to support it if we could also be guaranteed that the budget of the National Science Foundation would be increased by another $1 billion. 
   I say that because the National Science Foundation has not been treated well in its budgets over the last 12 or 13 years. It has increased very slowly. We even had a decrease 2 years ago for the first time in many, many years. It's a shame that we have not treated the National Science Foundation adequately. It has hurt our Nation, it has hurt our economy, and we certainly have to improve that situation. 
   We are in a catchup mode. I am reminded of former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was instrumental in getting the doubling of the National Institutes of Health, who today has told me, and I have heard him tell audiences in speeches a number of times, that he regards one of his great mistakes, perhaps the greatest, the failure to double the National Science Foundation at the same time that we doubled the NIH. 
   Nevertheless, that didn't happen, so we are in a period of poverty for the National Science Foundation. Therefore, I oppose adding a new program. Even though at this point it's only $281 million, I am sure it will be a popular program and end up costing well over $1 billion. We simply cannot afford it at this time. I would be happy to consider this proposal at some time in the future if we, in fact, do double the NSF as we hope. But even that will leave us with a skimpy budget there. 
   The other factor is that this program does already exist in the Department of Education. It's a very good program. It has been in operation for several years. 
   I hope that we will keep that in mind, that we will turn down this amendment at this point, and perhaps consider it sometime in the future when we are bound to have an abundance of money at the National Science Foundation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, all of us go back to our districts regularly and meet with our constituents, and some of the most sorrowful meetings I have are with students who have just graduated from high school and say, I can't get a job. I can't get a job. What a shock to them, after years of education. And I am not talking about dropouts. I am talking about students who have studied hard, worked hard, and tried to learn a lot. 
   When I analyze the problem, much of it circles around the fact that today, and, indeed, all the jobs of the future, require a good understanding of the basic principles of mathematics and science, and many students in today's curriculum are not getting that knowledge. 
   What can we do to help solve that? There are a number of aspects to the problem. Obviously, the first thing is to entice students to take those courses. But, secondly, and more importantly, is to make certain that all those teachers in our high schools across this Nation are adequately trained and adequately prepared to teach math and science courses and do it in a fashion that excites the students and entices them to take these courses so that they will develop the background in math and science that they need to get a job, both now and in the future. 
   The world has changed. China and India recognized this 20 years ago and changed their educational system. We did not change. We did not recognize what was happening, and so we have to play catch-up. 
   This bill, which I strongly support, is a good bill which will help us to improve U.S. math, science, and engineering education at all levels; K-12, undergraduate and graduate. 
   As most people in Congress know, I am a scientist. What you may not know is that over 40 years ago, I dedicated myself to trying to improve the science educational programs in the United States, basically from preschool through graduate school, because we were simply falling behind other countries in the areas of mathematics and science. 
   I am not talking only about producing good engineers and enough engineers, or good scientists and enough scientists. That is very important, and we must do it. We are losing out on that as well. But what we certainly have to do is to prepare everyone for the workplace of today, and especially the workplace of tomorrow. 
   1530 
   This bill will help do that. This bill builds on the Noyce Scholarship Program, an excellent program that has been in effect for a number of years and which was initially proposed by the former chair of the Science Committee, Sherry Boehlert. It is named after the person who helped to found Intel and make it grow into what it is today. They also have funded a number of scholarship programs, and this is our counterpart. 
   But this program does more than that. It strengthens and expands the  Noyce Scholarship Program, but it also strengthens and focuses the Math and Science Partnership Program at the National Science Foundation, a program which has fallen on hard times in the last few years, primarily because the President's budget has sought to eliminate funding for that program. I think this is based on a misunderstanding in the administration or in the Office of Management and Budget about what the program does, and the mistaken belief that this program was a duplicate of one residing in the Department of Education. As a result the program in the Department of Education grew, and the one in the Science Foundation was cut back. 
   The fact of the matter is they are both good programs and necessary programs, and they are complementary, not competitive. We need both if we are going to strengthen our teacher training programs. That is why I strongly approve of the aspect of the bill that will strengthen and focus the Math and Science Partnership Program. 
   The bill also extends the authorization of and expands the NSF Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Talent Expansion Program, better known as the STEP program, which provides grants to colleges and universities to improve undergraduate science, math and engineering education. 
   This bill enables NSF to fund the creation of centers at colleges and universities to develop new approaches to undergraduate education programs, and expands the focus of STEP beyond its initial focus of increasing the number of graduating STEM majors to also include increasing the number of nonmajors taking STEM courses. 
   The bill also establishes a pilot grant program at NSF to create a partnership to support science lab improvements in secondary schools, a proposal initiated by Mr. HINOJOSA in a separate bill, but that we are incorporating into this bill. 
   In short, this bill does a great deal to strengthen several programs at the NSF and, develop innovative programs which will provide better math, science education at all levels from the elementary schools through the undergraduate and the graduate programs. 
   We have worked together on this in a nonpartisan way. I commend Ranking Member HALL. Mr. HALL has been a strong person in this area and has strongly pushed this bill. I also commend the chairman of the committee, Mr. GORDON, who has also worked very hard on this. It has been a copacetic experience in the Science Committee to hear this discussion and see the progress we have made. I strongly support the bill, and urge the House to adopt it.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (10,000 TEACHERS, 10 MILLION MINDS SCIENCE AND MATH SCHOLARSHIP ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do support this amendment and I think we should approve it, but I would like to spend the majority of my time discussing the previous amendment which we already accepted. I would like to make a point in connection with that. A very good part of that amendment is that it provides an additional stipend for teachers during their 4-year service requirement. 
   We have a major problem in America with math and science teachers; in fact, we have a major problem with a lot of teachers who do not stick with their field. We just don't have the retention rate we should. But that is especially true of good math and science teachers because the market out there for them is tremendous. Frequently, they can double their salary by going into industry, and at the very least they can increase their salary by 40 or 50 percent. It is very difficult for the schools to compete with that, although I have argued for years we should have a salary differential for those teachers who have very strong economic incentives to leave the teaching profession and to go into another job. 
   We simply have to meet the market, and unfortunately that has not been the tradition in the schools. I think we should establish that. If you don't meet the market, you are going to lose your best teachers, and we certainly don't want to lose them after all the work we have done through these various scholarships to develop good teachers. 
   So I strongly support the part of the Noyce amendment No. 2 which Chairman Gordon offered, and I hope that we can work, not just within this Congress but within this Nation, with the teachers, the school boards, and the teachers unions to develop a system that recognizes that a mechanism is needed to meet the market for those teachers who are offered large inducements to leave the teaching profession and go to another field. 
   I simply wanted to make that point in connection with the first amendment simply because that amendment is a start in the right direction, and I hope we can carry that principle onward. 
   I appreciate Chairman Gordon offering the amendment, and I hope that we can continue along that path in future bills relating to the subject.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (COMMISSION TO STUDY THE POTENTIAL CREATION OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN LATINO ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 512, which establishes a commission to study the possible creation of a national museum of the American Latino community. As you know, this bill mirrors H.R. 2134, which was referred to the Committee on House Administration in the last Congress and which I was pleased to guide through that committee and present to the House for passage on September 27 of last year. It is only our regret that it did not pass the Senate. 
   The Latino American community is often recognized for its rich traditions, its sense of community, and deeply rooted beliefs which are woven throughout the fabric of American history. As the Nation's fastest growing ethnic community, the Latino population in America has more than doubled in size in the last 10 years to over 40 million, and continues to grow. 
   The creation of a national museum of the American Latino community would enable Latino Americans to tell their story in their own words and would create a destination for students, families and visitors that would accurately depict Latino American history. 
   In order to explore the possibility of creating such a museum, the legislation before us specifies that a commission be created with 23 members, seven of whom would be appointed by the President, and three voting and are non-voting. Each would be appointed by the Speaker, the House Republican leader, the Senate majority leader, and the Senate Republican leader. 
   Once appointed, the commissioners would assess the cost of the museum, its impact on other Hispanic and Latino-related museums, identify a possible location for the museum, and propose guidelines on the museum's operation. The commission would also work closely with the Latino American community during the design and development phase to ensure that the museum accurately captures the Latino American experience. 
   I urge my colleagues to, once again, support this important legislation which is the first step in creating a national museum of the American Latino community that will serve as a testament to the vibrant history and tradition of Latino Americans. And I would just be delighted to eventually see this constructed. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, at the risk of being the skunk at the garden party, I would like to add a postscript expressing my concern about the proliferation of museums on the Mall and what this may do to the Mall. As you recall, the Mall was designed many, many years ago as a gathering place for America, and it has nobly served that purpose. I believe it is very important that we, in building any additional museums, not impinge on that intent.     
   So establishing location is I think going to be one of the most difficult parts of the work of this Commission, and I wish them well. But I think it is extremely important that we preserve the National Mall as the gathering place for America and make certain that any additional buildings on the Mall fit well with that purpose.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (ELECTING OFFICERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I would join my colleague from Maryland in commending Jay Eagen and Karen Haas for the tremendous job they have done, and, before Karen, Jeff Trandahl, who served temporarily as CAO during the bridge time before the selection of Mr. Eagen, and who also served as the Clerk of the House very ably. 
   They both, Jay Eagen and Karen Haas, have done a great job in that office. The House has run very, very well as a result, and I commend them and wish them well in the future. I am certain that they have bright futures based on the excellent work that they did here. 
   I also would like to comment about the appointments that have been made. The new appointment for the Clerk, Ms. Miller, from everything I see, is an outstanding appointment. We recognize that as traditionally the appointment of the Speaker and can be made solely by the Speaker and has been in the past. 
   I look forward to good things from her. She is obviously very capable, has an outstanding record in working in the House, the Senate, and various other places. I look forward to good work from her. 
   In regard to the selected candidate for Chief Administrative Officer for the House, Mr. Beard, I do not object to his appointment. He is, I think, of relatively good background and should be able to manage the job, at least I seriously hope so. 
   But I have serious concerns about the lack of transparency and the selection process that resulted in his appointment. Just to give a better history, when I first arrived here, it was shortly before the Republicans took over the majority, and there had been considerable confusion in the House. We had the bank scandal, the post office scandal and so forth. A position was created, I forget the precise title, but something along the line of the director of the nonlegislative and financial functions of the House of Representatives. 
   The Speaker at that time, who was a Democrat, since they were in the majority, appointed a person to fill that post. It was General Wishart, I believe, and he resigned after several months saying basically he could not do the job, given the parameters that were imposed upon it. 
   When the Republicans took over the House of Representatives, they also appointed, and it was largely a Speaker's appointment at that time, appointed someone to serve as the Chief Administrative Officer of the House. That position was created and described by the new majority. 
   Mr. Faulkner had a good resume and had a lot of good ideas, but, frankly, did not really meet the needs that we had for that position at that time. We then decided, and I believe Mr. Hoyer was on the committee at the same time with me, and we simply decided that we had to make this as nonpartisan a position as possible. 
   So we formed a group, two Republicans, two Democrats, and they conducted a nationwide search with a search firm to find the best person for the Chief Administrative Officer position. 
   They ended up selecting someone from the House of Representatives, someone who was familiar with it, but also someone with extensive administrative background who did a tremendous job of operating this institution since that time.  
   The main point I want to make is a process was set up that was bipartisan. It resulted in an excellent appointment, and I believe we should use that same process again. 
   In fact, I felt so strongly about it, I sent a letter to the Speaker last week pointing out that we should use that same process again. Barely was the letter delivered that she announced publicly that she had selected a new CAO, without using that process at all, without input from the minority party. Simply, we had the courtesy of chatting with the new appointee, but nothing to say in the appointment or whether or not that person should have the appointment. 
   I have met with him; I recognize he has considerable administrative ability. He has been around a long time, but I am very concerned because we did not use the same process. I think this new appointee is going to owe his allegiance to only one person, that is the Speaker of the House, and I don't believe that is the best way to operate the House of Representatives. 
   At the same time, should anything deleterious or improper happen, we recognize where the responsibility for that will lie, because it will be with the person who made the appointment. 
   But I have firsthand knowledge, having served on the House Administration Committee now for over 12 years, firsthand knowledge of the important role the Chief Administrative Officer plays in the House operations, and it is an extremely important job. 
   This is a complex organization on the Hill, over 10,000 employees. The position has many responsibilities that are of significant consequence to the House of Representatives. 
   While the proper administration of the House is ultimately the responsibility of the majority, the successful operation of the House is most certainly not a partisan manner. 
   Republicans and Democrats alike maintain a shared investment in preserving and building upon the professional improvements made by the House Chief Administrative Officer over the last 12 years. 
   In 1997, as I mentioned, the last occasion a new CAO was appointed, a search committee was constituted that, as I said, required a unanimous decision from all search committee members in order to select a candidate for the position of Chief Administrative Officer. 
   That last provision, I think, is very important, to ensure that it was not a partisan position required that both Republicans and both Democrats had to vote to select the final candidate for the position. 
   At that time, our current House majority leader, my colleague from Maryland, stated that the formulation of a search committee comprised of the leaders of both parties ``was done to assure that we would have a bipartisan agreement on an administrator for the business of the House.'' 
   Mr. Hoyer also stated that what this House needs is a bipartisan and effectively nonpartisan way to assure ourselves and the American people that the business of the House, the paying of our bills, the managing of our information systems, all of that which has nothing to do with the formulation of the policy, but everything to do with the effective management of the people's House, is being done in a proper fashion. 
   Now, I am not quoting this to throw the words in Mr. Hoyer's face. That is not my intent at all. It is simply my intent to show how at that time we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement. That bipartisan agreement, which Mr. Hoyer spoke of, resulted in the appointment of Jay Eagen, our current Chief Administrative Officer, who has served us so well for a number of years. 
   Under Mr. Eagen's tenure, just as an example, the House has achieved eight consecutive clean opinions from independent auditors, an impressive result by any measure. This should be contrasted with the result when the Republicans first took office, we asked for an independent outside audit, and the auditors came back and said the books are such a mess, we cannot even audit them; you will have to construct an entire new financial management system. 
   I was pleased that since I had helped develop the computer system that I was able to help develop a system that was appropriate for that task. I think all of this together has led to the clean audits that we have had for a number of years. 
   I certainly support the comments that Mr. Hoyer made some years ago. They were very appropriate. They described the procedure accurately; and his points, as he made them, I totally agree that the appointment of a post was such a significant impact to this institution, we should be able to put aside our party affiliations and work together to find a suitable candidate. 
   I wish I could make a comparable statement today. I wish that such a bipartisan process had been followed this time. Instead, I am left only to express my sincere disappointment that it did not take place. 
   Let me make it clear, the qualifications of Mr. Beard are not under attack; but the process that Speaker Pelosi administered to make this appointment is. I think we should have had the same process, and I am disappointed that the Speaker chose not to do that. 
   Without a fair, open and competitive process, there simply is no way to determine whether the selection is in the best interest of the House, and the complete absence of transparency is cause for alarm for those who value the integrity of this institution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would also echo his comments about Mrs. Miller. I was astounded at her resume. In fact, I would love to have a resume that complete myself. She has served government in so many different agencies and in so many different ways that I am certain that she will perform very, very well as the Clerk of the House.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, in that case I will make my final comments. I assume the gentleman from South Carolina is able to close right after that. 
   Just hearing this debate reminds me again of all the things that happened. And first of all, I have to clarify that Mr. Eagen did not have to clear up a mess left by Mr. Faulkner. Mr. Faulkner may or may not have been the best choice for CAO at the time he took the job, but certainly improved the situation. And I was there. I saw the books as they were, ledger cards made out in pencil with erasures in the ledger book, an erasure of a number filled in with $2,500,000 just to make the books balance. I have seen those books. I know the facts. It was a mess after 40 years of the rule of one party. 
   Now, I am not defending or criticizing either General Wishart or Scot Faulkner. They were there. They did the best job they could in very difficult circumstances. But they were not there very long. 
   The point is simply that when we followed a good process, when we used a bipartisan process, we appointed someone who has served for a number of years and has served extremely well. 
   You know as well as I that if you hire a person, that person's loyalty is going to be to you. It is very important that this position be operated in a bipartisan fashion. And since the Speaker has appointed Mr. Beard, no matter how capable he is, no matter how much he tries, he will be suspected of partisanship in his decisions. 
   Daniel Beard may, in fact, be the right person to lead the CAO organization, and I truly hope that he is. However, given the selection process, there is simply no way of knowing that with any degree of confidence. This appointment could and should have occurred with the full confidence of all Members of the House. Unfortunately, the burden of proof now lies with Mr. Beard and, ultimately, Speaker Pelosi, to ensure that Mr. Beard is able to maintain the level of skill, professionalism and bipartisanship we have come to expect from the House CAO. 
   Mr. Speaker, I demand a division of the question on the adopting of the resolution.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to give a few vignettes of Jerry Ford that illustrate the type of man that he was. 
   We heard this afternoon when we discussed this on the floor that he had been active in supporting the Civil Rights Act that passed this House and the Senate some years ago. But this was not an out-of-the-ordinary thing for him. When he was a football player at the University of Michigan, and a very fine one, I might add, undoubtedly the finest athlete to ever occupy the White House, he was the captain of the football team. They were scheduled to play Georgia Tech. There was one African American football player on the Michigan football team, and Georgia Tech said we cannot allow a black player to play on the field at Georgia Tech. 
   When Gerald Ford heard that, he said I will not play either. I am simply not going to play if they will not let my friend, Ward, play. That was the type of person he was. It was not until his African American friend begged him to play that he finally conceded that he would play. 
   Another vignette is when he was elevated to the Presidency, we had a big party for him back in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and 5,000 people turned out for our little party. Person after person got up to the microphone and related experiences in their life where Jerry Ford had helped them, whether it was a matter of housing, of veterans benefits, getting medals for veterans. The list went on and on and on. 
   That accords with another thing that was told me by one of my fellow legislators at the time. He had become a Member of Congress and he said, Sometimes I cursed Jerry Ford. Because of the high standard of constituent service he provided, he said, we worked endlessly in our office to do as well as Jerry Ford and his staff did in his office.     
   Those are two examples. I have more, but I see that the majority leader has arrived, and I know he is anxious to speak on this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to add a few more comments, little vignettes. We have had a lot of discussion today about the wonderful attributes of President Ford as a President, as a Vice President and as a Member of the House of Representatives. Indeed, he was a most gracious person and also a most capable and hardworking person. I appreciate the comments that Majority Leader HOYER made which reflect very accurately what a wonderful person Mr. Ford was. But I want to add just a few examples from my hometown and my experience with him. 
   I, at one time, was the Chairman of the County Commission. This was at the time when we were erecting the Ford Museum in Grand Rapids. Of course, he was interested in that and came around regularly. He was retired from the Presidency at that time. 
   I recall walking down the street with Mr. Ford. I thought I knew quite a few people there, but walking down the street with him, even though he had not served in Congress for some 10 years at that time, people, of course, would greet him and say, ``Hi, Jerry, how are you doing?'' They all knew him. The amazing part to me was that he knew them, and he would say, ``Hi, Bob. Hi, Shirley. Hi, Jerry. How are you doing?'' 
   Then another time we walked into the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel, which had been the Pantlind Hotel, and he had stayed there when he came back to Grand Rapids for visits and for meetings. We walked into the hotel lobby, and, of course, a number of people saw him and sort of mobbed him and kept talking to him. 
   I noticed a bellman standing off to the side, and it was clear to me that he wanted to speak to Mr. Ford but didn't dare to come up to this group of people. He just thought it wasn't proper. So I mentioned this to President Ford. I said, ``I think the bellman wants to talk to you.'' He said, ``Oh, good.'' So he marches over to him and says, ``Harry, how are you doing? It is good to see you again.'' I didn't know he had a personal relationship with him. 
   Then he said, ``By the way, I heard that your mother has cancer. Is that true? How is she doing?'' He then had a 10-minute conversation with this young man about his mother and her health and what had gone on. I am curious how many ex-Presidents would take the time to do that for a bellman that they had known in the past? 
   Similarly, the first time he went to the White House as President and a reporter I know was following him, and as he approached the White House, of course, the Marines stood erect, opened the doors and stood at attention. He came up and held out his hand and said, ``Hi, I am Jerry Ford. I am going to be living here. What is your name?'' The reporter talked to the Marines at the door after that and said, ``Have you ever had that before?'' One said, ``No, I have been here for several years, and the previous President has never even looked at me.'' But, again, that was characteristic of Mr. Ford. 
   One final little note. I first got acquainted with him, I am a nuclear scientist, as most of you know. I had moved from Berkley, California, where I got my Ph.D., and I was teaching at  Calvin College. I heard a speech at a national convention from a Congressman who said, ``It is terrible. We don't have any scientists in the Congress. We don't have any scientific advice.'' He said, ``I urge you to contact your Member of Congress to see if you can help them by giving scientific advice.'' 
   So I took the gentleman at his word. I sent a letter to Congressman Ford and said, ``I am a scientist. I have heard there is not much scientific advice there. I would be happy to help you in any way I can.'' 
   I dropped the letter in the mailbox, and my first thought was, I would get a nice response that said: Thank you for your comments. We will keep you in mind if we ever need you. But in fact, Mr. Ford was excited about it. The day they got the letter, his chief of staff called me and said, ``Jerry is very excited with this and would like to meet with you.'' 
   So I met with him. I established a science advisory committee, and we met with him quarterly to advise him on scientific matters. What struck me was he was extremely interested in the meetings and in what we were saying, but also very, very quick on catching on to the scientific terms and issues we were discussing, much more so than the average lay person would be able to catch on. So it was a real pleasure for us. 
   But one day after a meeting, I said, ``Mr. Ford, I don't quite understand, because you come back to Grand Rapids, you spend all day in meetings, you spend an hour or hour and a half in a meeting with us just because we want you to know more about science,'' and I said, ``You really seem to enjoy it. Doesn't it get tiresome sometimes?'' 
   He put his arm around my shoulder and he said, ``Vern, one thing you have to recognize: Everyone else I meet with is asking for something. You are the only group I meet with that is offering me something.'' 
   I have never forgotten that, and it really gave a lot of meaning to me when I got here in Congress and found out that is true. Almost everyone that walks through our office doors comes in asking for something, not trying to help. So I now appreciate more fully why he appreciated our help. 
   These are just a few instances of what a wonderful human being President Ford was, how he related to the people around him, how he was concerned about the people around him and really sought to do what was best for them and what was best for this country. He was a terrific model for the rest of us and for me myself, and I have always tried to serve the people as well as he has. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I have no further comments, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (MOURNING THE PASSING OF PRESIDENT GERALD RUDOLPH FORD -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 15, a resolution I introduced along with Speaker Pelosi, Republican Leader Boehner, Majority Leader Hoyer and the entire Michigan congressional delegation. This resolution honors our great President, Gerald R. Ford, who was also an outstanding Member of Congress. 
   I am privileged to serve in the same House seat that President Ford held. I am still deeply honored when people, both here and in Grand Rapids, Michigan, refer to my district as ``Jerry Ford's district.'' After all these years, they still consider it to be Jerry's. 
   He personified the many good traits that West Michigan has to offer our Nation; honesty, integrity and a sense of courage and duty. I think you are going to hear these words a great deal as we honor President Ford in this chamber, where he honorably served for 25 years. 
   I was deeply touched by the funeral services and memorial celebrations held for President Ford over the past 2 weeks since his death on Tuesday, December 26, 2006. I want to thank all those who helped plan and carry out those memorable events, which solemnly reflected on this great man and his service and leadership to our Nation. I am pleased that this House can now take time at the beginning of a new Congress to celebrate and remember one of our own Members and the great things that he did for our country. 
   For many younger Americans, these past tributes have served as a history lesson about the so-called ``accidental President.'' They have learned, and those of us who knew him, have remembered his athletic prowess at the University of Michigan; his brave service in the Navy during World War II; his outstanding representation of Grand Rapids and Western Michigan in the Congress; his ascension to the Republican Leader's position in 1965; his appointment and confirmation as Vice President in 1973; and, of course, his rise to the Presidency in the wake of Richard Nixon's resignation in August 1974. 
   What has struck me during the memorial services and tributes is the shift in the way President Ford is regarded as compared to some of the opinions during his Presidency. For example, at the time of his appointment as Vice President, the Wall Street Journal editors wrote that the nomination ``caters to all the worst instincts on Capitol Hill, clubbiness, partisanship and the small-mindedness that thinks in terms of those who should be rewarded rather than those who could best fill the job.'' 
   Little did the Wall Street Journal know that the Congress had in fact picked the person who could best fill the job; they later changed their thoughts and their writings about President Ford. 
   I think a lot of people probably thought at the time as the Wall Street Journal did. He was a political insider, from a relatively small city in Michigan, who many knew little about. But those of us in Grand Rapids, his constituents and his colleagues, knew who he was, a decent, thoughtful, trustworthy man, full of integrity and courage. 
   As it turns out, the country should be eternally grateful for the blessing of the timely leadership, strength and wisdom of Jerry Ford during this perilously difficult time in the constitutional history of our nation. I am glad that 30 years of history have shown that the Members of Congress, and those who advised President Nixon on his appointment, knew what they were talking about and what they were doing. 
   President Ford's appointment and his ascendency to the office of President was not the result of ``clubbiness'' or ``political favor.'' He was the person best suited to fill the job, and he literally healed our Nation by the actions that he took during those troubled times. 
   I am pleased that the opinion writers at the Wall Street Journal recognized this when editorializing after his death. They eloquently wrote that President Ford navigated many perils in his short tenure, including the public furor over Watergate, the unpopularity of the Vietnam War, dramatic inflation and a struggling economy, and, as they put it, ``better than he gets credit for.'' 
   I think that over time history will continue to hold President Ford in even higher regard for the actions he took to bring honor and respect back to the Presidency, to stabilize the  economy, and to lay the groundwork for freedom and democracy to spread and for Soviet communism to fall. 
   My thoughts and prayers continue to go out to Betty and to their children, Michael, Jack, Steven and Susan, as well as their grandchildren. The Ford family demonstrated remarkable composure and strength during these long weeks of mourning, and we thank them for helping to lead us in our grief. 
   At the beginning of this new year and this new Congress, I am hopeful that we in this House will be mindful of the life and legacy of Jerry Ford. He served in this House with distinction, he treated everyone with respect, and he always conducted himself with honesty, integrity and forthrightness in every matter he undertook. I pray that we will do the same. 
   His family creed, incidentally, although humorous, is one we should all emulate: ``Work hard, tell the truth, and come to dinner on time.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I know all my colleagues will support this resolution to honor our 38th President.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, the last 2 weeks have been a time of sorrow for me, and a time of pride also. I was awakened at 2:00 in the morning to learn that my good friend, President Ford, had passed away. And the succeeding whirlwind of funerals, receptions, and events dealing with his death have reminded us all how much he gave our country and how much he did for our country. 
   I am proud to call Mr. Ford a friend. I am proud of what he did for our country. I am proud that he so ably reflected the values and virtues of west Michigan, my part of the country. 
   We pray that You will bless Betty and his family and give them comfort and give them strength. 
   I will shortly be presenting a resolution honoring President Ford, and I hope that Members will find their way to the floor to speak on this special resolution, or speak later this evening. I encourage them to join me in honoring this great American and wonderful President.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (AUTHORIZING THE PRINTING OF A COMMEMORATIVE DOCUMENT IN MEMORY OF THE LATE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GERALD RUDOLPH FORD -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 128, authorizing the printing of a commemorative document in memory of the late President of the United States, Gerald R. Ford. 
   It was an honor for me to serve as a scientific adviser to Congressman Ford in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and I then came to know President Ford in many capacities throughout the years. I now have the privilege of serving the people of Grand Rapids and western Michigan in the exact seat he held from 1949 until 1973, and I am now most pleased to recognize one of the great sons of the State of Michigan. 
   Although President Ford's life ambition was to become Speaker of this esteemed body, fate and the Lord had other plans for Jerry Ford. While he was not a man who sought the Presidency, Ford was a tireless public servant who did not shrink from duty when his country needed him most. He bore the mantle that had been thrust upon him with great humility, never forgetting the solid Michigan values that were his compass in the most trying of times. 
   When he ascended to the Presidency upon President Nixon's resignation in 1974, Ford served with honor and dignity, telling us that ``our long national nightmare is over.'' He was recommended and approved for his position by people in Congress who knew him very well. In fact, I believe he is the only President of the past one and a half centuries who served as the choice of the Members of Congress. Their trust in him aided him in governing and leading our Nation out of that nightmare. In pardoning President Nixon, he essentially gave up any chance he had of a second term as  President; but, in doing so, he literally healed the Nation. And I recall a very personal discussion with him one time where he said he knew full well that he would likely lose the election, because of the pardon, but he saw no alternative but to pardon President Nixon in order to put the whole Watergate episode behind us and get the Nation moving again. 
   I am privileged, and I have always felt a sense of honor, to be serving in the same House seat that Congressman Ford served. By publishing this book, we will educate future generations about the contributions of a great man who came from ordinary beginnings yet found himself performing well in extraordinary circumstances. Jerry Ford personified the many good traits that west Michigan has to offer our Nation, with his honesty, his forthrightness, and his hard work. And I urge my colleagues to support the creation of this commemorative volume. I urge strong support of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I thank Representative LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ for introducing this timely resolution and for allowing me to collaborate with her on it. I also thank the many Members of Congress that decided to cosponsor this resolution, especially Chairman MILLER and Ranking Republican MCKEON.  
   School counselors are instrumental in helping our students face daily challenges. They help develop well-rounded students by guiding them through their academic, personal, social, and career development. 
   School counselors also play a vital role in ensuring that students are prepared for their future. They may encourage students to pursue challenging academic courses to prepare them for college majors and careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. 
   I certainly recognize that school counselors contribute to the success of students in our schools, and I encourage all Members to join me in supporting this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD, MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I first met Juanita Millender-McDonald in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which is a wonderful committee, and I am sure the current Chair would agree with that. A great diversity of tasks there, and I came to know her at that committee. 
   I was amazed at Ms. Millender-McDonald in a number of ways. You just heard the previous speaker talk about her grace and elegance. That was apparent from the moment you saw her and talked to her. 
   She and I became rather good friends because it happened that her father was a pastor, and my father was also a pastor. There is a special bond between preachers' kids or PKs as they are called, and we used to jokingly discuss the need to develop a PK caucus in the Congress so that we could address major issues of the times, particularly those with a moral or human content to them. 
   Our friendship continued over the years, and I have to confess, I was continually amazed at new things I discovered in Juanita Millender-McDonald. 
   First of all, just imagine being born African American in 1938 in Alabama and becoming the first African American woman to chair a committee in the Congress. That is a long and difficult road, and she traversed that road, once again, with elegance and grace. 
   After having five children, she went back to school, received a bachelor's degree and then became a teacher. She later went back to school again and obtained a master's degree, showing amazing persistence and drive to do that. She then entered the political arena, became the mayor of the city in her district, and then later the State Assembly, and then the Congress. 
   So she had considerable drive and interests in serving others, and that stood out from the moment you first met her. 
   But I found it interesting, too, on a personal relationship, she was a good friend of mine but a very private person, and I was dismayed recently to find out that she had cancer because she had never discussed this with me and never alluded to it in our discussions. I knew something was wrong, but I did not know what. I wish I had known so I could have offered her more comfort and help. 
   We have had our amusing moments as well. One time she insisted in talking far past her limit in our committee when I was chairman, and I gaveled her out of order, which she refused to admit and kept talking. So I gaveled louder and she kept talking, and I gaveled louder yet, until she could no longer speak. She was not pleased with that. But when she became the chairwoman, I called her to congratulate her and I said, now, I fully expect you to gavel me out of order every opportunity you get, and that was the type of relationship we had. 
   In spite of our differences of party, in spite of occasional differences in perspective and differences on how we should accomplish things in this Congress, we remained good friends throughout. And I think because of that, together, we were able to accomplish a great deal in that committee this past year, and we were continuing to do that this year under her leadership. 
   We have lost a good friend. We have lost a good compatriot. We have lost a good Member of Congress. It is not easy to deal with that type of loss, and our comfort is that she is in a better place, that she has served our country well. She has served her people well. I am sure as a teacher she served her students well. I think she has left the Congress a better place because of her having been here and with the example that she set for us.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (GREAT LAKES LEGACY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate his comments. I especially appreciate his support of this bill. I also commend the gentleman from Minnesota for his thorough discussion of the history of the Great Lakes pollution problems and the solutions that we have developed. I certainly appreciate his support for this bill. 
   I rise today in strong support of the reauthorization of one of, if not the most, effective Federal environmental cleanup programs ever developed. Those are not my words, those are the words I have heard from many individuals about the Great Lakes Legacy Act which we put in effect a few years ago. This bill today will continue that act. 
   In 2002, I authored the original Great Lakes Legacy Act, which was passed into law with broad bipartisan support. The Great Lakes Legacy Act provides Federal funding to clean up contaminated sediments in the tributaries of our Great Lakes. These contaminated sediments are a legacy of our industrial past, and the longer we wait to clean them up, the greater the likelihood that they will be transported into the open waters of the Great Lakes, where cleanup is virtually impossible. 
   Just to give one example, the city of Kalamazoo, Michigan, has been renowned for years for the paper plants which developed high quality paper using the forests of Michigan. When PCBs were discovered, that seemed like an ideal thing to include in the composition of the coatings on the paper. No one realized their poisonous, toxic nature, and today the Kalamazoo River bottom is littered with remnants of that time with considerable amounts of PCBs. 
   Earlier this year, Congressman Oberstar and I introduced H.R. 6460 to reauthorize and expand the Great Lakes Legacy Act. In addition to making a number of improvements to the original law, our bill also dramatically increased the authorization for Great Lakes cleanup from $50 million per year to $150 million per year. If fully appropriated, this funding level has the potential to clean up all of the known toxic hot spots within 10 years, which will save a considerable amount of money over the cost which will be incurred if we do not clean it up and those toxic materials get into the Great Lakes. 
   On September 18, the House passed the Great Lakes Legacy Act by an overwhelming majority of 371-20. Unfortunately, the Senate was unable to overcome the objections of a few Senators who did not appreciate the necessity to authorize enough money to clean up all of the contaminated sediments within the next decade. Because the Legacy Act expires on September 30th, which is rapidly approaching, supporters in the Senate, most notably Senator Levin and Senator Voinovich, worked hard to draft a compromise amendment that ensures this vital cleanup program continues. 
   The Senate approved the amended Legacy Act by unanimous consent on September 25. That is the bill which is before us. It is not what I had hoped to have. It is not what I think we should have. But the Senate amendment, although it decreases the $150 million per year authorization, does continue the current $50 million per year authorization, plus $4 million per year for ancillary activities. 
   The amendment also decreases the authorization from 5 years to 2 years. This is not because we want to shorten the period of time this bill is in effect, but because the Senators wanted to reintroduce the bill with us next year and put in place a longer bill with greater authorization. 
   Although I am disappointed that this funding authority has been decreased, I am pleased with for the broad support this program has garnered. Congressman Oberstar has mentioned some of that broad support. I especially appreciate the commitment of Chairman Oberstar to revisit this authorization in the 111th Congress. 
   I once again want to thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Johnson, and especially Ranking Members Mica and Boozman for their hard work and for moving this bill so expeditiously. It is not always easy for individuals from other parts of the country to appreciate the importance of the Great Lakes and the importance of cleaning up the toxic materials. I personally want to thank Chairman Boozman for his very diligent work in examining this issue, fully understanding it, and getting the bill through the process. 
   I also want to thank all the members of the Great Lakes Task Force, and there are many, who have joined in cosponsoring this particular bill. 
   I ask my colleagues to once again join me in supporting H.R. 6460. Let's immediately get this bill on the President's desk for his signature, so that this important work can continue unabated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank you for the accommodation. 
   As soon as I discovered this issue was before us, I rushed to the floor so that I could participate in this discussion. 
   I worked closely with Ms. Millender-McDonald for several years. When I was Chair, she was ranking member, and when she was Chair, I was ranking member. 
   The word that comes to mind the second I think about her is ``elegance.'' She was a very elegant person. I mean that in a very positive sense. I'm not talking just about elegance in dress, elegance in bearing, but to the core of her being she was an elegant, wonderful human being. 
   I enjoyed working with her. We accomplished a lot together on the committee. We obviously had our differences now and then, but we always worked through them. And what always struck me as something really wonderful about her and about our Nation, and to show how far we've come, that a sharecropper's daughter could become the Chair of a major committee in the Congress of the United States. That's amazing, but it speaks very well of her in the way she comported herself, the way she had taught herself, the accomplishments that she had made during her life. Just a very remarkable person in every way. 
   The only regret I had was that she never shared with me anything about her illness or the seriousness of her illness. I believe she felt she had to carry that burden alone. And I would have been delighted and honored had she shared with me more of the details so that I could help her on this journey towards death, and that I could have been at her side praying with her and comforting her. 
   But it's just a great delight to see this honor bestowed upon her. I certainly hope this is an elegant highway that we're dedicating to her, because it would be befitting of her and her accomplishments, and above all, her presence as a human being, that this highway reflect her greatness, her elegance, her ability, and her dedication to her people and to this Nation. 
   I thank you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6475, which would establish the Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Program within the House of Representatives. 
   Instituting this program will create a talented pool of young attorneys within the House at a fraction of the cost of obtaining similar talent through the hiring process. Many of these exceptional individuals will become leaders of their chosen profession. By offering them a judicial clerkship, we may even inspire some to embark upon a congressional career in lieu of life in a law firm or corporation. 
   For these young men and women, the ability to obtain a judicial clerkship in the very body where laws are created will be an invaluable experience. For the House, it will be a chance to tap into the best and brightest legal minds just as they begin their careers. 
   While we cannot offer the same compensation package that many top law firms offer, we can offer an opportunity to experience the legislative process in a way that is only possible within the Halls of Congress. Whether they continue their careers in the private or public sector, a greater knowledge and appreciation of the legislative process would be enormously useful to the participants in this program as they become part of the fabric of our Nation's judicial system. 
   I thank my colleagues on the House Administration Committee, and especially thank Congressman Lungren and Congresswoman Lofgren for introducing this bill. 
   At this time, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the gentlewoman from California and the gentleman from California on this bill. I think it's an excellent idea. And I have good grounds for saying that because, as I mentioned earlier, I'm a scientist, and the scientific societies of America, for a number of years, have been supporting fellowship programs in which scientists will come and spend one year in the House of Representatives, and thereby learn something about how laws are made. And it has had a profound effect on the scientific community in this country and it has also had a profound effect on the Congress. Some of my best employees have come from that program. If they have worked in the  Congress for a year, either in my office or another office, and I have an opening, they fit in beautifully because so many of the issues I deal with are scientific. So I'm sure this clerkship proposal will be an outstanding program. 
   And I, frankly, think six clerkships is too little, especially for both Chambers. And I hope that some day we're talking in terms of perhaps 20 or 30 for the two Chambers together because I'm sure it is going to be successful. 
   With that, I yield what time he may consume to the gentleman from California.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, let me say a few more words about energy, and perhaps your speaker will be here by that time. 
   But I first want to say, I think your clerkship program is an excellent idea. And I think it would have been wonderful if your clerks could have heard this discussion that you just had with the gentleman from California.     
   It's just exactly the sort of experience that they should have, and it will certainly benefit them. But I have always been impressed with the court clerks that I have encountered over the years, some of whom are good friends of mine whose entire career changed and was shaped by their experience in clerking for someone, whether it was at the State court of appeals level or the Federal judgeship level. So this without a doubt is going to be a very important bill. 
   I also would like to make a few concluding remarks about the energy issues, as I outlined a little while ago. This time I want to mention two sources that are wonderful energy resources, and that we should use more often and more wisely. They are energy resources, that have been in this Earth for many, many years, ever since its creation. First is nuclear; second is geothermal. Both are ample sources of energy if used properly. Both are essentially free in the sense you're not paying anyone for the energy; you're just paying for the equipment and process to extract the energy. And when nuclear energy fell on bad times in the United States almost 30 years ago and basically no one was going to build another reactor in the United States, I said this is going to last one generation because it's a decision based on emotion, not on reality or on the facts. And that's precisely what is happening now. After one generation, we are recognizing that we made a mistake at that  point, whereas France has put 80 percent of their electrical power in the hands of the nuclear reactor business and India has done 90 percent. They have been using nuclear power successfully at reasonable cost with no dangers, no accidents, and this indicates that we can do the same. I think that would be immensely useful. 
   I am particularly perturbed with the current trend to use more and more natural gas to generate electricity. You can imagine what this is going to do to the price of energy for homeowners who heat their homes with natural gas, who are going to have to pay more as natural gas becomes in shorter supply because the power plants are using such copious amounts of it. In addition to that, I note that natural gas, frankly, is too valuable to burn. It's an invaluable feedstock for the petrochemical industry, and the more we use it for other purposes, the more we increase the price of natural gas for manufacturing purposes, we reach a point now where almost all the new fertilizer factories in the world are being built in other countries, not in America, because the price of natural gas here is getting so high that it's too expensive to make fertilizer out of natural gas in our Nation, so it is manufactured in other countries. 
   We have made a number of mistakes in our energy policy. I would hope this Congress, before the end of this session, would resolve this, set us on a new track, so that we would once again return to an era of cheaper energy, and that our Nation may prosper and our people may be able to keep warm. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 6608, the House Reservists Pay Adjustment Act. I thank Chairman Brady for his leadership on this issue, and I'm proud to join with him as a cosponsor on this important bill. 
   The men and women of the United States Armed Forces make many sacrifices to protect our freedom. They are asked to spend time away from their families, to put themselves in harm's way, and, in the case of some House staff, to accept a salary that is less than what they would normally earn in civilian life during the period that they are on active duty. The gap in pay experienced by these servicemen and women often causes undue hardship on themselves and their families and increases the already heavy burden placed upon them as they leave for battle. 
   I am pleased to be able to find any reasonable method of assisting House staff, who are also members of the military, with the personal sacrifices they are asked to make to defend their country. This bill would compensate active servicemen and women for the difference in their combat pay and their official House salaries. These individuals have found not one but two careers that serve the public, and they should not experience a financial penalty for doing so. 
   I congratulate Chairman Brady for introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6608.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Continuing with the discussion of energy, Mr. Speaker, let me just say I have a deep interest in the topic and have had for many years. Most of my colleagues here remember and recognize that I am a physicist, and physicists deal with energy all the time. 
   One of the biggest problems that we address is that energy is intangible. The public simply doesn't recognize what it is, how its obtained, what the limitations are, and so forth; and I think we should do a better job of educating them about these problems. 
   Another aspect is that energy is critical to every aspect of life. 
   As an example, we talk about the agricultural revolution. But very few people recognize that the agricultural revolution, even though attempted a number of times many, many years ago, did not actually succeed until people learned to domesticate their animals so they could do the plowing and thresh the wheat and so forth. 
   The second major revolution in history is the industrial revolution, once again directly tied to the use of energy. It's the first use of nonhuman and nonanimal energy with hydropower to drive the mills, later coal to drive the steam engines and so forth. And so the major revolutions in history took place in connection with the use of energy and the development of new forms of energy. 
   We are now at a critical point in our life as a Nation and as a planet. If we do not recognize the changes required in our energy use, we are going to retrogress. Instead of advancing, we will lose the advantages we have from our copious amounts of energy and end up in a state where we have less energy than we had before. This will have disastrous economic effects, unless we change our direction. 
   If you look back over history, virtually every recession has been tied to a dramatic increase in the cost of energy, which is something that we also have occurring now. 
   So this is a serious problem, something that should be addressed immediately, and should not wait for next year. There are a number of excellent proposals out there from both parties. I would hope that we would winnow these out and come up with proposals that truly accomplish what we have to do, and that is to preserve our standard of living by developing new sources of energy, certainly developing those that we already have and know about which we are not really using properly.     
   It's essential that we do this, but this isn't going to happen by itself. We need help from the Congress to lay down the guidelines for the people in the energy industry, to researchers in the national  labs and other labs to really tackle this problem and come up with new ideas. 
   I don't care if it's wind energy, which happens to be a part of solar energy; whether it's wave energy, which is also derived from solar energy; or whether it's photovoltaic cells. Naturally it helps that very soon photovoltaic cell research will be so good that we will have photovoltaic shingles on every house because we can make them at a cost that eventually will be less than that of the asphalt shingles. If we do that, every house becomes a power-generating system, and much of the electrical needs of each homeowner can be met just by the use of solar shingles on the roof of their home. 
   This would be a tremendous boon to our country. Relatively free energy; you just buy the shingles which you have to buy anyway, and you get essentially free energy out of it. 
   So there are many options that we should be pursuing, and we should be encouraging and helping as a Congress, so that we can help the public that is becoming desperate about what to do about the cost of energy and the price of energy. 
   So I sincerely hope our Congress will tackle this issue and deal with it, and meet the needs of the public and of the planet at the same time. 
   With that, if you have no further speakers, I'm pleased to yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1207, which would enable House staff to receive their pay stubs electronically and encourages the CAO to make further technological improvements that would enable employees to make changes in withholding, deductions or deposits electronically. 
   Increasingly, individuals are using technology to keep track of their financial information, and putting key data such as compensation information online will assist many in their efforts to keep track of their finances. 
   With the impact of junk mail, paper bills and other items delivered via postal mail, reducing the amount of wasted paper, even by a single item each month, would be good for the environment and likely will be a welcome change for many employees.     
   In this spirit of developing online tools for House staff, I also introduced an amendment to this bill that would direct the CAO to allow employees to make changes in withholdings, deductions, or deposits electronically. Not only would this service be of great use to employees, but it would also lessen the burden on payroll counselors who currently make these types of routine adjustments manually, which would in turn free them up to handle more complex questions that are not suited to a self-service model. 
   I am pleased that the committee voted unanimously to accept the amendment. I thank the chairman for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H. Res. 1207.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no further comments on the bill, but I do have further comments to make. 
   In particular, all of us have spent 5 weeks or thereabouts home with our constituents and were impressed at how seriously our constituents and the Nation is taking the energy crisis that we face. There is a huge concern about this, particularly with the cost of gasoline. 
   In one example, a young woman in my district lives on a farm. It's hard today to make a living on a farm, and so she has a job off the farm as well. Their only vehicle is a pickup with, of course, very poor gas mileage. And she's faced with a position where the cost of driving to work is almost greater than the pay that she receives. This is one small example, and I believe that it is absolutely urgent for the House of Representatives to address this issue. 
   There are several bills out there regarding the energy crisis. There's been a lot of discussion about it. I think the only way I can summarize it after looking at the various bills is to say, what we really need is all of the above. Some members are focused totally on drilling, some are totally focused on alternative forms of energy, some on conservation. But what we really need is a comprehensive bill which addresses all of the above, because we are in a situation where we cannot depend on oil for very many more years. 
   Back in 1954 scientists predicted that by 1970, American oil production would peak, and they were right on the mark. In 1970, American oil production peaked. It's been going down ever since. 
   That same research projected that in about 2005, or 2010, world oil production would peak, and it looks like we've entered that period, and that's one reason why prices are going up. 
   We clearly have to develop the resources we have in this country. We clearly have to develop alternative forms of energy, particularly related to solar. An incredible amount of solar energy hits the Earth every day from the sun, to the point that in one year we get more energy from the sunlight hitting our planet than is contained in all of the resources of energy and the fossil fuels that are in the Earth. 
   So clearly there are ways to address this. We must address this. I just want to speak out and say it's absolutely essential for us to develop new approaches to energy. We certainly ought to put the money into developing alternative forms of energy. We have to put the money into developing drilling techniques that are safe, environmentally safe, and are not going to pollute the waters if they are offshore. We really have to take this seriously. 
   And I think it's reached the point where we can't just throw spitballs or snowballs at each other, but must simply say that we have to do all of the above approaches to energy production, and develop legislation that does that. I am concerned that the legislation being proposed by the leadership of the House will not do all of the above. It will only do part of it. 
   So I urge all of the Members to work together to really solve this problem and show the people of this country that we can deal with an important problem like this. And it's my pleasure to raise this issue, and we will continue discussions on that in the House. 
   As we know, the minority party discussed it every day in the House during the recent recess, out of a sense of disappointment that we had taken the August recess without first dealing with the energy bills that were available for us to consider. We should carry that on and make sure that we do address this issue, especially before we adjourn for the next recess. 
   I thank the group here for listening, and I hope this will result in some action on the part of the House of Representatives. 
   I don't believe I have any further speakers, and if the gentleman from Pennsylvania doesn't, I will, at this point, yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, this is the third time I have served or been involved with a task force dealing with contested elections, and I believe this is by far the best procedure that has been developed and can help serve as a model for future decisions of this sort. 
   I congratulate the two gentlemen before you, who, representing the majority and the minority, did the yeoman's work on investigating the issue, deciding to pull in the Government Accountability Office, which I think was a good addition to the entire process. A careful examination has made it very clear that there was nothing wrong with the voting machines in this particular election; and, therefore, the contestant's claims that the undervote was caused by faulty machines is just not valid. 
   What the real reasons were, we will never know. It could have been ballot design. It could be several other factors that we have considered. 
   But the simple fact is that Mr. Buchanan did win the election, and the results of our vote tonight will demonstrate that. He did, in fact, win the election and will remain as a Member of the Congress. 
   I want to once again compliment the individuals here. Chairman Gonzalez of the task force was eminently fair, thorough, and complete in all his evaluations and discussions. Mr. McCarthy, in his first time on an assignment of this sort, has carried it out very carefully, very thoroughly and contributed a great deal to the discussions and the decisions. 
   I am just very proud that the House Administration Committee has completed this task which can be, I can assure you, a very onerous and difficult task; but the committee has completed it very competently, thoroughly and fairly; and the result, I believe, is beyond question. 
   This will serve as a model for future situations of this sort.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of the House Administration Committee, I am pleased to support S.J. Res. 7, a bill that allows for the reappointment of Roger Sant as a citizen regent of the Smithsonian Institution. 
   Several other members of the Committee on House Administration and I had the opportunity recently to meet with Mr. Sant and discuss the road ahead for the Smithsonian in this time of change and opportunity, and also to discuss the mistakes of the past. Mr. Sant assured me that, with his reappointment, he would do his part to ensure that the ``Nation's attic,'' which is the common name for the Smithsonian, is not being looted by those who have put personal gain above the interests of the Institution. 
   In the last Congress, this committee conducted an oversight hearing into Smithsonian Business Ventures in what would turn out to be a prophetic concern about the museum's financial operations. While my colleague Chairman Brady and and I are committed to continuing vigorous oversight of the Smithsonian, an effective and engaged Board of Regents is an essential first line of defense in ensuring that we do not experience a repeat of those problems that plagued the immediate past president of the Smithsonian. 
   I am confident, based on the statements made by Mr. Sant, that he is committed to earning back the trust of the Congress and the American people regarding the board's role of safeguarding our Nation's most treasured assets and ensuring proper governance of the Smithsonian and all its different enterprises. 
   I appreciate the leadership given by the chairman of this committee, Mr. Brady, and the way he has taken hold of this issue, among others, and I am pleased to join him in approving this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2206, which will extend the time period for the Joint Committee on the Library to enter into an agreement to obtain a statue of Rosa Parks. 
   A tireless advocate for equality, Rosa Parks is best remembered for a single act of civil disobedience that would change the history of our Nation. By refusing to move to the back of the bus in her native Alabama, to make room for white passengers, Mrs. Parks ignited passions on both sides of the civil rights movement. This led to the Montgomery bus boycott and helped to elevate the work of another great American of the civil rights movement, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as well as an august Member of this body, Congressman John Lewis, who also participated and played a leading role in some of the demonstrations of that time. 
   Even in her passing, Rosa Parks was a trailblazer as the first woman and only the second African American to lie in state in the Capitol rotunda. 
   I am especially pleased to speak on her behalf since she decided to take up residence in Michigan for the remainder of her life after she had gone through various demonstrations and activities surrounding her initial act of defiance. She was a distinguished citizen of our State, and in fact we recently dedicated a new park in downtown Grand Rapids in her honor. It is named the Rosa Parks Park. 
   By extending the time period to procure a statue of Mrs. Parks, this bill will allow the Joint Committee on the Library to delegate the administration of the statue selection process to the Architect of the Capitol. The JCL was not designed for, nor is it equipped, to run an arts competition. Allowing the Architect of the Capitol to administer the competition process will ensure that the statue selected is a fitting tribute to this marvelous civil rights pioneer. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, but I would like to close with a few additional comments. 
   First of all, I admire my colleague's voting record. It is a rare person who misses only two votes during 13 years. 
   But above all, I want to comment on a few things relating to Rosa Parks. First, what impresses me is how much one person who is determined to fight for what is right can accomplish. She was a marvelous person and stuck to her guns in tough situations, and she carried the day and inspired a lot of other people to carry the day. 
   The other factor is, as I look around the world today, and the United States especially, and compare that to the world before Rosa Parks, what a mammoth change we have undergone. But also as I look around, I still remember how much further we have to go. And let us always work in the spirit of Rosa Parks to destroy discrimination of all sorts and make certain that every American and in fact every citizen of this planet enjoys the freedom that we enjoy.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. I thank the gentleman from western Michigan for yielding to me. And I certainly thank the gentlewoman from California for offering this amendment. 
   As we discussed on the floor just a few weeks ago, I managed to get a bill passed a couple of years ago to strengthen the aerospace industry workforce just in order to help NASA, because they were having so many retirements. Many joined their workforce in the 1960s to respond to the call from President John Fitzgerald Kennedy that we go to the Moon, and those individuals are all now retiring, and as a result we have a serious shortage of workers in the aerospace industry. But there are many other industries, including the intelligence departments of this government, that have a desperate need of those knowledgeable about aerospace and other science and mathematics areas. 
   As I suspect everyone in this House knows, I've worked very hard over the last 15 years trying to improve the math-science education of this Nation. It's beginning to pay dividends. Just at lunchtime today, we had a very large room full of young ladies, all of high school and college age, interested in getting into mathematics and science, so we are making progress on that. But we need much more progress if we are going to compete with China, with India, and with other nations in regard to a trained, intelligent workforce. 
   That's especially true, of course, in the intelligence field and in the NASA. We have some very skilled, very knowledgeable, very bright people working there, but also, we are going to be losing a number of them to retirement, in the last few years. We have to beef up that force. And so this amendment will emphasize the need that we have to encourage more individuals to go into science and mathematics at all levels, ranging from high school graduates up through Ph.Ds. And we definitely need to work at that as a Nation. I appreciate that the amendment will direct the national intelligence effort in this direction as well. 
   So thank you again to the sponsor of the amendment for offering this. It is a great help to our Nation, it's a great help to the intelligence service, and I'm pleased to be part of it.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (CONGRESSIONAL PENSION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Thank you for clarifying that. 
   Mr. Speaker, part of the reason for the question was an honest inquiry simply because there has been a lot of confusion about the last-minute changes, which is certainly not customary for a bill taken up under suspension. 
   This bill would deprive Members of Congress from their pensions if they are convicted of certain crimes. Similar language was included in the ethics and lobbying reform bill passed by the Senate last week. 
   This is not a new issue. This is not the first time the House has considered the question of whether convicted Members should lose their pensions. In 1996, following the conviction of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, a public outcry followed published reports that he would be receiving a generous pension even while serving his prison term. In response, the House scheduled and voted on H.R. 4011, to take away the pensions of Members convicted of offenses listed in the bill. It passed 390-32 in the House, but was not taken up in the Senate and did not become law; and Mr. Rostenkowski received his full pension.  
   Incidentally, mail fraud, the crime for which Mr. Rostenkowski was convicted, was a listed offense in that bill, H.R. 4011, but is not listed in the bill pending before us today. So if there were another Rostenkowski event, today this would not affect that behavior. 
   The recent convictions of some of our former colleagues, and published reports implicating a current Member in bribery schemes, have caused this issue to surface again. 
   Then, as now, these legislative efforts amount to an attempt to close the barn door after the horse has gone. Even if H.R. 4011 had passed in 1996, it would not have affected anyone engaged in criminal activity prior to its passage. In other words, Mr. Rostenkowski still would not have been affected by that bill. Whatever we do today will not deprive any of our convicted former colleagues of their pensions and won't threaten the pension of a Member who might have already engaged in criminal activity but has yet to be charged or convicted. The Supreme Court has ruled you simply cannot change the criminal penalty for a crime after it has been committed and apply it retroactively. This is called ex post facto punishment and is clearly prohibited by the Constitution, and that is why it is so extremely important to draft this bill properly. 
   The Congress had originally attempted to do this when it passed the Hiss Act in 1954 in response to the perjury conviction of Alger Hiss. The law applied to a number of offenses. But this law, though passed after his conviction, was written to take away Hiss's pension but was struck down by a Federal court, and later the Congress scaled the law back because it was unmanageable. This illustrates again the importance of careful work on bills of this nature. 
   Conviction of an offense listed in the Hiss Act, which is still in effect and applies to all government employees, results in total loss of the pension. The Hiss Act, as amended in 1961, is now limited to crimes against the State that threaten national security: treason, espionage, sedition, et cetera. 
   Of course, had the Congress enacted the House-passed legislation on the subject in 1996, those who have been convicted of listed criminal offenses in the interim would not be able to receive pensions and today's action would not be necessary. 
   In view of all this, I have to say, Mr. Speaker, that I think it is most unfortunate that we are considering this bill under suspension with last-minute changes, with limited time for debate, and no opportunity to consider alternatives. I believe that it is important to look at some alternatives. The courts have raised the issue of proportionality, that the punishment must be proportional to the crime. This bill does not contain anything relating to that. And it should, because under this bill a person who commits a heinous crime and has 5 years of pension credit suffers a minor penalty compared to a person who might commit a minor crime but has 20 years of pension to lose. This is not taken care of in this bill, and it should be. 
   The issue of spouse pensions, as the Chair of the committee mentioned, is dealt with in this bill; but I don't think it is dealt with satisfactorily. I think we should give some guidelines to the Office of Personnel Management in dealing with that. 
   My point on all this, Mr. Speaker, is that this is an important bill. It is going to potentially affect each and every Member of the Congress. I think it should be done with due deliberation and carefulness, and I think it is most unfortunate that this bill has become clouded by the hasty effort to get this taken up on suspension with last-minute changes not approved previously by the minority. 
   I hope this is not an example of what we can expect in the future. The issue is certainly more important than naming a post office, which is what we normally do on suspension; and I hope that this bill, when it does pass, will come back in conference so that we will be able to fine tune it in conference with the Senate and produce a good bill that is worthy of final passage. 
   Mr. Speaker I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would just like to make a brief response to the majority leader before recognizing my next speaker. The issue is not just the quality of the bill. The main issue is the process, and I recall many times over the past few years, when we were in the majority, I asked our leadership to take up a bill on suspension. They said we can't do it unless the minority agrees to it, and I had to wait weeks several times for that. 
   Now, suddenly, we get a bill tossed out in just a few hours' notice. That is not proper procedure.

   I appreciate the comments made by the majority leader and minority leader. I hope they cleared the air. 
   But I just want to add a personal note. I served on a county commission some years ago and became the chair of the county commission, and there I learned the importance of proper order in doing things in regular order. I served as president pro tem of the State senate, and that even reinforced it more strongly. Always proceed properly, fairly and in order. 
   And I think part of the difficulty we have had here today is that the members of the current minority sat here for 2 weeks grinding their teeth while they watched things come to the floor without having gone to committee, without prior debate and discussion. And this was the crowning insult, to bring something to the floor under suspension, and to make not just one change, we have heard discussion of the date, but two changes in the bill between the time it was agreed to and the time that it reached the floor. 
   We cannot have that. As a minority we will not tolerate that. We deserve proper order. We deserve respect. And I assume the majority will, from this time henceforth, give us that respect and follow proper order, proper procedure, so we can avoid these donnybrooks in the future.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and service of William Spoelhof, president emeritus of Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He was born in 1909 in Paterson, New Jersey, and passed away on December 3, 2008, at the age of 98. 
   William Spoelhof graduated from Calvin College in 1931, and began teaching history and civics at the secondary level. He received his masters of arts degree from the University of Michigan in 1937, and began his doctoral studies there. 
   During World War II, Mr. Spoelhof enlisted in the U.S. Navy, and served our country in the Office of Strategic Services. Following the war, he completed his doctoral work, and went to Calvin College to teach history and political science in 1946. 
   After becoming president of Calvin College, Dr. Spoelhof oversaw the process of moving Calvin College from its original Franklin Street campus, located in urban Grand Rapids, to its current Knollcrest campus in southeast Grand Rapids. 
   Dr. Spoelhof carefully balanced the college's vision for excellent academics with its relationship with the Christian Reformed Church, as he effectively steered the college through occasional church conflicts and the tumultuous, nation-wide student protests of the 1960s. 
   In 1976, Dr. Spoelhof announced his retirement after 25 years, the longest serving president in Calvin College's history. After his formal retirement, he was named president emeritus and maintained an office and steady presence at the College, offering continued support and goodwill whenever needed. 
   Dr. Spoelhof was a Christian role model and mentor to many faculty members, staff and students, as he provided wisdom and counsel to thousands during his more than 8 decades of service to Calvin College. 
   On a personal note, Dr. Spoelhof recruited me from the University of California at Berkeley to teach physics at Calvin College. I am deeply grateful for his guidance and for leading me to teach at a wonderful, Christian liberal arts college. 
   Dr. Spoelhof is fondly remembered for his contributions to daily discussions with retired faculty and students at the ``Emeritorium'', and for his kind words to passers-by around the campus. 
   In 1935, William Spoelhof married Miss Angeline Nydam, and they had three children, Robert Spoelhof, Elsa Scherphorn, and Peter Spoelhof. Ange, as Dr. Spoelhof lovingly called his wife, passed away in 1994. 
   Dr. Spoelhof lived a life of gratitude, and desired to bring God glory in all he did. On December 3, 2008, the Calvin College community lost a visionary leader and wise friend. He is to be honored and recognized for his outstanding devotion and service as a member of the military, a Calvin College professor, and president and friend.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5972. While I would have preferred that we would have addressed these items in regular order, I am pleased that the proposed technical corrections in this bill will create a stronger operational framework for the Capitol Police. As often happens when language is tied to an appropriations bill in a hasty fashion, several requirements in the original legislation governing Capitol Police operations proved problematic under greater scrutiny and further use. This bill will bring clarity to the administration of the U.S. Capitol Police and will eliminate those provisions which are in conflict with one another or are antiquated and therefore unnecessary. 
   I would also point out that this illustrates the importance of the appropriations subcommittees to work together with the authorizing committees, because virtually all the problems that have arisen in the past in this area resulted from a lack of cooperation between the authorizing and appropriating committees. 
   The changes specified in this bill will also establish a transparent and decisive governance framework and create a clear reporting structure within the U.S. Capitol Police. The clarified language provides the Chief of the Capitol Police with explicit authority to perform all hiring and termination actions, which will assist the U.S. Capitol Police's legal staff in executing its duties regarding personnel matters. 
   This bill also clarifies that the Capitol Police must notify this committee, as well as the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, of substantive administrative and operational actions, such as notices of personnel actions or deployment of personnel outside of the Capitol Police's jurisdiction. This language further strengthens this committee's function as an oversight body and allows us to address any such issues as they occur. 
   I thank Chairman BRADY for his work on this bill, which will, upon its passage, create a stronger law enforcement organization, and a safer, more secure Capitol complex. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   First of all, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my chairman, Mr. Brady. He and I have worked very, very well together on a number of issues, and I believe that, if there were a competition, we would probably hold the prize among the committees of the House as to the best functioning committees who really try to get business done without a lot of partisanship. I commend my colleague for his great attitude on this. 
   One other comment I will make in regard to the Capitol Police. The one area we did not examine, which I think needs examination at some point, and I hope our committee will take it up at some point, the duties of the Capitol Police Board are not as clearly outlined as they might be. The composition, I believe, is lacking. We have a GAO report of a few years ago which pointed out some severe shortcomings in the operations and decision-making processes of the Capitol Police Board, and I think we would be well-served in this institution to re-examine that issue. 
   We have done so much in the past decade to modernize the police force; make them provide more ready responses to the trauma that we face today in this time of terrorism. I think we would be well-advised to look at the governing structure once again too, which to my knowledge, has not been examined for a long time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. One part about this bill that is probably worthwhile is the effort to reduce energy use, and in particular to reduce the carbon footprint, as it has come to be called, although I have always joked that I prefer ``carbon tire tracks'' because we produce a lot more carbon dioxide with our cars than from other common sources. Nevertheless, this bill allows schools to use funds to reduce the carbon footprint of their schools. 
   As I perused this bill, I realized that it was entirely possible that the schools might decide to use the Federal funds to purchase carbon offsets or carbon credits. To me, that would make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Because schools are small, they do not emit huge amounts of carbon dioxide, and the money that they might want to use for that can much better be used to improve insulation in the schools, improve the insulation in the walls, improve the type of windows so that there's less energy escaping. There are many modifications that can be made that would reduce energy use, and by reducing energy use, you reduce the carbon footprint. 
   I would also maintain that it is much more effective to reduce the energy use, whether it's by better insulation or by sealing the windows, or putting in the appropriate type of glass. It's much more cost-effective in reducing the carbon footprint than it would be to buy carbon offsets. So it seems to me that we should make certain that no school would ever attempt to use Federal funds, if this bill passes, for the purpose of buying carbon credits. 
   This is not because I oppose carbon credits. I think this is something that in fact we will be facing shortly because the Senate is working on a bill on that issue, but I am simply for efficiency, not wasting money, making certain that the money that is in this bill, if this bill passes, will be used wisely and will be used to conserve energy, not to purchase carbon offsets. 
   With that in mind, I offer this bill to make certain that money is not improperly used and to make sure that we use the funds efficiently. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 5893, which will reauthorize the Library of Congress's Sound Record and Film Preservation Program. It is an important bill, which will preserve the images and sounds of our Nation's history and make those pieces of the past more accessible to future generations. 
   The importance of this effort was illustrated just this weekend when Universal Studios in California had a mammoth fire in which some priceless films were lost, and all films, if they were recorded and in the Library of Congress, would not face this problem. 
   The National Film Preservation Board was formed in 1993 following a study that revealed that America's film heritage was at serious risk due to the degradation of acetate film stock at an alarming rate. Funding for preservation programs had fallen drastically since 1980, creating an urgent need for action. A national plan to protect our Nation's treasures on film was created in 1994 to address the growing need for preservation and to make films more available for education and public exhibition. 
   I must confess, Mr. Speaker, to some frustration that we have to come in and save the films that the film industry has not taken care of. Obviously they're making enough money when they pull down $300 million in one weekend for certain films. I would think they would have the wherewithal to preserve their own films. Nevertheless, since they have not, the Congress has had to step in to do it. 
   In 1999 Congress created the Sound Recording Preservation Program modeled on the successful National Film Preservation Program. This new program would protect historic pieces of audio recordings from deterioration. These audio recordings are extremely important and should be preserved as well. Through the creation of this program, the Sound Recording Preservation Board was instructed to produce a report on the current state of sound recording archiving, preservation and restoration activities, encompassing standards for digital preservation and for access to preserved recordings. The program also includes research on current laws governing sound preservation and how the Library and other institutions can make collections more available to researchers digitally. 
   This bill will continue the good work started by the Sound Recording and Film Preservation Program staff and their respective boards. Historians, scholars, and citizens will benefit from increased access to these important works, and the items themselves will be preserved for many more generations to come under these programs. 
   I fully support this bill and thank Chairman BRADY for his efforts to bring this matter to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And had I been your teacher, you never would have disliked any science course. I would have been delighted to recognize your native ability. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 485, which expresses appreciation for the profound public service and educational contributions of Donald Jeffry Herbert, who passed away on June 12, 2007. 
   Many people fondly remember Donald Herbert as Mr. Wizard, and they mourn his passing. He was born in  Waconia, Minnesota, which also happens to be my birth State, and he graduated from the La Crosse State Teachers College in Wisconsin in 1940, where he trained to be a science teacher. 
   He volunteered for the U.S. Army Air Corps and served our country during World War II in the Atlantic theater and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters. 
   Mr. Wizard will be remembered as a pioneer of commercial educational programming. He made science education and science exciting and approachable for millions of children across the United States. He developed the idea for science programs on radio and television, culminating in ``Watch Mr. Wizard,'' a live television show produced from 1951 to 1964. Another of his shows, ``Mr. Wizard's World,'' inspired children from 1983 to 1990 on cable television. Incidentally, these were precursors to today's Mr. Wizard equivalent, Bill Nye, the Science Guy, who has developed an outstanding reputation on Saturday morning television for educating children about science. 
   The National Science Foundation and the American Chemical Society lauded Don Herbert and his show for promoting interest in science and his contributions to science education. He has since been recognized by numerous awards. 
   For the duration of his life, Mr. Wizard served as an ambassador for science education. Outside of his television shows, he promoted science by offering multiple books and programs and by traveling to schools to provide classroom demonstrations. Not surprisingly, Mr. Wizard's dynamic and energetic science experiments attracted unprecedented numbers of children to educational programming, even those who were initially disinterested or unmotivated in science. 
   Mr. Wizard taught the magic about science by doing science. In fact, Mr. Wizard encouraged children to duplicate his experiments at home, leading children into independent inquiry into science with simple household equipment.     
   I might add he was a precursor to what is happening in the classrooms today, because teachers have discovered the best way to teach science is to let students do the science themselves. 
   I also appreciate what he did in leading children into independent inquiry. I grew up before television, and so I did not have the opportunity to watch him. But I developed my interest in science by doing experiments at home. These were experiments that were outlined in Popular Science Magazine, and that gave me my start in science, just as Mr. Wizard gave many other children their start in science. 
   Certainly, Mr. Wizard's efforts were very important, and are relevant to legislation currently under consideration by our Congress. Evidence indicates that young children make decisions about future careers at an early age and are influenced greatly by positive contacts with science and technology. Recently passed bipartisan bills have focused on the need to improve science education, promote innovation, and ensure our Nation's competitiveness. 
   This year I introduced several bills related to science education, including the Science Accountability Act, H.R. 35; the Standards to Improve Educational Achievement for Kids, better known as the SPEAK Act, H.R. 325; and the National Science Education Tax Incentive for Teachers Act, H.R. 36. 
   Through this resolution the House of Representatives expresses its appreciation for the profound public service and educational contributions of Donald Herbert. Also, we should recognize the major impact of higher educational institutions that train teachers who encourage students to honor the heritage of Don Herbert by exploring our world through science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. 
   I offer my condolences to the family of Don Herbert, and we thank them for their strong support of Mr. Wizard's tremendous educational efforts. He has set a path that all of us should follow, and if we are serious about competing with other nations and keeping the jobs on our soil rather than letting them be outsourced, we must follow his example and educate our children in mathematics and science so that we can continue to be ranked number one in the world in the areas of science and mathematics. 
   Finally, I thank the Members who cosponsored this resolution: Mr. Akin, Mrs. Biggert, Mr. Gingrey, Mr. Hall, Mr. Kuhl, Mr. Lampson, Mrs. McCarthy, Mr. John Peterson, and Mr. Mark Udall. Also, I thank the Education and Labor Committee staff for their work on this resolution, especially Chad Miller and Rob Borden, as well as my staff member, Rachel Post, who has contributed invaluably to this. 
   I urge all Members to vote for this resolution to honor Don Herbert for all his work on science education and to honor his memory by continuing to support science education in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise, reluctantly, in opposition to this resolution. I say ``reluctantly'' because I had hoped to be able to vote in favor of something positive, a fresh perspective, a new idea, a new pathway to success, anything to encourage and foster a positive outcome in the Iraq conflict. But this resolution offers none of these things. It is a simple, almost meaningless, nonbinding statement of disapproval that provides no constructive resolve on this daunting, yet critical mission. 
   My opposition is both procedural and substantive. I am extremely disappointed that we only have this one simplistic, inadequate statement before us for consideration. No alternatives, no other ideas, no solutions. The situation in Iraq is complicated, and the American people deserve far more from Congress than a resolution that essentially calls for the status quo. 
   The resolution opposes the troop surge called for by the Commander in Chief, but fails to offer or even allow for consideration of any alternatives aimed at achieving success in Iraq, nor does it offer an alternative aimed at a reduction of troops.  
   There are other ideas out there worthy of consideration and discussion, yet we are not debating those, including those suggested by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. For example, the study group concluded that there is no single action that the military can take that, by itself, can bring about success in Iraq. I agree with that assessment. Regardless of a troop surge, I believe a positive outcome in Iraq requires regional cooperation and positive engagement with all of Iraq's neighboring states. 
   A case can be made for a troop surge, but even more, we need a surge in diplomacy to create an environment conducive for a lasting peace throughout the Middle East. The history of the region is too diverse, too complex, and too tumultuous to expect progress without an integrated diplomatic effort and multinational support. Of course, this simple resolution before us offers no perspective on these matters. 
   In a few weeks, this body will have the opportunity to vote on funding for ongoing operations in Iraq. Forget today's resolution; the vote on the supplemental funding bill is where the real debate will occur, and the policies will be laid forth. Make no mistake, a cutoff of funds and a premature withdrawal of troops from Iraq will produce even greater sectarian violence, further deterioration of security conditions, and would foment a terrorist breeding ground for radical Islamists. We, the Members of Congress, must give our troops the resources they need to carry out their critical mission to a successful conclusion. 
   In closing, let me say that we all unequivocally support the troops who are serving and who have served in Iraq, and we all deeply appreciate their efforts to carry out their duties. Every day I think about the 3,000-plus American troops who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I pray for their families, as well as for our troops that are there now. I think about the thousands more who have been injured, and the tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi citizens who have been killed or injured as a result of this conflict. We must do all we can to ensure that those casualties were not suffered in vain. Above all, we must seek to end this conflict and stop the casualties. 
   Simply put, the resolution we are debating offers no path to success, and that is why I oppose it.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (HONORING AND COMMEMORATING ACTS OF HEROISM OF THE LATE DETECTIVE JOHN MICHAEL GIBSON AND PRIVATE FIRST CLASS JACOB JOSEPH CHESTNUT OF THE CAPITOL POLICE ON JULY 24, 1998 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 1360, which would honor and commemorate the selfless acts of heroism displayed by the late Detective John Michael Gibson and Private First Class Jacob Joseph Chestnut of the United States Capitol Police. 
   It is hard to believe that it has already been 10 years since the tragic chain of events that took the lives of two heroes, Jacob Joseph Chestnut and John Gibson, who were killed in the line of duty when a deranged gunman stormed this very building on July 24, 1998. And how well I remember that day. I had just left the Capitol, gone to the airport to fly back to Michigan, and as I entered the airport building, I saw on TV the ambulances, the gentlemen being carried out, and what a sad event that was. 
   Jacob Joseph Chestnut, who was affectionately known as ``J.J.,'' was an 18-year veteran of the Capitol Police force, just months away from retirement. A husband and father of five and a Vietnam vet, Chestnut was remembered at the time of his passing to have been extremely proud to be able to continue to serve his country by working in the United States Capitol. After a 20-year career in the Air Force, he carried his discipline and military training with him to Congress when he joined the Capitol Police in 1980, but  was also known for his big smile and warm demeanor. 
   John Gibson, who was stationed outside the office of then House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, was also a husband and father of three and an 18-year veteran of the Capitol Police. He was a die-hard fan of all of Boston's sports teams and often requested a copy of the Boston Globe from the whip's office to see how his teams had done. He had become extremely close to Representative DeLay's staff and in the end saved their lives through his selfless act of heroism. He was remembered for tirelessly accompanying the Congressman even when the day would stretch into night, until his job was done. 
   This bill is only a small tribute to those two exceptional men who gave their lives in defense of their country. We owe them a great debt, and in honoring their memory, we honor all those Capitol Police officers who routinely put themselves in harm's way to protect us each day. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 1360. 
   Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (EXPRESSING GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION TO THE CAPITOL POLICE -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 645, which expresses the gratitude and appreciation of the House of Representatives for the professionalism and dedication of the United States Capitol Police. 
   As long ago as 1801, when John Goldman, the Capitol's first watchman, was appointed, there have been brave men and women charged with risking their own lives to protect Members of Congress. With the passage of time, the threat to the Congress has evolved, and with it so too have the Capitol Police become a world-class law enforcement body. 
   Over the years the development of the Internet and various telecommunications devices that have proved revolutionary to all Americans have had the unintended consequence of providing new ways for criminals to communicate with each other in order to plan more elaborate attacks. As their attacks have become more sophisticated, the Capitol Police have had to adjust their protocols and skills to stay a step ahead of the perpetrators. 
   As discussed with the previous resolution, tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of a tragic accident that took the  lives of two heroes, Jacob Joseph Chestnut and John Gibson, who were killed in the line of duty when a deranged gunman stormed this very building. Their deaths are a stark reminder of the great peril that Capitol Police officers face each day. With the terrorist attacks of 9/11 came new threats and heightened awareness that there are those for whom destruction of the Capitol and its inhabitants would be cause for celebration. 
   This sobering reality is one that the Capitol Police must live with each day. Yet even with the burden they carry, the Capitol Police greet members, staff, and visitors alike with a welcome demeanor and reassuring presence. They are often the first face we see when we a arrive at the beginning of the day and the last person we say goodnight to as we leave. This resolution serves as a tribute to each of those men and women who bravely stand between us and those who would do us harm. 
   For these reasons I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 645. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (COMMITTEE FUNDING RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 202, which provides approximately a 2.4 percent increase to committee budgets in the 110th Congress. 
   I believe I speak for both myself and my colleague, Ms. Millender-McDonald, when I say we would have liked to have seen a larger increase to relieve some of the financial constraints that have been placed on committees. I totally agree with her concerns, which she expressed a moment ago, about the salaries of staff members, both in personal offices and in committees, and several Members on our side of the aisle have raised that same concern with me.     
   We, of course, as Members of the Congress, will not receive any increase in salary this year, but we expected that, and we have no problem dealing with that. However, it is different for our staffs. They have lush fields of opportunity outside of this institution, and we hope that all staff members will bear with us during this lean time during the next year or two and not be attracted to these lush fields, but remain with us, so that the institution can continue to function as well as it has. 
   The committee and ranking members alike face an increasing workload each year with limited resources and staff. Despite the funding limitations we have this year, it is my sincere hope that even a modest increase will be of use to committees in performing the important work that they do, and also my fond hope that through a normal appropriations process this year, there will be adequate funding to deal with the business of the Congress during the next fiscal year. 
   My goal during the course of providing funding levels for House committees in the 110th Congress has been twofold: first, to maintain what has in the last few years been a relatively smooth committee funding process. Many of our chairmen and ranking members have established standing precedents about the operating practices within their respective committees and have functioned for many years in accordance with those principles. Based on the productive hearing we held last week during which the chairs and ranking members testified on their budget requests, I believe we have continued that smooth process following the pattern of the last several Congresses. 
   Second, I wanted to ensure that an equitable division of funding continues. When the Republicans previously served in the minority, we were not provided with sufficient funds or staff. As an example, one of the major committees was given only 11 percent of the resources assigned to that committee, whereas the then majority, the Democrats, retained 89 percent for themselves. This is not appropriate or fair. 
   During the course of the past 12 years, the Committee on House Administration has reached an agreement on maintaining two-thirds of the funding for the majority and one-third for the minority, and I am very pleased that every committee chairman who came before the committee promised to honor and continue that commitment, that allocation, and we are delighted that the new majority's continuation of that split will serve as good guidance for the future as well. It is vital to the strength of the House of Representatives as an institution that the minority, no matter which party it is, continues to be given adequate resources, and that each chairman and ranking member be able to come to an arrangement that is satisfactory for both parties. 
   Adjustments to the two-thirds/one-third budget allocation have been made  in the past, for instance through the years of shared staff or a centrally managed budget for non-personnel expenditures. My goal is not to discourage these types of arrangements between the chairman and the ranking minority member. In fact, I admire the creativity and cooperation demonstrated by some of our chairmen and ranking members to establish a process that works for their particular committees. However, I do want to ensure that those in the minority continue to be given adequate resources and that each chairman and ranking member are able to come to an arrangement that is satisfactory for both parties. 
   I conclude by thanking our chairwoman, Ms. Millender-McDonald, for conducting this process in an open and transparent fashion. While we were only able to provide a small percentage increase for each committee when compared to last year's budget, we are pleased that we have accomplished the goals of a smooth process that maintains the two-thirds/one-third allocation.

   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for a brief comment. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his comments, and I certainly agree with him. It would have been much better had that special committee been processed through the Committee on House Administration, as all other committees are. I want to also let him know it is even worse than he said, because the total over the 2-year life of this special committee, the select committee that is being formed, is approximately, $3.7 million, which is a large amount of money for any committee to have. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 9 minutes to another gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren), who is also on our committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. EHLERS. (COMMITTEE FUNDING RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I yield myself the balance of my time to conclude. 
   I wish to make a few comments about some of the points raised by the members of the committee on our side of the aisle. 
   First, I voted for this resolution as it came out of committee, without any dissent, because I thought we had done the best job we could, with both parties working together, to fairly distribute the limited funds that we had. 
   What is upsetting our side of the aisle and upsetting a number of individuals are two things: first, the select committee apportionment. I can assure you I am not opposed to forming the Energy Independence and Global Warming Select Committee. It is a major issue, a major topic, which probably has to be studied by a special task force, a select committee, simply because the issue is so complex and cuts across so many committees' jurisdictions that this is the only way to effectively conduct the study and come to an answer. 
   I do, however, strongly object to the process of adding this huge amount of money, $3.7 million, in the confines of the Rules Committee. That is something that I had hoped and expected would come to our Committee on House Administration so that the Chair of the committee and I could work on this issue with all of the parties involved and ascertain the needs of the select committee and determine the precise allocation needed. 
   What particularly angers me about this is that we did not fully fund the Ethics Committee at the level it should be funded. The reason was we simply didn't have the money. Now, suddenly, there is an extra $3.7 million. I would have much preferred to allocate part of that to the Ethics Committee and reduce the amount for the select committee. I am sure they would not have noticed the difference, whereas the Ethics Committee would notice a huge difference and would be able to do its work effectively. 
   With those caveats, I want to express my disappointments with the process, not within our committee, but the process outside our committee. I wish it would have gone through our committee, and we would have dealt with it properly. 
   My final comment is simply to say most Members of Congress do not realize what an incredible amount of work goes into this budget process. It took our committee a full day just to hear the testimony, but that was the easy part. The tough part is for the staff to assemble all of the numbers and get them in order, particularly when there is a transition from one party to the other. That adds complexity and difficulty to the task. 
   I want to thank Peter Sloan and George Hadijski from our side of the aisle, who did an excellent, an outstanding job on this issue. But even though normally one only praises the  people on their own side of the aisle, I want to take special note of some individuals who worked very, very hard on the majority side, simply because their job was monumental having to do it for the first time. 
   I particularly want to commend Charlie Howell, Janelle Hu and Matt Pinkus for their hard work. They worked closely with our team, and we were very happy to help them. But I can't emphasize enough what a horrendous task this is to put together all these budgets very quickly, and both sides did yeomen's work. I am very pleased. 
   I think they set a pattern for the committee because they worked so closely together on this, both parties equally shouldering the burden and not worrying about how many hours they were spending on whose job; and I think that is a good pattern for us to follow for the next 2 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
