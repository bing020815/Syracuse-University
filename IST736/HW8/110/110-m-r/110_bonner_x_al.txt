<DOCNO>Mr. BONNER. (LET REGULAR ORDER PREVAIL ON AIR FORCE TANKER SELECTION -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, today one of our colleagues introduced the KC-X Recompete Act, and its message is clear: If the warfighter wants a new tanker to replace its aging fleet anytime soon, it has but one choice, the Boeing KC-767. This act would tell the warfighter to take the 767; take it or leave it, or face years of delay if you have to have a new competition. 
   Boeing's 767, mind you, is judged second best to the more capable, more modern, Northrop aircraft, an aircraft that I am proud would be built in my home State of Alabama. 
   Yes, the GAO noted procedural errors in the source selection process, but it did not rule on the merits of these two aircraft. And there is no equivocation in terms of which plane the Air Force wants and desperately needs, the KC-45. 
   Some have tried to preempt regular order and take this decision away from the warfighter. Let's not preempt the voice of the men and women who will take this plane into harm's way. We owe them that much.

<DOCNO>Mr. BONNER. (ENERGY BILL NOTHING BUT POLITICAL COVER -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, in words that the American people can understand, you can put lipstick on a bad bill but it is still a bad bill. And sadly, that is what your leadership's so-called energy bill is. It has been called a sham, which it is; it's been called a hoax, which it is. But the truth is, it is nothing but political cover to allow  Members on your side of the aisle an opportunity to say they are for something which we all know the majority of your Members are adamantly opposed to. 
   Why does Congress have the lowest approval rating in the history of the Republic? Because instead of having a real debate on a real energy producing bill, one that will give incentives to the States to actually join in the production of new American energy, this Democratic majority is instead offering up a bill that will not produce a single drop of new oil or a single ounce of new gas. 
   With so much uncertainty in the hearts of the American people today, today's vote is a kick in the teeth to every hardworking American who's tired of paying more for oil and gas. 
   Shame on us. Shame on you.

<DOCNO>Mr. BONNER. (ANNUAL BUDGET DEBATE -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I thank the Speaker for allowing this Special Order to proceed. 
   I thank Jeff for organizing this. This is important for the American people in Texas and California and Alabama and all over this great country to understand what the Democratic majority is doing this week by unveiling their budget, and a budget that we will have to vote on. 
   As my friend from Texas will appreciate and certainly as the majority of my constituents back home in south Alabama know, I do not often come to the House floor every time there is an open microphone just to offer my view on whatever the topic of the day happens to be. Instead, I remember the words of my father who although I was only 13 when he passed away, he told my brother, Jim, my sister, Judy, and me that you learn a lot more from listening than you do from talking. 
   So usually I prefer to sit in the back of the chamber, this building, this awesome chamber that we are so privileged to serve in, and listen to the give-and-take, the back-and-forth of the debates that have helped to define our time. 
   Sadly, however, on this particular evening, I feel moved to come off that back bench so as to speak up and to voice my real concern and, quite frankly, my real disappointment that now that they are back in power after 12 years of being out, our friends on the other side of the aisle have chosen with their budget to revert back to their old familiar habits.     
   Because when all is said and done, that is what this budget will do. In a single sweep, in the snap of a finger, this Democratic budget will give to the American people the single largest tax increase in American history. 
   If all of that sounds familiar to you, then perhaps there's a reason for that. You see, the last time the Democrats  were in control of Congress, they, too, gave the American people what was, at that time, the largest single tax increase in American history. Of course, that was back in 1993, when they had the help of President Bill Clinton to sign the bill into law. Fortunately, at least for the time being, President Bush has a veto pen that hopefully will keep these tax increases from becoming a reality. 
   But one thing is for certain. It didn't take the Democrats long, just 77 days from the time they took over the majority on January 4 of this year, to roll out their plan to raise taxes, yet once again on the backs of hard working Americans. 
   Now, Mr. and Mrs. Middle-Class American Taxpayer, I know some of you may be sitting at home tonight working on your own taxes. In fact, I called a constituent of mine in Mobile just last night, and that is what he told me he was doing, working on his tax returns for 2006. After all, April 15 is just 19 days away. So this topic of raising taxes on America's families couldn't be more timely. 
   Congressman Hensarling, I don't know about you, but I don't recall a single time in any of my years of being in Congress, either as an elected Member or in the 18 years that I worked for my predecessor, Congressman Sonny Callahan, I don't recall a single time where a constituent came up to me, not at a town meeting, not at a Rotary Club, Lion's Club, Kiwanis Club or the like, and somebody came up to me and said, Jo, old buddy, you know the Federal Government needs more money. Why don't you just take some of mine? 
   Nor have I had anyone come up and say, Congressman, there is not an ounce of waste in the Federal Government. Washington, DC, is a lean, well-oiled machine. You all could use a little bit more of my money. Here, take whatever you need. 
   Correct me if I am wrong, but I doubt the gentleman from the Fifth District of Texas has ever heard any of his constituents make the statement to him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BONNER. I thank the gentleman, and I know that he has done the math for his constituents in the Dallas area of Texas. I have done the math for people of south Alabama as well; and, if enacted, what the budget will mean to the average Alabama household is not good news. In fact, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there are approximately 4.4 million people who are proud to call Alabama their home. If this tax increase is enacted, it will mean that the average tax-paying Alabama household will owe another $2,500, $2,500. Friends, that is a lot of money to most folks back in my district in Alabama and I think in every district in America. 
   But if they have to write an additional check for $2,500 more to Uncle Sam, if this Democrat budget is enacted, then that likely means no braces for the kids. It means that you won't be able to set aside money this year for your children going off to college, and it certainly will mean there will be no family vacation. 
   Sadly, the Democratic majority must think either the Federal Government can spend the American people's hard-earned tax dollars better than they can, or that the Federal Government simply shouldn't be asked to make a sacrifice when there are so many worthy programs yet to fund. Either way, the Democratic majority is making quite a statement this week, a statement that I hope the American people will listen closely to as this debate unfolds. 
   You see, as my friend, Mr. Hensarling from Texas, knows all too well, as do my other Republican colleagues on the House Budget Committee, last week when the Democrats passed this budget out of committee, they had an opportunity some 32 different times, I have got the amendments in my hand, to accept some reasonable tax relief for the American people by putting into writing their commitment to not raise taxes. 
   Now, in fairness, Jeb, you will recall many of our Democratic colleagues on the committee, they were quick to say, well, wait a minute, we don't want to raise taxes, well, not all of them, at least not now. 
   But actions speak louder than words. Their actions, unfortunately, speak much louder than the lack of their words in that document. This is nothing short of the single largest tax increase on the American people. Quite frankly, it's a sad day for the American taxpayer. 
   Time after time, House Republicans on the Budget Committee tried to amend this budget with commonsense amendments that are overwhelmingly supported by the majority of the American people, amendments such as the one that our colleague, Congressman Jon Porter of Nevada, offered to prevent a tax increase on middle-income families with children. That went down on a party line vote by the Democratic majority. 
   The amendment by our friend, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, who offered to prevent an increase of the onerous and, I think, the most unAmerican of all taxes, the death tax that, if the Democratic majority doesn't do anything, will go back to 55 percent in just 4 short years. That amendment also went down on a party line vote by the Democratic majority. 
   Congressman Hensarling, you remember your amendment, you had many, but this one in particular, JEB, to dedicate funding to protect America's veterans. Did it pass?

   Mr. BONNER. Congressman Hensarling, I know there are others here tonight who want to speak out against this single largest tax increase of American history. I don't want to be accused of hogging microphone. 
   But, instead, I would like to close for my part by asking the American taxpayer a very simple question. Time after time our Democrat colleagues have come to this floor over the past few months and said the American people voted for change on November 7. It was all about change. Well, if this Democratic budget passes and if our taxes go up, and they most certainly will, then that is about all the American people are going to have left after these tax increases go up, is a little change. Is that really the message you were sending on November 7 of last year? 
   JEB, you have two beautiful children, Claire and Travis. Janee and I have two beautiful children back home in Mobile, Alabama. I hope they are all asleep right now, Lee and Robbins. This is really about the future of our children and grandchildren. There are a lot of good Democrats and a lot of good Republicans who have children and grandchildren who are concerned about them. This Democratic tax increase  and this Democratic budget is nothing about the children. Unfortunately, it's about the government. 
   I thank the gentleman for this special order, and I appreciate his leadership on fiscal responsibility.

<DOCNO>Mr. BONNER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BONNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin, our ranking member. 
   Either our friends on the other side of the aisle have a bad case of amnesia, or their selective memory is such that they need to check themselves into the House physician's office. 
   The Democratic majority likes to claim that when President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus, which we did. But because of those evil tax cuts, which let the record also show that many of our Democratic colleagues actually voted for, and some even still profess to support, that because of these dastardly tax cuts, all of the problems we are facing now are because of George Bush and the Republican Congress.     
   Mr. Chairman, our Democratic colleagues either have forgotten or they fail to acknowledge the fact that when President Bush came into office in January of 2001, he was walking into a recession left courtesy of the outgoing Clinton administration. A few months later, the dot-com bust and the corporate scandal made matters worse. And then remember September 11, 2001, and the ensuing costs associated with responding to the worst terrorist attack in American history and the additional costs associated with fighting the global war on terror. 
   I mention this, Mr. Chairman, because this budget is step one in the Democratic majority's plan to dismantle the tax policies that Republicans have put in place these past few years, policies that have actually worked, and replace it with the single largest tax increase in American history. 
   Do not take my word for it, Mr. Chairman. Consider the following: During the past 45 months the tax relief was enacted, 7.6 million new jobs have been created, an average of 168,000 per month; contrast that with the 27 months prior to the tax relief, where we lost 2.7 million jobs. 
   During the past 15 quarters since the tax relief was enacted, real GDP growth has averaged a robust 3.5 percent, faster than the averages of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In the nine quarters prior to the tax relief, actual GDP growth was just 1.1 percent. 
   Since the enactment of the tax relief, unemployment has fallen from 6.1 percent in June of 2003 to a near 5-year low of 4.5 percent. This is below the averages of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. 
   My friends in Alabama know a good economy when they see one. Our unemployment rate under the leadership of Republican Governor Bob Riley is just 3.3 percent, the lowest since we became a State in 1819. 
   Mr. Chairman, no one on our side is saying that we can continue the great economy or that everyone who has a job has the job they hope to retire from. 
   One thing is for certain. The Democratic majority had 32 opportunities last week in committee to vote on amendments that would have made these tax cuts permanent, 32 opportunities where they had an opportunity to vote for it, put it in writing, make it acceptable to the American people; and all 32 times they voted it down on a party-line vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I do not have a chart. I have a picture of America's children. These tax increases are going to result in Alabama alone of an increase of $2,500 for the average working, tax-paying family. That means no braces, no college education fund, no family vacation. That is what this budget is about, our children. 
   And I thank the gentleman.

<DOCNO>Mr. BONNER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues and certainly the people from my home in south Alabama know, I do not often come to this floor, either to hear my own voice or to offer some prophetic words of wisdom on whatever the topic of the day happens to be. 
   My father often taught me that you learn a lot more from listening than you do from talking. So in many ways, that is what I have been doing the past few days, listening to my colleagues and thinking about the consequences of the words that we are debating. 
   After a lot of listening to a lot of words, however, I find myself compelled to come and say in the most direct way I know that I am opposed to this nonbinding resolution. Let me say that again for that is, after all, what we are talking about. This is a nonbinding resolution. It is nothing more than a few words on a piece of paper, and yet they are powerful words that have the potential of being demoralizing and possibly even destructive. 
   Make no mistake that the resolution we are debating today does not have the force of law behind it. So for those of you who are watching at home, let us be clear. At a time when the President recognizes that the situation in Iraq is unacceptable and it is clear that we need to change our strategy, this resolution will not stop the deployment of a single soldier or marine to Iraq, nor will it bring a single soldier or marine home to their families or loved ones. 
   More importantly, this resolution does not offer any alternative strategy. Nothing. Zip. It is silent with regard to our country's ongoing efforts in fighting the global war on terror. Instead, it is simply and unfortunately a method by which the House Democratic majority is seeking to send a message to the President of the United States. 
   But let us not kid ourselves. The words spoken in this Chamber this week will travel much farther than the distance between this building, the Capitol, and where the President lives, the White House. In reality, these words will travel far beyond our shores, across the globe to the 140,000 men and women who are currently deployed in Iraq and engaged in but one part, admittedly an important part, of the global war on terror and the Islamic militant extremists we are fighting. 
   I know we have heard Democrat after Democrat and a few Republicans, to be fair, come to this floor and say, we support our troops and we support this resolution; but with all due respect, I find it totally inconsistent to say you support our troops and at the same time you support this resolution. 
   How can we really expect our soldiers to have the will to succeed when this body as a whole does not have the resolve to stand by them and their mission? Do we think our troops do not listen to what is being said here in Washington and around the country? During my visits to Iraq, I found just the opposite to be the case. 
   So while the underlying message of this resolution is intended for the President, it is only logical to ask who else might be listening. What about the families of these soldiers who are anxiously awaiting their safe return home. Make no mistake, they will hear this message loud and clear. 
   And then there is the very real chance that the families of the thousands of Alabama National Guard members who have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the families of all active and Reserve forces, will read the glaring subtext of this resolution and hear the people's House signaling that we will not be able to prevail in Iraq, the cause is lost, and their loved one's sacrifice is for naught.     
   Unfortunately, the words of this resolution will also travel to the ears of our enemies. And what could be better news for our enemies than that America is divided, an America that does not have the will to succeed. 
   On this topic, let's look to the man who knows the enemy in Iraq better than anyone, General David Petraeus. You remember General Petraeus; he just received an overwhelming vote of confidence when he was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate to command our forces in Iraq. At his confirmation hearing, General Petraeus was asked if a congressional resolution disapproving the deployment of additional troops would encourage the enemy. His response was direct and unequivocal. ``That is correct, sir.'' 
   Let me say that again. General Petraeus, our commander in the ground on Iraq, believes that a resolution disapproving the deployment of additional troops, which is what we are debating today, will encourage our enemy. 
   He went on to say that this is a test of wills, and at the end of the day a commander in such an endeavor would obviously like the enemy to feel that there is no hope. But instead of saying there is no hope to the enemy, we are saying there is no hope to the American soldier and the American people. 
   Let's not forget that our words as well as our actions do have consequences. Vote ``no'' on this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. BONNER. (RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE BUD CRAMER AND THE HONORABLE TERRY EVERETT ON THEIR RETIREMENT FROM CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, as the American people are sitting home tonight watching the President of the United States talking about the state of our economy with so many uncertain questions that are out there about so many different issues, this is a time where the House has completed its work that gives us an opportunity to show the American people how, at least in the State of Alabama, Republicans and Democrats have over the years worked together hand in hand with a love of country at heart to try to make our State, our communities and certainly our great country a better place. And tonight I am privileged to lead this special order which will not take the entire hour but will give some of our colleagues an opportunity to recognize the significant contributions of two such Members, two men who didn't come to Congress at the same time, but who came within a term of each other, and who have, with different life backgrounds, made a substantial contribution to the betterment of their district, the State that they grew up in and love, and certainly this wonderful Nation. And I'm referring to two men of different political paths and different political parties, but two men who have universal respect here in the House of Representatives, Bud Cramer of the Fifth Congressional District of Alabama and Terry Everett of the Second Congressional District. 
   Earlier this year, Congressman Cramer surprised his constituents and really people throughout this city and our Nation's capital that he would be leaving Congress after 18 remarkable years of dedicated service to the people of Huntsville and his district, the Fifth Congressional District in north Alabama. And I think it was actually this time last year when Congressman Terry Everett surprised the people in the Second Congressional District that he too was going to be calling it quits after 16 wonderful years of dedicated service to the people of Alabama's Wiregrass community. 
   Joining me tonight will be some colleagues who know these Members intimately well. And so I will be privileged to recognize them in just a moment and let them say a few words of thanks on behalf of the American people to these two giant legislative leaders and their dedicated service. 
   I also have some statements for the Record, Mr. Speaker, that I would like to enter, because as the night has drawn on and Members have had other obligations, they have not been able to actually be here for some of these comments. But I would like to enter one in particular at this moment from my colleague, Congressman Robert Aderholt, of Alabama's Fourth Congressional District. 
   Of Terry Everett, Robert Aderholt said, ``we value very highly Representative Everett's service and his work with our delegation over the course of his distinguished career. John Quincy Adams once said, if your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you're a leader. Terry Everett is the type of leader that embodies this quote. His actions have inspired many Alabamians to dream more and to learn more. And I am pleased for his great contribution to our State. As Terry leaves this institution at the conclusion of this 110th Congress and goes on to other endeavors, we wish him the very best of luck and ask God's blessings on him and his wife, Barbara, for many years to come.'' 
   And Robert also serves next door to Congressman Cramer. And he asked me as well if I would take just a moment to mention the following about his friend and neighbor, Congressman Bud Cramer. ``Even though Bud and I are members of different political parties, we have cosponsored over 50 bills in this congressional session alone. We've not always agreed on every issue that has come before the House, but I have always respected him and his leadership no matter what the issue has been. Congressman Bud Cramer has served his district and our State well. And it is my pleasure to have worked alongside him for 12 years. He has been a great partner in working on issues for north Alabama. As Bud leaves this institution, he leaves behind friends on both sides of the aisle. Regardless of the path he chooses, he leaves this institution a better place. And I look forward to watching his successes along the way.'' 
   And also, Robert added ``may God bless Bud in all of his endeavors, and we wish him all the best that he looks forward to doing.'' 
   Now I'm very pleased to recognize for a few minutes my distinguished friend from California, the former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the current ranking Republican on that committee, Honorable Duncan Hunter, who has known Congressman Terry Everett for every year that Terry has been in Congress. And I would be honored to yield as much time as my friend, Duncan Hunter, might choose to consume.

<DOCNO>Mr. BONNER. (RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE BUD CRAMER AND THE HONORABLE TERRY EVERETT ON THEIR RETIREMENT FROM CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BONNER. As this evening continues to unfold, we have heard from so many colleagues from all over the country who are paying homage tonight to Congressman Bud Cramer and Congressman Terry Everett. 
   Congressman John Tanner, one of Bud's closest friends and colleague and one of the leaders in the Blue Dog Coalition asked me, because of a last minute conflict, to enter the following statement. 
   ``Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join our colleagues tonight in paying tribute to my friend Congressman Bud Cramer, who, as you know, will retire later this year after representing Alabama in this body for 18 years. During this time, he has been an important leader in Congress and an excellent public servant for the American people. 
   ``Several years ago, Bud and I, along with a handful of our other Democratic colleagues, formed a small group to fill what we saw as a void within the body at the time, a solution-oriented coalition of moderate Members who could help forge a bipartisan bridge between our colleagues on either side of the partisan aisle. That group was named the Blue Dog Coalition, to which we both still belong. 
   ``I appreciate Bud's leadership on working on bipartisan solutions to the challenges facing our country. A military veteran, grandfather and children's advocate, Bud has dedicated much of his life to his country and helping others. 
   ``Mr. Speaker, Bud Cramer's dedication and commitment have served our country well, and his presence in this Chamber will be sorely missed.'' 
   That comment and so many others from our colleagues in Alabama, Congressman Artur Davis, Congressman Spencer Bachus, Congressman Mike Rogers. I have already mentioned Congressman Aderholt could not be here because of a last minute conflict, but asked his statement to be entered into the record. 
   Friends of Terry Everett and Bud Cramer, Lincoln Davis of Tennessee, Bart Gordon, the distinguished chairman of the Science Committee, Gene Taylor, my neighbor along America's Gulf Coast, so many people from both sides of the aisle and all political stripes who are opening up their heart tonight saying thank you for the leadership that these two outstanding gentleman have provided. 
   Mr. Speaker, without objection, I would like to enter an article on each of these two gentlemen in the Congressional Record. 
   On July 27th, shortly after Congressman Cramer announced his intentions to resign at the end of this session of Congress, The Huntsville Times, Congressman Cramer's hometown newspaper, ran a series of articles about the outstanding, dedicated leadership and service that Bud Cramer has provided. 
   So without objection, I would like to enter this into the Congressional Record. 
   Likewise, on October 1, 2007, and then a few months later in the Dothan Magazine, the first being the Montgomery Advertiser, the capital city newspaper, there were editorials and articles alike praising Terry Everett for his solid performance as an outstanding leader of Congress and an outstanding leader for Alabama. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter both of these as well.  
   Everett Has Been Solid Performer 
   Residents of Alabama's Second Congressional District--which includes all of Autauga and Elmore counties and a portion of Montgomery County--aren't prone to frequent changes in the representative they send to Washington. A new representative has been elected just twice in 44 years. 
   Bill Dickinson won the seat in 1964, the year of the fabled ``Goldwater sweep'' that saw five Republicans elected to Congress from Alabama, something that would have been unimaginable only a few years before. He held the seat until 1992, usually with ease, fending off only a handful of significant challenges over the years. 
   Dickinson retired from Congress that year and the Second District, to the surprise of many observers, turned to Terry Everett over two better-known candidates. Its voters have elected him every two years since and likely would continue doing so for some time to come. 
   But they won't have the chance. Everett announced last week that he would not seek another term in the House in 2008. At 70, he said he was looking forward to returning to his farm in Rehobeth. 
   The announcement set off a flurry of speculation and exploration. Chances to run for an open congressional seat are rare, so there surely will be no shortage of candidates next year in a district that covers the Wiregrass area of southeast Alabama, then curls upward to reach into Montgomery County. 
   There will be ample opportunity to consider those candidacies in next year's campaigns. For now, Everett's tenure in office deserves some reflection by those he has represented since 1992. 
   Everett, who previously owned a string of small newspapers, was not exactly a household name when he began his bid for the seat. Nor was he--nor did he ever become--a scintillating campaigner. For those looking for a candidate to ignite an audience or light up a room, Everett was never the guy. 
   Yet Second District voters liked Everett from the start. Something in his low-key, receptive manner and steadfast common-sense conservatism resonated with them. He defeated state Sen. Larry Dixon of Montgomery, long considered a likely successor to Dickinson, in the Republican primary and state Treasurer George Wallace Jr., then a Democrat, in the general election. 
   He would have opposition in future races, but never any opponent of similar stature. 
   Everett understood well the concerns of his district, where military and agricultural issues are especially important. He was a consistent supporter of the major military installations in the district, Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in Montgomery and Fort Rucker near Ozark. Farmers had a reliable advocate in Washington as well. 
   A subcommittee Everett chaired uncovered and addressed serious abuses in health care facilities for veterans. He served for years on the House Intelligence Committee and is now the ranking minority member. He observed wryly in an interview with The Associated Press that ``some of the most important work I've done I can't talk about because it was on the Intelligence Committee.'' 
   Everett has served the district and the nation well. It should be noted that he's not leaving office right away. Indeed, he'll be there for more than a year. We are confident that he will continue his steady, conscientious representation during that time before entering an honorable and well-earned retirement from public life.   
   Staunch Support for Defense, Space a Hallmark 
   Over his 18 years in Washington, D.C., U.S. Rep. Bud Cramer says his connection to defense, NASA and the Space Station has been huge. 
   ``In the early years, I had constant battles in defending the Space Station and with protecting NASA,'' Cramer says. ``We won those battles, but it took going member to member asking for votes. It meant building support to preserve the station. One of those victories was won by one vote.'' 
   In defense, early issues with the Redstone Arsenal arose with the base military realignment--or BRAC-rounds. The congressman says he immediately sought to tell the ``Redstone story,'' often by showing its cooperatives with BRAC. 
   Cramer also says there were a host of other developments, like a weather station with NexRad radar. When the National Weather Service intended to close its Huntsville office, the congressman sought legislation to keep it open. After a decade of uncertainty, Cramer helped secure $3 million in startup money for a full service weather forecast office to be located in the National Space Science and Technology Center building on the University of Alabama campus in Huntsville to serve an 11-county area. 
   After a four-year battle, the congressman got the National Weather Service to drop its plan to eliminate radar in Huntsville. The radar was kept and Doppler radar was added. 
   Huntsville Mayor Loretta Spencer says, ``Without question, Congressman Cramer has been a stalwart in assisting the growth of the Army and NASA in Huntsville. By be-  ginning and continuing the National Children's Advocacy Center in Huntsville, Bud continues to bring positive recognition for our city.'' 
   Cramer was elected to Congress in 1990 after serving 10 years as Madison County's district attorney. He was re-elected to Congress eight times and is a strong children's advocate, having founded the National Children's Advocacy Center. In North Alabama, the congressman's support for defense and aerospace industries is well-known. Part of his economic development efforts is the Boeing Company rocket plant. 
   In the House of Representatives, Cramer is known as a tireless supporter of the Space Station and a leading advocate for spending increases in missile defense, particularly with Huntsville long being a center for research and development for both. Redstone Arsenal is located in the Fifth District, as well as the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. 
   In 2002, when Cramer joined officials in breaking ground for the world-class Propulsion Research Laboratory at Marshall Space Flight Center, he commented on it representing fortitude. 
   ``The groundbreaking today represents years of hard work by many people who are dedicated to making sure Marshall continues to be the leading center for propulsion research in the country. Securing funding for this world-class research lab was one of my top priorities, and I was pleased to help lead our Alabama delegation's efforts to make it a reality. With this new facility, Marshall Space Flight Center will be well-positioned to play a significant role in the future of NASA.'' 
   Cramer worked to secure funding for the laboratory, including $10 million for design and research equipment, and another $20 million for construction. The facility's research will aid advanced nuclear technology, alternate- and combined-cycle engines, high-energy plasma engines, beamed-energy sails and antimatter propulsion systems. 
   Building on the Huntsville area's high-tech growth, the congressman called the area ``a natural place'' for the laboratory and a fundamental move toward maintaining North Alabama's excellence in propulsion. 
   Two years later, when Cramer helped NASA officials cut the ribbon at the laboratory, he also praised Sen. Richard Shelby for his support for the lab. 
   ``Since our space program's earliest days, North Alabama has been a center of space propulsion expertise,'' he said. ``With this new lab, the world-class propulsion experts right here in North Alabama will be better prepared to tackle the propulsion challenges facing NASA and the new Vision for Space Exploration.'' 
   In June, Cramer continued his support of NASA with the House of Representatives passage of the NASA Authorization for fiscal year 2009. It authorizes $1.2 billion for programs and an additional $1 billion for research and development of space exploration vehicles, including the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and the Ares 1 Crew Launch Vehicle, which are being designed to replace the space shuttle. 
   ``I am proud to support NASA and all of its field centers, including North Alabama's Marshall Space Flight Center,'' Cramer said. ``The authorization bill passed by the House today gives NASA the resources it needs to sustain programs and research initiatives that are critical to keeping America at the forefront of space exploration. In North Alabama, our space community is poised to continue its major role in NASA's vision.'' 
   Cramer serves on the House Appropriations Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The Appropriations Committee is in charge of spending for all aspects of the federal government, including the U.S. Department of Defense and NASA. Many of the critical jobs performed by these two agencies are based in North Alabama. Cramer was appointed to the House Intelligence Committee in 2002, which oversees defense and national security intelligence issues. 
   The congressman has been a strong, active supporter of the space program. As one of NASA's top allies in Congress, he fought for Huntsville's NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and programs like the U.S. Space Station. For his outstanding record of support for space exploration, Cramer received the National Space Club's 2002 Von Braun Memorial Award for Space Exploration.

   Mr. BONNER. Now, while I know others would like to speak, I think it is appropriate to pause and dedicate the balance of our time to recognizing these two outstanding individuals, outstanding public servants, sons of Alabama. 
   Interestingly enough, they both serve on the Intelligence Committee. Bud had become a leader in the defense world on the appropriations side. Terry has been a leader in the defense world on the authorization side. 
   Ironically, but probably not coincidentally, they both came to Congress having served their communities as Sunday school teachers and long-time community advocates. 
   So for the balance of this time, I would like to yield first to my friend Congressman Bud Cramer, the dean of our delegation, and then to Congressman Everett.

   Mr. BONNER. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say thank you for allowing us to have this opportunity on behalf of the 433 other Members of Congress who are not here in person but who tonight, in some form or fashion, have expressed their love, their appreciation and their respect for the dedicated service of Bud Cramer and of Terry Everett. 
   In closing, I just want to tell the people who might be listening in Kansas or in Wisconsin or in Florida or in California that this is an example of the best of America, of the best of two men who grew up in different times but in the same State, who came to Congress 2 years apart and who worked their hearts out to make their country a better place. 
   As the son of an Alabama sharecropper and railroad foreman, Terry Everett knew hard times from the day he was born, never leaving his home area of Dothan and Midland City until he joined the Army following high school. He learned Russian. He served as an intelligence analyst in Europe. After his military service, he came back to his beloved Dothan and worked as a sports reporter. He then covered the police beat for the Dothan Eagle, eventually becoming a newspaper editor and publisher and eventually becoming an owner of several newspapers in southwest Alabama. 
   Terry, on behalf of the people in Autauga, Barbour, Bullock, Butler, Coffee, Conecuh, Covington, Crenshaw, Dale, Elmore, Geneva, Henry, Houston, Lowndes, Montgomery, and Pike Counties--635,000 people who have benefited from your 16 years of dedicated service--a heartfelt thanks for what you have done and for what you continue to do. 
   Certainly, without equal, Bud Cramer was named just a few years ago by Money Magazine as one of America's best Congressmen. What a tribute and what a true statement at that. 
   For a remarkable career, the people of Colbert, Jackson, Lauderdale, Limestone, Madison, Lawrence, and Morgan Counties owe a debt of gratitude for your outstanding 18 years of service, Bud. 
   As the editorial staff of the Huntsville Times said it best, your record has been nothing short of remarkable. 
   The Times Daily went on to say that he has shown that he can represent the people of his district while always considering the best interest of his Nation. 
   These are two outstanding men who will leave Congress at the end of this session, but they will leave a lifetime of service. 
   Bud, especially for you, in the area of child advocacy, you certainly are the national leader in that area.
