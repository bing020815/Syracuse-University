<DOCNO>Mr. ADERHOLT. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of Congressman Space's amendment, which is of course funding for the ARC, Appalachian Regional Commission, in this year's Energy and Water appropriations bill. 
   Many Americans may not be aware that this was a program that was established back in 1965. ARC was created to address the persistent poverty and the growing economic despair of the Appalachian region, which is an area that extends from southern New York to northeast Mississippi. At that time in 1965, one out of every three Appalachians lived in poverty. Per capita income was 23 percent lower than the U.S. average, and high unemployment and harsh living conditions had, in the 1950s, forced more than 2 million people in that area to leave their homes and seek work in other regions. 
   Even today, ongoing changes in declining sectors of the economy, such as  manufacturing and textiles, exacerbated by globalization, changes in technology, and the recent downturn in the economy have hit this region very, very hard. It has threatened to reverse a lot of the economic gains that were made in these communities over the past several years. For an area that has suffered economically for so long, we can't allow this to happen. 
   By funding the ARC at least at last year's level, $65 million, we will ensure that the people and the businesses of Appalachia have the knowledge, have the skills and the access to telecommunications and the technology to compete in a technology-based economy. 
   As has been mentioned here by Congressman Space, this restoration of funds will be offset by $30 million for the Department of Energy's administrative account. ARC has been a responsible steward for the Federal funds that it has received over the past several years. For example, in fiscal year 2006, across all investment areas each dollar of ARC funding was matched by $3.14 in non-ARC public project funding, and each ARC dollar invested leveraged $11.55 in private investment in ARC projects over time. 
   The 410-county region still faces a complex set of issues. However, this program has made a difference, and we are seeing results. 
   Over the last 10 years, funding for the ARC has remained level at $65 million. And the region continues to receive less Federal assistance per capita than the rest of the country. Additionally, in the past, the House of Representatives has voted to authorize the ARC levels at the higher level of $65 million. 
   I would like to thank Congressman Space for his assistance in this program, and also Chairman Visclosky for his attention to this matter.

<DOCNO>Mr. ADERHOLT. (COLONEL OLA LEE MIZE VETERANS CLINIC -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member for their support of this piece of legislation. And of course as it has been said, we're here today to honor Ola Lee Mize by naming the veterans clinic in Gadsden, Alabama after him. Col. Mize was a soldier in the United States Army during the Korean war. And as has already been mentioned, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on June 10 and 11, 1953. 
   Most people may be surprised to learn that just over 100 recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor are alive today. And only one of them lives in Alabama. And I'm honored that Ola Lee Mize resides in the district I represent, which is the Fourth District of Alabama. 
   Ola Lee Mize was the son of an Alabama sharecropper. He dropped out of school in 1946 after the ninth grade. And he did that so that he could take care of his mother, his brothers and his sisters. A few years later he decided he could do better. So he left a job that was paying $15 a week and then enlisted in the United States Army. 
   However, when he went to apply to the Army, he was rejected because he weighed only 120 pounds. But he was persistent, and recruiters finally let him enlist. Mize's military career  would see him courageously rise to the high ranking position of colonel after the humble beginnings of a young high school drop-out who was once rejected by the Army. 
   Col. Mize's story is a great example to all Americans who aspire to great things in the face of challenges. The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States Government. It is bestowed on a member of the United States Armed Forces who risk their life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States. Col. Mize exemplifies this. And I think it is appropriate and fitting that he be honored again by the naming of this clinic in Gadsden, Alabama. 
   Colonel Ola Mize earned his Medal of Honor when he was a sergeant for the U.S. Army with Company K of the 15th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. 
   During one particular battle in the Korean war, his company was committed to the defense of an outpost in the southern region of what is now South Korea. And at the time, the Chinese were under heavy attack of the area.     
   With all the company's officers dead or wounded, Mize worked to establish a defensive position while dragging wounded into the shelters made by timbers pulled from American bunkers destroyed by enemy fire. Over the next several hours, he assembled an impromptu patrol that went from bunker to bunker firing out of the open spaces in an effort to make the Chinese believe that they were still opposed by a vigorous force. 
   American counterattack forces reached Mize's position about noon on the 11th day of June, and after helping to resecure the outpost, Mize got permission to take his wounded men back to American lines. Upon reaching friendly territory, Mize, the regimental commander and the division commander, were all standing together. The two commanders did not recognize Mize, whose uniform at the time was in tatters, his flight jacket smoking, and his face badly swollen from burns. ``Who are you,'' demanded the regimental commanders? ``Sergeant Mize,'' he answered. ``You're not Mize,'' the commander responded. ``He's dead.'' 
   His Medal of Honor citation states that Sergeant Mize's valorous conduct and unflinching courage reflect lasting glory upon himself and upon the noble traditions of military service. 
   Several months later, informed that he would receive the Medal of Honor, Mize told the commanding officers that he didn't want it because it really should go to the entire platoon. Reluctantly, he was flown back to the United States so he could attend a ceremony in Denver, Colorado. He was decorated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on September 7, 1954. In the early 1960s, Ola Mize joined the Special Forces and did three tours in Vietnam. He retired as colonel in 1981. 
   Ola Mize is a great soldier that has served our country with bravery and class, and it is my pleasure today to offer this resolution in his honor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in mourning the loss of one of our own, it's been mentioned here tonight, Representative Jo Ann Davis. Representative Davis, as has been said and as we have discussed tonight, battled cancer for several years, and of course, as we know, lost her battle Saturday morning. 
   At a time when others would have considered retirement, Jo Ann Davis continued to represent the people of the First District of Virginia with distinction. Through her service she set an example of courage in the face of adversity. She refused to allow a disease that afflicts far too many affect her life and take her away from the work that she loved so dearly. 
   As the first female elected to the House of Representatives from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Jo Ann was a leader and example to all of us. But of all of Jo Ann's accomplishments, of all the roles she played, she would not be ashamed to tell you that her decision to follow Jesus Christ was the most important decision for her. 
   The people of Virginia were privileged to have known her as a public servant. The Members of this Congress were honored to share her as a colleague. I was honored to consider her a friend. 
   Our thoughts and prayers are with her husband, Chuck; her sons, Charlie and Chris; along with her granddaughter, Charlotte. May God give each of them an extra measure of peace during this time.

   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in remembering one of our own, Paul Gillmor. It is moments like this that you realize the fleeting nature of time. Indeed, we truly realize the shortness of time and the greatness of eternity. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his friends and all of the people that he touched during the time he was on this Earth. 
   Representative Gillmor was a friend. He was a gentleman who I had the pleasure of getting to know as a neighbor. Because we lived across the street from each other at one time, there were several occasions that we shared a ride home after a long night of votes. During those times, I was able to gain a small measure of the man and discovered him to be generous, kind, and, above all, considerate. 
   The people of Ohio were privileged to have known him as a public servant. The Members of Congress were honored to share him as a colleague. His friends were rewarded with his company, and his family was embraced by his love. 
   We will miss Paul and remember our time with him and honor his memory. May God give Karen and his children an extra measure of grace during this most difficult time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ADERHOLT. (AMERICAN RELIGIOUS HISTORY WEEK -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank my colleagues for taking time to call attention to this topic that we have been discussing tonight. And certainly from the very beginning of our history in this Nation, religious expression and faith was the norm amongst conversations that our Founding Fathers had. 
   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes) along with several of my colleagues tonight pointed out that as we stand here tonight in this Chamber that as we look around the room and we see the reliefs under the ceiling of the Chamber, and we see the 23 different lawgivers that are depicted above the gallery doorways, the most prominent relief, of course, has been noted is that of Moses who handed down the Ten Commandments. And of course those Ten Commandments were handed down to the children of Israel from God Himself. 
   Furthermore, it has been noted here tonight that ``In God We Trust'' is above the Speaker's chair, as it is our national motto. And of course let's not forget that as we started the legislative day today, before we voted on the legislation just a couple of hours ago, a chaplain said a prayer that began the legislative day. And of course that has been the custom dating back to the days of our Founding Fathers. 
   The Founding Fathers no doubt believed that God had His Almighty hand in the founding and the building of this Nation. George Washington himself believed that America's independence from Britain ultimately depended on God and not man. I find it interesting that it is not unusual for the Founding Fathers when they dated documents at that time they would use the phrase ``in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ 1776'' of what the date may have been. 
   A few months ago, I was walking down the stairways just outside of the House Chamber, and one of the paintings that is above the stairways is the ``Signing of the Constitution.'' And I have passed by that painting hundreds of times. Of course, most Americans are very familiar with that famous painting. But for some reason, one thing caught my eye that was not usually the case, and I noticed there was an open book there near where the presiding officer was over the signers of the Constitution. And I took a closer look and noticed that it was an open book. And at the top it said ``Saint Matthew.'' And certainly I don't think it is any coincidence that that book was open on that particular day. 
   One may ask why our Founding Fathers were so concerned about this issue. And one reason I believe that they were so focused on this issue and thought it was so important is because they had this radical belief that we are all endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. And this was indeed a radical concept in the time, because in England your rights were granted to you by the king. Therefore, if the king or the queen granted your rights, or if man granted your rights, then the king or the queen or the man could take those rights away. However, if God granted those rights, no person, be he king or queen, could take them away. They were a gift of God. 
   So when one asks the importance of religious history and faith in America, one can point to many reasons. And one reason that we can point back to is that in the United States of America, rights are granted by God and not by man.

<DOCNO>Mr. ADERHOLT. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I would like to reference two positive programs within this Homeland Security Appropriations bill that are making a difference in the 4th District of Alabama. 
   For several years, Congress has included funding in this bill for local Assistance to Firefighters Grants. The purpose of this grant program is to award grants directly to fire departments and nonaffiliated emergency medical service organizations. These awards aim to enhance our first responder's ability to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as that of first-responder personnel, with respect to fire-related hazards. Using a competitive process overseen by fire service subject matter experts, DHS awards grants to applicants whose requests best address the priorities of the program. 
   This is especially important in the district that I represent in North Alabama. 
   As a rural area, North Alabama is home to many volunteer fire departments and rescue squads. These people work hard to protect their communities and provide first rate care of their neighbors. Unfortunately in too many instances they are forced to do so with older equipment that doesn't provide the proper safety or performance that they need to do their jobs. This problem isn't for lack of care; it's in large measure due to a lack of funding. The Fire Grant program has proven to be a tremendous asset that has helped meet the needs of the fire departments and EMS organizations that I represent. 
   I am pleased that this important program has received increased funding this year. That means that more organizations will be able to participate and upgrade equipment and training that they might otherwise have been unable to do. As a result they will be better prepared to save lives, protect homes and businesses and continue to serve their communities in a meaningful way. 
   I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their support of another important program within Homeland Security, textile transshipment enforcement. As a district with a heavy textile manufacturing presence, I am very aware of the problems faced by this important industry. 
   Today foreign manufacturers are utilizing unnatural and unfair business practices that are hurting U.S. textile manufacturers. One such scheme involves the transshipment of goods to evade duty or quotas on textiles being brought into the country. Over the last several years, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, CBP, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been very successful in stopping many of these illegal textile transshipments. 
   In 2006, Customs announced that they seized more than $100 million in wearing apparel and textile goods that were misrepresented, smuggled or illegally transshipped in an effort to circumvent U.S. textile trade laws and regulations. Of that amount, $3 million worth of socks were confiscated. This program is making a difference and giving U.S. textile manufacturers an opportunity to compete. I fully support this funding and am pleased that this Congress continues to recognize its importance.

   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our guest chaplain, Dr. Billy Franklin Hudgins. Dr. Hudgins has served selflessly as a pastor in Louisiana, South Carolina, and now in the district I represent in Alabama where he's the senior pastor of Cross Creek Community Church of Hokes Bluff, Alabama. 
   In addition to pastoral work, Dr. Hudgins has also been very involved with both State and national church leadership organizations. Among the honors he's received, he's served as president of the Alabama Baptist Convention Pastors Conference. He also served as trustee of the International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. 
   Dr. Hudgins has been a teacher and a coach over the course of his career. He has spent 5 years as a bi-vocational pastor and 35 years in churches belonging to the Southern Baptist Convention. If that wasn't enough, at a time when others look toward retirement, at the age of 60, Dr. Bill Hudgins helped start the church he currently serves in Hokes Bluff. 
   Dr. Hudgins is joined in Washington today by his wife, Connie, with whom he'll be celebrating 46 years of marriage in a matter of weeks. I'm honored to welcome Dr. Billy Hudgins as our guest here in the United States House of Representatives this morning as someone who is a servant and has spent his career as a follower of Jesus, and one who has helped others do the same along life's way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my opposition to the expansion of Federal funding of embryonic stem cell research that is represented by this bill, H.R. 3. 
   This bill unnecessarily opens the door to research that sacrifices one life for the potential health of another. I will never believe that this is a fair and equitable trade, especially when there are other avenues of research that are available. 
   On its own, stem cell research is a worthy pursuit to help solve many of today's medical mysteries, but a line must be drawn when this research destroys human life, as in the case of embryonic stem cell research. 
   There are ethical stem cell alternatives which no one objects to, and they are flourishing. In fact, as of today, and it has already been noted here on the floor, stem cells from noncontroversial sources, like umbilical cord, have been used to treat humans suffering from more than 70 different afflictions. 
   In debating this issue, we need to be clear on the facts, and I would urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and respect the sanctity of human life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate, pay tribute, and honor a great jurist who has served on the bench for over 40 years in his home State of Alabama. 
   Born on December 6, 1935, to Ruby and Jesse Clifton, he grew up in Winston County, Alabama, and graduated from Haleyville High School in 1954. He pursued his undergraduate degree at Birmingham-Southern College. Thereafter, he attended the Cumberland School of Law in Lebanon, Tennessee, and obtained his law degree from the University of Alabama School of Law. 
   As a young attorney, he joined the faculty at the Cumberland School of Law, which by that time had moved from Lebanon, Tennessee, to Birmingham, Alabama, which is known today as Samford University. It was during this time that he authored, along with Professor Sam B. Gilreath, Caruther's ``History of a Lawsuit,'' eighth edition. 
   In 1958, he married his high school sweetheart, Mary Frances Brown, and they have been married for over 48 years. They have one son, who is married to the former Caroline McDonald and, two grandchildren, Mary Elliott and Robert Hayes. 
   In 1962, he began serving as judge of the Court of Law and Equity in Winston County and served there until 1973. Then in 1977, he took office as one of two judges serving the 25th Judicial Circuit in the Alabama court system and has remained on the bench for 30 years. 
   He has served the public for more than 40 years and has presided over each case that has come before him with integrity and with impartiality. He is someone who has a brilliant legal mind; but most important, he has compassion for all individuals, regardless of their background or their social standing. 
   He is a man of faith, prayer, and integrity, who has a great love for his family, his country and his God. He has taken his job seriously from the first day he stepped up to the bench to preside. In addition to his responsibilities on the bench, he has been a businessman and has pastored Fairview Congregational Church in Hackleburg, Alabama, for over 40 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know all these things to be true about this individual and his character and his reputation because I personally observed him. Many times Members don't always have that kind of perspective when they come to the floor. I can say these things in all truthfulness as I stand here on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives because this man, the judge I am talking about, Bobby Aderholt, is my dad.

   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to call attention to this, the first Thursday in May, as the National Day of Prayer. The 56th annual National Day of Prayer is being recognized today, May 3, across our great Nation in tens of thousands of ceremonies and services nationwide. 
   The National Day of Prayer traces its history back to 1775, when the Continental Congress asked the colonies to pray for wisdom in forming a Nation. In 1952, a joint resolution of Congress was signed into law by President Truman. In 1988, President Reagan signed a law permanently marking the first Thursday of every May as the National Day of Prayer. 
   As in previous years, President George W. Bush signed a proclamation regarding the 2007 observance. He specifically asked that the Nation remember in their prayers the members of our Armed Forces, their families, as well as the students and families affected by the recent tragedy at Virginia Tech. 
   Chairman Shirley Dobson and Vice Chairman Brian Toon have done an outstanding job in coordinating these events that will take place across this land. Dr. Charles Swindoll will serve as Honorary Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, across the street, here on Capitol Hill in the Cannon House Office Building at noon is when the events will begin. However, whether you're in Washington, D.C., you're in Alabama, North Dakota, I encourage the American people to come together in the spirit of Jesus and take a few minutes to thank God for the blessings upon this Nation, and ask Him to guide and protect us in the days to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. ADERHOLT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, today is a day that we will look back on and know that fundamental decisions regarding our Nation's history were made. 
   The discussions that we are engaged in will go a long way in determining our future in the ongoing global war on terror and Iraq's role in that fight. When this vote is cast on the non-binding, Democratic resolution, we will be sending a message to the world. The only question remaining is what message will we send? 
   Will we say that America remains steadfast against the rising tide of hate and intolerance offered by militant Islamists? Will we say that we don't have the stomach to finish the fight against terrorists who actively seek to kill us and destroy our way of life? 
   The war in Iraq has become such a flashpoint that we struggle to separate the politics of the situation from the reality. The politics attacks the intelligence that led us to war, questions our Nation's elected leadership, and condemns the decisions made along the way. It leads to the resolution that we now have before us. The reality recognizes that we are at war now and our troops are putting their lives on the line each and every day. It says that if this is a fight that we believe in, a fight against global terrorism, we must do everything possible to support the men and women who are carrying it out on our behalf and never giving a hint to the contrary. 
   Unfortunately we are at a point today where some have forgotten exactly who and what we are fighting. 
   Prior to 9/11, we failed to understand the hate of people like Osama bin Laden and what could result from it despite all evidence to the contrary. In 1979, 66 American diplomats were held hostage in Iran for 444 days; in 1983, 241 Marines were killed in Beirut when their barracks was attacked; militant Islamic terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in 1993; 225 people were killed in attacks  on U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998; and, in 2000, 17 American sailors were killed when al-Qaeda attacked the U.S.S. Cole. 
   Today we are at a historic crossroads: we either boldly tackle the issue of militant Islam that exists on the Iraqi front and is part of this world-wide struggle, applying the lessons we have learned from the years leading up to 9/11, or we approach the issue as we naively demonstrated before 9/11 and expect more attacks and more American deaths. 
   The war in Iraq has gone on longer than any of us would have wished. We've seen too many funerals for too many sons and daughters, husbands and wives. To all those who have lost a friend or loved one, our hearts go out to you. 
   It should be noted that mistakes have been made, of that there can be no doubt. We must know without question what led us to this point, and that time will come. But now is not that time. Not while we still have American service men and women in harm's way. History will play its part, teaching us our mistakes and urging us not to repeat them. But we don't have the luxury of waiting on history to pass its judgment. 
   Without resolve, it is certain we will fail in Iraq and there will be far-reaching consequences for our Nation, the region and ultimately the world. Since September 11, there have been major terrorist attacks in Karachi, Bali, Moscow, Casablanca, Riyadh, Istanbul, Madrid, London and Amman. If we allow the terrorists present in Iraq to win, we can expect more of the same. We can expect to see another Afghanistan--a puppet government established to support and back the aims of their terrorist masters. This is totally unacceptable. 
   Victory in Iraq is our only option. It is the only path through which we can hope for peace. Without victory, our terrorist enemies gain confidence in their opposition to the United States and their ability to defeat us militarily. We embolden them and offer them the opportunity to further their attacks against American men, women and children. 
   The resolution that we are debating will send a message to the world. What will that message be? My fervent hope and prayer is that it will be a message of resolve, a message of strength, a message of victory. 
   Now is the time to support our troops in the field unequivocally and vote against this nonbinding resolution. We don't want anyone to construe our action here today as not fully supporting our men and women who serve us in Iraq.

   Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank every Member who has worked on this piece of legislation, and there has been a lot, especially Mr. Barton and Mr. Deal who have gone beyond the call of duty in their work. I have been in meetings with them for many hours, so I appreciate their work. 
   I think we are all disappointed that it has taken so long to come up with a solution, but in the end we have arrived at a correct decision. 
   When SCHIP was first brought to the floor in 1997, I was a new Member of Congress. It was a bipartisan bill that was enacted by a Republican House and Senate. And it was signed into law by a Democrat President. 
   This year's process has been anything but bipartisan. I think it would be fair to say that the political rancor in the debate that has occurred over the last several months has surpassed anything that most of us have seen while we have been in Congress. But it is time to move forward and it is time that we remember what is important in this whole process, and that is the children that need health care in America, that are simply the poor in this country. 
   In my home State of Alabama, SCHIP has been a tremendous success and has helped a new generation of children live happier and healthier lives.     
   I'm pleased that this Congress has decided to extend this vital program into 2009 and provide a level of certainty to State health directors that did not exist under our previous resolutions. This is a good solution, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose the amendment, and I'm sure that my friend and colleague from Arizona means well in this endeavor. But I must say that I support the National Textile Center. 
   As you know, Mr. Chairman, our domestic textile manufacturers are facing tremendous competition from around the world, and much of that is due to the way that our trade laws in this country are structured. And it's not the fault of our domestic manufacturers. The only way we can remain competitive against cheap labor in these foreign countries is through cutting-edge technology. 
   The National Textile Center strengthens our Nation's efforts by bringing together diverse research and also those in the industry so that our textile producers can produce to lead the world in technology. So the end results, therefore, will be workers in the United States can continue to produce the highest-quality products and in the most efficient manner. 
   This center that we're discussing today, the National Textile Center, provides real-world applications that are needed to make sure that the textile industry in America survives. For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I rise to support this center and to oppose the amendment that is being offered before us at this time.

   Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the Chairman's support for this legislation to be brought to the floor. I also want to say that I appreciate Congressman Coble, his lending his support for this legislation and making sure that it gets to the floor today. And as Chairman Conyers noted, Congressman Davis of Alabama and Congressman Braley of Iowa have been very helpful in this effort as well. So I'm glad to have their support. 
   One other person that has been very supportive that actually called this to my attention initially was a friend of mine from Alabama, Mike Turner, some time ago brought this issue to my attention, and so I'm glad that we can work on this and try to get this resolved here on the floor of the House and through the United States Congress. 
   I'm pleased to have been able to work together with the committee of jurisdiction to find a satisfactory solution to this issue dealing with recognition across State lines. During the hearing that was held during the 109th Congress, which has already been mentioned, by the Subcommittee on the Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property, then Ranking Member HOWARD BERMAN pointed out that though the topic of notary recognition between the States is not necessarily the most exciting issue, it is an extremely practical one. And to my colleague who, of course, now chairs that subcommittee, I would have to agree with him on both points. 
   During the hearing, which was held back in March of 2006, we heard from several witnesses who all agree that this is an ongoing and a difficult problem for interstate commerce. To businesses and individuals engaged in businesses across State lines, this is a matter long overdue that is being resolved. 
   H.R. 1979, the bill today, will eliminate confusion that arises when States refuse to acknowledge the integrity of documents from another State. This act preserves the right of States to set standards and regulate notaries, while reducing the burden on the average citizen who has to use the Court system. 
   It will streamline the interstate, commercial, and legal transaction consistent with the guarantees of the State's rights that are called for in the Full Faith in Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. 
   Currently, as the law is today, each State is responsible for regulating its notaries. Typically, an individual will pay a fee, will submit an application, takes an oath of office. Some States require the applicants to enroll in educational courses, pass exams and even to obtain a notary bond. Nothing in this legislation will change these steps. We are not trying to mandate how States regulate notaries which they appoint. 
   In addition, the bill will also not preclude the challenge of notarized documents such as a will contest. 
   During the subcommittee hearings on this bill that were held back in the 109th Congress, Tim Reineger, who serves as the executive director of the National Notary Association stated, ``We like this bill because it is talking about a standard for the legal effects of the material act, the admissibility of it, not at all interfering with the State requirements for education and regulation of the notaries themselves.'' 
   This is an issue that has really lagged on for many, many years. When I was first elected to Congress back in 1997, this was an issue that I was first made aware of, and here we are in 2007, and this issue is still not resolved. And this is an issue that people who deal with notaries on a daily basis deal with, to a lot of frustration. 
   And simply, this legislation that we have before the House today and that will be going before the United States Senate, hopefully in a very short period of time, will address this problem. It will try to expedite interstate commerce so that court documents and so that when notaries are in one State or the other, they will be fully recognized. 
   And again, I think it must be stressed that it is in no way trying to mandate what a State should do or should not do. It simply allows there to be more free flow of commerce between the States and particularly when you're talking about the regulation of notaries themselves. 
   Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your support, Congressman Coble for your support of this legislation, and allowing it to be able to move forward today. And I would urge my colleagues that when this bill comes for a vote, that they would support it under the suspension of the rules.

<DOCNO>Mr. ADERHOLT. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ADERHOLT. First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Smith and Mr. Stupak for their leadership on this amendment. What we are doing here on this amendment is no small thing. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe it should be noted for the record that most Americans do not believe that abortion is an appropriate form of family planning. To suggest it is simply wrong. It would never be considered proper within the United States and it isn't proper that taxpayers' money be spent for this purpose overseas. 
   The amendment that we are debating today in question is not anti-family planning. There are a number of alternatives to abortion which do not rise to the level of concern that this proposal engenders. This is only anti-family planning if one considers abortion to be a method of family planning. I reject this way of thinking and urge the adoption of this amendment. 
   When President Bush adopted our Nation's current policy, he was right. Prohibiting the expenditure of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions outside the United States is a policy that has been in place for many years. Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues who care about the sanctity of human life to vote in favor of the Smith-Stupak amendment.
