<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Madam Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Just a brief description of the amendment which I hope will prove noncontroversial. What I would like to do under the bill, though I'm not particularly a fan of the bill itself and its particulars, I would like to try to help to make it better. 
   My amendment would, under the bill, require States to give first priority to veterans, active duty military personnel, National Guard, Armed Forces Reserves, schoolteachers and emergency response personnel when selling rehabilitated housing with funds authorized under H.R. 5818.     
   Importantly, this amendment will not exclude those individuals who are low income, and does not change the underlying low-income eligibility requirements established under the bill. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCOTTER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I would like to reemphasize the point made by the gentleman from New Jersey. The distinguished chairman of the committee is right, the Republican numbers are declining, and this painful experience with arithmetic has taught us that 17 is still a greater number than zero.

   Mr. McCOTTER. The gentleman may potentially yield, but not at this point. 
   I would also like to point out that the distinguished chairman is right, the bill, if this amendment is adopted, would not be for speculators, simply for Bear Stearns, for Wall Street, would not be a big, bloated government golden parachute, but again, I think in this town, I think I'm being thanked for adding deserving people to something that may or may not help. 
   You see, it's not the intent that we are debating, it is how we get to where we all want to go. Do we believe that this is the best way to go? I highly doubt that on our side that we would concur with that. And the reason that we cannot concur with that is, as I believe the gentleman from Georgia pointed out, there are fundamental principles at stake here that we simply differ on. That's all right. We agree on some things, sometimes we don't, but they're a matter of principle. And in the end, the fundamental principle at stake is that our side believes that Americans' prosperity does not come from government, it comes from their own hard work and entrepreneurial investment. And what we want to see with this bill is an appropriate balance for the people that we truly are trying to help, for them who have made no mistakes, for them who have managed to hang on by their fingernails, for them to be able to say that we were compassionate towards our fellow Americans, our tax dollars were wisely used, and yet they were appropriately used. We believe in better government, not necessarily bigger government. And that is the crux of what we are debating today. 
   All good people on both sides. And as for the chairman, I do believe he is a very honorable man. One of the places we do agree is on the Bear Stearns bailout. A lot of our colleagues on this side of the aisle screwed up their jobs and didn't get to walk away with $61 million. They walked away with far worse. And I think that the Bear Stearns issue, which is being conducted by Bernanke over at the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury, both of whom work for the Bush administration--well, one technically does--and who both were, I think on a bipartisan basis, confirmed by the United States Senate. So at least there's one thing we have in common, we aren't to blame for that. So I would look forward to working with him on that. 
   But again, I appreciate the support for the amendment, and I will yield to the chairman.

   Mr. McCOTTER. I thank you. 
   This bill is worse than nothing; it is the illusion of something. As was alluded to by my colleague from Nebraska, when you see people who claim to be more green than the Maid of Arran supporting a drilling bill, questions do arise. 
   In the final analysis, I must be honest. In fairness, this bill will do one thing. It will unleash the new power of the Democratic Party's hybrid of solar and wind power. It's called hot air. Now, hot air will not fuel your car, it will not fly your plane, and it will not lower your gas prices. 
   I would point out before you vote on this, remember the more hot air that you unleash over this, the more disastrous the consequences to both gas prices and global warming.

   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, earlier today we saw a picture of the President of the United States with foreign dignitaries. We today see the Speaker of the House with a foreign dignitary. We do not begrudge either of them on this side of the aisle. We have to have responsible foreign relations. The only difference is we do not use pictures to explain America's energy policy or put forward conspiracy theories as to why you are feeling the pain at the pump. 
   Let us be realistic about this. We need more American oil production, commonsense conservation, and free market innovations. And no amount of political cant or hot air is going to do anything except keep your prices at the pump to the point where your family budget shrinks.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, we find ourselves today as a minority party watching a very perplexing bill come towards us. It's perplexing in the sense that we watch a majority party which has promised America to end the war, which many of us, I think, rightly view and the world will view as an American defeat because it has failed and cannot be changed to the point where America can win. We've also watched a majority party tell us that the spending on the Iraq war has destroyed the American economy. We can differ on that but that is their position. And we now watch the Democratic Party bring forward a bill that will fund a failed war and will evidently, by their logic, further decimate the American economy. 
   Now how does one come to the conclusion that this is a necessary step for said party? Well, you have discretionary spending added into it. Now, I would argue that a fine piece of legislation has been attached to this bill, which was introduced by the gentleman from Washington, to help people who are unemployed. Thanks to the policies of my State legislature, which has raised taxes and helped drive business out of Michigan, we have seen that people need unemployment insurance to get themselves through difficult times in the hopes they can find employment. 
   Which brings me to the next problem with this, which is in an attempt to help veterans, we are raising taxes on small business income. Eighty percent of the income that will be taxed comes from small business. So now what we have is an attempt to show that we can fund a war that we believe has failed with money that has decimated the American economy by going overseas; yet we will try to help the unemployed, who will further suffer from this, and we will try to help veterans who come back from that war by making sure that there are no jobs here waiting for them. 
   Again, it is a very perplexing bill. I would suggest to the gentleman who earlier suggested there was nothing Congress could do to end this war to rethink the position.

   Mr. McCOTTER. Congress still holds the power of the purse. If the war is not funded, the war cannot continue. That's perhaps a position I disagree with, but it is a factual matter. If you are serious about this, you would do that. 
   Or you would have a straightforward vote on funding the troops to ensure that we continue to move forward and that America is not defeated in Iraq. You would have dealt with the McDermott bill and sent it to the President despite his veto threat because he has also threatened to veto this legislation. There would be much Republican support for this. And then you would deal with the veterans in the way they should be. 
   Now many friends of mine are Blue Dogs. You were not questioned on your patriotism when you determined that this money for veterans had to be offset. No one said you cared more about big government than veterans. I would suggest that those of us who want to make sure our economy recovers and do not want to tax it into submission and decimation should not have any patriotism questioned about supporting veterans by opposing tax increases and instead looking for cuts in Federal pork to pay for it.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (AFGHANISTAN FREEDOM AND SECURITY SUPPORT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Chairman, first, I wish to begin by commending the work of the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   Upon my first visit to Iraq in 2003, I was struck by the centralized reconstruction process. I believed it was a mistake, and I came back in November of that year and gave a speech on the floor of the House and I said that I thought that one of the things that we needed to do was to provide the Iraqi people a transactional benefit to undergird the transformational change to democracy. This lesson is equally applicable in Afghanistan, which is why this bill today is so welcomed, because it recognizes that the people of Afghanistan in the provinces, in the local levels are where the reconstruction money must really be targeted. 
   If you think about how the United States evolved into a democracy, we began with the family unit and went to the town halls and went to our county government level and eventually became States and eventually became a strong union. We can expect no more nor no less from the people of other nations who are yearning to breathe free and have been given the chance to seize the opportunity. 
   On a more personal note, having been on my first trip to Afghanistan with my colleagues, we had the opportunity to meet with some female parliamentarians, and I was struck by two things: The first, and I said this to them, was that I admired their courage and that there was a part of me that envied them. I envy them because here in the United States capital we see portraits and we see monuments and we continue to this day to hear testaments to the courage and perseverance of our Nation's founders. 
   And I said that I was so honored to be in the presence of these female parliamentarians for in Afghanistan, as they move towards democracy, one day there will be testaments and monuments and portraits of them hanging on the walls of their own chambers and in the homes of their fellow countrymen. 
   We promised that day not to forget or forsake them. And today, thanks to the leadership of the ranking member and the chairman, we can tell those female parliamentarians that we have not forgotten them and that we stand with them. 
   And, finally, let us not forget when we think about the role of the United States, which was conceived in liberty, those female parliamentarians were once considered property until they were emancipated by the United States of America and the coalition allies.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (WAR IS UGLY BUT TYRANNY IS UGLIER -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. 
   Mr. Speaker, amidst these tumultuous times, it is often difficult to make sense of the stakes and the situations which confront us. But let us be clear: America in Iraq faces the prospect of a defeat, with consequences not only for this present generation of Americans but for future generations of Americans as well. Unlike Vietnam, the enemy will follow us home; and this is an enemy that is bent upon our destruction and the death not only of ourselves but of everything we hold dear. 
   In similar times, as my colleague PHIL ENGLISH, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, earlier read, it was the moral clarity of individuals like President Roosevelt, who helped guide the greatest generation to their triumph over abject evil. 
   This generation of Americans must retain their moral clarity to understand what needs to be done in the perilous present to get us to a better tomorrow. First, we need to step back and assess the situation in Iraq. The reality in Iraq is that we have one thing left to do as a Nation, and that job has been entrusted to our troops, who have done everything and more that has been asked of them. 
   To date, Iraq is free, Iraq is sovereign, Iraq has a democratically elected government. The people of Iraq within the government are fighting side by side with United States forces to kill and capture al Qaeda and other terrorists and insurgents. 
   And today we find ourselves struggling to attain the last goal before our troops accomplish the mission, and that is to give the new democracy a chance to survive in our absence. I say a chance to survive in our absence, because no free people, including ourselves, can ever be guaranteed that their liberty will last in perpetuity. 
   Did not Benjamin Franklin tell us this when he said to his fellow patriots at the founding of our Nation, we will give you a republic, if you can keep it. 
   The price of keeping that republic, or of any free nation, is eternal vigilance, to make sure that your rights are not eroded and you are not enslaved. 
   At another time in our Nation's history, when we were sorely tried through the conflagration of war, it was President Lincoln who understood that a war for secession had become a war for the emancipation of an entire race so that our Nation could have a new birth of freedom. 
   What we find in the Middle East today as we struggle to accomplish the last task in this mission is that our war for terror has been transformed into the war for the emancipation of millions of Muslims, so that the Middle East and our world can have a new birth of freedom. 
   If we, as a nation conceived in liberty, who have seen the sorrowful sacrifice of so many of our sons and daughters throughout our history to retain that liberty, determine to turn our backs upon people we have given a cruel sip of freedom to before we abandon them, we must ask ourselves two questions: What do we as a nation believe anymore about ourselves and the inalienable truths upon which we were founded; and what manner of dedication can we portray to the world and to ourselves as to its preservation?     
   And then we must ask ourselves a very cruel question: What other nascent democracies under terrorist attack will the United States abandon? Because that is the question that the enemy wants us to confront in what they are doing in Iraq. 
   If the United States is defeated in Iraq, and make no mistake, with the euphemisms that are bandied about, if we leave we lose, and the terrorists will remind us of this. The gutter snipe, Osama bin Laden, will be more than happy to proclaim it through every Internet site and every broadcast media available to him and his ilk for domestic American consumption. 
   If we leave and are defeated in Iraq, everything that the enemy has done in Iraq will be transferred to Afghanistan. Already, as we found out earlier today, we have seen the hand of the Iranians in putting exploding devices and other material to support the Taliban insurgents against the NATO forces and our own U.S. troops who are part of that coalition. 
   Let us not forget that it was in Afghanistan that al Qaeda, and especially bin Laden and others, learned to kill as they chased the Soviets out through  measures that they are now applying in Iraq and Afghanistan. And let us not forget that an emboldened enemy will then, on much more familiar ground where the al Qaeda was housed before the attacks of September 11, it will prove a much more fertile ground for their incipient brand of insurgency, which we will have already been unable to quell in Iraq, which will now devolve into chaos and prove a safe haven for those who wish to kill us. 
   But let us not forget, we have one thing left to do in Iraq. That is why it is so bloody, that is why it is so bitter, and that is why it is so frustrating to the vast majority of Americans. But if we maintain our prudence and perseverance and clarity, we can see this through until the mission is accomplished. We can see that the United States, which is a revolutionary experiment in human freedom, can remember the lesson that Lincoln taught us: When we extend liberty to the enslaved, we ensure liberty for ourselves. President Lincoln understood that liberty is not static. It does not remain in a perpetual stasis where we can enjoy our liberty while others have it denied unto them. 
   If freedom is advancing or eroding in the course of human events, let us rededicate ourselves not only to accomplishing the mission in Iraq and Afghanistan so that our world can experience a new birth of freedom, let us rededicate ourselves to the proposition that we who are born into freedom also bear the responsibility where we can to extend liberty to those who also yearn to breathe free, as do all of God's creatures.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (THE DEMOCRAT ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. I thank the gentleman from Indiana. 
   As you know, a fellow midwesterner, we, in the Great Lakes State, have suffered gravely from the high cost of energy. We've seen our manufacturing sector hard hit; we've seen our tourism industry hard hit; and across the board, we've seen our residents hard hit by the high cost of energy. And they have taken exception to the fact that the Congress, which they elect to work for them--and the Democratic majority in particular--chose to take a 5-week paid vacation while they suffered, while their family budget shrank, and while there was time for politics, but no time to bring a vote on this floor for an all-of-the-above energy strategy. 
   Now, let us make one thing clear: You will hear much from the majority Democrats that this is a drilling bill. This fails on two accounts. First, this is a political bill. All statements by the majority party have been phrased in the context of a political decision to provide them cover with the electorate they have so ill served over the course of the last 18 or 19 months. So when you say that we have incredulity on our side of the aisle, it is more than that; we have indignation at the way the process has been abused to prevent help going to our constituents through a sane, sound, all-of-the-above strategy. 
   Secondly, what we are most concerned about is the fact that the Democratic majority seems to believe its own myth that all the Republicans care about is drilling. This is not the case. Drilling is a technique. What the Republican Party has been about is the maximization of American energy production. It is not the technique, it is the goal. 
   We have focused on an all-of-the-above strategy that requires maximum American energy production, commonsense conservation, and free market green innovation so we can have a responsible transition to American energy security and independence. And when we see a bill come forward that says we are going to allow some drilling, we are going to somehow continue the government rationing of America's energy and provide you with maybe 20 percent relief by allowing you access to those precious materials and fossil fuels--which are yours, the American people--we not only strain credulity, we not only raise indignation, but what we have done is we have insulted the intelligence of the American people that somehow help will be on the way. 
   So when this bill comes forward in the manner that you and the gentleman from Arizona and the gentleman from Georgia have talked about, this is surely proof positive that this is a political ploy. It is not an energy policy suitable for the United States in the 21st century. And we have no doubt that while some on the majority side in the Democratic Party may have the witty talking line that Republicans will not take yes for an answer, I have no doubt that the American people will not mistake the Democratic Party's ``no'' for a solution. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Indiana.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (WELCOMING HIS HOLINESS POPE BENEDICT XVI ON HIS FIRST APOSTOLIC VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank Chairman Berman, Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, and all of the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   You know, I remember back when I was growing up there was a movie, and the movie was called ``A Hard Day's Night.'' This was at the height of Beatlemania, and the Beatles had obviously been wildly popular and well-received when they first hit our shores. And yet in the movie there is a scene where a reporter, seemingly unaware of this, asked John Lennon a question. And the question was this: ``How did you find America?'' 
   And Lennon said, ``I turned left at Greenland.'' 
   The point I bring this up for is quite simple. Today we hear many inane questions about how His Holiness will be received by the American people. How will America find the Pope? How will the Pope find America? Well, I think these questions are inane for a very simple reason: The United States understands the Holy Father because he advocates that we use faith and reason to find our way through these trying times and on to a transcendent Creator. 
   The United States, our revolutionary experiment in human freedom, was founded upon faith and reason. The Founders had the faith that they were playing a role in divine provenance, that they had rights that were endowed to them and inalienable by a Creator. And yet it was not passion alone that allowed for the founding of our free republic; they also used their reason to find their way to express how those rights could be guaranteed against government, and how individual citizens could live together with their rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   This is no different than the message that the Holy Father brings today. The Holy Father has said that faith and reason are concomitant blessings from God which allow us to find him not only in ourselves but in each other. 
   So as Americans await the Pope's first visit, I am not saying that there will be teenyboppers dropping in the streets as the popemobile passes, but I do say His Holiness will receive a warm reception from people who have understood and who continue to understand that faith and reason are gifts from God we squander at our own peril.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (COMMUNIST CHINA -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, one of our greatest Presidents was Harry Truman. And one of the reasons President Truman was held in such high regard by people, including my own father, was that he had the courage to go against conventional wisdom, especially in the area of foreign relations. 
   It was President Truman who had the moral courage to tell the American people that our World War II ally the Soviet Union was no longer our friend and had become a threat to the very liberty that our people had helped advance throughout the course of that conflict. This was not a message that the American people were particularly expecting. In fact, there were many who decried President Truman's analysis at the time. One of them was George F. Kennan, who is, unfortunately, often remembered as the father of the containment policy. 
   In fact, when faced with the rise of the Soviet Union as a strategic threat and rival model of governance, it was Mr. Kennan's position that the Soviet Union could be managed, that we should constructively engage them, that their ideology meant nothing to them, and that, in fact, they were but a different variation of the traditional Czarist order within Russia. And, besides, Mr. Kennan concluded, what did it matter? Eventually the two systems of communism and our free Republic's democratic system would merge into one. 
   President Truman was not as educated as Mr. Kennan. He was not as sophisticated as Mr. Kennan. And President Truman took the Soviets at their word that they were in fact communists. He took them at their word that they meant they were going to put in practice their intrinsically evil ideology. And Mr. Truman dissented from Mr. Kennan and said that the fundamental goal of the United States foreign policy to defeat the intrinsic evil of communism will be the advancement of liberty throughout our world where and when we can achieve it. 
   Recently I came across a picture that I had ordered from a friend of mine in the District, Mr. Doug Brown. It was from one of Mr. Truman's return trips to St. Louis. He was meeting a gentleman from his old World War I Artillery Battery. And a picture that struck me the most was this: The MC of the event that night for President Truman in Missouri was an entertainer named Ronald Reagan. And in that crystalline moment, it was clear for me to see the link in the Cold War's victory between the foundation President Truman courageously laid and the way that President Reagan courageously won it ultimately. 
   What we see today now is a repeat of history where we have two paths we can take. We can take the path of Mr. Kennan and the detente crowd of the Kissingerites and others that says we can manage the rise of Communist China, that we can engage them and barter with them and engage in structural diplomacy, all the while the oppression of their own people's God-given rights to rights to life, liberty, and dignity are repressed, while Tibet suffers under their yoke, while the Burmese and Sudanese regimes are propped up, and while they continue their stealth assaults on our national security with sleeper cells, and I could go on. Or we who profess to be the heirs of Ronald Reagan, especially within the Republican Party, can follow the path of President Truman and understand that you cannot barter with butchers. You cannot constructively manage evil nor engage it. But what you can do is unleash the liberty of people yearning to breathe free where and when you can. 
   The reason I bring this up is not merely the Beijing Olympics. I'm on record as opposing our President's attendance at the games. I believe it would be a betrayal of our free Republic's commitment to liberty. But I was struck by a statement in this regard by our current Secretary of State, ironically enough herself a Sovietologist. I will not make the joke that a Sovietologist is often considered diplomacy's equivalent of a Latin teacher for this has relevance. She said, ``It is important for the Chinese people to see that the United States supports their emergence onto the world's stage.'' 
   I fundamentally differ with that assessment. I remain a Reaganite. I remain my Truman Democratic father's son. The United States, and my party in particular, exists to put communism in the ash can of history, not to usher communism onto the world's stage. If my party, as it has strayed from principle in the past, does not understand  the emancipation imperative that runs through Abraham Lincoln to Ronald Reagan and to today, we are in a sad state. I trust we wake up while there is still time.

   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, as the Olympic torch goes through San Francisco today, I would just like to bring attention to the fact that I, as well as others on each side of the aisle, will be introducing legislation to ensure that we send our athletes to the games but not our politicians. 
   In the past, America has sent their athletes to the Olympics to show what free people can achieve, most notably in 1936 when Jesse Owens won gold and disabused the world of the Fuhrer's propaganda that there was an inferior race amongst us. FDR did not go to the Olympics. 
   I would encourage American politicians, including the President of the United States, not to politicize the games by their attendance, but rather stay home and attend to the pressing issues which face us as a people. This would be the proper way for the United States to both honor the spirit of the Olympics and the spirit of our free people.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. I appreciate that. Thank you. We have a fundamental agreement and yet a disagreement. I think that everyone can see that there are three key elements to America's energy situation: Production, conservation, and innovation. We all agree on conservation. We'd like to see America more energy efficient, and we differ on whether or not what the extreme would be in terms of conservation. Republicans generally would hope that they would be community-oriented conservation, recognizing these tiny ripples of hope, citizen engagement in protecting their local environment would be the most efficacious way to deal with this situation rather than pass an overarching bill in Washington, with no citizen participation and only hope and more regulation, taxation, and burden upon America's industry and upon the American people. 
   In the area of innovation it is a very stark difference. Our side of the aisle believes that the free market and the genius of the American people will come up with the innovative solutions necessary to move us toward green fuels and a cleaner environment. The other side of the aisle believes the government knows best, and if they just capture enough revenues from the hardworking American people, they will then determine what ideas will work and will not work and force them upon the market. 
   But it is most noticeable in the area of production where the two sides differ. We believe production is essential. The gentleman from Iowa has properly laid out we live in a global economy. Supply and demand are the keys to the crisis today. If America does not produce more energy from its own sources, the cost will continue to go up because the supply will remain constricted, if not finite, and the demand will continue to grow from developing countries such as Communist China, India, and others. 
   What we believe is necessary is a declaration of energy independence which, like our own country's Declaration of Independence, recognizes that it would not happen overnight, it would not be easy; it would require sacrifice, and yet together we would get there. 
   We need to continue to produce domestic energy as we transition through a free market-based approach to innovations that will get us to a green energy policy and through the community-based conservation that will help foster and perpetuate energy efficiencies within our communities, within our homes. 
   Now the difference between these two policies is clear in the chart that the gentleman from Iowa has put before us. As someone who does not come from Iowa, but from Michigan, once known as the arsenal of democracy, a proud manufacturing State, the State that put the world on wheels, we see what the cost of energy does. It is not an abstract number, it is a situation which causes an intense amount of pain and anxiety to the constituents of my district and the constituents of my State. 
   Manufacturing requires energy. We know the manufacturing sector has been decimated by unfair trade competition and other unfortunate policies. Yet, when you take the cost of energy on top of it, you are almost signaling the death knell of the manufacturing base as we know it and as we would like to preserve it, because that cost of energy, as it rises, is put into everything the manufacturer must do. And in the age of global competition, it becomes increasingly difficult for the manufacturer to keep his costs down, his fixed overhead rising, and in the end, there comes the push, especially from the tier one and tier two suppliers, the push comes from above to either eat the cost or send it offshore. 
   We also are starting to see what the government dictates in terms of innovation with the emphasis on ethanol and others is we are beginning to hear stories about food shortages in the United States, we are now beginning to hear about how the cost of basic staple commodities is rising. Again, in our economy today, which is slowing down, the cost of energy, the cost of gasoline in particular is the cause. In my mind, this is the cause. Because it is one important commodity that is continuing to go up in price without any relief in sight, and it also has spillover costs to all of the other commodities related to it. 
   There is nothing that does not wind up on your kitchen table that does not require energy to produce and transport. There is nothing in your home that you turn on, your Internet, or anywhere else, that does not require energy. As the cost of energy goes up, the cost of everything goes up. If we do not help increase the supply of energy, the costs will continue to rise, the American people will continue to suffer. 
   Now there will be an attempt, because evidently production conservation and innovation in a sound way is not palatable to some in this chamber, indeed a majority, there would be the attempt to shift the blame for the rising costs of energy to the producers. I am no fan of any multinational corporation. But then, again, I am not their executioner either. Because I remember what Ronald Reagan once said, Corporations are not taxpayers, corporations are tax collectors. 
   You want a windfall profits tax, you want a punitive tax on oil companies, energy producers, you can do it. And where are these energy producers and oil companies going to get that revenue from? They are going to pass the cost right onto the American people at their pumps, because Americans right now cannot survive without driving their cars to work. They cannot survive without energy. It would seem to me that these are simple lessons that we should have learned in our youth. 
   Then it occurred to me as I watch my children grow up, we have an entire generation of voters that were not alive in the 1970s. They did not live through the OPEC oil crisis, they did not live through taxation upon energy producers, they did not live through the syn fuels, where government raised taxes, put money in a fund, handed it out and we were going to be energy independent, or when Jimmy Carter went on TV and declared that by turning down the thermostat to 68, this was the moral equivalent to war. 
   The gentleman from Iowa and I have in the past talked about our love of history and its need to be taught in the schools. Because anyone with a remote understanding of the 1970s would understand that the failed policies of the 1970s are inadequate to meet the pressing energy needs of today. What we need is a 21st century energy strategy, not a failed 1970s Jimmy Carter policy that actually helped pave the way toward more energy dependence in America. 
   So I thank the gentleman for what he is doing today, and I would encourage my colleagues to go back and look at what was tried before and failed and then perhaps they would be more amenable to coming across the aisle in joining with us to try to take concrete steps to alleviate not only the rising cost of energy but the rising cost of everyday life that is associated with it. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Iowa.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, as the world stumbles toward the Communist propaganda extravaganza labeled the Beijing Olympics, somewhere Chairman Mao is looking up at us and laughing. 
   According to the Catholic News Agency, Bibles and all other religious symbols are among Communist China's list of athletes' ``prohibited objects'' due to ``security concerns.'' 
   Since the leader of the Free World, President Bush, has articulated his eagerness to attend Communist China's Olympics, I am compelled to ask three questions: 
   Mr. President, how many Bibles will you be taking to Beijing? Will you visit the five bishops and 15 priests in prison for opposing the Communist regime's official church? And will you tell China's Communist tyrants this fundamental truth: No good government denies God's presence.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (RE-INFLATING THE BUBBLE -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, we have confronted the first financial panic of the ``New Global Economy''--an economy spawned by the fall of the Berlin Wall--and the precedent we set will affect our prosperity, liberty, and posterity for generations. 
   Unconscionably, we have rushed to misjudgment and approved a $700 billion Wall Street bailout the American people know is intrinsically unfair to them. This truth is self-evident in how, initially, an exiting President and his  Treasury Secretary incited a panic amongst our people and the world, all to compel a compliant Congress to deliver upon this demand: ``Main Street must bail out Wall Street, or how the people will suffer.'' 
   Justly, the people's House voiced the will of the sovereign people and refused. Recalcitrant, the administration zealously intensified its attempt to shift $700 billion worth of consequences from Wall Street onto Main Street and pronounced a new ransom dictum: ``No bailout for Wall Street, no tax relief for Main Street, and how the people will suffer.'' 
   To this demand, the Congress capitulated. The saddest part of this immorality play is how the people will suffer regardless, and they know it. Working Americans, whose well-deserved tax relief must never be predicated upon rewarding others' misdeeds, understand this self-described, short-term stabilization bill cannot claim with certainty to attain its professed intent, let alone solve the new global economy's latest structural dysfunctions. 
   Worse, as a multitude of economists and entrepreneurs prove, this bailout bill will reinflate the bubble by $700 billion and thereby only delay our day of economic reckoning. It cannot be otherwise because the bailout bill's central economic construct is patently and grossly unfair to Americans. 
   Succinctly: Congress will buy ``toxic assets'' with your money that private investors won't buy with their own money. What a deal for you. Therefore, belying the ludicrous claims, this bailout is designed to save Wall Street, not Main Street. It is small wonder Americans rejected this odious proposal, and equally unfathomable how Congress ultimately approved it. 
   In the aftermath, a deeper truth emerges from the ruins. In setting a new economic precedent during this pregnant moment fraught with consequence, we also face a transcendent choice between two competing visions for our Nation's future: Global materialism versus American traditionalism; ``creative destruction'' versus ``innovative restoration''; Wall Street versus Main Street. 
   In the tumultuous transition from our humane American traditions into an insane global age, we viscerally glean the evolving forces dwarfing our mortal power to protect the cherished realms of faith, family, community and country, while in each heart beats the murmur of Yeats: ``Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, the blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned. The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand.'' 
   From this Congress, Americans sought reassurance their representative institutions remained vibrant and sufficient to shelter and steer our Nation through the amoral global flood tide's enveloping chaos. We have answered them today. In voting ``yea,'' you have not solely chosen Wall Street over Main Street, you have chosen the big over the beautiful, the giant over the gentle, the great over the good. 
   And this decision now shapes our destiny. This being the case, we bailout opponents must grudgingly admit a tinge of envy for its supporters. Tonight, you will go to sleep praying you are right; we will go to sleep praying we are wrong, while in each breast the murmur returns. 
   Now the future beckons from its ominous shadows, and through the impending gloaming we can but glimpse how the people will suffer. As breaks that nightmarish day, let us arise and combine to transcend the insanity of our age, forge a humane global economy, and restore our American home to a God blessed land of hope, devotion and dreams.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (OUR RICH HISTORY OF FAITH -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia and the gentleman from North Carolina for holding this. 
   Phillip Bobbitt, the author of the ``Shield of Achilles,'' once wrote that if you don't know where you have been, you won't know where you're going, and any road will take you there. 
   Throughout the history of the 20th century, we have seen where people who deny the role of religion within their government--the hells to which they have descended, hells of which Dostoevsky warned a long time ago that all manners of things are possible in the absence of God. 
   It has been said tonight, and rightly so, that the United States, from its founding, has understood a self-evident truth that our liberty comes not from the pen of a government bureaucrat but is written on our hearts by almighty God. It is this self-evident truth that allows us to understand that it is our liberty which has curated the subservient government which exists to protect our God-given rights. 
   I think it is also important that we understand that history is not merely something that happened 200 years ago,  100. But let us look back to our own recent history of religion and its salubrious effects on the American people. 
   In the civil rights struggle, it was the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior, who understood that America was a country founded upon the principle of equality for all because all human beings were endowed by the creator with the gift of liberty. It was the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior, who appealed to the conscience of this country to allow us to live together and to one day achieve the dream of equality, regardless of race. 
   In pursuit of this noble goal, in pursuit of this Godly goal, Dr. King was slain. And in a eulogy performed for him in Indianapolis in the wake of this tragedy, it was Senator Robert F. Kennedy who said, And even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart until then our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God. 
   In that moment of anguish for our Nation, which would be repeated shortly thereafter for Senator Kennedy, we saw that religion and government in the United States were not exclusive but complimentary. And we saw that what binds us together as the greatest Nation on the face of the earth stems not from government but from the yearnings and the common bounds of our own heart. 
   This recognition, this understanding of where we've been, where we are, and where together we must go, is what will allow America to remain a community of destiny, inspired and guided by the virtuous genius of her free people and eternally blessed by the unfathomable grace of God.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (VICTIMS OF COMMUNISM MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday was the unveiling of the dedication of the Victims of Communism Memorial here in Washington D.C. It is a replica statue of Lady Liberty, the Lady Liberty that inspired the Chinese students and their fellow people in Tiananmen Square. 
   It was this period of time in which there was great hope within the Chinese people that their desire to breathe free would finally be realized. Yet that hope, that inalienable right, which we all as human beings share, was crushed beneath the tyrant yoke of the Chinese communist party. 
   Yesterday, at the dedication of that memorial, to not only those students and those Chinese people, yesterday at that dedication, which commemorated all the tens of millions who have died beneath the inhuman atheistic ideology of communism, the President of the United States made his remarks. 
   I wish to say that I have an enormous amount of respect for the President. He has been a steadfast leader, and I believe he is a good man, but I am saddened by the fact that he missed the opportunity, not to simply and nobly and necessarily commemorate the victims of communism and the triumph of liberty in parts of the world over that invidious ideology, but he missed the opportunity to issue a clarion call for the American people and all free peoples in our world to summon the courage to call for the end of communist regimes that still exist in our midst, Communist regimes from North Korea, to Cuba and, obviously, to Communist China. 
   For it is easy for people to believe that we had reached the end of history, to view communism as an ideology that is no longer a threat to our freedoms, our way of life and to the way of life to all people, yet it is. 
   When the Cold War ended, we had won the European theater of the battle between freedom and communism, and, yet, hundreds of millions across the globe remained enslaved. It is too little to say to them, good luck finding your freedom. If, we as a free people, are a beacon of hope to all humanity, we must also accept the responsibility that we bear to do everything within our power to ensure that our fellow people have the opportunity to enjoy their freedom, for they are equally God's children, as are we. 
   So I would suggest to the President of the United States that he recall that the struggle, what John F. Kennedy called the bitter twilight struggle between freedom and communism is not over. It is not time for a victory lap. It is time for a rededication of ourselves as a free people of a Nation conceived in liberty to continue our historic and our moral mission to emancipate all humanity from this insidious ideology. 
   For we are a revolutionary country by birth, and we must remain a revolutionary country in present. If we fail that mission we lose part of ourselves, not only our legacy but the legacy we must leave to our children and to all humanity. 
   In conclusion, I would urge the President of the United States to realize that the victory over communism is not complete and that we as Americans must continue to be champions of human freedom in our world.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to address the Chair. I will resist the temptation to point out how my Tigers took two out of three from your Mets recently. 
   I, too, am Generation X and was interested in some of the remarks that were put forward on the floor. First, I do not know that the people who wrote the Federalist Papers and came up with the system of limited government would be rolling in their graves at any attempt that we engage in to stop the obfuscation of earmarks within a process that is less than transparent. 
   I would also like to note that it is my preference to refer to the bull in the china shop as the bull in the Communist China shop. And speaking of bull, let us not forget that for 4 days this Chamber dealt with little else than a nonbinding/impotent resolution on Iraq that resulted in absolutely nothing except the people's business being delayed for that period of time. 
   Today, we are here about earmarks and not in general, but in particular the process by which they are inserted into appropriation bills. It seems to me that one of the fundamental problems we have in addressing this is the lack of openness and transparency in the process and that is what this endeavor is about. 
   It would also strike me that in discussing this process, it is odd to hear the new majority using the President of the United States' budget requests as an absolute baseline of fiscal sanity when throughout the course of the last 4 years in which I have served in this body, they have decried this President of the United States as the epitome of fiscal insanity. 
   So a baseline request from the President is just that. It is a request. 
   Now, in many ways we are then bound as an institution to give deference to both the authorizing committees and then the appropriating committees. But we do not delegate carte blanche our individual power which is vested in us by our constituencies to then oversee the work product of both the authorizing committees and the appropriating committees.     
   Today we are engaged in trying to exercise and reaffirm the right of not only ourselves but of Members on the other side of the aisle to be able to exercise that power that has been temporarily vested in them by their constituents to fully and fairly vet these bills and to make sure that the appropriations are what they are claimed to be, and to make sure that they are put to the best, most efficient and effective purpose that they can be on behalf of the American people. 
   Part of the reason this is necessary is not everyone in this Chamber takes the same approach to earmarks as other Members might. Some Members do no earmarks at all. Some Members prefer to do many, many earmarks. And some Members, I cite myself, do earmarks at the request of their local municipalities so we can serve as conduits back to our States. 
   I come from Michigan. It is critical to us that we receive our fair share of Federal spending because we pay more than our fair share of Federal taxes. My State, Michigan, is a donor State. Michigan is currently in a one-state recession, and it is very important that our taxpayers receive their money back. But that is my individual approach. That approach has to be vetted by 434 of my colleagues here, and only an open and transparent process will ensure that if I have made a priority request through a earmark, it is in keeping with the best interest not only of my district but within the best interest of the entire American people. 
   It would seem to me this is a very reasonable approach, it is a very reasonable request, and it is a request that we are pressing today, as we did yesterday, and will continue to do so because it is part of our constitutional obligation we take as Members of this body. 
   Were we to do otherwise, it would be a dangerous precedent to set because in my mind we are tragically on the verge of coming up with a new kind of system which will allow very little transparency and openness and thus injure the ability of not only ourselves but the American people to know how their money is being spent. 
   In the past there was the old joke that in the Congress you had Republicans, Democrats and appropriators. If the process that we in the minority find so offensive is allowed to proceed, you will now have four distinct entities. You will have Republicans, you will have Democrats, you will have appropriators, and you will have super-appropriators. 
   I don't know if the new super-appropriators get to make these decisions in the dead of night, also get to wear a cape and cowl, if they come with a sporty car so they can chase down Federal earmarks, or if they have a cave or a pole to slide down at their leisure as they go off to work to spend other people's money. 
   I think, however, this would be a tragic development and would oppose it.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. I rise today not to change anyone's mind, but to express to my constituents my reasons for opposing this bill. 
   There will always be time and pretext enough for people to compromise their principles and put forward poor public policy that may in the short run be popular, but in the wrong run will be detrimental to the long-term interests of the American people. We learn this through history. 
   In the 1832 bank panics, Andrew Jackson had the question of whether he would remove the Bank of the United States' charter. The people in the bank did not like that. They threatened the prosperity of the American people. In the middle of the panic, Andrew Jackson looked at these bankers and he said, ``There are no necessary evils in government. The Treasury to you, gentlemen, is closed.'' 
   This was an act of courage on the part of President Jackson, because he understood what was at stake was not merely an ephemeral prosperity or a panic caused by the very people with their handout. Andrew Jackson understood this was about majoritarian rule; it was about the faith in the people's representative institutions and those who inhabit the seats in which they are entrusted. 
   Today we are in a global financial bank panic. It is the first of our global economy. We are seeing a leveraged bailout of the United States Treasury. In the end, these interests that want your money are threatening your prosperity, and the choice you face is this: You will lose potentially your prosperity for a short period of time at the expense of your long-term liberty. Once the Federal Government has got you to take that risk and pass it on to you as a ``moral hazard,'' they will be in the marketplace. And as the free market is diminished, your freedom itself is diminished, and as your Congress does not stand up to these and put forward a better plan that truly protects the taxpayers, that truly has the long-term interests of the United States at heart, you will be in jeopardy of losing both your prosperity and your liberty. 
   The choice is stark, and it was put forward in the book by Dostoevsky. In ``The Brothers Karamazov,'' the grand inquisitor came to Jesus and he said, ``If you wish to subject the people, give them miracle, mystery and authority; but above all, give them bread.'' 
   It has always been the temptation in a crisis especially to sacrifice liberty for short-term promises of prosperity, and it was no mistake that during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution the slogan was ``peace, land and bread.''     
   Today you are being asked to choose between bread and freedom. I suggest that the people on Main Street have said that they prefer their freedom, and I am with them.

   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I greatly appreciate the compassionate concern of the previous speaker for the well-being of the Grand Old Party. It seems that compassionate conservatism these days is far more contagious than many expected and even I would have hoped. I will also tell you that prolonged exposure to the speeches of Ronald Reagan will quickly cure you of that. 
   I would also like to point out to the gentleman, through the Chair, that he points out the rich Republican lobbyists that this town is so awash in. Well, I have good news for him and bad news for the rich Republican lobbyists that are more highly paid these days than the Democrats, as they are now in the majority, which is why you will see so many foreign cars driving around with Kerry-Edwards bumper stickers on them in our Nation's Capital, if not in the Motor City where the UAW might find them. 
   I was told that we are antilabor. As the grandson and son of union members, whose voting record was better on CAFTA than 13 Members of the new majority, I take umbrage at that statement. As the son of schoolteachers, who has a good voting record on education matters, I take umbrage at that. And in terms of voting to send our troops to war and then not voting to fund our veterans, I would point out that in the new majority there are those who voted to send our troops to war and then voted not to fund our soldiers. So let us be careful with our accusations and how we impugn one's motivations. 
   Interestingly, we are not content with the war overseas, and now we see a case where we are going to engage in class warfare over here at home at a very time when we should be united. 
   It is these types of situations that, when I try to explain government and what I do to my wife and I's 10-year-old daughter Amelia, that I spend a lot of time scratching my head, which would explain my balding pate, because I find this place very frustrating. 
   To the gentleman, I know the majority has tried very hard to work on this bill, and it has been called a ``delicate, well-thought-out document.'' If that were the case, how can $1.2 billion be accepted in such a facile fashion at the drop of a hat to simply pacify a minority and to get them to stop addressing this bill? $1.2 million remains a lot of money. And it would be, I would hope, wrong of people to perceive that $1.2 million could either be taken from or put into a bill simply for reasons of convenience and operations of the floor of the United States House of Representatives. 
   But these are the problems that tend to come with governing, as my own party found out. We got to sit in power for 12 years, some of us for far less than that, and we watched and we watched and we watched as the spending and the debt continued to mount and our Nation's taxpayers and families and our party was no longer entrusted by the American people to govern. But I remember at the time I would point out that a lot of those appropriation bills that so many people decried throughout that election were vastly bipartisan exercises in governance, and that there were many votes on this side of the aisle for the excessive spending, and many votes on the other side of the aisle for excessive spending.     
   The rub then came when the majority party at the time, our Republican Party, was accused of spending too much on too many things and for deficit spending. 
   Today we flash forward, and what do we find? We find a situation where we have just recently passed a budget. I didn't vote for it. None of my Republican colleagues voted for it. But it was duly passed. 
   What did that budget do? That budget promised billions in new spending in reserve accounts. Billions in new spending. What else did it promise? What else did it promise? It promised the largest tax increase in American history to pay for it. 
   Now, today, as we go through this appropriation process, we see that some of the promises they are attempting to keep in the new majority. That would be the billions and billions in new spending. Does one not believe that they are going to do everything they can to go through and have the largest tax increase in American history to pay for it, or, in the alternative, they will continue to see the deficit and the debt mount?

   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Granted, I cannot bring you the histrionics and gesticulations because I am not from a big city like New York. I'm just a simple country lawyer from Detroit. 
   But I am reminded of a phrase that Ralph Waldo Emerson used in one of Robert Kennedy's favorite poems. It's called ``Fame.'' And he used the phrase ``Being for Seeming bravely barter.'' And that is what this has become an exercise in. 
   The reason that we are here is not because we want to rush this bill. I think you would be quite pleased if we were in a hurry to leave. I think, Mr. Chairman, that the majority would be very happy with us if we were willing simply to take whatever was offered and move on, as much of what happened during the first grand and glorious 6,000 minutes where if they had the votes, the minority services were not required. 
   The reason that we are here today is so that we can seem to be doing our work. If you pass an appropriation bill, your constituents are going to come back to you and say, Okay, tiger, what was in the appropriation bill? And we will then say, What? Well, I don't really know, but I did my work. 
   It is akin to being on an operating table where the doctor opens you up and knows he has to put something inside of you, and then shoves you off to outpatient therapy saying, Well, don't worry. We will figure that out later and don't think about it because we still haven't decided what is going to go back in you. 
   We are trying to bring transparency to a system that does not have it because it wants to put perception over policy. That is what we are fighting for. It is not our way. It is the American way. We are trying to make sure that we do our work in the sunlight, not in the dark of night, so that America knows we are appropriators, not vampires. 
   As a country lawyer from Detroit, I am reminded that this appropriation process is much like closing the barn door after the horse has left, and when you watch that fine steed leave, you know the rear view is not all that it is cracked up to be. 
   We have learned a painful lesson as a former majority. We did not realize, I think, the historic opportunity we had to lead this Nation to transformational times, but at least we tried to be honest about the process, certainly more honest than the new majority has portrayed themselves to the American people. 
   Mr. Chairman, ``Those who do not learn the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them.'' I sincerely hope so, because you are repeating so many of the mistakes we made, I can hardly get to sleep at night, I am so happy to see it. Except for one thing: The American people deserve better. Give them the process that allows them to weigh their determinations that we make here in a fair, full, and honest manner. Give them the government they need so that you do not become an empty majority as this new minority once was. 
   And I wish to close with this. Prove me wrong. Because as of today, as of tonight, I know two things: My party stalled moving America forward, but right now you have stalled moving America backward. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCOTTER. Very quickly. Through the Chairman, I would like to remind my friends that all spending bills originate in the House, not in the executive branch of Congress; and that a lot of those appropriation bills looked certainly bipartisan at the time. 
   What we have here in front of us is a clear choice, a choice to move America forward, as we have tried to do, or a choice to move America in a new direction, backwards. 
   We are going back to the 1970s. As a child of the 1970s in the Carter administration, I remember how we gutted defense, I remember how our Nation had no intelligence worth anything. And I look back to the Clinton era and I see how the budget deficit that we now have accumulated in a time of war was necessitated by the reduction in our military, the gutting of our intelligence network, the inability to defend America's basic needs. The rush to free trade, which was signed by the Clinton administration, and now the bill came home to roost on the watch of George Bush and the American people on September 11, 2001. It is a history lesson that I hope was not lost upon the America people. 
   Finally, to quote Lewis Carroll, as one of his admirers, ``Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.'' 
   It is time for America to be wide awake to the choice in front of them, and let us come back and move America forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Madam Speaker, before I was elected to Congress, we used to hear--and unfortunately with some justification--that when faced with a crisis, Members of Congress would invariably soil themselves, throw money at the problem, and hoped it went away. Unfortunately, in these dysfunctional economic times, we find that this process has continued. As American families face a potential meltdown of the financial sector, we have seen what I believe to be an inappropriate response starting with this administration. 
   From the time that we were informed that a potential financial meltdown was going to occur, the separate, equal branch of governance, which is the  United States Congress, was told that we had but one alternative, and that if we did not pass it quickly in the time period specified by the executive branch, that our economy would be severely damaged. 
   It has been my opinion that we were elected to serve in this Congress by the sovereign people of the United States, to make important decisions on their behalf, to do it with our due diligence and our devotion that it's due, and to come up with a positive solution to their situation. 
   Last night, as I watched the President of the United States explain his view of this, I was struck by the fact that again we were told that if we did not give unlimited amounts of money, up to $700 billion, and unlimited powers--with lack of adequate oversight--to the executive branch, that we were failing in our due diligence and responsibilities to the American people. 
   I heard the President of the United States say that if we do not support what they put forward as the only alternative to this crisis, we do not understand the need to act. That statement is false. We understand the need to act. 
   We heard from the President of the United States that if we did not support his plan and the Paulson plan, that we did not care about American families. That statement is false. We care very much about American families. 
   What we did not hear was a recognition that a three-page document that gives to the Treasury Secretary and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve unlimited powers--the likes of which Stalin and Mao killed people for--was not an acceptable response to give to this separate, equal branch of government. 
   Today, we are told that House Republicans are standing in the way of a $700 billion use of your tax dollars to bail out the very people who caused this problem. Guilty as charged. House Republicans believe that there is an alternative. 
   The administration tells us that their first, last, only resort is to go to the taxpayers and bail out Wall Street. We fundamentally disagree with this. What we believe should happen is Wall Street should bail out Wall Street. House Republicans believe that the toxic assets that are clogging up our economy should first attempt to be recapitalized by the people sitting on the sidelines with their money waiting for you, the taxpayer, to be fleeced and put it in so they are confident that the market will work. This is not making the market work. 
   I heard from the President last night that the free market has failed.     
   The free market has not failed. The free market is correcting from the bad deeds of actors within that market. It is the government that is trying to interfere in the market for political purposes. 
   We cannot reinflate the bubble to save the American economy. What we need to do is be responsible and lay forward a private recapitalization plan with appropriate backstop that first and foremost protects the innocent, namely the taxpayers. The people who on Main Street invested and saved and had good credit their entire lives should not be asked to go back in and help the cowboy capitalists who shot themselves in the foot. House Republicans understand this. Just as we understand the need to act quickly, we also understand the need to act appropriately. 
   This is not an attempt to engage in an argument with the President. I have admiration for the President. And I have supported the President, as have House Republicans, when he has been correct. But he is in error now. House Republicans stood and supported the Petraeus surge so our troops would have victory in Iraq. Today House Republicans oppose the Paulson splurge so that we can have prosperity in America over the long run. And make no mistake. We understand the gravity of this situation. But we will not engage in a rush to judgment that destroys the possibilities of a free market and prosperity for American families for decades to come. 
   We will not walk out of this room after a forced vote, waving a piece of paper in our hands and claiming ``peace in our time.'' We will do the job we were entrusted. And we will get the job done.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, two quick points as the debate draws to a close. First, I have to question again the use of the term ``compromise.'' The use of the term ``compromise'' implies that the minority party was consulted, our advice was sought, that we could channel the wishes and aspirations and voices of our people into this debate as the legislation moves forward. We were denied that opportunity. Perhaps it would be best to clarify that this is a compromise amongst the Democratic Party itself and not amongst the majority and minority parties. 
   Secondly, this bill continues to ration energy. This is a government rationing of energy, and at this point in time when America needs energy production, it will not meet the needs of people who are suffering.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6842, NATIONAL CAPITAL SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule, and like our previous speaker from Indiana (Mr. Pence), I do support the Childers amendment in the nature of a substitute. But I, too, find it ironic that we are discussing this today when we have so little time to discuss America's future energy security and energy independence. 
   Earlier today we've heard that we will be confronting landmark legislation. I concur with this assessment. Unfortunately, it will not be a landmark energy policy. It is going to be a landmark in political cynicism. 
   We've heard much about a compromise being struck. Yet as a member of a party that has not been consulted on this legislation, let alone involved in a free, open, and transparent process, we are left but to assume there's a compromise amongst the Speaker herself, potentially radical special interest groups, and maybe members of her own caucus that were privileged to be a part of its drafting behind closed doors. 
   Then what do we celebrate, as we've heard the word ``celebrate'' this landmark legislation so much? What do we celebrate? Do we celebrate the end of the House as a free, open, transparent institution where the voices of the American people are expressed through their servants in this Congress, to have an influence on legislation, to have an impact on legislation? Or do we actually, more, commemorate the loss of an individual's ability to serve as legislators rather than as radical rubber stamps for legislation placed under their noses? 
   What does this legislation do? Well, it increases a lot of things. It increases utility prices. It increases gas prices, increases taxes, increases everything but energy. And as we know, this is not what the American people demand. It is not what the American people deserve. 
   So we ask ourselves why. Well, there are two reasons. The first reason comes to us out of the curious visage that we have before us as Members, who in the past would not vote to drill a tooth, now embracing oil derricks as if they were endangered darter snails. 
   The question is why. It's because, as has been pointed out by many of my colleagues, this bill is not a drill bill, and drilling is, by the way, a technique. It is a technique that meets the goal which is maximum American energy production, and in that, this bill falls short. In fact, while you might be tempted to judge this book by its cover, the Dems are in the details and no drilling will occur, for many of the reasons put forward earlier. 
   So you ask yourself why. Why would we not expand supply? Why would we not allow Americans to access their own domestic energy resources to help successfully transition to American energy security and independence? 
   The reality is this. There are people who believe that high energy prices will help make this transition necessary, will force the American people to radically change their lifestyles in the pursuit of some abstract dystopia put forward by radical environmentalists and others who seek to undo the industrial age in American economic prosperity during this transition to a globalized economy. 
   That is the real basis of this discussion. That is the basis of this debate. We can have an all-of-the-above energy strategy that responsibly transitions America into a future of energy security and independence, or we can have a radical restructuring of their very lifestyle through the government regulation and rationing of American energy. 
   The consequences upon the people of this country will be devastating and, in the end, they will not be fooled. For while this bill comes before us and we are told the Republicans should not take ``yes'' for an answer, the reality is this: The American people will not mistake ``no'' for a solution, and in the end, they will also come to the conclusion that by not increasing American supply of their own energy resources, this deadbeat, drill-nothing Democrat Congress is Big Oil's best friend.

   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the sponsor of the resolution and the chairman of the committee, the ranking member, and all of my colleagues who are joining me in support of honoring the heroic members of the 303rd Bombardment Group. 
   It has rightly been said that they were the greatest generation; and yet, it is important, through the adoption of resolutions and other instances, where we, as a people, recognize their sacrifice for the very liberty upon which our free Republic is founded, always remember that their service to our Nation did not end with World War II, for they continued in their transition to civilian life where they also helped form the foundation of our Nation. But it is also critical that, too, at this juncture, where again another generation of Americans finds themselves tasked with defending freedom in its maximum hour of danger, that we never forget the example that these citizens, soldiers and airmen set for the rest of us, not just as a matter of history, but as a matter for our progeny that they may ever breathe free.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (AMERICA NEEDS TO DEVELOP ITS OWN NATURAL RESOURCES -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue and for yielding me some time. 
   We have heard a lot throughout the past years about making America more energy independent. Myself, being a natural contrarian, have heard recently members of my own party saying that the Speaker has yet to unveil her plan to lower gas prices. I think this is an error. I think the more disturbing news is we have seen the Democratic party's plan to lower gas prices, and it has failed miserably. 
   If we remember last year, we were told we were taking the steps toward American energy independence. We passed a ``Lethargy Bill,'' as I referred to it, that was going to solve all our problems. We were going to innovate our way out of this, we were going to conserve our way out of this. We were going to throw American taxpayers' money to India and Communist China and around the world to make the red bureaucrats green. 
   When the Speaker was recently on Larry King's show last week, apparently she was under the impression that their plan had worked. When asked what the price of gas was, she replied, $2.56. She was off by $1. Evidently the pattern of wishful thinking had already set in; that their wonderfully detailed plan that they had waited to unveil had already been hoisted upon an unsuspecting American electorate. And these are the results. 
   Now we hear the ``blame game'' beginning. Because having had their energy plan fail, they are now looking for scapegoats. When politicians come looking for scapegoats to explain their failure, I assure you of one thing, it's going to cost taxpayers money. It may cost you directly, it may cost you indirectly, but this will cost you money. 
   I will say why. First, their policy having failed for a fundamental reason, they can come up with no better thing to do than to try to affix blame. Their policy has failed because it's built on a 21st century energy fallacy. The fallacy is that environmental conservation and energy production are irreconcilable. The Republican party takes the opposite view. We believe that a plan of conservation and innovation and responsible production through the use of green technologies and others is entirely possible for our free people, and it can help increase the supply of domestic energy and help to alleviate the  cost of gas at the pump and the cost of energy throughout our economy, which is eating into family budgets even as we speak and do nothing in this 110th Congress. 
   Now what are they going to do instead? They are going to put taxes on energy companies. Windfall profits tax. I remember something Ronald Reagan said a long time ago. Corporations are not taxpayers, corporations are tax collectors. 
   So here's how this works. This is the new energy plan. The new energy plan is to divert attention from the fact this Congress has done nothing to increase the supply of oil or domestic energy to help Americans. They will then try to tax the energy companies. The energy companies will turn right around and put that cost into your pump. It will be passed right on. This is not my speculation, this is what economists tell you almost universally. 
   Then the politician comes to you, after Government has more of your money, and says, Thank me. I punished those bad people. And you say to them, Well, that is great, but what about me? Is there any more energy being produced? You have taxed it, there is less of it, the price continues to go up. You walk out of here with more of my money. I don't think the American people are going to be grateful for that. 
   Another short term gimmick that we are hearing is we must demand that OPEC produce more oil. This is sheer genius. Sheer genius. We are now hearing calls from the Democratic party to make America more energy dependent on foreign sources. They pump more, we buy more, they keep the money. There is no energy independence in this shortsighted call, there is just another attempt to deflect blame and responsibility away from this Chamber, where it belongs, the Chamber across the hall, where it belongs, and from a total failure of a 21st century fallacy to fix energy needs in America and make us more energy independent. 
   Now, as we know, these costs go throughout the economy. They are inflating the cost of living for all Americans. And yet there's talk, talk, talk, talk. But there are people who are not talking about energy. We are engaged in a fight for the global access to oil with the Communist Chinese as we speak. They are in every continent of our world and they are trying as hard as they can to gain direct access to these foreign sources. 
   At the very time the United States of America, as the distinguished gentleman from Texas points out, is trying to deter American companies from finding new sources of oil, at the very time we are told by some voices that we demand energy production everywhere but America, it is easy in our day and age to say to ourselves that there is no real direct cost to Government. We live in a credit card age. We don't live in the age my parents grew up in, my grandparents, and I was raised to respect you save your money, you plan your budget, you work responsibly, and hopefully the good Lord takes care of you. No. 
   But when you think that votes on an energy bill or votes on a regulation that is imposed or votes on litigation that is imposed or votes on taxation that seem indirectly removed from you, there's a cost to all this. When we talk about the cost of taxation, litigation, regulation and an aversion to production of American energy, you need not go to the CBO to have this scored. 
   Look at the gentleman from Illinois's chart. That is the cost of a government that is unaware of what is happening in America, what our future energy needs are, and who do not understand that the American people, when challenged, will meet that challenge, we will provide for environmental conservation, free market innovation, and the domestic production of energy to take America where it needs to be, which is energy independent. But then, again, we have always viewed America as the solution, and we always will. 
   I thank the gentleman for all the work that he has done on this, and I look forward to continuing this discussion with him in similar forums, for it is important that the American people understand something. According to the chart in front of us today, it is clear that in the 110th Congress Democrats don't care what they cost you. 
   I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Chairman, I come from Michigan, a State that respects honesty, even when one is in error, so I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by the integrity, if not the ultimate decision, that we heard from the gentleman from New Jersey. 
   We heard a lot about change over the course of a year or two, and I too must be honest. We have seen change in how Washington budgets. We have seen change. We have gone from bad to worse. 
   Now, as I recall sitting in Michigan, living there with my wife and children, I have seen a similar instance out of my State government which, in a one-State depression, faced the choice of allowing working families to keep their money and protect their budgets or raising taxes and protecting the State budget. 
   They started with the smokers. They went after them. They took their money. Nobody likes smokers. Who cares? Then they had a one-time-only property tax advance. They never did tell us when the property tax relief comes, but I am sure one day it will. It is only once. And then they raised our income taxes. They raised our income taxes because by then it was for the greater good. And whose family budget wants to stay in the way of the greater good? Certainly not somebody like me, somebody whose children are looking at college, somebody whose mother may be getting older and may need care, somebody who worries that their dreams of their future for their children might go up in ashes in a State that is mismanaged by a government that cares more about itself than it cares about the sovereign citizens who elected it. 
   And then I come out here to do their work as their servant and I see the same thing. I see the same thing. I hear the same talk. I see the change that was promised and delivered. The sad part is the promise was implied. 
   I remember hearing the government spent too much. Got to stop. The government spent too much. We are going to change that. I didn't hear the part where you said the government spends too much. We are going to spend more. 
   I heard people talk about working families struggling, and we are only going to tax the rich. We are only going to tax the rich. Evidently we must not be doing too well. There is not enough rich to back up the promises. So what do we do? The largest tax increase in American history on everybody. Well, that is a change. I concede the point. It is a change. 
   But I was shocked again with both the honor and the erroneous conclusion of the gentleman from New Jersey. I never in my life expected to see a Member of Congress apologize for not raising taxes on the American people. That is a change. I grant you that. 
   The question is then, if the American people need to have their taxes raised to come into prosperity, surely you know what the ultimate number is. How high, how fast until we get to prosperity? How much more of my money has to go the Federal Government before I can dream for my family and feed them? Surely somebody must know that number. 
   Is this largest tax increase in American history going to be the last? Are we then going to reach the American Dream? Are we going to have our liberty and economics to pursue that dream through our own works, or will government have to do that for us? Are we going to get bureaucrats as life coaches? What is going to be necessary? Give me a number. I haven't heard that number. I haven't heard that percent. 
   I think the one thing that we do need to change immediately right now in rejecting this budget scheme to bloat, to soak your family budget, to bloat the Federal Government's budget, is I want to hear somebody admit that America's economic prosperity comes from our free people, not from the growth of government, for that is a truth to hear that would be a refreshing change of late.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Chairman, I wish to begin by echoing the sentiments of the gentleman from Texas. The distinguished gentleman from New York has much to be proud about, coming from humble circumstances and a difficult area, to come here to the people's House and serve his constituents. It not only shows the strength of character he has; it shows what the American Dream is all about. I give you your due, sir. 
   Talk about another man who came from humble circumstances, Dennis Vincent Patrick Mullen McCotter, my father. A man whose father was an Irish immigrant to this country, whose mother died when he was young and he and his brother and sister were sent to other families to stay, eventually winding up in the St. Francis Home for Boys. He got a football scholarship, worked his whole life to put his brother and sister through college, in addition to himself. He grew up and became a teacher, became a proud union Democrat. 
   He taught me something about government that I have never forgotten. He said government spends nothing. It is the American taxpayers who pay for everything. I recall a lot of talk last year about Federal spending being out of control. I could hear my father in my head reminding me that you are spending other people's money. The money does not belong to the government. And many people who have forgotten his simple wisdom paid a high price for that. 
   And yet today we find ourselves under the misconception that somehow this is money that belongs to the government as opposed to the people who pay the taxes. This is the only way I believe that we can come to logically reconcile the concept of a 9.9 percent increase in new domestic spending juxtaposed to the rhetoric that we heard so much last fall about trying to get Federal spending under control. 
   It would strike me that my father's advice on this would be: Remember, this is not your money. You are spending other people's money. And if you tell them that you are going to be fiscally responsible with the sweat of their brow, with their hard-earned money, you had better keep that promise. Because if you do not, another thing that my father, who continues to get much wiser as I get much older, taught me, fair is fair. And if the American people believe that the pines that were offered to fiscal sanity last year are not matched by the deeds in these appropriation bills, there will be many Members on the other side of the aisle who will find that they will forfeit a great deal for their lack of loyalty to their commitments.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (ENERGY SOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. I thank the gentleman from Iowa, and I rise to address some of the issues that were raised by our colleague from New York, whose  sincere earnestness was not matched by his argument's accuracy. 
   Let us look at this situation squarely in the face. You can either increase America's supply of its own domestic natural resources in oil and gas, or you won't. Now, if you want to support it and increase the supply of American oil and natural gas, which we have to understand is that every time you play politics, for whatever ideological reason, to have government imposed rationing over America's production of their own domestic natural resources, you are going to increase the cost to the American consumers, because the more you hold back, the less supply is added, and this at the very time that global demand increasing. 
   What you are going to want to do is increase the supply as best you can, as fast as you can, so you can help Americans who are suffering. What we have seen out of this Democratic party is quite simply a fig leaf plan to do nothing. 
   First, do-nothing bills that come to this Congress that are purported to be energy bills are in fact lethargy bills that are designed in fact to have a supermajority required to pass them. Why are they designed so have a supermajority to pass them? Why make it harder to do something that will actually help Americans at the pump? Because they are designed to fail, and they are not allowed to be amended by the Members on this floor. So this is part of a cynical strategy to put forward a do-nothing bill, get nothing done, and refuse to accept your accountability as the Democratic majority. 
   All we are asking the Democratic majority is to either agree with us to have a bipartisan vote on the all-of-the-above energy plan or to be honest with the American people. We have heard that somehow the Republican Party is engaged in a myth. Well, if it is a myth, then let us put it to the test on the floor with a vote. Let us see how many Democrats believe it is a myth. 
   The Republican Party can pass nothing in this House without Democratic support. We believe we have it, and if we don't, we will accept the defeat, move forward and try to find a way to work with the Democratic Party's leadership, which seems to believe that the United States does not need to increase its own domestic energy supplies, but rather needs to go cold turkey into an oil-free future, which I continue to stress is going to callously inflict pain upon Americans' pocketbooks and their quality of life. 
   This is an ideological battle, but it is not an ideological battle amongst the majority of Members of Congress. Again, I could be wrong, but give us an up-or-down vote. 
   In fact, as you know, through the Chair to the gentleman from Iowa, as you know, we have seen this Democratic Congress take a 5 week paid vacation while 84,000 Americans were put out of work. The Speaker of this House had time to write a book, but not a bill on energy. We still do not have a bill on energy. We still have nothing in front of us, except what? A bill that has already been introduced called the American Energy Act. And whether it is fact or fiction, or good or bad public policy, we can debate that, if you let us. We can debate that and have a vote, if you let us. 
   If you allow this representative institution, this beckon of democracy to all the world to actually function as it is intended under the Constitution of the United States and as it has been entrusted to us by our constituents, put it up for a vote. Let our voices be heard on behalf of our constituents, and let the majority, if not a party prevail, but the people prevail. That is all we ask. 
   But let us be clear about what the stakes are and the positions are. We support an all-of-the-above strategy. We want maximum domestic energy production as a part of it. We do not want minimum energy production as part of an ideologically zealous pursuit of some unobtainable future in the near term which is going to devastate Americans' lives now. 
   I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (THE TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I have great empathy for the gentleman from Utah who hoped for a big ending. I would prefer just a passable beginning; so bear with me. 
   I come from the State of Michigan, as my colleague who spoke earlier, PETER HOEKSTRA, so well earlier discussed. We are a State that is suffering. We are a manufacturing State that has seen job losses for several years in a row. And what we have also seen because of the high price of energy is a drop-off in our tourism trade both from Michigan residents inside the State who could not afford to take a family vacation and for people who come to our wonderful Great Lakes State to recreate. This is a twofold problem which has done something to the State of Michigan which has happened to no other of the 49 States. Last year Michigan became the only State in the Union to have a rise in poverty and a decrease in median income. 
   The cost of energy is exacerbating this suffering greatly. Now, because my State wants to work under difficult economic times, I want to express the absolute disgust that many of us have for the way people who have been elected by the sovereign citizens of the United States to serve in this Congress have worked on their jobs. We have seen over the month of August in America 84,000 American jobs lost in large part due to energy costs. In response, the Democratic-controlled Congress took a 5-week paid vacation. 
   On our part as Republicans, we came to this floor every day this Congress should have been in session and had a speak-in with the American people about what we hoped to do on their behalf if given the chance by the Democratic majority to actually come here and earn the salaries that we were being paid. We got no response from the Democratic Party. But we did get a response from the American people. And the response that we got from the American people was loud and clear: It was we would like to have a fair up-or-down vote on the bipartisan all-of-the-above American energy strategy. 
   What is in this? As the speaker from Utah stressed, it is not simply a drill-only bill. It has three key components as we move towards an important goal. The first is maximum American energy production. The second is commonsense conservation. The third is free market green innovations. 
   Now, why do we need all three? So we can have a responsible transition to American energy security and independence. If we do not recognize that this problem is one of supply and demand, if we do nothing to increase the supply, you can do one of two things: You can let the cost continue to escalate or you can focus on the demand. If you focus solely on the demand, what you are doing to the American people is saying what some people have said about American gas prices: ``We are better off without cheap gas.'' This is a cold turkey policy which for ideological reasons will accomplish nothing but pain and suffering unnecessarily on the American people's family budgets and on their pursuit of the American Dream, which I point out is not necessarily to be mandated that it has to occur on foot. We want a responsible transition to American energy security and independence, one that makes the American people full participants in this transformational undertaking and does not continue the state of affairs that is occurring now here in their own country. 
   Who are the best friends of Big Oil? My friend from Utah touched upon it. The best friends of Big Oil are the people who do nothing. And for 5 weeks we saw who was doing nothing and we saw who was trying to do something. If you want to be a friend to Big Oil, continue the government-mandated rationing of American energy. Stop Americans from extracting their own natural resources to increase supply as we transition to American energy security and independence because if you do not allow that supply to increase here at home, American oil from American soil, you're going to continue to see prices rise. You're going to continue to see the Big Oil companies that you claim not to like reap even greater harvest at the gas pump, and meanwhile you will know that you were complicit in this, and we will make sure that the rest of the country does too. 
   In the final analysis, if we do not have a fair up-or-down vote, the suffering is going to continue and no amount of political chicanery is going to mask the fact to the American people that you refused to act and when you were compelled to act, you refused to do anything substantive that was going to help them because all they have to do is drive. All they have to do is need any form of energy, be it gasoline, be it home heating oil, and check the price and see what did or did not occur on your behalf and who did or did not act. 
   When we came back into session, what did we find? We found trout waiting for us. We decided we were going to do something about trout and perhaps that would spawn an energy bill that perhaps could help Americans. This is yet to prove the case because what we have seen is a continuation of the 5-week paid Democrat vacation that has stumbled into week 6 with nothing substantive being done about energy prices, an internal debate amongst their own caucus as to what to do if to do anything. And we stand here with not a bluff but a bill. We have stood here with the American Energy Act and asked for one thing: an up-or-down vote. They have refused. 
   I have no doubt that as we proceed in this process, the American people are not only going to be outraged by the fact that we have done nothing on energy to help them, they are going to look at a calendar as put forward by the Democratic majority in this Congress that has something that you who work for a living could never do. Between August 1 and January 1, this Democratic Congress cares so much about working Americans and energy that they will meet for 15 working days out of 5 months for full pay. You try doing that at your job, if you're lucky enough to have one, thanks to this Democratic Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to defend the sovereignty and national dignity of our friend and ally, Estonia; condemn Russia's unwarranted intrusions against these free people; and affirm our commitment to America and Estonia's common cause of human freedom. 
   After a long, illegal and unjust Soviet occupation, Estonia now rightly and proudly stands by our side in the ranks of free nations. Nobly and selflessly, Estonia is steadfast in its defense of civilization from our barbaric enemies, and has championed the cause of human freedom throughout our world. Disturbingly, last week, this free people's very national sovereignty was threatened. 
   In what should come as no surprise to Americans, whose own founding generation gained their independence from an imperial power, Estonia relocated an aging statue of a Soviet-era soldier from a central location in Tallinn to the city's Garrison Cemetery. Obstinately refusing to recognize Estonia's patent right to do so, or the obvious irony in the statue's new location, Russia used this routine act of municipal administration by the City of Tallinn to engage in a coordinated attempt to interfere in Estonia's internal affairs. 
   Using state-controlled TV broadcasts into Estonia, the former Soviet Union used its state-controlled television broadcasts to spew propaganda into Estonia. This provocative Russian propaganda falsely claimed Estonia's relocation of the insulting Soviet statue constituted an international crisis. Russia did so to agitate and, thereby, incite the vandalism and violence which occurred in Tallinn from April 26 through 29. 
   Prior to these outbreaks of violence, Russian embassy officials were observed meeting with the organizers of radical pro-Russia fringe groups; and, while Russian-speaking mobs roamed Tallinn's streets, Estonia's government Web servers came under cyber attack, the cause of which was later traced to IP addresses located in Moscow and owned by the Russian presidential administration. 
   So, too, there is a new report Russia has conveniently discovered a need to repair its rail links entering Estonia and, as a result, is suspending oil shipments to Estonia. 
   Further, Russia continues to flout the Vienna Convention by allowing Russian nationalist extremists to surround and vandalize Estonia's embassy in Moscow. 
   Mr. Speaker, when one weighs this inexcusable incident along with Russia's recent refusal to adhere to the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, its recent arrest of Russian democracy advocates and its refusal to honor past agreements to withdraw its military forces from countries such as Moldova, one is compelled to question a former KGB lieutenant colonel's commitment to democracy; and whether the red bear is awakening from its hibernation to once again feast upon the free peoples of Eastern Europe and the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join in a righteous defense of Estonia's sovereignty; a condemnation of Russia's belligerent intrusions into this democratic nation's internal affairs; and affirm, in the tradition of American Presidents from Harry Truman to Ronald Reagan, we will stand united against tyranny with our Estonian brothers and sisters as one free people.

   As the gentleman from Tennessee talked about, we want a bridge. We want a responsible transition from where we are today to where America becomes energy-independent and secure. We believe we need maximum American energy production, commonsense conservation, and free-market, green innovations to provide that responsible transition that does not allow for the callous infliction of economic pain upon the American people. 
   And when you think about what we hear in phrases like, ``I'm trying to save the planet, I'm trying to save the planet,'' what we're really hearing is that the party that was elected to lower our gas prices, the Democratic Party, has made a subtle shift in what they're trying to accomplish. They're now trying to break us off our addiction--not to foreign oil simply; they are now trying to break our addiction to oil. 
   So, in short, their solution to the problem of high gas prices is to make sure that no one has access to any gas at all. And that's why another quote, which I'm sure you'll put up, is that they have described, in their own Democratic staff's words, ``Drive smaller cars and wait for the wind.'' This is not a responsible solution. 
   Like many people, when I was growing up--I'm 43--I remember something called the ABC Wide World of Sports. I remember ``The Agony of Defeat.'' And I used to like Evel Knievel. Now, there was one time when Evel Knievel, instead of just jumping over cars and busses--you know, he worked for a living, it's tough work; if you can get it, it pays well--he was going to jump something called the Snake River Canyon. And I remember watching this on a little, tiny TV screen with my dad. And my dad looked at it, just looked at Evel and his little suped-up motorcycle, he looked at this enormous Snake River Canyon, and my dad said, ``That boy ain't gonna get there from here.'' 
   And when I think of the Democrats' energy strategy, whereby we have no domestic production of our own natural resources from the Outer Continental Shelf, from ANWR, from anybody else, anywhere else, and they tell us, we're going to fix this with green technological innovations, it's going to be magic, I think of poor Evel Knievel. The only difference is that, in trying to jump immediately, cold turkey, from our current petroleum-based economy into some distant green future where we do not need our own domestic energy resources, is we are not simply taking the American people over the Snake River Canyon, the Democratic majority is pushing them over an economic cliff. And they are already beginning to see where the abyss lays every time they drive by and buy gas at the pump. 
   Now, as we heard about the process last night, people think, why does process matter? I don't know. It seems to me that as a sovereign citizen of our free republic, we live in a democracy for a reason; that the will of one person will not be imposed upon any sovereign citizen of the United States, certainly not by the subservient Members of Congress because we work for these people. These people are our bosses, and they want their 
   voices heard on the floor of this House. And on an issue as critical as American energy and how we transition to a secure future not only for ourselves, but more importantly, for our children, they expect to have their voices heard through their elected representatives. 
   And as the gentleman from Georgia pointed out, we heard several promises about what an open process this was going to be, how every vote was going to count, how every voice was going to be heard and we would come together in a bipartisan fashion to serve the American people. And yet, what did we see? We saw a bill drafted in the dead of night by a Speaker, handed to her Rules Committee, no amendments allowed, and voted, rubber-stamped by her Democratic Congress, with no debate on this floor, no dissent about amendments, no chance to offer alternatives, no committee process. Silence, silence, in terms of input on this bill. 
   And then we saw something that I thought I would never see. We saw 24 people who had co-sponsored a bipartisan bill, who had sang its praises to their public and to the rest of the American people, and they voted against it--and I didn't really hear a good reason put forward--so they could pass a sham drill bill. 
   Now, we've heard a lot about why the Republicans didn't do certain things over the course of their majority. And we paid a heavy price--and a rightful price, as many of us have admitted. We were put into minority, from majority to minority status by the American people, and we are learning a painful lesson. But let us not forget the people who obstructed a sound, sane, productive American energy policy for the entire time they were in the minority. They act as if they had no hand in it. 
   When we were in the majority, we tried, we tried mightily. Many times the House would pass legislation and it would get to the Senate, yet the Democratic minority did everything they could to prevent the expansion of American domestic energy production to the level sufficient that it would serve the American people and lower the gas prices. The only difference now that they're in the majority is they have to pretend that they're trying to lower them. 
   And that's why, when you pass a bill out of this House called a compromise bill when you have not talked to anyone on this side of the aisle about what goes in the bill, it means it's a compromise amongst yourselves. That is a unilateral compromise. So let's be clear about who compromised with who. 
   And then when it comes to the floor, it's called ``landmark legislation,'' it's  going to create jobs. And if you vote against this, you are a captive of Big Oil because you don't want to lock up 88 percent of America's reserves? 
   As our friend Steve Scalise from Louisiana said, the Democratic ``sham drill bill'' might as well have been written by OPEC; it's going to make them a lot of money when America doesn't produce its own oil and gas. 
   And the best part is their unilateral compromise the Speaker cut with whomever, they didn't bother to talk to the Senate. As Senator Landrieu from Louisiana mentioned, that bill is dead on arrival in the Senate. How do the statements we've heard yesterday, the justifications, the compromise, landmark legislation, when your own Democratic Senators think it's dead on arrival? 
   Where is the hope for the economically struggling families across America? Where is your sense of responsibility, not only to the people of this country, but to their House right here, to this institution? Where is the hope for the American people who are suffering under energy prices, skyrocketing since you took power in this place? There isn't. Because it's a sham. 
   And it is the Democratic Senate that will prove it. It is not Republican Luddites that don't want to go forward towards a more ``green'' future. What it is is the Democratic Senate telling the Democratic House we can't stomach your bill. 
   Now, the thing that I think that everybody should remember is there is a solution to this. If and when this happens, if the Democratic Senate refuses to pass the Democratic House ``lethargy bill,'' this Democratic majority here in the House, the Democratic majority in the Senate, this Democratic Congress can say we will not leave here until a real piece of energy legislation helping the American people is signed into law, until we have done the job we have been elected to do on behalf of the American people. I do not think that is too much to ask. I do not think that is something that the American people should be denied. 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. I thank the gentleman. Earlier the gentleman from Tennessee had mentioned that we are going to be looking at the prospect of a speculators bill on the floor again. My question is, regardless of the merits of the speculators bill, it is a simple proposition to anyone watching. 
   We have heard much debate about energy policy. I remember hearing much of this back in a very unpleasant period of our Nation's history called the 1970s. What is old is new again. So when we hear about the speculators bill, the Democratic Congress, the Democratic majority, had come in with a reputation for being against the production of American domestic energy. Again, it was not limited to the technique of drilling. Clean coal, nuclear energy, all sorts of alternatives they were opposed to. 
   Now, if you were investing your money in the energy market and you saw the anti-American energy party take power in Washington, and you understood the concept of supply and demand, that as demand goes up, if supply stays stagnant, prices skyrocket, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that when the Democratic majority came into Washington, it was against the domestic production of America's own energy resources, that something was going to give and the prices were going to shoot through the roof and you were going to make a lot of money. 
   So, again what you see is the total denial of responsibility for their policies, many of which have failed to be implemented, having an impact on markets. Just as we will hear later on, or throughout the rest of the year, the 12 days or so that they even show up for the work they are paid to do, is when you promise the largest tax increase in American history in your budgets, when your chairman of the Ways and Means Committee talks about the ``mother of all tax increases,'' this is going to have affect on markets. 
   This is going to have an effect on the rational, hard-working Americans, who every day know that as much as they  scrimp and save, here comes big brother government to take that money right out of your pocket. So consequences of ideas, or even bad ideas especially, can be detrimental to the average, hard-working American. 
   Now, you and I, through the Chair the gentleman from Georgia, we know one thing: The best economic stimulus for the United States of America is an all-of-the-above energy strategy that gets that trend line on energy prices stabilized and going down so that the unemployment numbers can stabilize and start going down; so speculators start losing money because the supply of oil will be coming online and they know it; so big oil doesn't make the money as the supply floods the market to meet the demand and the prices stabilize and go down; so hard-working Americans know they are not going to have to choose between freezing and eating, they are not going to have to worry about whether they can drive to see their doctor in rural areas; so they can make sure they still work in manufacturing because the fixed cost of energy hasn't driven their job offshore or killed it altogether. 
   We know this, which is why we are so passionate about helping the people who have entrusted us with the opportunity to serve them in this, their House. 
   I will wrap it up with this, the gentleman from Georgia. There are many people who say, Republicans, you weren't great. You told us you stood for things. You told us you believed our liberty was from God, not the government; our prosperity was from the private sector, not the public sector. 
   Yes, we did, and we did not do a good enough job keeping with our principles. 
   There is a difference between us and this Democratic majority. I want to know what the succinct enunciation of the principles upon which you base policy are. Because what I see in the energy debate, or lack thereof, and the Democrat sham energy bill is a quite simple proposition. They support the government rationing of American energy. You will get 12 percent when you are suffering. We will lock up 88 percent forever. That is the gist of their argument. 
   Why does this matter now? Because you hear more of the same promises that the gentleman from Georgia listed and had proven broken. And when you start to do your thinking this year, as the American people are want to do, I will be more than happy if the American voters judge this Democratic Congress not by the fact that it took America in a new direction to a 9 percent approval rating, which technically makes the Democratic Congress the most hated in American history; I want Americans to look at two numbers. 
   I want Americans to look at the price of gas when the Democratic Party took power in January of 2007, promising to lower them; and I want them to look at the price of gas, oh, maybe around early November 2008. And tell you me if you have changed your mind, if you no longer think this Democratic Congress deserves to be the most hated in American history. Because they have a chance to work with us. We are putting politics aside. We will compromise in a real bipartisan fashion to help the people whole elected us. 
   But if you refuse, there is nothing we can do, because, as the gentleman started out earlier, the math doesn't add up in our favor.

   Mr. McCOTTER. I've long thought that civics should be taught as earnestly as possible in our schools. 
   Yesterday, we saw the spectacle of a Democratic House sham energy bill being passed out of here and lauded as if the problem had been solved. The problem is no one had consulted with the Democratic Senate, which had declared it dead on arrival. 
   Now, for a bill to become law, it must pass both Chambers and be signed by the President of the United States. Only in that way can meaningful American energy security and independence be secured. That is why I have introduced House Concurrent Resolution 417 that says that it is the sense of this Congress that we will not adjourn until meaningful energy legislation has been passed into law to help the American people through this difficult time. 
   Now, again, I have to do this because there seem to be some who think that simply passing a sham energy bill for political cover out of this body is going to help any American struggling at the pump. It will not. Let them put your money where their mouth is and stay here until they get the job done.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (RECOGNIZING NORTH PLATTE, NEBRASKA, AS ``RAIL TOWN USA'' -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. The joys of a segue. 
   It's right in this time to concede that despite Republicans over the course of August talking about the Democratic majority taking a 5-week paid vacation, that we do recognize when this institution has acted with due alacrity. Today we have before us the opportunity to name North Platte, Nebraska, Rail Town USA. We could not have done so at a better time, because jumping into the competition for the coveted title of Rail Town USA is Washington, D.C. 
   This week we have seen a bill drafted in the dead of night, sent to this floor and rubber-stamped by the Democratic majority and proclaimed to solve America's energy crisis. This is as unfortunate as it is injurious. America has an energy crisis. It also has representative institutions who seek to deal with this problem, so the processes put forward, so that the voices of our constituents could be heard, so that true compromise could be found. 
   And yet in Rail Town Washington, what have we seen as a result? A sham energy bill sent to a Democratic Senate by a Democratic House, and a pronunciation from a Democratic Senator herself was that the bill was dead on arrival. What we do today is important to recognize Rail Town USA. But as the gentlelady pointed out, what Americans can do and the challenges they can transcend acting together is what truly makes North Platte, Nebraska, Rail Town USA, because it shows what, in a time of crisis, people coming together for the common good, sincerely and earnestly, putting forth the effort can accomplish. We could well learn and emulate their efforts. And yet we do not. 
   In this time where Americans are suffering, they should expect no less from their servants in Congress than to do this. Because to do anything else is to diminish not only ourselves as your servants, if that were possible in this Democratic Congress, but it diminishes the institution itself as a beacon of representative democracy for all the world. 
   Critically, I think we can change this. I think there is still time that we could learn from the people of North Platte, Nebraska, and their worthy history, that we still have time to come together. And if we do not come together before this Congress adjourns, a relatively short period of time, I suggest we make a commitment to each other, like the people of North Platte, Nebraska. Let us tell the American people that until this energy crisis of our time is solved, until their servants in the United States Congress come together on a truly bipartisan bill that can be signed into law and relieve your pain at the pump and guarantee American energy and security, we will stay here. We will serve the full time that you elected us to work in this Chamber on your behalf. Because to leave here and go play politics while the American people suffer is not worthy of this institution, and it is certainly not worthy of the example set forward by the people of North Platte, Nebraska, Rail Town USA.

Today, in a bipartisan moment that reflects what is both the best in us and is expected of us, we come together to ensure that we do not take them for granted.

I won't bring up whether she regrets it or not. 
   I say this because, as we raise our own children and they share the same experiences with the natural beauty of the Great Lakes, we are honoring a commitment to future generations to ensure that, for the time to come, our Great Lakes remain not only the boon of our quality of life and to the vibrancy of our economy, but they remain the most visible way we in Michigan and in the Midwest in America can teach our children that we honored our duty to defend those Great Lakes and pass them on for future generations.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (COMMUNIST CHINA AND CIFUS: ``DROPPING THE SHARK'' -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, to resuscitate the 1970s sitcom ``Happy Days,'' Arthur Fonzarelli was aquatically clad in a swimsuit, white T-shirt and leather jacket and filmed performing a harrowing water ski jump over a shark. Though The Fonz pulled it off, the network pulled the plug on ``Happy Days.'' Subsequently, inane attempts to prevent a show's cancellation by scripting an absurd season have been coined ``jumping the shark.'' 
   But what should we call situations where the U.S. Government willfully suspends its disbelief Communist China is a strategic threat and, instead, appeases it? I suggest we call such instances ``dropping the shark.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States must review and block Bain Capital and Communist China's Huawei Technologies' deal with the 3Com Corporation. If approved, Communist China's Huawei Technologies stake in the 3Com Corporation will gravely compromise our free Republic's national security. 
   The 3Com Corporation is a world leader in intrusion prevention technologies designed to prevent secure computer networks from hacker infiltration, and our Department of Defense extensively utilizes them. These technologies were severely tested this June when Communist China hacked into our DOD's computer networks and caused a shutdown. Given this and other instances of Communist China's persistent cyberwarfare against us, approving this sale would be an abject abnegation of CIFUS's duty to protect America's vital defense technologies from enemy acquisition. 
   Few doubt the aims of Communist China's Huawei Technologies, which was set up in 1988 by a People's Liberation Army officer to build military communications networks. The pending deal with Huawei is deemed ``really worrisome'' by a former Pentagon cybersecurity expert, and as reported by Bill Gertz in today's Washington Times, a current Pentagon official confirmed, ``Huawei is up to its eyeballs with the Chinese military''; while another official stated ``we are proposing to sell the PLA a key to our front door. This is a very dangerous trend.'' 
   This is not the first time Communist China's Huawei Technologies has raised legitimate American concerns. In January 2006 Newsweek described Huawei Technologies as ``a little too obsessed with acquiring advanced technology.'' Appearing before the House Armed Services Committee on September 19, 2002, Professor Gary Milhollin, Director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, testified as to the extent of the danger: ``The history of Huawei shows how sensitive American exports can wind up threatening our own Armed Forces. So when we talk about export controls, we are not just talking about money. We are talking about body bags.'' 
   This is not hyperbole. At the start of this decade, Huawei violated U.N. sanctions and illegally provided a fiber-optic network to Iraq. This network linked the Iraqi military's air defense network. Moreover, the CIA-led Iraq Survey Group's final report concluded Huawei illicitly participated in providing transmission switches for Iraq's fiber-optic communications. In August  2001, this Chinese-made fiber-optic network was bombed because it was part of the Iraqi air defense missile sites firing at U.S. and allied aircraft which were enforcing a no-fly zone. And also, for the record, this company found time to help the Taliban too. 
   In other business practices, Huawei appears equally cavalier about the rule of law. In 2003, Cisco Systems formally charged Huawei Technologies with grievous intellectual property violations, including patent infringements. Again, this should be unsurprising, given the strong ties between Huawei Technologies, the Communist Chinese Government and its armed wing, the People's Liberation Army. Not coincidentally, in only two decades, Huawei has expanded to over 100 countries, amassed sales of over $87 million, and significantly contributed to the PLA's arms buildup. Obviously, through this proposed acquisition the comrades at Huawei aim to contribute far more. 
   Mr. Speaker, this deal is not only unacceptable on its face to our free people's sensibilities, it endangers our military and our security. Therefore, if CIFUS approves this sale and its accompanying sensitive defense technologies to Huawei, it will place in Communist China's cyberhacking hands some of the most sensitive technologies employed for our high-tech defense, and it will be tantamount to CIFUS dropping the shark in our fish bowl and pulling the plug on America's happy days. 
   Therefore, I urge CIFUS to do its job and block this deal that threatens our liberty, our security and the bounds of sanity itself.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (LET IT BLEED: RESTORING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Madam Speaker, as my Republican Party completes its first year in the minority since 1994, we find ourselves held in historically low regard by the sovereign American people. 
   To end this trend, Republicans must accurately assess our party's past and present failings; and its future prospects of again providing Americans a meaningful choice between the major parties. This remain, after all, a party's duty to the citizenry. 
   For my GOP to fulfill it, first we must bury our ideological dead. Safely on this side of the cleansing mists of memory, it is chic to eulogize the late Republican majority. From the chattering class few insights emerge, for in the aftermath, only poetry is an apt epitaph. 
   ``The world is too much with us; late and soon; getting and spending we lay waste our powers; little we see in nature that is ours. We have given our hearts away. A sordid boon.'' 
   Such was the Republican bathos: A transformational majority sinned and slipped into a transactional ``cashocracy.'' Promises, policies, principles, all bartered, even honor. The majority now is of the ages. May it rest in peace. And be redeemed. 
   Once, George Santayana cautioned: ``Those who do not learn the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them.'' If our current Republican minority guilefully refutes or gutlessly refuses to admit, accept and atone for the bitter fruits of its lapsed majority, it will continue to decline in the eyes of the American electorate. Thus, for the sake of our Nation in this time of transformation, we must fully and frankly examine and understand the cardinal causes of the Republican majority's recent demise, and, sadder but wiser, commence our Republican minority's restoration as a transformation political movement serving the sovereign citizens of our free republic. 
   To begin, we must retrace our steps down a broken alley of broken hopes to glean the essence of our party's headier times, big hits and fazed cookies. 
   Though many of its legislative leaders may moot the point, two Presidents caused the 1994 Republican revolution: Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. 
   The members of 1995's new Republican majority were Ronald Reagan's political children. From President Reagan, Republican congressional revolutionaries inherited a philosophy of politics as the art of the possible: Cogently expressed by conservative intellectuals ranging from Edmund Burke to Russell Kirk, this philosophy's central tenet held: 
   Men and women are transcendent children of God endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights. 
   Government was instituted to defend citizens' inalienable rights and facilitate citizens' pursuit of the good and of true happiness. 
   Over the generations, Divine Providence has established and revealed through tradition prescriptive rights and custom within communities how order, justice, and freedom, each essential, coequal and mutually reinforcing, are best arranged and nurtured for humanity to pursue the good and true happiness. 
   Finally, human happiness is endangered by every political ideology, for each is premised upon abstract ideas; each claims a superior insight into human nature not revealed through historical experience; each proffers a secular utopia unobtainable by an imperfect humanity; and, each demands an omnipotent, centralized government to forcefully impose its vision upon an ``unenlightened'' and unwilling population. 
   This is the political philosophy and resulting public policies a once-impoverished youth from Dixon, Illinois, Ronald Reagan, engagingly articulated to America throughout his Presidency in the 1980s. By 1994, the American people who have taken Ronald Reagan at Russell Kirk's word that ``conservatism is the negation of ideology,'' and remembering its beneficent impact upon their daily lives, yearned for its return. For self-described congressional Republican revolutionaries, this formed fertile electoral ground, one shaped as well, it must be admitted, by a host of unheralded and immensely talented GOP redistricting attorneys. But like all revolutions, the peace required a villain. 
   Enter Bill Clinton. 
   Exuberant at having defeated an incumbent President George H.W. Bush, Clinton mistook a mandate against his predecessor as a mandate for his own craftily concealed liberalism. In his first 2 years in the Oval Office, this mistake led Clinton to overreach on ``kitchen table'' issues, such as raising taxes and socializing medicine. 
   Daily, the four-decade old Democratic congressional majority abetted Clinton's radical policies, and across the political spectrum, voters seethed. 
   Congressional Republicans bided their time, planned their revolution and seized their moment. Led by their spellbinding and abrasive guru from Georgia, congressional Republicans unveiled their ``Contract With America'' to much popular, if not pundit, acclaim. 
   Though much mythologized, if it is to prove instructive for the present Republican minority, this contract can and must be placed in its proper perspective. A musical analogy is most elucidating. 
   When a reporter once praised the Beatles for producing rock's first concept album, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band, John Lennon curtly corrected him: ``It was a concept album because we said it was.'' Lennon's point was this: Yes, the Beatles had originally set out to produce a concept album, but early in their sessions the band dropped any conceits to creating a ``concept album'' and recorded whatever songs were on hand. Recognizing their failure, the Beatles tacked on a final song, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band (Reprise), to engender the illusion they had, after all, created a concept album. Importantly, when the band later tried to produce a true ``concept album'' and accompanying film, Magical Mystery Tour, the lackluster result was one of the Beatles' few failed artistic ventures. 
   Similarly, congressional Republicans' ``Contract with America'' was a collection of specific policy proposals and concrete grievances against the incumbent Democratic President and his legislative allies. It possessed merely an implicit philosophy, one obviously harkening back to Reagan. Even less than Sergeant Pepper, the individual tracks of which have mostly stood the test of time, today many of the Contract's specific proposals sound dated. But like Sergeant Pepper, what endures about the contract is the fact that it was marketed as a revolutionary concept in governance. Of course, it is not. The contract was a suitable period piece which served its purpose--the election of congressional Republicans in sufficient numbers to attain our party's first majority in 40 years. Nevertheless the contract's lack of a clearly enunciated political philosophy sowed the seeds of the subsequent Republican devolution. 
   Therefore, if the current Republican minority buys into the myth and makes the contract the basis of a derivative ``concept'' agenda, the GOP will be condemned to another 40-year Magical Mystery Tour through the 
   political wilderness. 
   This is not to say the members of 1995's new Republican majority lacked a political philosophy or immutable principles. Quite the contrary: These Members were steeped in the Reagan tradition. But after an initial rush of laudable accomplishments, the Members found themselves trapped by the contract's inherent pragmatism and particularity. Absent a philosophical anchor in the contract, Members drifted into the grind of governance, which distorted Reagan's philosophical principles for public policy into nonbinding  precedents for political popularity. Exacerbating this process, the new majority's leaders, exuberant at having defeated an incumbent Democratic congressional majority, mistook a mandate against their predecessors as a mandate for their own finitely posited conservatism. In its first 2 years in control of the House, this led the majority's leaders to erroneously conclude it could govern as a parliament rather than as a congressional equivalent in power to the executive branch; and they over-reached on key issues, most notably in the shutdown of the United States Government over the issue of spending. Artfully framed by President Clinton with sufficient plausibility as an irresponsible Republican ideological attack on good government, this moment marked the beginning of the Republican majority's end. In point of fact, from the government shutdown to the present, the House GOP conference has never had as many Members as it did in 1995. 
   Some persist in too facilely dismissing this Republican debacle as being due to Clinton's superior messaging of the issue from his bully pulpit. This analysis is errant. The reason Clinton succeeded is the kernel of truth he wielded on this issue: House Republican leaders had stopped governing prudently in accordance with Reagan's political philosophy of politics being the art of the possible and, instead, started acting belligerently in an ideological manner against the public's interest. It is not an accident this battle fundamentally affected Clinton's thinking and spurred his reinvention from a liberal ideologue into a pragmatic problem-solver and proponent of ``good government.'' Unfortunately, Clinton's publicly applauded posturing as a centrist incensed the Republican majority and accelerated their efforts to differentiate themselves from an unprincipled President by being increasingly ideological, which they confuted with being principled. 
   As this ideological fever progressed through 1996, too late did the new majority's members intuit the political cost to candidates considered ``ideologues.'' The Republicans' majority did survive the partisan carnage of Clinton's overwhelming 1996 reelection, but the cycle's cumulative effect was lasting and damning. Without gawking at the gruesome minutia of each ensuing GOP ideological purge and internal coup instigated by this election, we can note it spawned the unseemly political perversion of the House Republicans' transformational majority into a transactional ``cashocracy.'' 
   Hubristically deemed by its leading denizens as a ``permanent majority,'' the GOP ``cashocracy'' was a beggars' banquet at taxpayers' expense. The cashocracy's sole goal was its own perpetuation; and its cashocrats and high priests of money-theism myopically chased the same through pragmatic corporatism and political machinations. 
   Obviously, the cashocracy's cardinal vice was its conviction to survive for its own sake. Curiously, this was not the height of arrogance; it was the height of insecurity. Aware it stood for nothing but election, the cashocracy knew anything could topple it. This fear cancerously compelled the poll-driven cashocrats to grope for ephemeral popularity by abandoning immutable principles. Materialistic to their core and devoid of empathy, the cashocrats routinely ignored the centrality to governmental policies of transcendent human beings. 
   This cashocracy's first cardinal error facilitated its second: Pragmatic corporatism. Ensconced in insular power, the cashocrats lived the lives of the rich and famous, despite their middling personal means, due to their newfound friends in the corporate and lobbying community. Cut off from Main Street, these cashocrats embraced K Street. The desire was mutual, and the corporatists' influence grew gradually but ineluctably. Closed within a corporatist echo chamber, the cashocrats became deadened to the tribulations and aspirations of real Americans, and came to measure the ``success'' of its pragmatic policies by their reception on K Street. Reams of measures spewed forth prioritizing the interests of multinational corporations over the needs of middle-class Americans.     
   In fairness, even without the Cashocrats' incessant inducements, blandishments and bullying, the majority of GOP members truly did feel they were promoting the interests of their constituents. This belief was insidiously sustained by the Cashocrats grafting their pragmatic corporatism onto the philosophy of economic determinism. It was not an unforeseeable development. Akin to their conservative brethren who after the fall of the Soviet Union proclaimed the ``End of History,'' House Republicans convinced themselves the ideology of democratic capitalism was an unstoppable deterministic force predestined to conquer the world; and on their part, they viewed their job as hastening its triumph and preparing Americans to cope with its consequences. Combined with the Cashocracy's insatiable need of corporate contributions for its sustenance, this adherence to ideological democratic capitalism reveals how the Republican House majority helped President Clinton (whom they had unknowingly come to emulate and likely loathe ever more because of it) grant the permanent normalization of trade relations to Communist China. With the enactment of this legislation, the Cashocracy reached its political zenith and moral nadir, for it did not shape globalization to suit Americans' interests; it had shaped Americans' interests to suit globalization. 
   The handsome rewards for such ``courageous'' legislation fueled the Cashocracy's third vice, avarice. The process was both seductive and simple, especially in a materialistic town forsaking the qualitative measurement of virtue for the quantitative measurement of money. While this temptation is to be expected in a city where politicians ``prove'' their moral superiority by spending other people's money, it was equally to be expected Republicans would collectively resist it. 
   They didn't. 
   Earmarks, which began as a cost-saving reform to prevent Federal bureaucrats from controlling and wasting taxpayers' money in contravention of express Congressional intent, spiraled out of control once the Cashocrats and their K-Street cronies realized the process could be manipulated to direct any appropriation, however undeserving, to any client, however questionable. In turn, political contributions materialized from the recipients of these earmarks for the Members on both sides of the aisle who dropped them into legislation, oftentimes without the knowledge of or the appropriate review by their peers. The passage of policy bills, too, increasingly mirrored the earmark process, as special interest provisions were slipped into the dimmer recesses of bills in the dead of night. The outcome of this fiscal chicanery was an escalation of the K-Street contributions the Cashocracy required to attain its aim of perpetuating itself in power; and of the illegal perks required to sate the more venal tastes of some morally challenged members who are now paying their debts to society. 
   Cumulatively, in addition to rendering it morally bankrupt, these three vices left the Cashocracy intellectually impotent. Tellingly, within this less than subtle and manifestly sinister system of earmarks and contributions, the Cashocrats greased the skids for their legislative ``favors'' by relegating the majority's younger Members to voting rather than legislating; ignoring these Members' qualitative virtues, ideals and talents; measuring these Members by the quantitative standard of how much money they raised; and, thereby, condemning these Members to the status of highly paid telemarketers. Having squandered this infusion of youthful energy and insight, the Cashocrats hailed the election of Republican President George W. Bush and handed him the Nation's legislative agenda. 
   At first, the Cashocrats' subordination of their separate, equal branch of government to the executive branch bore dividends. But by 2006, when the failures of the Iraq war's reconstruction policy and Hurricane Katrina's emergency relief torpedoed Bush's popularity, the latent danger to the Cashocrats of hitching their SUVs to the fortunes of a President was evident. Precluded from tying its vicarious popularity to Bush's coat tails, the Cashocracy teetered beneath the gale  force invective of the Democrats' campaign mantra the Congressional Republican majority was a ``culture of corruption'' slothfully fully content to rubber stamp the failed policies of an unpopular President. Panic stricken, the politically tone-deaf Cashocrats urged GOP members to tout America's ``robust economy'' and attack Democrats on national security issues. The innately materialist economic argument was doomed to fail because the ``robust'' economy was not to be found in regions like the Northeast and Midwest. The latter argument proved unconvincing to an electorate convinced Iraq and New Orleans were GOP national security fiascoes. And, finally, nothing could persuade an outraged electorate to return a Republican majority which, in the interests of perpetuating itself in power, failed to protect House pages from predatory Members of Congress. 
   By election day the public had concluded the Republican majority cared more about corporations than Americans; and when the tsunami hit, the Cashocracy crumbled down upon many now former GOP members who became the last, blameless victims of its stolid cupidity. 
   In hindsight, the Cashocracy would best have heeded President Theodore Roosevelt's warning: ``The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first, the love of soft living, and the get rich quick theory of life.'' 
   Straggling back to Washington for the Republican revolution's death vigil, the 2006 election's surviving GOP members bid anguished goodbyes to defeated friends and struggled to make sense of it all. Dazed and confused, some Members managed to grasp the reality of their newly minted minority, while some still grapple with it. Out of this former group, a distinct vision has emerged concerning how House Republicans can revitalize and redeem themselves in the estimation of their fellow Americans. 
   ``Restoration Republicans'' are best considered Reagan's grandchildren. Like their Reagan-Democratic parents, Restoration Republicans were attracted to our party by the intellectual, cultural, and moral components and proven practical benefits of philosophical conservatism. Transcending talking points and political cant, these Restoration Republicans are devoted to restoring the human soul's centrality to public policy decisions; and focusing these policies on preserving and perpetuating the permanent things of our evanescent earthly existence which surpass all politics in importance. 
   The enduring ideals of Restoration Republicans are succinctly enumerated by Russell Kirk in his book, The Politics of Prudence: 
   One, conservatives believe that there exists an enduring moral order. Two, conservatives adhere to custom, convention and continuity. Three, conservatives believe in what may be called the principle of prescription, that is, of things established by immemorial usage. Four, conservatives are guided by the principle of prudence. Five, conservatives pay attention to the principle of variety. Six, conservatives are chastened by their principle of imperfectability. Seven, conservatives are persuaded that freedom and property are 
   closely linked. Eight, conservatives uphold voluntary community, quite as they oppose involuntarily collectivism. Nine, the conservative perceives the need for prudent restraints upon power and upon human passion. And finally, 10, the thinking conservative understands that permanence and change must be recognized and reconciled in a vigorous society. 
   Given how the Cashocracy repeatedly violated these principles during its descent into oblivion, and how the Democrats' 2006 rallying cry was ``change,'' this 10th ideal merits deeper contemplation. For to understand it fully is to fully understand why Restoration Republicans, who are convinced we live amidst a crucible of liberty, proclaim our minority must emulate and implement the philosophical conservatism of Ronald Reagan and the fiery integrity of Theodore Roosevelt in the cause of empowering Americans and strengthening their eternal institutions of faith, family, community and country. Again, I quote from Kirk: ``Therefore, the intelligent conservative endeavors to reconcile the claims of permanence and the claims of progression. He or she thinks that the liberal and the radical, blind to the just claims of permanence, would endanger the heritage bequeathed to us, in an endeavor to hurry us into some dubious terrestrial paradise. The conservative, in short, favors reasoned and tempered progress. He or she is opposed to the cult of progress whose votaries believe that everything new necessarily is superior to everything old. 
   ``Change is essential to the body social, the conservative reasons, just as it is essential to the human body. A body that has ceased to renew itself has begun to die. But if that body is to be vigorous, the change must occur in a regular manner, harmonizing with the form and nature of that body; otherwise change produces a monstrous growth, a cancer, which devours its host. The conservative takes care that nothing in a society should ever be wholly old and that nothing should ever be wholly new. This is the means of the conservation of a nation, quite as it is the means of conservation of a living organism. Just how much change a society requires and what sort of change depend upon the circumstances of an age and a nation.'' 
   Kirk's words compelled Restoration Republicans to empathetically assess our Nation's age and circumstances, and ponder the direction and scope of the changes our American community requires. In making these determinations, Restoration Republicans draw parallels between, and inspiration from, America's greatest generation. Our greatest generation faced and surmounted a quartet of generational challenges born of industrialization: Economic, social and political upheavals; a Second World War against abject evil; the rise of the Soviet super-state as a strategic threat and rival model of governance; and the civil rights movement's moral struggle to equally ensure the God-given and constitutionally recognized rights of all Americans. 
   Today, our generation of Americans must confront and transcend a quartet of generational challenges born of globalization: Economic, social and political upheavals; a third world war against abject evil; the rise of the Communist Chinese super-state as a strategic threat and rival model of governance; and moral relativism's erosion of our Nation's foundational, self-evident truths. 
   The critical difference between the challenges conquered by the greatest generation and the challenges confronting our generation of Americans is this: They faced their challenges consecutively; we face our challenges simultaneously. 
   In response to these generational challenges to our free republic, Restoration Republicans have drawn upon the roots of their philosophical conservatism to affirm the truth America does not exist to emulate others, America exists to inspire the world, and to advance the policy paradigm of American excellence, which rests upon a foundation of liberty, and the four cornerstones of sovereignty, security, prosperity and verities. 
   Individually and collectively, American excellence's foundation and four cornerstones are reinforced by these policy principals: Our liberty is granted not by the pen of a government bureaucrat, but is authored by the hand of Almighty God. Our sovereignty rests not in our soil but in our souls. Our security is guaranteed not by the thin hopes of appeasement, but by the moral and physical courage of our troops defending us in hours of maximum danger. Our prosperity is produced not by the tax hikes and spending sprees of politicians, but by the innovation and perspiration of free people engaged in free enterprise. Our cherished truths and communal virtues are preserved and observed not by a coerced political correctness but by our reverent citizenry's voluntary celebration of the culture of life. Restoration Republicans conclude, therefore, that we must be champions of American freedom in this challenging new millennium to keep our America a community of destiny inspired and guided by the virtuous genius of our free people, and forever blessed by the unfathomable grace of God. 
   It will not be easy, given the root public policy question of our times. In the age of industrialization, President Theodore Roosevelt empathized with  Americans' feelings of powerlessness in the face of economic, social and political forces radically altering or terminating their traditional, typically agrarian lives. Writing years later in his book A Humane Economy, the economist Wilhelm Ropke examined the impacts upon human beings by these forces, which he collectively termed ``mass society'': 
   ``The disintegration of the social structure generates a profound upheaval in the outward conditions of each individual's life, thought and work. Independence is smothered; men are uprooted and taken out of the close-woven social texture in which they were secure; true communities are broken up in favor of more universal but impersonal collectivities in which the individual is no longer a person in his own right; the inward, spontaneous social fabric is loosened in favor of mechanical, soulless organization, with its outward compulsion; all individuality is reduced to one plane of uniform normality; the area of individual action, decision and responsibility shrinks in favor of collective planning and decision; the whole of life becomes uniform and standard mass life, ever more subject to party politics, nationalization and socialization.'' 
   In that industrial epoch, the root public policy question was how to protect Americans' traditional rights to order, justice and freedom from being usurped by corporate or governmental centralization.     
   The advent of virtual corporations and transient international capital has ended the old industrial welfare state model of governance, wherein solutions to Americans' economic and social anxieties were the shared burdens of centralized corporations and government. The stark choice is now between increasing the centralized power of the Federal Government or decentralization of power into the hands of individuals, families and communities. 
   In their urgency to replace their lost or slashed corporate benefits, Americans will be sorely tempted to further centralize the Federal Government to do it. But expanding the authority and compulsory powers of the Federal Government will be injurious to the American people. Big Government doesn't stop chaos; Big Government is chaos. 
   By usurping the rightful powers of individuals between its bureaucracy's steel wheels, highly centralized government alienates individuals and atomizes communities. Once more, Ropke speaks to the heart of the matter: 
   ``The temptation of centrism has been great at all time, as regards both theory and political action. It is the temptation of mechanical perfection and of uniformity at the expense of freedom. Perhaps Montesquieu was right when he said that it is the small minds, above all, which succumb to this temptation. Once the mania of uniformity and centralization spreads and once the centrists begin to lay down the law of the land, then we are in the presence of one of the most serious dangerous signals warning us of the impending loss of freedom, humanity, and the health of society.'' 
   Only liberty unleashes Americans to establish the true roots of a holistic American, the voluntary and virtuous individual, familial, and communal associations which invigorate and instruct a free people conquering challenges. In contrast, centralized and, thus, inherently unaccountable government suffocates liberty, order and justice by smothering and severing citizens' voluntary bonds within mediating, nongovernmental institutions, and so doing, stifles our free people's individual and collective solutions to challenges. In consequence, the temptation for more centralized government must be fought to prevent turning sovereign Americans from the masters of their destiny into the serfs of governmental dependency. 
   Fully versed in this verity, restoration Republicans have made their decision: power to the people. Thus, in this age of globalization, restoration Republicans vow to empower the sovereign American people to protect and promote their God-given and constitutionally recognized and protected rights; promote the decentralization of Federal Governmental powers to the American people or to their most appropriate and closest unit of government; defend Americans' enduring moral order of faith, family, and community and country from all enemies; foster a dynamic market economy of entrepreneurial opportunity for all Americans; and honor and nurture a humanity of scale in Americans' relations and endeavors. 
   Further, while these restoration Republicans will be releasing a more detailed program in the future, the above will form the basis of any concrete proposals brought forth. 
   Madam Speaker, my constituents are honest, hard-working and intelligent people who are bearing the brunt of the generational challenges facing our Nation. They have lost manufacturing and every manner of jobs due to globalization and, especially, the predatory trade practices of Communist China. Throughout these economically anxious times, they spend sleepless nights wondering if they will be able to afford to keep their jobs, their houses, their health care, their hopes for their children. 
   In the war for freedom, they have buried, mourned and honored their loved ones lost in battle against our Nation and all of civilization's barbaric enemies. And every day, they struggle to make sense of an increasingly perverse culture that's disdainful of and destructive to faith, truths, virtue and beauty, if the existence of these permanent things is even admitted. 
   True, my constituents differ on specific solutions to their pressing problems, but they do agree Washington isn't serving their concerns. They agree this storied representative institution is increasingly detached from the daily realities of their lives. And they remind me that when we enter this House, their House, we enter as guests who must honor the leap of faith they took in letting us in and allowing us to serve them. 
   With my constituents, I utterly agree. While it is not my purpose here to discuss the majority party, let me be clear as to my own. House Republicans have no business practicing business as usual. My constituents, our country and this Congress deserve better, and we will provide it. 
   Our Republican minority has Members who know America isn't an economy; America is a country. Our Republican minority has Members who know the only thing worth measuring in money is greed. Our Republican minority has Members with the heart to put individuals ahead of abstractions, people ahead of politics, and souls ahead of systems. Our Republican minority has Members who have seen sorrow seep down a widow's cheek and joy shine from a child's eye. 
   Yes, Madam Speaker, my Republican minority has Members who know our deeds on behalf of our sovereign constituents must accord with Wordsworth's poetic prayer: ``And then a wish: my best and favored aspiration mounts with yearning for some higher song of philosophic truth which cherishes our daily lives.'' 
   It is these Republicans whose service in this Congress will redeem our party by honoring the sacred trust of the majestic American people who, in their virtuous genius, will transcend these transformational times and strengthen our exceptional Nation's revolutionary experiment in human freedom. 
   With these Republicans, I hereby throw in my lot and pledge my best efforts on behalf of my constituents and our country. 
   May God continue to grace, guard, guide and bless our community of destiny, the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Madam Speaker, President Lincoln warned, ``A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. It will become all one thing or all the other.'' 
   Today, our House is divided; tomorrow, it will become all one thing or all the other. What are the possibilities? 
   In our divided House, one side believes we must win in Iraq to avoid a catastrophe; another side assumes we can lose in Iraq without consequence. 
   One side believes we must support our troops in harm's way and continue their funding; another side claims we can support our troops in harm's way and cut their funding. 
   One side assumes we must defeat al Qaeda in Iraq; another side asserts we can retreat from al Qaeda in Iraq. 
   And one side believes the American people voted to change course in Iraq to win; another side feels the American people voted to change course in Iraq to lose. 
   Shortly, we will see how divided we are. One side will vote to support the President's plan to win in Iraq by reinforcing our troops, and then pray to God we are right; one side will vote against the President's plan. And in this question rests the answer to the future of our divided House. 
   My friends, many of you are about to put yourselves in a precarious position, for no one knows what the future holds. While we may feel sure of our decisions in the evanescent present, the unfathomable vagaries of fate have yet to fully play upon the stage of human history. As a result, many supporters of this resolution made an ominous omission while urging its adoption: In denouncing the President's plan, too few of you have openly hoped our troops' new mission would win the day and prove you wrong. 
   Being your colleague, I know you share this hope in your hearts. But your fellow Americans in fields abroad and constituencies at home must now wonder, will you cut our troops funding to prove yourselves right? 
   Sooner than you imagine, this nonbinding resolution will instigate binding legislation to commence a ``slow bleed'' of funding cuts while our troops battle against the enemy. Again, because I serve beside you every day, I know you abhor the thought of American soldiers being harmed by such an abject betrayal of their trust during combat, but it is upon this crucible of conscience you will be judged by all. And when the time comes to confront the consequences of today's expediency, I pray you make the right decision. If, however, you make the wrong decision, you will not only betray our citizen soldiers' trust, you will disastrously unite this House in a callow contentment with our own liberty and a calloused apathy to others' enslavement. 
   Could there be any more dishonorable epitaph for our free Republic's revolutionary experiment in democracy? True, some allege I exaggerate the danger, but they have turned a blind eye to the epitaphs of liberty etched above the ruins of nations once gloried, now dead: the Athenian city-state, the Roman Republic, the Weimar Republic. 
   Thus, even as we today divide in our own House, we remain compelled to unite behind the cause of our free Republic in this dangerous age of globalization, wherein humanity's destiny is daily entwined across the disparate reaches of Earth. 
   Our cause is this: Our world cannot permanently endure half slave and half free. It will become all one thing or all the other, as it has before in the darkest ages of human existence. 
   My friends, at this crossroads of our Republic, we must heed the better angels of our nature. We must unite our divided House behind the self-evident truth that all human beings are endowed by their Creator, with the inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   We must extend freedom to the Iraqis and, in so doing, enhance the liberty of ourselves and all free peoples and inspire our fellow human beings caged in  tyranny's embrace. And emulating our nation's greatest generations, we must let hope to flow from God's heart to our humble hands so we may, where He allows, emancipate humanity into a new birth of freedom for ourselves and generations unborn. 
   Madam Speaker, we must reject this resolution, unite behind our heroic troops and, God willing, win our country and humanity's mortal struggle to be free.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. I thank the gentleman from Iowa. I just want to touch on some points regarding strategic basis of the surge and some of the goals, some of what we've heard today. Your indulgence. Just touch upon some of the general themes that our Nation faces in the war for freedom. 
   Mistakes in the past in Iraq have been rectified under the Petraeus plan. As I have said and many here have said on our side of the aisle, in the early days of the problems of reconstruction, we believed that you could not impose democracy from above in a top-down approach, but you could unleash liberty so that it could rise up, much as the American Revolution did, to take its own shape as the Iraqi people were emancipated from the shackles of Saddam's oppression. 
   What General Petraeus is doing, in conjunction with Ambassador Crocker, is they are going into the towns, they're going into the tribes, they are going into the bedrock of the population of Iraq, and with the surge, providing the security to protect these individuals in these towns from the collective and systematic terror of the enemy, so that average Iraqis can make the local political shift to liberty and away from the insurgency. This is being done not simply through the utilization of military force. In fact, the success on the ground in the local levels and in the provinces and in our cooperation with the tribes is built upon and hastened by this political shift among the population. 
   In any counterinsurgency operation, the critical element is to separate the population from the insurgency. This can be reasoned, if we look back at some of the statements of the grand guerilla warrior, Chairman Mao. When asked about how his guerilla operations and insurgencies against the nationalist Chinese would work, he said, our people will be as the fishes amongst the water of the people. What you have to do is separate the fish from the water. This is why the critical testimony I believe we heard today was that every single Iraqi, everyone in Anbar Province and elsewhere where we are seeing progress is being given the ability to make the free, conscious decision to reach for their liberty. They are not being terrorized because of the valor of our troops and the plan and the reconstruction efforts that are flowing into these areas that show they have a transactional benefit in this transformational change. And this is hastening the local political shift which I believe undergirds our chances for victory in Iraq. This is also what undergirds the good news that we had today, at least the welcome news that, because of the local shift amongst the population and the improved security that is concomitant to it, General Petraeus has proposed a reduction of 4,000 troops by the end of the year and a reduction of 40,000 troops by July. 
   Even if our Nation is so divided that we cannot unite in the cause of victory in Iraq, at least let us unite with the welcome news that 4,000 now and 40,000 of our fellow Americans citizens are going to be returning from harm's way to their loved ones.     
   To have individuals derive this as a token gesture is to accuse General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker of what the accusers themselves are doing, which is to play politics with the lives of our troops. We have seen, despite all evidence, despite what the military's assessment has been, repeated calls for the immediate withdrawal of the United States forces from Iraq. This would be irresponsible not only to our troops in the field but to the people of the region, especially the Iraqis themselves, who would be slaughtered. 
   When one decides to engage in a strategic withdrawal in the face of enemy, military experts generally concur that this is one of the most dangerous maneuvers forces in the field can attempt because your numbers are getting smaller as the enemy is becoming emboldened and encroaching ever closer to you. The wholesale withdrawal on a date certain, which is an arbitrary dictate from politicians in Washington, for those who believe that this is a proper course of action, I ask them to check into how the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan went, and they might reach another decision. 
   Further, to call this a token gesture not only belittles the sacrifices that our troops have made to reduce the security problems in these areas and to help get this local political shift, it also diminishes and belittles in a callous way the true joy these troops' families are going to feel when their loved ones come back. 
   To me that is something that is not a token. That is something that relieves the painful anxiety of every waking minute these families spend wondering if their loved one will come home. I highly doubt that the military mothers in my district or throughout America are ever going to consider any troop coming home from accomplishing their mission as being a token gesture. 
   Be that as it may, it is also critical that we understand, in this period of time, that ours is the latest generation duty bound to defend freedom in its hour of maximum danger. Thus we must ever remember, through this crucible of liberty, our course is tough but our cause is just. 
   The enemy is the sire of tyranny; we are the children of liberty. By heinously invading our Nation on September 11, 2001, and killing 3,000 innocent American souls, the enemy announced we cannot co-exist. In consequence, it is clear a world condensed by an Internet cannot endure half slave and half free. Yes, many times in the life of our free Republic, we have been called upon to face danger and to defeat it, and we have always done this and secured it by advancing a simple elemental truth that has served us well: to ensure our own liberty, we must ensure liberty to the enslaved. 
   Thus in this trying time, it is imperative that we demonstrate that our devotion to liberty transcends their obsession with death. And united amongst ourselves and other free people, with prudence, we can, we must, and we will, for the sake of our children and the generations of Americans yet unnamed, we will win and we will walk our path, and we will widen the cause of human freedom. 
   I thank you for allowing me the chance to address you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Thank you. The gentleman from New Mexico, the good doctor from Texas and other speakers have touched upon a fundamental point. I wish to stress what General Petraeus said in terms of what an American victory would look like and then ask a question of those who would support an immediate withdrawal. 
   In his own letter to the troops, General Petraeus said that what we need is for the Iraqis to become solely responsible for their own security. That means a very small footprint, if at all, of the United States in Iraq militarily. Secondly, it will depend upon the local reconstruction, reconciliation, and security of the average Iraqi which will then drive the national reconciliation. Between those two pillars of local reconciliation and security will come a stable and free Iraq that no longer creates terrorists, but captures them instead. 
   But as we are the children of liberty, as we are a Nation that proudly proclaims it is conceived in liberty, that since every human being has an unalienable, God-given right to breathe free, to have the right to pursue life, liberty and happiness, I ask my fellow Americans who support the immediate withdrawal this: If we betray our fundamental commitment to liberty to the people of Iraq and watch them be slaughtered in the sands, what will we ever be able to offer them again to turn them from the enemy and towards us? If we betray our own profession of the desire to liberate them, to let them share in their God-given rights the same way we have, we will be ideologically disarmed in the war for freedom. 
   I assure you we will rue the day that we betrayed not only them but the inherited legacy that we have received from the greatest generations of Americans who preceded us and allowed us to live in the majestic America that we know today.

   Mr. McCOTTER. My amendment that I've offered is very simple and straightforward. It requests that the Secretary of Defense, in concurrence with the Secretary of State, issue to Congress a review of declassification procedures that are in place to guarantee that materiel does not fall into the hands of terrorists, does not fall into the hands of state sponsors of terrorists, does not fall into the hands of groups hostile to the United States, or any similar reprobates in general. By classification procedures I mean Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service procedures to classify something as excess and also as eligible for sale. We believe this should not engender any opposition. We have worked very well with the majority staff of both the committee in question, and the Foreign Affairs Committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. RHYS LEWIS -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and mourn the extraordinary life of Rhys Lewis upon his passing at the age of 83. 
   Born on May 13, 1924, Rhys Lewis dedicated his life to serving others. As a United States Marine Corps sergeant  during World War II, Rhys served in the South Pacific and fought to defend the liberty of Americans and all humanity. His tour of duty included seeing combat on Iwo Jima, where he demonstrated his unfaltering honor and valor. 
   Following his return home in 1947, Rhys married his beloved Ruth and continued his service to our Nation. An active church member, Rhys was ultimately elected to and entrusted with numerous positions of governmental and civic trust. 
   He served as a Republican precinct delegate, a Redford Township trustee, a Redford Civil Affairs chairman, the chairman of the Redford Republican Party, as a member of the Michigan Republican State Committee, and a 1980 Bush delegate to the national convention. 
   Regrettably, on October 27, 2007, Rhys Lewis passed from this earthly world to his eternal reward. He is survived by his wife, Ruth Lewis, his children, Arthur Lewis and Charlotte Wirth, his grandchildren, Kathryn Ostreko, David R. Wirth and Jeffrey Lewis, and his great grandchild, Jack Ostreko. A courageous and honorable man, Rhys will be sorely missed. 
   Mr. Speaker, Rhys Lewis is remembered as a compassionate father, a dedicated husband, a leader, a soldier and a friend. Today, as we bid Rhys farewell, I ask my colleagues to join me in mourning his passing and honoring the unwavering patriotism and legendary service to our country and community of this fine American. 
   And I would be remiss if I did not add what I believe encapsulates the essence of the man. Early in my tenure as a Member of Congress, I was honored to be asked to participate in a ceremony where Rhys Lewis was honored for his commitment to our Nation and his service as a member of the Greatest Generation of World War II. We had to work with his wife, Ruth, because Rhys, an honorable man, was not a proud man. And so when we surprised him at the VFW that day with the medals that he had earned, he was stunned. Part of him seemed to be surprised that people had remembered his service to our Nation in its crucible of liberty, and the other part of him was deeply, deeply concerned that he was being singled out for what he and so many other fine young Americans had done to preserve the freedoms we now hold. 
   That was the man that we honor today. That is the man whose example I believe we should ever cherish and ever emulate.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (THE LIBERTY ALLIANCE: CHAMPIONING LIBERTY AND DIGNITY IN OUR HUMAN COMMUNITY -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, in the immediate aftermath of World War II, at the commencement of our Cold War against the Soviet Union and international communism, in his blunt, son of the middle border manner, President Harry Truman enunciated the eponymous doctrine he would apply to this challenge during his March 12, 1947, address to a joint session of Congress. 
   ``I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressures. I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way. I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes. 
   ``One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and of religion, and freedom from political oppression. The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly opposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms. 
   ``The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. 
   ``The free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms. If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own nation.'' 
   Regarding the Soviet Union, in the face of experts' arguments, Stalin's imperialist dictatorship should be psychologically understood and indulged to purchase an illusory peace, Truman morally comprehended this evil empire's threat to the United States and the Free World. Through the United Nations, multilateral and bilateral treaties, his strategy to contain and defeat inhuman communism called for the United States to champion the cause of human liberty and dignity. 
   We heeded his call, and, through American leadership and sacrifice, the Soviets' evil empire imploded and Eastern Europeans and the Russian people experienced a new birth of freedom. This victory of humanity over tyranny must not lull us into the conceit liberty is now without enemies or invincible in their face. For we must always remember our Founders' caution: ``We will give you a republic, if you can keep it.'' Today, as we confront a barbarous terrorist enemy and the rise of another Communist superstate, China, it is wise to reexamine President Truman's sound strategy, revise it as appropriate to our circumstances, and defeat the enemies of our free Republic and the free world. 
   A revision I propose is this: We can no longer rely on any part on the United Nations for the preservation of American or human freedom. For global altruists afflicted with cognitive dissonance, in a likely futile effort, let us remind them of the U.N.'s recent, execrable acts against the human liberty and dignity it was founded to defend.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO END ITS CRACKDOWN IN TIBET -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Madam Speaker, we stand at a historic moment. In the stream of history, it is oftentimes overlooked as we circumnavigate around time, fate and circumstance the momentous era and the momentous deeds which must be undertaken. This is one of them. 
   I thank the Speaker for bringing this resolution. I thank her for bringing with it the moral weight of her opposition to Communist China's abysmal human rights record throughout her career in this Congress, and for uniting Republicans and Democrats behind it. 
   But at this moment, I am also reminded of someone who is no longer with us, someone from whom I learned very much. That man is the late Chairman Tom Lantos, a man who embodied the human spirit in its ability to triumph over evil. How many people in this Congress understood the moment when the tanks rolled into Budapest and the Soviets went into Hungary, that that was a seminal moment in the Cold War, that the desire to breathe free, of the Hungarian people, could not be quelled by tanks and could only be quenched by freedom? And throughout the history of the Cold War, their example was emulated by others, including the Czechs in 1968, and of course the Poles, and that eventually brought down the Soviet Union. 
   Today, what may appear a resolution of the moment for a specific incident is not that. It is our generation's Budapest. It is this generation of Americans who get to witness the Tibetans trying to breathe free from beneath the Communist yoke of the Chinese regime. And as we Republicans and Democrats stand together today, we stand with them, and we send a clarion message to the Communist Chinese Government. They will be free. And as the Olympic torch goes from town to town and you see people gathering together of all political persuasions and all walks of life to protest the abominable suppression of the Tibetans, let us remember that we here have come together to make sure that the torch of Lady Liberty still shines bright as a beacon of hope for all the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to go on record with the reminiscence of late President Ford. 
   As a young person growing up in Michigan, I remember Watergate. It is a very early political memory. And it would have been so easy at the time for that indelible memory to remain with a young person and sour them and make them cynical toward the public process and toward government in general. 
   But I was very lucky because the man who took the place of the disgraced Richard Nixon was a man from Michigan by the name of Gerald Ford. Living in Michigan at the time being a young person, to see someone from my home State filled me with pride and a sense of inspiration that one person could rise above it and help to heal the wounds of a Nation. 
   So in many ways today in paying respect to Gerald Ford, it is not my ability to thank him for his service to our country in general, but to thank him personally for the inspiration that he provided me, to see what one good and decent man could do for his fellow Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (A NEW DEBATE REGARDING LIBERTY, SOVEREIGNTY AND PROSPERITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Madam Speaker, I know that it is getting close to closing time, and I am in the unenviable position of being between so many good people and the door, so I will try to make sure that I give a truncated version of my simple desultory philippic to my constituents. 
   We in Congress are charged with the sacred duty of heeding and serving our constituents' aspirations and addressing their tribulations. We also have the responsibility of offering them a national vision and purpose and, most importantly, of putting them first in policymaking, which is why I have risen today to again lay before my constituents what I believe to be the four great generational challenges facing the United States of America. 
   Like the Greatest Generation, we face four challenges. The Greatest Generation, due to the rise of industrialization, faced social, economic and political turmoil. They faced a world war for freedom against an abjectly evil enemy. They faced the rise of the Soviet superstate as a rival model of governance and strategic threat, and they faced the moral question of whether the constitutional rights of all Americans applied equally regardless of race. 
   This generation of Americans in the age of globalization faces social, political and economic turmoil. We face a  world war for freedom against an intrinsically evil enemy. We face the rise of the Communist Chinese superstate as a rival model of governance and strategic threat, and we face the question of whether moral relativism will erode the foundations of a Nation built upon self-evident truths. 
   The Greatest Generation faced their challenges consecutively. This generation of Americans faces their challenges simultaneously. In the past year, this Congress, sometimes together, sometimes not, have striven to address some of these challenges, and I would like to quickly go through a couple of them. 
   In the area of globalization's economic, social and political upheavals, we have seen a continued emphasis on the role of the centralized Federal Government. This is done through taxation, increases in taxation and increases in spending. It is my belief that if we continue to build the monument to Big Government on the backs of the American taxpayer, we will exacerbate the economic and social turmoil, and, yes, political turmoil that they are experiencing. I believe what we need to do is go back to the fundamental concept and change the debate. 
   The debate about people's money staying in their pockets and about the government spending people's money, which was taken from their pockets, should be this: We must stop discussing how quickly government spending grows and start getting back to talking about how quickly government spending is reduced, because this directly affects the liberty, sovereignty and prosperity of the American people.     
   And, at least in my District, they feel they are in short supply of their own money and don't believe the Federal Government needs to take more from them. 
   In the war for freedom, we have seen a change of course in Iraq. It has been contentious and it has been difficult on the political level here in Washington. But, fortunately, progress in Iraq and with our troops is occurring. There is a long way to go, as we know from the fact that so many of our friends and family members that are serving in the military are not home with us for this holiday Christmas season. 
   But what we have seen, and I want to explain it again, is a fundamental change of course in this sense. The past mistakes of the reconstruction effort were based upon the imposition of a system, a system of governance and a system that was perceived to lead to prosperity. What is now being done, which is much more important and is a lesson for future generations of American policymakers, is that democracy cannot be imposed, liberty can be unleashed. When liberty is unleashed, when a people finally breathe free, as General Petraeus' plan recognizes, we must help them fashion their representative institutions in their own way. 
   In Iraq, this is being seen through local reconciliation, where you're beginning to see people who are finally out from underneath the oppressive Saddam Hussein regime and starting to come out from the oppressive reign of terror of al Qaeda and other murderers in the country who would take it back to a time when the government ruled through the bullet rather than through the ballot. 
   What we are seeing is them working with tribal leaders, religious leaders, pillars of order in their community, to begin to reconcile themselves to each other, to begin to recognize the future that they may have if they remain free and resolute in the face of evil. And you are beginning to see this national reconciliation lead to the reduction of violence in Iraq, and you will continue to see it if we remain courageous and remain prudent in our policies. You will continue to see this grow and evolve into a national reconciliation process. Again, this will not happen overnight, but at least this has occurred. 
   Unfortunately, in my mind, on the third great generational challenge we face, which is Communist China's rise as a strategic threat and rival model of governance, the administration and this Congress have largely continued their policy of unconditional engagement. I think the American people are much further ahead of policymakers in this instance. 
   As we have recently seen from the U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission's report, people who are worried about dangerous imported products from Communist China should be. According to the Economic Security Review Commission's report, because of the closed system of the communist government in China, it is impossible or extremely difficult with any certainty to determine what products are defective or not before they arrive, and it is going to be increasingly difficult as time goes on as the regime consolidates its hold, which means that there is no simple resolution to the issue. We are trying to allow imports from Communist China to come in by spending more American taxpayer moneys on customs or inspections to allow these products to come in, because we will never know with certainty whether they are defective or not because, again, the closed nature of the Communist Chinese regime. 
   We have also seen in the area of national security repeated attacks by the People's Liberation Army through attacks on America's existing computer networks, both in industry and financial services, and in the United States Government itself. For example, what the Communist Chinese Government likes to do is set up front companies for people who are former members of the People's Liberation Army, and in this instance, we use the name Huawei, that is what it is called, which is trying to purchase a major U.S. supplier of cyberdefense technologies. 
   Now, this is still, at my last understanding, pending in front of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, despite the fact that our own Office for National Intelligence has told us this is a strategic threat to the United States. Now, how is this occurring? This is occurring because people wish to refuse to believe that the Communist Chinese Government is engaged in massive espionage against the United States of America, both in terms of our private sector and in terms of our public sector, i.e., our Pentagon as being one prime example. 
   The reason that Americans or their policymakers are so loath to recognize this fact is because there is not a whole lot of support to be anticommunist anywhere, except from the American people. Well, I prefer to have that support than any kind of political or economic elite's momentary approbation. In fact, it was the Economic Security Commission's report that actually steeled my convictions and helped me with this, because we were now able to tell people that according to the Economic Security Review Commission, Communist China's espionage against the United States firms and our governmental entities is likely the number one strategic threat that we are facing at the present time. 
   So we will continue to work and push on this, not only because this is a strategic threat to us, but also, more importantly, the second part of the equation. Communist China is presenting itself to the world as a rival model of governance to Western democracies. The fundamental tenet of the Communist Chinese approach is this: That liberty is a danger to their people's prosperity and security. I am going to repeat this. The Communist Chinese Government believes that its own people's liberty are a danger, a danger to their stability and prosperity. 
   This is a direct contradiction to what we believe here in America and in the free world is that people's liberty leads to a nation's stability and prosperity. The reason this is dangerous is we need not look any further than Time Magazine's current Man of the Year to see that this school of thought, this neo-communism has advocates amongst people who were former communists, such as the former President of Russia, Lieutenant Colonel Retired Vladimir Putin. 
   As we watch Russia slide from the first steps in democracy back towards autocracy, it is Putin who is telling his people that their liberty stopped their prosperity and stability under the Yeltsin years, and if they just cede more liberty, they will again have stability and they will finally have prosperity. 
   Other tyrants throughout the world are watching this, from Chavez in Venezuela to Castro in Cuba, who is still clinging to power, and they are watching to see in the coming years, in the coming decades, what will be the preferred model of governance in the world.  
   Now, we know what the dictators would like. We know what all those who would subjugate their fellow human beings beneath their ideological bents would prefer to see. They would prefer to see liberty considered a danger, a threat, to humanity's stability and prosperity. 
   We will find them continuing to echo the siren song that we hear from people in Beijing and Moscow and elsewhere that echoes the words that we heard from Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor, ``Give them miracle, mystery and authority, but above all, give them bread.'' 
   It is a materialist philosophy, it is a cynical philosophy, it is a neocommunist philosophy which we in the United States and the free world must reject. We must again reassert the primacy of liberty to all human beings as their divine right endowed to them by their creator and that the view of our free people that the future belongs to free nations, remains intact, not only for ourselves, but for all those who are oppressed and yearning to breathe free. 
   In the fourth area, the question of moral relativism eroding our foundational truth, we see this every day. We see this every day in the areas of faith, family, community and country. This Congress needs to do more to help reaffirm the historic role and the critical role that it currently plays, that faith currently plays in the lives of the American people and in the life and perpetuation of the American Republic. 
   Fortunately, Congressman Randy Forbes, I believe, is going to be introducing a resolution to do just this, and to remind people that the constitutional right under the first amendment is to the free exercise of free religion. It is not for the freedom from religion. It is not for the excoriation of religion and faith from the public square. 
   In the area of family, we continue to see erosions by the State upon the parents' sovereign and I believe inviolable powers to impart their moral teachings to their children. We have seen this in Maine, where the situation was presented to parents where if you did not want your child to get birth control under the school medical program, then your child would get no health care at all. 
   This is a diabolical dilemma presented to parents, and there are some that are occurring throughout the country in various locales that are unreported, and this must stop. A parent's right to raise their child and impart their moral teachings to them, the inviability of the parental family structure, of the parent-child relationship, must be respected by this government, must be respected by all governments, and we must take appropriate steps to see that that continues. 
   In the area of community, we must do more to ensure that the voluntary mediating institutions, nongovernmental institutions, remain intact as a buffer between the sovereign American people and their subservient government. 
   What de Tocqueville saw when he went through the United States of America and what he expressed to us must always be remembered, that the true strength of America lies in its voluntary associations and its individual senses of community, which then grow upward into the grand Republic which we now have inherited. 
   If the government goes out of its way to continue to make it difficult for people to join volunteer associations or begins to let it be known or to subtly or directly try to coerce volunteer associations as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, or such as Rotaries, Kiwanises and Chambers of Commerce, or, yes, labor unions, if these voluntary associations are infringed or encroached or eclipsed by the Federal Government, we are going to continue to see an atomization of individuals from their sense of community and we will continue to see a devolution of the true public purpose that is expressed by citizens in our Republic even today. 
   Finally, in the area of country, certainly we must do more to remind Americans not only of their civic rights and duties as citizens of the United States, but also the history of the United States. How can any individual citizen who is unaware of their rights, who is unaware of their duties, who is unaware of how a bill becomes law, how a constitutional amendment is adopted, how Congress spends money or who has the power of the purse, if they do not understand this, if they do not understand the history of their country, where we have been, where we are going, where we hope to, then they will be like lambs led before the shepherd of big government, because they will not know how to think for themselves in relation to government nor how to defend themselves from government actions and policies when necessary. This fourth area we must not overlook, because in many ways it is one of the most critical. 
   That is why when in facing these challenges, I believe it is important that we remember our shared American philosophical heritage, which is this: Men and women are transcendent children of God, equally endowed by their creator with inalienable rights. 
   Secondly, government was instituted to defend citizens' inalienable rights and to facilitate citizens' pursuit of good and true happiness. 
   Third, over the generations, divine providence has established and revealed through tradition, prescriptive rights and custom within communities, how order, justice and freedom, each essential, coequal and mutually reinforcing, are best arranged and nurtured for humanity to pursue the good and true happiness. 
   Finally, human happiness is endangered by every political ideology, for each is premised upon abstract ideas. Each claims a superior insight into human nature not revealed through historical experience, each proffers a secular utopia unattainable by an imperfect humanity, and each demands an omnipotent centralized government to forcefully impose its vision upon an unenlightened and unwilling population. 
   This is a shared heritage that transcends simply Republicanism or Democratism, for this is what was in the seminal documents of our Nation and this is what our Founders set out to do. It is from this shared philosophical tradition that we have been able to see in the United States the creation and perpetuation, even up to our generation, of American excellence. 
   Now, American excellence has a foundation and four cornerstones. Each of these is mutually reinforcing. Americans understand that our excellence is built upon a foundation of liberty, and the four cornerstones are sovereignty, security, prosperity and truth.     
   If we think about them individually, it becomes much more clear. Your liberty comes from God, not the government. Your sovereignty is in your soul, not in the soil. Your security comes not from the thin hopes of appeasement, your security comes from our collective love of liberty and from the courage of our fellow citizen soldiers who defend us in hours of maximum danger. Our prosperity comes from the innovation and perspiration of free people engaged in free enterprise, not from the growth of a government or from centralized planning or from higher taxes or from increased government spending. And, finally, our truths are communal. They have preserved over time. They have been perpetuated by families and institutions of faith and voluntary associations, and we revere them every day by voluntarily celebrating a culture of life. 
   This is what American exceptionalism is supported by. If we turn our back on that concept, then America is no longer an excellent Nation. If we go back and try to determine that somehow America exists to emulate other nations rather than America existing to inspire the world, we will be cheating our future generations of Americans of the legacy which we ourselves have inherited and which we ourselves so enjoy. 
   It seems to me that in this period of time that is very difficult, we must also make sure that we remember to have two goals as elected officials in this Congress. I think that the first goal we should have is to prevent the centralized Federal Government from growing ever larger and unaccountable by taking citizens' liberty and prosperity. And that is what happens through taxing and spending powers. And we must also reduce and decentralize the Federal Government and empower Americans to exercise their inherited and inalienable rights within  a culture of faith, family, community, and country. 
   To obtain these goals, I believe that we must take the following critical steps: One, we must empower the sovereign American people to protect and promote their God-given and constitutionally recognized and protected rights. All policies that we pursue should promote the decentralization of Federal governmental powers to the American people or to their most appropriate and closest unit of government. I believe we must also defend Americans' enduring moral order of faith, family, community, and country from all enemies. We must foster a dynamic market of entrepreneurial opportunity for all Americans. And we must honor and nurture humanity of scale and Americans' relations and endeavors. 
   This last point I would like to emphasize a little more directly. In the age of globalization, much like the age of industrialization, average Americans often felt that so many things were occurring to them outside of their control that they felt almost impotent in the face of the major changes that were occurring to them and radically altering their traditional way of life and their livelihoods. Fortunately, in the age of industrialization, Presidents with vision from Theodore Roosevelt to Franklin Roosevelt were able to help Americans through that transformational time. 
   We too must have such sagacity, because we too must recognize that in the age of globalization Americans oftentimes feel powerless against many of the forces that are shaping and radically altering their lives. And they look to the Federal Government, their duly elected servants, to try to help make sense of it, to try to help alleviate their sense of danger. And we must do this. We must do this with empathy, we must do this with creativity, we must do it with integrity. For to simply deny it does not exist or to simply say that somehow there are these mechanical determinative forces out there that no one can control such as globalization is not to do the American people justice, it is not to do ourselves any honor, or to provide to ourselves any honor in their service. 
   We can impact decisions that are the result of human decisions. Globalization is not a deterministic, mechanistic force, much as Engels and Marx said communism was and much as many of the globalists today say free trade is or any other economic determinative. This is not outside of people's control. People can still think their way through it. They can make sound policies within your Federal Government, with your help. And we can try to get through this difficult time with as little social, economic and political turmoil as we can. Or, instead, we can turn a blind eye to it, and we can watch as people continue to suffer many of the effects of globalization which could be ameliorated and which must be ameliorated. 
   Madam Speaker, I know the hour is late so I will not dawdle much longer. But I just want to say that while we have come to find ourselves in a global age, it is a perilous global age, but it is not a global age without hope. We are not the first generation of Americans; we are not the first people on this earth to face momentous challenges. And I believe that, like our fellow Americans before us and so many Americans, we will meet these challenges and we will transcend them. I believe we will preserve American excellence. I believe we will promote and defend the institutions of faith, family, community, and country against all enemies. And I believe that one day future generations of Americans will look back and say, well, they argued a lot; but they had a lot to argue about, but in the end they managed to get it right and we remain a free people. And I believe that the United States of America then, to the rest of the world, will be an inspiration to them for all the oppressed, for all those who yearn to breathe free, and that they will never lose hope that some day they, too, will enjoy in their own homes what we enjoy in ours. 
   Again, it will not be easy, it will not be immediate, but it will be done. We will preserve our shared heritage of freedom, and we will ensure that the permanent things amidst our ephemeral existence are preserved for future generations to come, because it is imperative that we make sure that things such as love, truth, beauty, justice, and honor remain because they surpasseth all politics and they give meaning to our somewhat troubled and yet ultimately majestic existence. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to conclude my remarks by expressing my personal and my constituents' sincere appreciation and heartfelt prayers for the men and women who are serving the cause of freedom overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere throughout the world, as well as extending them to their families. May God continue to bless them and all of the majestic American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding. I also wish to take this moment to thank him for his strength of character and his depth of intellect and leadership on this issue. 
   It has been said if you don't know where you are going, any road will take you there. Unfortunately, we find ourselves in such a situation, as America finds itself amidst a potential economic meltdown of its financial sector. 
   Right now, the U.S. Congress is being asked to vote upon the Paulson-Bush-Obama-McConnell-Pelosi-Reid plan. I myself will be up front and say I think it is a disastrous policy that House Republicans should continue to resist. What we are asking Americans to do, quite simply, is to send money to the very people who caused this problem and expect them to fix it. 
   If I can put this in the simplest terms that even I could understand, we have a liquidity crisis in our financial markets. That means that private investors are standing on the sidelines. They do not want to put their money into purchasing toxic assets. What they are now doing is asking Congress to put your money into purchasing toxic assets, and, if you do not, then these private investors have promised to wreak havoc upon your personal savings, upon your credit ratings, upon your financial existence. And for what sin? For not giving them $700 billion to fix the problem that they caused. 
   House Republicans have stood against this. We have consistently tried to keep ahead of the crisis atmosphere, and we have succeeded. What we instead offered is a responsible position that protects the taxpayers, that puts private recapitalization first, so that Wall Street can bail itself out of its mess before going to the taxpayers, and  putting an appropriate backstop in place. 
   Now, we have been reviled for our principled opposition to what we believe is an extortion of taxpayers' precious resources. For this we have been condemned in the liberal media. For this we have been condemned by the majority Democratic Party in this House. We have been condemned by the Democratic majority in the Senate. We have been condemned by our own Republican President and his Secretary of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board Chairman. 
   In fact, I think we have recently reached the height of the disapprobation heaped upon us when earlier the Speaker of the House, in response to our refusal to spend $700 billion of taxpayer money on this problem, we were labeled ``unpatriotic.'' I suppose this should not surprise us the least bit. We had earlier heard from the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Senator Biden, that Republicans, because we would not raise your taxes, were also unpatriotic. 
   Now, there has been some debate whether there is a new Democratic Party in America. If I may link these two statements to disprove that notion, according to Senator Biden and Speaker Pelosi, if you do not support raising the American people's taxes and spending $700 billion of it on Wall Street, you are unpatriotic. 
   I disagree with this assessment, and I trust that the American people do. In fact, in many ways it tends to point out the politics that are being played here. The reality is, as has been shown so often in the past, the Republican Party in Congress is the minority party. In the House of Representatives especially, the minority has acute pangs, because we do not have the power to obstruct a single thing the majority wants to get done. Let me draw a quick comparison. 
   When we were debating increasing American energy production to help our constituents and ease their pain at the pump by increasing supply, we were denied a bipartisan vote on an all-of-the-above energy strategy. Today, in the debate to bail out Wall Street, we see the Speaker demanding a bipartisan vote to bail them out. 
   The dichotomy proves the point that if this Democratic majority truly believes, as does their Speaker and Senator Obama and others, in President Bush's plan, yes, I know that sounds dysfunctional, but these are the times in which we live, they would then take it upon themselves to do one of two things: They would run us over; or instead they would choose the prudent course, to work with us. 
   Today they are beginning to show signs they may work with us. But, unfortunately, the political games continue. We continue to hear now, in addition to being unpatriotic and obstructive, which is impossible as the minority party in the House, we continue to hear that if we resist an arbitrary Sunday midnight deadline, we, who cannot stop this bill from being passed, are going to cause the meltdown of the American and the global economy. 
   We instead as House Republicans are going to do what you sent us here to do, which is guard your money with which you have entrusted us. What we are going to do is reject arbitrary deadlines, for two very critical reasons important to the American people. 
   One is we will have no rush to misjudgment, whereby a bad bill is passed for the sake of meeting an artificial deadline that winds up being either passed into law or being forced into a no vote defeat in this House, the result of which could be the very economic meltdown we are trying to prevent. 
   The other alternative is if prudent consultation with Republicans and Democrats continue and we pass the arbitrary deadline, if investors' expectations are raised improperly and irresponsibly, if we do the right thing and take a prudent course with this legislation towards a pro-taxpayer outcome, the economic meltdown may still occur. 
   This is why House Republicans refuse to put a deadline on these economic negotiations, which are of critical interest to the American people, the same way we opposed putting artificial deadlines on our troops in Iraq. One is dedicated to preserving the prosperity of the American people, just as the other was dedicated to preserving the liberty of the American people by expanding it to the Iraqis. 
   We have failed to do so in the past in our negotiations with the Democratic Party to make it clear that we have learned our lesson. We will not legislate defeat, either of our troops or of the American taxpayer, and we will continue to stand strong in their defense. 
   Why is this critically important? If one looks at the lessons of history, we see critical times where decisions are made that affect future generations. This is such a time. 
   This is the first economic panic of the global economy. The precedent that we set as your servants in Congress will be followed for decades to come. If we are rushed into this by a market bent upon getting their billions from taxpayers, we will set a precedent that we will rue. If we take our time and have prudent, responsible progress towards a pro-taxpayer result, such as embodied in the Cantor-Ryan plan, we will have done our job, not only for the crisis of the present, but for future generations to come. 
   This is why today I say I have never been more proud to be a House Republican, because in many ways the more you are reviled for not abandoning the hard-working, responsible American people, for not abrogating their trust in you to protect their tax dollars and their futures, we wear it as a badge of honor, because that is precisely what we were elected to do as the party of Lincoln, as the party of Reagan. 
   And I have a history lesson as I conclude for the party of Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson stood tall for the working people of America in the face of every rich special interest that this Nation had. When they demanded a Bank of the United States and got a servile Congress to pass it for them, he vetoed it, not once but twice, because he knew that the best way America could grow was from families, communities and neighborhoods, not from a centralized Bank of the United States. 
   Today we face a centralized shadow bank of the United States on Wall Street, and this is precisely the forces that we are standing up to for the responsible, hard-working people of America. And when Andrew Jackson for the second time vetoed a charter for the Bank of the United States, he said something that I would ask every Democrat in this Chamber to remember: ``There are no necessary evils in government.'' 
   So that when this Democratic majority brings a bill to the floor, make sure that you believe in it; because if you do not believe in it and you do not vote for it, or you do, do not go home and tell your constituents that this was a necessary evil to get through this time. And we as Republicans on our part will always remember the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson: ``If one man plant himself upon his convictions and then abide, the whole huge world will come around to him.'' 
   We will stand our ground, backed by principle and the American people, and we will do our duty. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from New Jersey.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT FOR AN ALL-OF-THE-ABOVE ENERGY STRATEGY -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, in August the high price of energy helped cost 84,000 Americans their jobs; 39,000 auto manufacturing jobs in the State of Michigan alone were reported lost. 
   The response of this Democratic Congress was to take a 5-week paid vacation at taxpayer expense without doing anything on the price of energy. 
   What we have asked for repeatedly in this Chamber, and even through the recess by taking to the floor, is for an all-of-the-above energy strategy that includes maximum American energy production, commonsense conservation, and free market green innovations. It is time for a vote on this commonsense bipartisan proposal. The American people cannot afford to wait. 
   Instead, we see a Speaker who had time to write a book now coming to us finding time to write a new energy proposal unilaterally. 
   All we ask for is a vote on existing legislation. Again, Mr. Speaker, the American people cannot afford to wait.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (ENERGY SOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. We all have different constituencies, but I think you said something that I can't quite agree with, and that is that everybody seems to understand this problem and what the solutions are. 
   I had a friend. We used to play in a band back in Detroit Rock City, and my brother one time loaned him my guitar. So it dawned on me that before the statute of limitations expired, I better go get my guitar back. 
   So I went to see Bob. He was living in his parents' basement and he was enjoying some goat's milk and granola. I complimented him on his earth shoes and I said, ``Dude, I want my guitar back.'' 
   He said, ``You can have it back because it doesn't make very much noise.'' 
   I said, ``Bob, it's an electric guitar. You have to plug it in.'' Bob didn't like that because Bob believed he was getting electricity from the local nuclear plant and had to make a stand even at the expense of no one hearing his cacophony of terrible folk music.  
   He then said, ``You work in Congress, right?'' 
   ``Yes, I do.'' 
   ``So you go up to Lansing to do that?'' 
   ``No, Bob, I go up to Washington.'' 
   He said, ``I have something to tell you people.'' 
   I was fascinated, so I said, ``What do you have?'' 
   He said, ``We have to get the rest of the world to like us, and we have to stop our reliance on foreign oil. And we have to make sure that we don't tear up America's natural resources trying to drill our way out of this problem.'' 
   I looked at Bob and I said, ``Bob, I would rather have the world respect America, but be that as it may. You want people to like America, but you have just told them you are not going to buy their product because they are foreigners. This might be detrimental to your cause. And if you are talking about not producing American oil, where are you going to get the oil to compensate for that so as supply increases, prices can come down?'' 
   He then said that he agreed with many Democrats that we should have OPEC produce more oil. 
   I then asked Bob if he understood that OPEC is composed of foreigners whose oil he no longer wanted to buy so we could break America's reliance on foreign oil. The dazed look on his face was akin to the one that he had probably around 1983 prom night shortly before his parents took away the car keys for quite some time. 
   The reality is we hear circular arguments about what needs to be done. Bob is not an exception. Every day here on the floor of the Congress we hear every excuse in the book as to why the American people will not be allowed to solve the gas price problem and the energy problem. 
   As Ronald Reagan once said: In this instance, government is not the solution, government is the problem. 
   If the government would just get out of the way, remove its regulations, litigation, taxation, and other obstacles to the production of American energy by entrepreneurs and allow free markets to work, the supply of oil will increase. It will be American oil. The price will start to stabilize as investors within the world markets realize that we are serious about attaining energy security. Gas prices will precipitously fall, and not only will the energy problem begin to be addressed by the very people who can do it best, the American people, you will also to start to see people understand that there is no other alternative than to face the reality that if you want energy security, you must concomitantly reduce the bureaucracy. 
   Again in a nutshell, if we want to help our little guys and gals, get big government out of their way, allow American energy production, allow for commonsense conservation, allow for free market innovations as we transition to energy security and independence. That is the best thing we can do for our constituents and for my friend Bob. 
   I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7321, AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, just two quick points, one is the funding was already brought up by the ranking member of Financial Services. We will hear a lot from my side of the aisle about how much money we are saving the taxpayers. 
   I would remind those who voted to appropriate this into the low-interest energy loans to help cover the unfunded CAFE mandate that that appropriation is gone. It is either going to go to help the auto industry survive a liquidity crisis, or it will be expended elsewhere. There is no savings there. 
   Secondly, I would like to remind everyone in the room that your love for the taxpayers should also extend to the hardworking men and women, be they white collar or blue collar that work in the auto industry in the United States, that work in the manufacturing sector in the United States, and whose social costs, through a cavalier and calloused approach to bankruptcy, will be borne by the very taxpayers of the United States, except there will be one difference, they will be out of work and will no longer be taxpayers.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. I come from Michigan. I was born in Detroit. Wherever you go in the world, people know two things about Detroit. They know we make cars and they know we make music, Motown. And so when we find ourselves in difficult situations, it is not unusual for us to refer to music to help keep our lucidity and our balance to come through the tough times. 
   As I listen to the debate on the auto industry, in many ways I'm reminded of Bob Seger's song where he says: To the IRS I'm another file. I'm just a statistic on a sheet. I feel like a number. I'm not a number. I'm a man. 
   We've heard a lot of talk about the policy undergirding this bill. There are good arguments on both sides, but I live with the people who will be affected by it. There have been those who have said bankruptcy is an option. Many people have said bankruptcy is a preferred option. I suppose bankruptcy is an option for those who it is not an option for. Why? Because those who like bankruptcy should first impose bankruptcy upon themselves and to see how their family feels when their future has been foreclosed, when they have no job, when they have no hope, when they believe that they have been forgotten because they are a number. 
   We can talk about the small businesses. We have small businesses in Michigan, and they rely on manufacturing jobs in the auto industry to stay in business, because the ripple effect is not a ripple effect. It is a tsunami effect. For one manufacturing job, you will lose 7 to 10 others, and we in Michigan have felt this pain. Oh, we have felt this pain, and we have seen the cost of the restructuring that so many here seem oblivious to. 
   But again, we're numbers, I guess, in Michigan. We're statistics. We're involved in systems. We've been devoid of souls evidently at least by the opinion-makers and looters that have now watched the restructuring that so many of us on both sides of the aisle have watched for years. 
   But we're from Michigan. We did not complain. We kept our nose to the grindstone. We gritted our teeth. We suffered and endured. We endured as businesses closed, as white collar and blue collar jobs were lost. We endured as retirees worried about what would happen to their hard-earned lifetime of benefits, those legacy costs so many are so willing to shave, our senior citizens' lifetimes of hard work. They played by the rules, which bankruptcy would change. 
   We've heard a lot about the quality gap. We have heard a lot about the cost. I guess we should make less to be like everybody else. It's not a very attractive option for real people, but if you're a number, if you're a statistic on a sheet, this makes perfect sense. It's very logical. It's very logical unless you start to worry about the person behind the statistic, the person who will get to look amongst their Christmas cards for a layoff notice, the ones who have already had an anxious Thanksgiving as we performed our due diligence upon the executives and President Gettelfinger of the UAW and had them come in and testify. 
   We asked them how they got here. We asked them why they were in a restructuring now, again, as if the last several years had never happened. And I think they were productive meetings in the end. It brought us here to a bill that we believe can protect taxpayers and can help an industry that has been restructuring continue to survive. 
   And if a bridge loan is passed, will we be happy in Detroit? Will we be happy in manufacturing throughout America? No. And it's not because it's not the money we wanted. It's because we know a painful restructuring will continue if this bridge loan is approved. 
   You see, to me, this is not abstract. My son Neal, my oldest son, turned 14, he looked at me and said, hey, Dad, I know what I want to be when I grow up. I said, well, as long as it is not a Congressman, I'm okay with that, whatever it is. And he looked at me, and he said I want to be an automotive engineer. And because of the restructuring in the auto industry, because of the pain that we've had and because of the reality that our children leave us for better climates economically and otherwise, I didn't have the heart to tell my son that the likelihood of him achieving his dream of being an automotive engineer would be foreclosed to him. 
   And there are so many other children that grow up loving cars, who want to have that experience, and it's not just the children. It is the parents, the parents who work in the industry, white collar, blue collar, and my Republican friends, it is not just the white collar we must worry about. 
   I have a very interesting experience when I talk to people on my side of the aisle about UAW and their concessions. Give credit where credit is due. They've been a partner with the big three in making painful concessions. I hope one thing yet will suffice. 
   I once spent a freezing winter morning in front of the glass house at the Ford Company corporate headquarters in Dearborn. All those employees, those UAW members that people say don't want to work, come to work and don't want to perform, don't care about their quality of performance, I will tell you what. They stood out in 0-degree temperatures to keep the Wixom plant in my district open. That's how badly they wanted to work. That's how much they cared about the production of those cars. That's how much they loved their families. 
   For those who think we've not been restructuring, the Wixom plant was closed as part of a Ford Motor Company restructuring. How many more people that want to work will be precluded because we did not give them the opportunity? 
   We hear that the auto industry has brought it on itself. Well, that's what Washington does. Washington makes bad decisions and blames the victim. And we're not going through the painful litany of how Washington has not been as helpful as it could be, but let us suffice to say that throughout the entire restructuring process that we have endured and know will continue, we did not come here with our hand out, did we? 
   We did not ask the Federal Government to take over all the health care of the employees. We did not ask the Federal Government to keep the Wixom plant open. We did not ask the Federal Government to do anything but leave us alone while we continued our painful restructuring and gritted our teeth and kept our nose to the grindstone. 
   And now, circumstances outside of our control have led us to the point where we have to be here or there will be no domestic auto industry in the United States, and there will be no manufacturing base in the United States, and this at a time when it has been pointed out the taxpayers that work in the auto industry are watching the people at AIG talk about $4 million per person bonuses after they have been bailed out to the tune of roughly $40 billion in this last round of their dollars. But then again, when you're a statistic, when you're a number, those things don't really matter for the people who have to make the decisions. 
   We come here to make decisions as best we can in public policy, but the overriding goal is to serve the people that those policies affect, and in my mind, the failure of sound policies here at least gives us the chance to give these people to survive, to keep a manufacturing sector in place in the United States, and to let these working families continue to endure and grit their teeth and keep their nose to the grindstone and work and hope for the best. Because if we do not, we will be confirming that they are statistics, they are numbers, that they are worthy of bankruptcy because that's what makes economic sense, if not moral and societal sense. 
   And to close, I remember very well coming home after the Thanksgiving break after we had the auto industry in, and I was driving past the Jefferson plant.

   It has been an anxious holiday season in Michigan and the Midwest in the auto industry and the manufacturing sector. They have seen Congress perform its rightful oversight over their request for a bridge loan from the taxpayers of the United States. And today, after due deliberation, I think it is appropriate that we have a vote on this legislation, because behind all the statistics and all the talk of bankruptcies are hard-working people who deserve to know an answer to a fundamental question: Does the Congress of the United States care about them?

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (LEARN HOW TO SPEAK DEMOCRAT -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, in the interest of legislative process whereby we hear many speeches on the floor, many Members talk to their constituents, I am going to try to bring a bit of enlightenment to this process with the use of a technological device known as a ruler and charts. 
   We are going to learn how to speak Democrat today, speaking local Democrat. 
   Often we heard the word ``progressive,'' which translates into ``regressive.'' As used in a sentence, ``Democrats are progressive.'' The translation, ``Democrats are regressive.'' 
   We hear the word ``change,'' which means ``the 1970s.'' ``Democrats will bring you change.'' Translation, ``Democrats will bring you the 1970s.'' 
   ``Government'' means ``socialism.'' ``Democrats support proactive government.'' Translation, ``Democrats support proactive socialism.'' 
   ``Enhance revenues'' translates into ``raise taxes.'' ``Democrats will enhance revenues.'' Translation, ``Democrats will raise taxes.'' 
   This is my favorite part. ``The rich means you.'' For example, ``Democrats will only tax the rich.'' Translation, ``Democrats will only tax you.'' Ouch. 
   ``Invest'' translates into ``waste.'' Again, used in a sentence, ``Democrats will invest your money.'' Translation, ``Democrats will waste your money.'' 
   ``Energy'' means ``lethargy.'' ``Democrats have an energy policy.'' Translation, ``Democrats have a lethargy policy.'' 
   ``Green-collar jobs'' translates into ``unemployment.'' ``Democrats will replace your blue-collar jobs with green-collar jobs'' translates into ``Democrats will replace your blue-collar jobs with unemployment.'' 
   Speaking global Democrat. ``Diplomacy'' equals ``magic.'' ``Democrats will protect America from Iranian nukes through tough principled diplomacy'' translates into ``Democrats will protect America from Iranian nukes through tough principled magic.'' 
   ``Engaged'' means ``appease.'' ``Democrats will engage America's enemies.'' Translation, ``Democrats will appease America's enemies.'' 
   Importantly, ``end'' means ``lose.'' ``Democrats will end the Iraq war.'' Translation, ``Democrats will lose the Iraq war.'' 
   Finally, contextually construing electoral Democrat, i.e., walking the party plank. This is a graduate-level course. 
   ``As a progressive party, Democrats will bring you change by using government to enhance revenues from the rich to invest in the production of energy and green-collar jobs and by using diplomacy to engage America's enemies and end the Iraq war.'' 
   The translation, ``As a regressive party, Democrats will bring you the 1970s by using socialism to raise taxes from you to waste in the production of lethargy and unemployment, and by using magic to appease America's enemies and lose the Iraq war.'' 
   I hope this exercise has been instructive.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Chairman, in addressing my issues with this budget, I prepared some elaborate charts. I know that you are pretty worn out of charts by now, but I think these will try to encapsulate some of the problems that I believe my party and myself in particular have with this budget. 
   Some of the problems I think have to be dealt with right off the top. We have a budget that promises to balance by 2012. It does so with many promises for future spending, and it promises to hit American taxpayers with the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, we are told not to be concerned about that. As someone with young children who would like to be out of the poorhouse when I retire, I worry about that greatly. I worry about that greatly, the economic opportunities that they will have in the future. 
   So when I see that it is being defended, the largest tax increase in human history is being defended because there are promises contained within the budget that, no, we do not mean this, we will only raise certain of your taxes, that still provides me very cold comfort indeed. 
   When I hear there are promises for billions upon billions in future spending in things called reserve funds, which means there is no money in it, it constitutes an IOU account, which to its name you have signed the American taxpayer, I also take very cold comfort in that. 
   When I hear that we talk about trying to find tax gap money to pay for new spending, I am reminded of the fact that tax gap funding is the difference between taxes levied and taxes collected. In short, tax gap money has to go for deficit reduction or debt reduction, because you are going to collect money for which services have already been purchased. If you allow new spending based upon that money, you will continue to perpetuate a deficit. 
   Now, I have come to this also as a father with young children and as a member of Generation X. I know I don't look it, because I am bald, but I am far younger than my service here has rendered me to look. 
   In the final analysis, there is no true entitlement reform here. My generation is the one that thinks it is never going to see Social Security, that the babyboomers will break the social safety net. We are concerned about Medicare, we are concerned about Medicaid, and yet we are told that we will deal with that later. 
   We are told by the Democratic majority that, when they were in the minority, somehow we impaired their ability to think and devise plans to save the social safety net of the United States, and let us wait. I tell you, I am not getting any younger, and I prefer not to wait. 
   Now, one of my particular concerns I have to address. I have much respect for the Blue Dogs in the Democratic Party. My father was a Blue Dog Democrat. He wound up being a Reagan Democrat, which I think is pretty good. 
   The Blue Dog Democrats looked like this before in the past when they were in the minority, trying to show that they were fiscally conservative. Now, I don't know that I would let this dog watch my wallet, but I wouldn't think he would bite me. So I might take a chance on him or not. 
   But today's budget, for the Blue Dogs who support it, I want you to see what America is going to think of you. There you are. There you are, with a fine new hairdo. There are you are with silk and threads, purchased with the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now, that dog might not bite you, but I certainly wouldn't trust it to guard my wallet either.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Madam Speaker, as a husband, as a father, as a former child, I respect very much what we are endeavoring to accomplish today. But we always have to remember that it is not simply enough to do the right thing; we must do the right thing the right way. And again, that is the purpose of this debate. 
   Much of what we hear outside of these walls tends to mute the serious discussion that we have. I know that following this debate there will be those ads or others that will say that Republicans do not like kids. I assure you, Republicans like kids, and not just medium rare with a side of fries. We do care about the future of children. But it is the comprehensive holistic approach to the care of children which we discuss too little in this body. 
   It is my belief that what we should have done, to truly put poor kids first, was that from the first moments of the first 100 hours this should have been the first bill we could have done. Instead, other bills were passed and billions were spent. 
   We have seen appropriation bills come through this Chamber repeatedly where billions are spent, and there was no talk of putting kids first and helping poor kids have health insurance. 
   And now today we reach the point where the only way we can help poor children is to raise taxes on the American people. This is not a prioritization of children and their health care. 
   I am prepared to accept the majority when they say that they have, the second time around is the charm and they have fixed access of illegals to this program. I am prepared to be concerned about poor kids and kids who are in the margins. But I do ask them to reconsider raising taxes, because we do not want to see one day where our children grow up to be the healthiest people in the unemployment line.

   Mr. McCOTTER. Over the recess, I had the opportunity to meet with a manufacturing community in my district; talk to managers, talk to owners, talk to employees. The one thing they all agree on is the cost of American energy is adding to their fixed costs at the very time international pressure is forcing them to reduce the cost of their product. In short, they're facing the nightmare scenario of energy prices forcing them to lay off workers in the manufacturing sector or to, unfortunately, terminate their employment altogether. 
   What we need in the United States is American energy production, conservation, and free market innovation if we are to protect these jobs and help these workers. It is very cold comfort for the people of Michigan and the manufacturing workers of the United States to hear that some day a green collar job will come and take away your blue collar job. When you're putting them out of work today, the prospects for tomorrow look much more bleak than they do to some academic or to some politician who is engaging in rhetoric that somehow the government will innovate us out of this effort. 
   We need American production to help protect manufacturing jobs and help provide prosperity for the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (IN COMMEMORATION OF TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTEST -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, today the world commemorates and mourns the events that happened in Tiananmen Square 19 years ago today. It was then that over 2,000 people were massacred by the Communist regime for the crime of quoting Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, the crime of creating a model of the Statue of Liberty, killed for the crime of wanting their God-given right to liberty. 
   In these 19 years, many things have changed and, sadly, too many people have forgotten. 
   But there are 130 people that cannot forget. There are 130 people that remain in the communist Chinese prisons for participating in the pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989. 
   Today, many are told that the communist Chinese regime will one day change. We've heard this for 19 years. We have seen corporate leaders, we have seen elected officials, and regrettably we will soon see the President of the United States go over to Beijing for the Olympics and meet with the butchers that killed 2,000 people, and they continue to imprison 130 of their fellow human beings. 
   The arguments that will be made in attending this propaganda fest will be that we have to show our respect to the Chinese people; that we have to show them that somehow the United States of America wants to usher in this communist, nuclear-armed dictatorship into the world stage. I find this logic reprehensible. 
   The United States is a beacon of liberty and hope for all the world suppressed. When the leaders of the United States, be they in business or, more importantly, in the corridors of Congress or in the halls of the White House, attend these communist Olympics, the Chinese people that I am worried about, the Chinese people that I believe we will not be standing behind will be the people who are rotting in the jails for the crime of yearning to be free. 
   The question then arises, what can we do as a Nation? Many believe the 21st century will be the century of the communist Chinese regime; that their economy will pass ours; that their rival model of governance will be adopted throughout the world of the corporate structure where one can make money when allowed by the tyrants and that all of your political rights simply do not exist but for the whim of the communist party. 
   I believe the people who are writing the obituary of the West and of our free Republic are mistaken, and I believe that over time, the voices and the influence of the communist tyrants in Beijing will ring as hollow in the ears of our fellow human beings as once did the callow calls from the halls of the Polit Bureau that the Soviet Union was going to bury the United States. 
   So as we go forward toward the Olympics, as we go forward from the 19th commemoration of the butchering in Tiananmen Square of the killing of students my own age for wanting the same God-given rights that I and everyone in this country have, let's not forget the 130. Let's demand their release, for if we do not, we will betray not only their liberty, but our professed commitment to being a beacon of hope for all of the world; and we will have squandered the legacy given to us as the custodians of this last best hope of Earth.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like today to discuss an issue that is on the horizon that could very well affect the economic freedom of Americans, especially their family's prosperity and happiness. It is an issue that I would also like to thank the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Representative Frank, and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Representative Kanjorski, for bringing forward. 
   The issue I am talking about is the issue of sovereign wealth funds. Many people will question what is a sovereign wealth fund. The answer is very simple. A sovereign wealth fund is a fund that is controlled by a foreign government that then invests into the private market of the United States. 
   Many people, especially those within my own party, disturbingly think sovereign wealth funds are a wonderful way to inject capital into the United States. The reality is these are very dangerous instrumentalities of foreign nations and would allow for the potential interference of these foreign nations in our domestic affairs, and not only within our economic sphere.  
   One of the reasons I joined the Republican Party was because I oppose socialism, communism; and I wanted to advance the cause of liberty. A sovereign wealth fund denies all of those. Again, a sovereign wealth fund is controlled by a government. Those who recall economics can understand that when a government buys an asset from the private sector, when the government owns it, the product or service has been ``nationalized.'' This is the root of socialism. Government buys something in the private sector, socialism gets bigger, free markets and free enterprise and free people get diminished. This is the root problem of a sovereign wealth fund. It will diminish the economic liberty of individuals in the face of governments that are trying to control free enterprise. 
   We should not have this occurring in the United States of America, the bastion of free enterprise conducted by free people. 
   The second problem I have with sovereign wealth funds grows from the first: a foreign country controls this fund. This is not protectionism of anything except Americans' liberty, prosperity, sovereignty, and security. 
   The Communist Chinese have one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. As they continue to tell us, although few people seem to understand that they are serious, they remain communists. The communist sovereign wealth fund from China comes in and buys private assets in the United States. Those government assets are now socialized; and, again, your freedom, liberty, prosperity, and security are diminished and there is a huge problem with this in the hands of the Communist Chinese. 
   In addition, whereas in the free market private investment funds have to raise capital voluntarily from individuals and then make rational decisions based upon the profit motive, a sovereign government's wealth fund is allowed to take and spend and invest. They spend and invest that which they take from their people. They have no accountability to these citizens, and they can invest for a political motive. 
   These entities of sovereign wealth funds are antithetical to private sector free market investment. And, again, when they are forced to operate on a private sector profit motive, the sovereign wealth fund can operate on a political motive, which may or may not be in the long-term interests of the people of the United States. 
   So for two reasons I would like to go on record immediately in my opposition to sovereign wealth funds in any nation's hands being invested in the United States and socializing our private sector assets. And I would like to also especially emphasize my abject contempt for nations that are opposed to the United States' continued existence as a bastion of liberty being able to buy up influence within the United States based upon a solely political motive, and that political motive is not in the people's best interests. 
   So to my fellow Republicans I would ask them to remember why they are Republicans, to remember that we have the duty to advance the economic liberty of Americans and to protect and preserve their liberty and prosperity and security, and ask them to reassess these sovereign wealth funds. Because no matter how much money they inject into our economy to socialize private sector assets, the cost we are going to pay to the long-term vitality of our free people is too high a price to tender to the very enemies of our existence.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Chairman, it was interesting that the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee pointed out since the time Dictator Castro has held sway over the Cuban people, the United States has had Presidents come and go, which seems to point to one ineluctable fact: the United States, as a free people, can make their Presidents come and go, which is an option the Cuban people do not have. 
   As a practical matter, I oppose this amendment for a very simple reason: it would open up trade with a state sponsor of terrorism, and I can find no logical way to differentiate one state sponsor of terrorism from another. It would be akin to simply trying to determine what the make of the car that ran you over was as opposed to the driver. In either event, you are probably likely dead, and the rest of the question is academic. 
   Secondly, we have heard much in this debate about the benefit that we may reap in terms of our corporations and farmers, but let us never forget that the United States must always care more about the cause of human freedom than about mere money.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCOTTER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCOTTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, he was conscientious, committed to peace and momentarily praised. His laurels burned in the bombings. His valorous and vain efforts had but hastened upon his people. 
   Yet, in eulogizing this ``English worthy,'' Sir Winston Churchill, an ardent opponent of the deceased's policy of appeasement, unexpectedly struck a conciliatory chord toward the late Neville Chamberlain: 
   ``It is not given to human beings, happily for them, for otherwise life would be intolerable, to foresee or to predict to any large extent the unfolding course of events. In one phase, men seem to have been right, in another they seem to have been wrong. Then again, a few years later when the perspective of time is lengthened, all stands in a different setting. There is a new proportion. There is another scale of values. History, with its flickering lamp, stumbles along the trail of the past, trying to reconstruct its scenes, to revive its echoes, and kindle with pale gleams the passion of former days. What is the worth of all this? The only guide to a man is his conscience; the only shield to his memory is the rectitude and sincerity of his actions. It is very imprudent to walk through life without this shield, because we are so often mocked by the failure of our hopes and the upsetting our calculations; but with this shield, however the fates may play, we march always in the ranks of honor.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, while not serving in this Chamber during the debates on the resolution authorizing the President of the United States to use martial force to remove Iraq's Baathist regime for numerous just causes, including its refusal to honor its Gulf War cease-fire and United Nations' resolutions, during my time as a temporary custodian of my constituents' office, I have striven to ensure our Nation's victory in the battles for Iraq, Afghanistan, and in the overarching war on terror. In doing so for 3 years, I have four times traveled to Iraq and once to Afghanistan to meet with our troops; visited wounded citizen soldiers, eulogized our fallen, and consoled their grieving families. As a witness to their courage, sacrifice and suffering, I have been morally compelled to support every appropriation for our military and civilian personnel in harm's way, oppose every policy injurious to our country's common cause of victory; advance my own ideas on how to secure our victory, including the introduction of bipartisan, though ultimately unaccepted, legislation to establish concerted congressional oversight over the course of this conflict; and refused to condone a resolution by my Republican peers which failed to meet its duty; and, immediately afterwards, introduced a resolution of my own in order to fulfill my duty to our soldiers, my constituents, and our country. 
   As a staunch supporter of our Nation's mission in Iraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the world, I did so in the belief that it is morally imperative for every sovereign American citizen and their congressional servants to ensure our valiant troops victoriously come home to their loved ones' arms. Were I to do otherwise and lapse in my moral duty, I would not only be violating our troops and my constituents' trust, I would be violating the dictates of my conscience. 
   It is equally true, of course, how within this House other Members' dictates of conscience have led them to a decidedly different, though equally constant course of action. To these Members and their fellow citizens who have done so to date, I share the sentiments Sir Winston held for Neville Chamberlain: You are ``An American Worthy,'' who ``however the fates may play, will ``march always in the ranks of honor.'' Yet, because the resolution thrust before us is a craven exposition of political expediency in a time of national crisis, today many may stray from the ranks of honor. 
   This resolution is ``nonbinding,'' which means the resolution has no force of law to compel future legislative acts in compliance with its dictates. In sum, then, this resolution legally changes nothing. Americans' money will still unabatedly facilitate our troops' continued deployment into harm's way, despite the United States Congress collectively condemning the President's announced troop reinforcement plan. This impotent resolution is injurious in the eyes of its opponents because it will undermine the morale  of our troops, their families, and our fellow citizens even as it heartens and emboldens our enemies; and this impotent resolution is injurious because it will not stop what many of its supporters purport will be a loss of life in a lost cause. By neither stopping the war nor speeding our victory and by calculatedly doing nothing in this time of national crisis, this resolution is immoral. 
   This immorality is manifest in how the resolution guilefully attempts to insinuate the United States Congress can simultaneously support our troops and oppose their mission. During a time of war, if an act is not i 
   our national interest, such as the President's plan is deemed to be in this resolution, the act is injurious to the national interest. At best, the act will expend resources, most tragically claim lives without furthering the cause of victory. Better than anyone, our troops understand this. Therefore, this Congress does not support our troops when it proclaims they are risking their lives in a doomed mission injurious to America. 
   Yet, if Congress persists in this insanity, the Members must meet their responsibility to enumerate the reasons they disapprove of the President's plan and, in point of fact, the mission upon which our troops have already embarked. But this resolution does not provide any rationale for its conclusion. Thus, rather than deserving our collective concurrence, this resolution deserves our universal condemnation. 
   To this, some supporters will object and allege two defenses for this resolution's fatal omission. Do not these supporters' floor remarks provide the rationales sufficient to sustain this resolution? No. If floor remarks alone are sufficient to sustain the resolution's conclusions, then floor remarks alone would be sufficient to derogate the President's plan and, ergo, vitiate any necessity for a written resolution. Conversely, if it is imperative for the plan's detractors to express their opposition in a written resolution, it is also imperative to express their reasons in writing. Alas, such logic pales before some Members' impulsive muse of the moment. 
   Let us, then, move to some of the resolution's supporters' second, far more distressing defense: ``A vote of disapproval on the President's plan will set the stage for additional Iraq legislation which will be coming to the House floor.'' As no one who participated in the crafting of this covert legislative agenda has deigned to inform the American people as to its aims, one wonders if it will cut off funding for our troops in harm's way or cut off critical reconstruction funding in the supplemental appropriations bill, thus toppling an unheralded but essential pillar of the President's new victory strategy and proving the perspicacity of the present resolution. While we wonder and worry, according to newspaper reports there is a strategy to make this rumored legislative plan palatable to the public. This strategy's tactics, which its instigators are more than happy to relate to the media, are reputed to include a coordinated multimillion-dollar TV campaign by leftist special-interest pressure groups. No doubt somewhere beyond this ephemeral stream of time there lurks a jealous Clement Vallandigham. But, in fairness, let us disdain a priori speculation, and instead examine a previous resolution to glean the potentialities of the present resolution's supporters' secret legislative plan. The following passages are excerpted from a previous resolution which, albeit more forthrightly, also opposes the Commander in Chief's decisions: 
   ``Resolved, That this convention does explicitly declare, as the sense of the American people, that after 4 years of failure ..... by the experiment of war, during which, under the pretense of a military necessity of war-power higher than the Constitution, the Constitution itself has been disregarded in every part, and public liberty and private right alike trodden down, and the material prosperity of the country essentially impaired, justice, humanity, liberty, and the public welfare demand that immediate efforts be made for cessation of hostilities ..... to the end that, at the earliest practicable moment, peace be restored.'' 
   This previous resolution too expresses its support for our troops in harm's way: 
   ``Resolved, That the sympathy of the Democratic Party is heartily and earnestly extended to the soldiery of our Army and sailors of our Navy who are and have been in the field and on the sea under the flag of our country, and in the events of its attaining power, they will receive all the care, protection, and regard that brave soldiers and sailors of the Republic have so nobly earned.'' 
   This previous resolution is the Democratic Party platform of 1864. 
   If the past is prologue, let us be firm in a fair request: If the resolution's supporters possess a victory strategy, or otherwise, for Iraq, these public servants must immediately reveal it to the sovereign citizens of the United States. If these stealth strategists refuse, they will incur the American people's inference this legislative plan assumes and will hasten our Nation's defeat in Iraq. How else could one explain these individuals' already having a legislative plan and an accompanying media plan premised upon our troop reinforcement failure, and doing so regardless of potential American victories on the ground or the advice of our military commanders? Perhaps while they demur from revealing it, these anonymous commander in chiefs will dubiously coin their legislative plan an ``exit strategy.''     
   It is an irrelevant distinction. Right now the enemy is actively seeking to murder more American and Iraqi soldiers and civilians. So right now and for the immediate future, an exit from Iraq is a defeat in Iraq. Whatever one pretends to the contrary, one will never convince our enemies otherwise. 
   Yes, it is all too human to wish the world were different; all too human to rationalize away one's misguided actions. Being composed of frail, fallible human beings, even great assemblies such as this have succumbed to the temptation. We must not. 
   Writing well before Churchill's magnanimous eulogy of Chamberlain and, to the contrary, warning the British people's representatives how history was pitiless, George Dangerfield coldly assessed his national leaders' mismanagement of state affairs during the pre-Great War years of 1910 to 1914: ``Along that row of distinguished and original faces there would pass from time to time, as lightly as a shadow upon the waters, an alarming, an alien spirit, a spirit dangerous and indefinite, the Spirit of Whimsy ..... In the hush of crisis, in the tumult of abuse, or when the stuffy air of the Commons seemed almost to glitter with the shining, salt ripples of sarcasm, there it played, airy, remote, and irresponsible.'' 
   Is an inchoate angst over history's final verdict the reason some supporters of this resolution have taken to this floor, though not in this resolution itself, and verbally professed three key defenses of their decision? One defense is they were misled into supporting an Iraqi regime change because of the false claim it did or might possess weapons of mass destruction. Mercifully, let us stipulate these elected officials performed their due diligence on the matter and, especially for our Democratic colleagues so situated, they did not overly trust the some many of them had accused of stealing a Presidential election. 
   Again, there were numerous justifiable reasons for authorizing the President of the United States to militarily execute a regime change in Iraq. As those reasons are written in that resolution, I will not dwell upon them, for they do not constitute the crux of the matter, which is this: the war aim of regime change was a success. It is the post-war failure of Iraqi reconstruction breeding our present perils. 
   Thus even if a Member of Congress can be excused for authorizing force on the basis of being ``misled,'' the Member of Congress cannot be excused for failing to demand adequate post-war reconstruction planning, nor for a 3-year failure to demand constructive changes to an inadequate post-war reconstruction plan. 
   Dovetailing with this defense, some of the resolution's supporters now claim their initial ardor for the regime change was a mistake because this administration has botched Iraqi reconstruction beyond salvaging and the fledgling democracy is now in a state of civil war. This argument has the  merit of being partially correct, for despite the hard-learned lessons of our Nation's former successes in doing so, this administration utterly failed to comprehend and implement the fundamental principles of reconstructing a defeated, belligerent nation. Importantly, this does not preclude reconstructing Iraq now. 
   While rife with sectarian violence, much of it instigated and perpetuated from external elements, Iraq is not in a civil war. Relative calm exists in most of the beleaguered nation's provinces, and if one dares to look, there are the agonizingly slow but significant signs of incremental progress in the establishment of order. This progression will be expedited by the administration's new plan, which finally incorporates the two fundamental principles of Iraqi or any reconstruction plan, one, a liberal democratic society evolves upward from its traditional roots of order, not from a centralized bureaucratic government downward; and, two, a nation's transformational evolution into a liberal democracy must contemporaneously provide transactional benefits to its citizens. These fundamental principles will be implemented through critical initiatives, such as provincial reconstruction teams, an accord on oil revenue allocations, and a national reconciliation process, amongst others. 
   But to earn the support of terrorized Iraqis, security must first be established so they may commence securing the blessings of liberty. This is why the troop reinforcement is required and why the twin pillars of troop reinforcement and grass-roots reconstruction can achieve a joint American and Iraqi victory over the enemies of liberty. 
   The ineluctable fact of our victory is it must be won with the help of Iraqis, which is disconcerting to many of this resolution's supporters who believe the Iraqis are unwilling to fight for their freedom and are incapable of perpetuating once it is secured. This argument often intersects with the charge our mission in Iraq has been untenably shifted from effectuating a regime change to erecting a model democracy; and for the above reasons, they think this is impossible. This deplorable argument is antithetical to the self-evident truths written into our own Declaration of Independence, though, sadly, it is not without precedent. Once more, let us reference another resolution, this one opposing a military mission creeping toward a decidedly different goal: 
   ``Resolved: that the emancipation proclamation of the President of the United States is as unwarranted in military as in civil law; a gigantic usurpation, at once converting the war, professedly commenced by the administration for the vindication of the authority of the Constitution, into a crusade for the sudden, unconditional and violent liberation of 3 million Negro slaves; a result which would not only be a total subversion of the Federal Union, but a revolution in the social organization of the Southern States, the immediate and remote, the present and far-reaching consequences of which to both races cannot be contemplated without the most dismal foreboding of horror and dismay. The proclamation invites servile insurrection as an element in this emancipation crusade, a means of warfare, th 
   inhumanity and diabolism of which are without example in civilized warfare, and which we denounce, and which the civilized world will denounce as an uneffaceable disgrace to the American people.'' 
   So much for the prognostications of the ``Peace Democrat'' controlled Illinois legislature's 1863 resolution. Thankfully, by the grace of God and the sanguine sacrifice of the American people, it was this Illinois legislature, not our African American brothers and sisters and our Nation's great emancipator, who are to be denounced by the civilized world for all eternity. 
   What of our legislative body? Now resurrects the specter of our own judgment, which hovers above and shadows us as we seek to ensure we are not forever weighed in the balance and found wonting. It is as it should be, as it must be, for notwithstanding its nonbinding nature, even after this resolution's disposition, our duty demands we make moral decisions affecting our Nation's victory or defeat, and our fellow citizens' lives or deaths. Is this not why, even while bearing malice towards none of them, in defending his own war plan, our own maligned President warned his opponents history is a harsh mistress: 
   ``Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we here, Congress and Executive, can secure its adoption? Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they, by any other means, so certainly or so speedily, assure these vital objects? We can succeed only by concert. It is not `Can any of us imagine better?' but `Can we all do better?' Objection whatsoever is possible. Still the question recurs `Can we do better?' The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise to the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country. 
   ``Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free, honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of Earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just, a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless.'' 
   My friends, history harkens your honorable hearts to reconsider supporting this immoral resolution. If one believes all human beings are equally God's children, whether they be free or yearning to breathe free, one cannot, after a cruel sip of hope, condemn 20 million of God's equally beloved children to a saturnalia of slaughter. If one supports our troops, one cannot deride their cause as injurious to our country. If one seeks our victory in the war on terror, one cannot advocate a retreat and defeat in the face of our enemy. 
   My friends, through the fog of war, our fiery trial illumes and creeps ever nearer along the trail. Rather than curse the darkness and dread the echoes of history's verdict, let us acquit ourselves with lasting honor by leading our searching Nation through these trying, transformational times and into a transcendent, triumphal tomorrow. Let us earn the esteem of the latest and later generations of all free people by reaffirming our revolutionary Republic cherishes the self-evident truth that all human beings yearn to breathe free. Let us, in our Nation's finest traditions and truest character, remove the Iraqi people's bonds of oppression and replace them with bonds of brotherhood amongst our free, sovereign, and secure peoples. 
   Let us, in the face of terror, march always in the ranks of honor and courageously and selflessly secure the Iraqi people's blessings of liberty and, in so doing, secure our own blessings of liberty for unnamed generations of American children. 
   Mr. Speaker, fully cognizant of my moral duty to our troops, my constituents, my country, and my Creator, I cannot in good conscience support this resolution, which is injurious to the cause of our Nation's victory and in consequence is patiently immoral. Therefore, I urge this resolution's rejection and pray God graces, guards, and guides the steps of all who bear the burden of our decisions made on behalf of the majestic American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
