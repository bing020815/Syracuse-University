<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE 73 PERCENT MAJORITY, A PLAN FOR INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, in our country, Americans debate, argue and discuss all types of issues. And because of the type of people we are, we seldom agree on everything. Almost any issue you bring before the American public, it is evenly split on most issues, about 50/50, sometimes a little more than others. 
   But today, 73 percent of all Americans believe we ought to drill offshore. That is a phenomenal number. 73 percent of Americans don't really agree on hardly anything, but they agree on drilling offshore because the American public gets it. They understand we need more crude oil, Mr. Speaker. And the only way we can get gasoline is from crude oil. And the offshore drilling ban by the President has been lifted. 
   The only thing standing between us and energy independence offshore is Congress. Congress has handcuffed the American public's will to drill offshore. 
   This map shows where we drill currently, Mr. Speaker. The section down here in the Southeast, where the blue markers are, now, I represent part of the State of Texas, and proud to do so. But we only drill in this country off the shore of Texas, Louisiana, parts of Mississippi, and parts of Alabama. 
   But yet, you see all of this red section, off of our shores, and in all of those areas there are places where there is crude oil on the bottom of the ocean. But yet, Congress won't let us drill there. There are a lot of reasons for that. They are all political, and they are all nonsense because there is oil out there. 
   Seventy-three percent of the American public say we ought to drill. We need help. Gasoline prices are too high. We can't afford to go to work. And even in California, 53 percent of the people who live on the West Coast in California say, for the first time in recent memory, that we ought to drill off that coast as well because there is crude oil out there in the Pacific. But because of political reasons and reasons that really don't make much sense we are not taking care of ourselves. 
   One argument is that we can't drill safely, that those oil rigs out there in the Gulf of Mexico and off the east and west coast will cause environmental damage because there will be pollution from that crude oil that would seep from those oil rigs. That is not correct, Mr. Speaker. 
   Give you the best example. In 2005, two hurricanes came blasting through my congressional district in Southeast Texas. Their names were Katrina and Rita. They came from Louisiana and Texas. Hundreds of offshore rigs in this area where we do drill were damaged or completely destroyed. But yet, we didn't hear 1 word about those rigs causing pollution from crude oil seepage from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, and the reason was it didn't  happen. Those massive valves that sit on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico called Christmas trees, that are made in Houston, Texas, by the way, they shut down. That crude oil was not allowed to escape and there was no environmental damage. 
   But still we hear this hue and cry. We can't drill safely. There is pollution. Crude oil will pollute our shores. Let's look at some facts instead of hysteria. 
   Pollution from crude oil. Here is where it comes from off our shores. Mother Nature is the biggest culprit. 63 percent of the pollution of crude oil that comes a shore is from Mother Nature. 
   The second is boating, 32 percent. Tankers cause 3 percent. And if you look at that little bitty line over there on the end, Mr. Speaker, 2 percent comes from offshore drilling. Mother Nature is the culprit, not offshore drilling. We can drill offshore safely. 
   We need to take care of ourselves. If we allow the opening of the Outer Continental Shelf, two good things will happen. Those oil companies will have to pay a lot of money for the right to drill offshore. That brings revenue into the Federal Treasury, to the taxpayers. And we ought to let States that do allow offshore drilling, no matter which State it is, get a portion of that offshore lease revenue, and let them use it in their states for whatever they wish, like education, transportation, health care, whatever they wish. 
   Secondly, thousands, literally thousands of high-paying jobs will be created if we allow offshore drilling, plus we will have the crude oil, then the gasoline and be able to reduce the price. That is not the only answer, offshore drilling, but it is one of the answers. 
   And we are not doing anything. Like my grandfather used to say, when all is said and done, more is said than done. And we haven't done anything this week. We could be 1 week up on offshore drilling if we just took the handcuffs off of America and allowed offshore drilling. 
   $425 million dollars a day goes to Saudi Arabia from the American taxpayers to buy crude oil. $425 million. That money needs to stay home. We need to take care of ourselves. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, as our ``Drill Nothing'' Congress continues to ignore viable energy options such as drilling in ANWR, I thought a chart would best illustrate where these drilling locations are. 
   Madam Speaker, this is Alaska, this is ANWR, and this little bitty red speck is where the proposed drilling in ANWR is to be. It takes glasses to see it because it's only 3 square miles. To put it in perspective, the Houston Intercontinental Airport is five times the size of this speck. Disney World is 15 times the size of this speck, and the King Ranch in Texas is 500 times this proposed drilling location. 
   Madam Speaker, it's time for Congress to stop using the distortions of the elites in the environmental fear lobby as an excuse not to take care of ourselves. America needs to take care of Americans and not be held hostage by OPEC and handcuffed by the Drill Nothing Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank first of all the chairman of the committee for his work on this bill and his vast knowledge of transportation issues, not just with bridges but every other issue regarding transportation and how he is able to give us that history lesson every time the committee meets, either in English or Spanish. He can do both of those. 
   Today there is a reasonably good system in place for removing old bridges when they need to be replaced with new bridges, but it is in the circumventing of that system that causes problems. Old bridges that have been replaced, if not removed, could cause nationwide problems for shipbuilders, ship operators, port authorities, terminal operators and even barge operators. 
   Under current law, bridges have to come down or be repaired when they pose an unreasonable obstruction to navigation. This is carried out through bridge permit requirements, providing that an old bridge must be torn down when the new bridge is built and the old bridge no longer serves a transportation function. 
   One example of where this process is not followed is the Brightman Street Bridge case. This bridge is 101 years old. New construction started 10 years ago, but yet the new bridge has still not been built, and now there are plans to keep the old bridge in place even after the new bridge is constructed. 
   There has been a constant increase in the size of ships on our waterways throughout history. This makes bridges built in the past an obstruction and danger to navigation. For instance, the width between the bridge and the pier on the new Brightman Street bridge are much longer than on the current bridge. And unless old bridges like this are removed, they will still be navigation problems upriver. 
   We need to understand that some of the worst, most severely deteriorated bridges in the country are not only hazardous to vehicular traffic and people traveling on top of the bridge, but also to maritime and perhaps rail traffic that are below them. There are bridges deemed by the Coast Guard to be navigational hazards, and when States build a replacement bridge, the hazards ought to be removed. 
   There are roughly 60 bridges with a sufficiency rating of 5 or less, or what I call 95 percent deficient that are over navigable waters according to 2007 numbers. 
   The purpose of this motion to recommit is to be proactive, Mr. Speaker, and strengthen current policy that when a permit is issued to build a new bridge it also includes a provision or requirement for removal of the old bridge. If an exception to this rule is allowed to continue, it could lead to similar bridges being kept nationwide for limited transportation purposes. But the sole purpose of using these old bridges is to really block upstream development, specifically blocking energy development upstream that has already been approved. 
   Keeping an old bridge when a replacement has been constructed has less to do with the condition of the bridge and more to do with the existence of an unnecessary barrier to navigation. This makes the dangers of an old bridge worse for the maritime industry. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (ALL IS NOT QUIET ON THE SOUTHERN FRONT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Iran, Somalia, Syria, Colombia, Afghanistan, and Iraq have something in common. These are six nations, among several others, where the State Department recommends that Americans don't travel. 
   But today there was another advisory issued, but this one was not by the State Department but by the State of Texas through the Texas Department of Public Safety. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to read just a portion of this into the Record. Here is what it says. Texas Department of Public Safety dated today: ``Due to the increased rising level of violence in Mexico--which is attributed to drug cartels, violent criminal organizations, and increased presence of military personnel in some Mexican border communities--it is recommended that persons be discouraged from traveling to Mexican border towns, particularly those that have recently been scenes of gang-related violent activity. These communities include Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros, Reynosa, Rio Bravo, Miguel Aleman, and Ciudad Juarez.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, you see, the Texas Department of Public Safety has issued an advisory for Americans: don't go to these border towns because of the violence. And the reason the violence has increased specifically has to do with what happened in Rio Bravo which is across the Rio Grande River from Texas. The Rio Bravo mayor last month was gunned down while leaving a restaurant, along with two other politicians. The Mexican Government sent in troops to help quell the violence. But 5 days ago, local police in several Mexican border towns, specifically Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros, and Reynosa, were relieved of their duties by the federal Government because of their alleged links to drug cartels, specifically the gulf drug cartel. 
   What that means, Mr. Speaker, now on the Mexican border, bordering Texas, there are 6,000 Mexican troops stationed there. They are stationed from Matamoros to Miguel Aleman. Now, Matamoros is the border town across from Brownsville, Texas. Brownsville is on the furthest eastern tip of Texas. Brownsville is a big community, and across the river is Matamoros. And Miguel Aleman is 100 miles upriver across the river from Roma, Texas. There is violence in these border towns. 
   Many people don't understand what a border town is. A border town is a town on the American border and has another town very similar to it on the Mexican border. And both of these towns, being border towns, border each other separated only by the border between Mexico and the United States. 
   The State Department has already issued a travel alert for Mexico because of the violence that occurs there. But now the State of Texas finds a need to warn all citizens, especially law enforcement officials, of the problems. 
   Mr. Speaker, the open-border crowd denies this violence occurs on our southern front. I have been down to the Texas-Mexico border now 13 times, and I have talked to the local people who  live there, and I have also talked to the chamber of commerce types who say, Oh, there is no problem here in our border towns. There is no violence or drugs. We don't have a problem with infiltration from drug cartels and criminals coming into our cities. Of course they say those things, in my opinion, because they want that open border for that travel back and forth between Mexico and the United States because of money, because of commerce, because of that greed that so many people have; and they deny the fact that the border needs to be secure. 
   We live in denial sometimes that there is a border war that is existing. It is a violent border war. It is a border war between drug cartels and criminals, and many of those people don't just stay on the Mexican side. 
   When Sheriff Rick Flores was here in Congress and testified before Congress, he is the sheriff in Webb County, Texas, he said we are naive to believe that the border problem only will be on the Mexican side. He is the sheriff in Laredo. Across the river is Nuevo Laredo. That is basically a ghost town now controlled by the drug cartels; and those criminals, they will come to the American side as well. 
   Sigi Gonzales, the sheriff in Zapata County, he told me that the drug cartels and the criminals, they have better equipment, they have more equipment, they have better money, and they have more people involved in doing what they want to do than we have in protecting the dignity of the United States. 
   And to illustrate how violent it is on the border, Mr. Speaker, I want to read you one more portion of this report: There currently exists a U.S. Department of State travel alert for Mexico. Fort Bliss officials announced Saturday that travel to Juarez has been declared off limits for U.S. military. 
   In other words, Fort Bliss, the United States Army, they can go to Iraq, they can go to Afghanistan, but they can't go to Juarez right across the river because it is too dangerous. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a border war taking place on the southern border. All is not quiet on the southern border, and we need to understand that this is a tremendous problem and our government needs to get into action and protect Americans from this invasion. 
   And that's just the way it is. 
   Border Travel Advisory 
   SUMMARY 
   Due to the rising level of violence in Mexico--which is attributed to drug cartels, violent criminal organizations, and increased presence of military personnel in some Mexican border communities--it is recommended that persons be discouraged from traveling to Mexican border towns, particularly those that have recently been scenes of gang-related violent activity. These communities include Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros, Reynosa, Rio Bravo, Miguel Aleman, and Ciudad Ju&#225;rez. The increased levels of violence in recent weeks and potential for additional violence suggest that an advisory against traveling to these communities is warranted. 
   DETAILS 
   On November 30, 2007, gunmen opened fire on the former mayor of Rio Bravo--who was a two-term representative and one-time senator--and his entourage as they left a restaurant in Rio Bravo. The former mayor was killed along with two other politicians and two federal agents. The Los Zetas, an organized cell of the Gulf Cartel, had previously threatened the former mayor's life and attempted a prior assassination, prompting the government to assign bodyguards. In response to the assassination, the Mexican government immediately mobilized approximately 500 soldiers, federal police, and support personnel in order to conduct counterdrug operations in the state of Tamaulipas. The focus of the operation was on the cities of Matamoros, Rio Bravo, and Miguel Aleman, just south of Roma, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico. 
   On Monday, January 7, 2008, members of the Mexico Federal Preventive Police (PFP) were patrolling Colonia Cuauht&#233;moc in Rio Bravo when they observed a 2005 Chevrolet Suburban occupied by heavily armed men. The officers attempted a traffic stop that resulted in shots being fired at the officers from the Suburban. A gun battle ensued, and additional officers and a contingent of the Mexican army responded. Three gunmen were killed and ten others were arrested, including three U.S. citizens, one of whom was from Texas. 
   On January 23, 2008, local police in the border cities of Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros, and Reynosa, Mexico, were relieved of their duties as army troops disarmed the officers and searched for evidence that might show links to drug traffickers. Eleven men were arrested by federal police in Nuevo Laredo, including four police officers, who were said to be operatives for the Gulf Cartel. 
   President Calderon has sent approximately 6,000 military troops and federal police to areas that extend from Matamoros--which is across the border from Brownsville, Texas--westward to Miguel Aleman, which is across the border from Roma, Texas. Mexican military and federal police personnel have also been sent to the city of Ju&#225;rez. A similar operation was conducted last year in Tijuana when violence erupted there, with more than 3,500 soldiers and federal officers sent to the city. 
   Over the past weekend, a total of five people were either shot or beaten to death in separate incidents in Ju&#225;rez. This comes on the heels of approximately 30 persons in Ju&#225;rez being murdered since the beginning of the year, including 17 law enforcement personnel, as well as the recent attempted assassination of a Chihuahua State Police Commander Fernando Lozano Sandoval. Commander Sandoval is currently hospitalized in El Paso's Thomason Hospital under tight security. An alleged ``hit list'' of Mexican law enforcement was also discovered near Chihuahua state offices over the weekend. 
   There currently exists a U.S. Department of State travel alert for Mexico with a date to expire of April 15, 2008. Fort Bliss officials also announced Saturday that travel to Ju&#225;rez has been declared off-limits for U.S. military personnel. 
   In addition to the travel advisory, law enforcement officials should be aware of the possibility that violent criminals and cartel members may seek to enter Texas in an attempt to escape Mexican military and law enforcement operations. As some persons seek refuge in Texas, their enemies may plan to conduct raids or hits on them here. The most significant violent criminals in the region are members of the Gulf Cartel or their violent enforcers, Los Zetas. 
   ANALYST'S COMMENTS 
   With the increased military and police presence in Mexican border towns, and the recent violence associated with shootouts between Mexican military and drug cartels, it is advised that Texas residents avoid traveling to Mexican border communities, particularly those that have recently been scenes of violent gang-related activity. In addition, there exists a possibility that Los Zetas and Cartel members may cross the border into Texas. Tactical operations, such as increased police patrols, should be initiated in high-profile and high-visibility areas--such as points of entry and between points of entry--to discourage cross-border incursions. If any contact is made with suspected Los Zetas or cartel members, an INT-7 form should be completed and forwarded to the Texas Intelligence Center. 
   Law enforcement officials are encouraged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious incidents to the Texas Intelligence Center.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Chinese attack on the Christian faith continues. For 60 days, the Chinese Government has held Shi Weiham, a Christian bookstore owner, in secret detention for praying. 
   As China readies for the 2008 Summer Olympics, it is trying to convince critics that it embraces religious freedom. But China is secretly moving religious believers to the dark, damp, hidden hideaway of jail. 
   China restricts all religious practice to state-sanctioned churches and certain places of worship. So Chinese don't dare pray or worship anywhere else, or off to jail they go. That is what happened to Shi Weiham. 
   China's religious tolerance is a public relations campaign draped in hypocrisy. China arrests thousands of Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists each year. 
   As religion is being attacked across atheistic Communist China, we should recall Winston Churchill's words about communism: ``A communist is like a crocodile, when it opens its mouth, you cannot tell whether it is trying to smile or preparing to eat you up.'' The Chinese crocodile is devouring religious freedom among its people.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, journalists should be able to report the news without having to worry about getting arrested for not revealing their confidential sources. Our Nation needs a Federal shield law to further protect the freedom of speech and press. 
   Recently, several journalists have been arrested and jailed for not disclosing their anonymous sources. These arrests did not occur in foreign countries run by dictators but happened here in America. Putting journalists in jail for not confessing their sources tramples on the Nation's freedom of speech and freedom of the press. These freedoms in the first amendment are first because, without them, the rest are meaningless. 
   More than 30 States so far have passed laws that protect reporters from being required to testify and name confidential sources, but there is no Federal law. 
   The job of a journalist is to report the news and not be an arm of the government or controlled by our government. Law enforcement officials should not force journalists to gather information or find witnesses. 
   A free press means free and independent of government intrusion into the sources of reporters. 
   Madam Speaker, the country needs a Federal shield law because, instead of getting a reporter arrested, the truth should set them free. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, I rise in total support of this resolution today. And I want to thank the chairman for including language from one of my proposals regarding worker exploitation to the bill being considered today. 
   Having been to China, I have seen firsthand how the Chinese government runs roughshod over its people and abuses their basic rights. 
   Earlier this year, Madam Speaker, I introduced a resolution condemning the government of China for not only its inhumane working conditions, but also for the exportation of unsafe goods like lead toys and pet food to the United States, and for the poor environmental policy that affects the entire globe. I hope the committee will soon consider the Chinese policy of exporting harmful products to the United States and other parts of the world. 
   However, the Olympic Games begin next week, and I believe it is critical to remind the government of China that it is a member of the world community, and the world is watching how China treats its citizens. China has a social and moral responsibility to provide basic rights to all of its citizens, especially in the workplace. 
   In June of 2007, it was discovered that hundreds of people, including women and small children, were forced to work in hot brick-making factories, suffering from brutal beatings and confinement equal to imprisonment. 
   According to Amnesty International, there are instances where Chinese companies withhold wages from the workers for months at a time, refuse to give them ID cards. Without an ID card, it prevents that worker from securing work someplace else. 
   In the city of Shenzhen alone, in an average day, 13 factory workers lose an arm or some other body member, and every 4 days a worker dies in a workplace accident. And Madam Speaker, this is just in one city in China. 
   I stand with the Chinese people who have been subjected to inhumane working conditions, and call on the government to end the dangerous conditions faced by these workers. If China expects to gain the respect of the global community, China must earn that respect from its own citizens first, and that requires reforming their inhumane working conditions and respecting basic human rights of their own people. 
   And once again, I want to thank the chairman for bringing this to the House floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, as air travel increases, revenue to airports, of course, increases as well. Much of that money is from hidden taxes passengers pay. But now this increased revenue isn't enough for some. They want to tax flyers even more to fly. 
   Right now, if a citizen buys a typical round trip ticket, the fare is about $230. But additional taxes raise the fare another $45. So the passenger is now really paying $275. 
   Airports now want to collect more Federal taxes from each passenger by increasing the passenger facility charge, another word for tax, to $7 per passenger per segment. What that means is a family of four that flies from Odessa, Texas, to Washington, D.C., with a stopover in Dallas, is going to pay another $112 in more taxes. 
   Airports already get plenty of money. They sell bonds; they get millions in Federal, City and State taxes; they charge airlines for gates and the right to land; they get taxes off rental cars; and they lease airport space to businesses. 
   Airports should make do with the abundance of revenue they already get from the taxpayers. Don't raise taxes any more on passengers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, America is about people. Who we are and what we are is because of the people who have come to America. They are individuals who have lived and died and influenced the rest of us because of their tenacious spirit and determination. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am a history fan. I love American history especially, and Texas history, not the history of dates and movements, but the history of the lives of individual Americans who made a difference. 
   Roy Benavidez was one of those Americans. Roy Benavidez was born in South Texas in a small town called Cuero, August 5, 1935. He was the son of a sharecropper. He was an orphan and he had mixed blood of Yaqui Indian and Hispanic. He was raised by his uncle after he lost his family and he dropped out of school in the seventh grade. He didn't see the need for an education at that time. 
   He was a migrant farm worker. He worked all over Texas and as far as Colorado in the sugar beet fields and the cotton fields. He decided to join the United States Army in 1955, and he joined in Houston, Texas. He was in love with his hometown sweetheart, Lala Coy. So while he was away in Germany on active duty, he asked a local priest, his grandfather and his uncle if they would go to Lala's father and ask permission for Roy to marry her, and he agreed. Mr. Speaker, you have to appreciate that old school that marry this way. 
   While he was in the Army, however, he was in a lot of trouble, even though he was a member of the Military Police. So he finally joined the Special Forces training at Fort Bragg and reached the rank of staff sergeant and went to Vietnam as a Green Beret. 
   But on May 2, 1962, his life changed and the lives of many Americans changed. It is a story that is almost unbelievable. On the morning of May 2, 1968, a 12-man Special Forces team was inserted in Cambodia to observe a large-scale North Vietnamese troop movement, and they were discovered by the enemy. 
   Most of the team members were close friends of Roy Benavidez, who was the forward operating officer in Loc Ninh, Vietnam. Three helicopters were sent to rescue this 12-man team, but they were unable to land because of the heavy enemy concentration. When a second attempt was made to reach the stranded team, Benavidez jumped onboard one of the helicopters, armed only with a Bowie knife. 
   As the helicopters reached the landing zone, Benavidez realized the team members were likely too severely wounded to move to the helicopters. So by himself he ran through heavy small arms fire to the wounded soldiers. He was wounded himself in the leg, the face, and the head in the process. 
   He reorganized the team and signaled the helicopters to land. But despite his injuries, Benavidez was able to carry off half of the wounded men to the helicopters. He then collected the classified documents held by the now dead team leader. As he completed this task, he was wounded by an exploding grenade in the back and shot in the stomach. At that moment, the waiting helicopter's pilot was also mortally wounded, and that helicopter crashed. 
   He ran to collect the stunned crash survivors and form a perimeter. He directed air support, ordered another extraction attempt and was wounded again when shot in the thigh. At this point he was losing so much blood from his face wounds that his vision became blocked. Finally, another helicopter landed and as Benavidez carried a wounded friend to it, he was clubbed in the head with a rifle butt by an enemy soldier. That soldier bayonetted Benavidez twice. 
   Mr. Speaker, Benavidez was wounded in that one battle 37 times; seven gunshot wounds, he had mortar in his back, and two bayonet wounds. He was taken for dead and left for dead and zipped up in a body bag, but right before they zipped the bag up, he spit in the doctor's face, letting the doctor know he was yet alive. 
   He later recovered. He received the Distinguished Service Cross and then many years later Ronald Reagan presented him with the Congressional Medal of Honor. President Reagan stated that if this were a movie, no one would believe it because of the heroic deed of Roy Benavidez. 
   Mr. Speaker, after he retired from the military, Roy Benavidez went around America talking about the importance of an education, since he only went to the seventh grade. He talked to young gang members, he talked to youth, telling them to stay in school and get an education. 
   He was a remarkable individual. A Navy ship has been named after him, several elementary schools in Texas have been named after Roy Benavidez, and even a toy company has issued a Roy Benavidez GI Joe action figure. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate and honor Hispanic Heritage Month, one of those great Hispanic Americans was Roy Benavidez, a Texas hero, an American hero, a war hero that loved America and, as he said, got to live the American Dream the way that he wanted. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Thank you, Dr. Burgess. And thank you, Judge Green, for sponsoring this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, Dr. Michael DeBakey's life motto is ``strive for nothing less than excellence,'' and he has achieved excellence in all of his 99 years. 
   He will be 100 years old next year, and he has made remarkable and valuable contributions to surgery and to the entire world in the area of heart surgery. 
   When he was only 23 years old, Dr. DeBakey reported the roller pump for blood transfusions, which was later used in the heart-lung machine used in the first successful open heart surgery. When he volunteered for the Army during World War II, his experience in the Surgeon General's staff taught him that more needed to be done for veterans and for the wounded that are on the battlefield. He recommended massive changes in the management of war wounds. And as Judge Green mentioned, he invented the mobile army surgical hospital, or the MASH units, as Americans know them. We have all watched MASH on television and its satire, but MASH has served a tremendous purpose for those who are wounded on the battlefield. 
   Once the MASH units came into play, Americans wounded during battle at war and were taken to these units, the survival rate increased tremendously. In previous wars when Americans were wounded, most of them died. Now, when they're wounded and taken to a MASH unit, most of them survive. 
   He created the medical follow-ups for veterans. We call that the Veterans Affairs Medical Center. And in 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor University College of Medicine staff. He launched the first surgical residency program in Houston, and now Baylor Medical School is one of the Nation's most respected health science centers in the world. 
   He developed innovative treatments for aneurysms, performed the first successful coronary bypass, successfully used a partial artificial heart to help a patient wean off a heart-lung machine after open heart surgery, and he supervised the first successful multiorgan transplant. 
   Dr. DeBakey could be, Mr. Speaker, the finest heart surgeon that has ever lived in the world. He deserves this Nation's greatest honor. And we're forever grateful for his contributions, his vision, his leadership and his big heart for others. 
   Winston Churchill said, ``We live by what we get, but we judge our life by what we give.'' Dr. DeBakey has given hearts to thousands of people throughout the world.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Government Accountability Office is in the border crossing business. Like the illegals, drug dealers, smugglers that cross both our southern and northern borders at will, GAO investigators recently crossed undetected from Canada into the United States in three different areas with, get this, red duffel bags of radioactive material, detonators and narcotics. They crossed with no problem, and no border agent was anywhere in sight. 
   On the 5,000-mile Canadian border, there are no more than 250 border agents on duty at any given time according to a deputy chief of the Border Patrol. It sounds easy to slip back and forth unnoticed across the border.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, on August 7, 1998, American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania were the target of almost simultaneous terrorist bombings, killing hundreds and wounding thousands of people. 
   Among those killed were 12 American Embassy employees and dozens of foreign service nationals. These public servants paid with their lives while performing their duties, and it is our responsibility to ensure that their families receive proper compensation. 
   I strongly support H.R. 2828, introduced by my distinguished colleagues Congressman Jackson and our Republican whip, Roy Blunt, which provides compensation to the families of the United States Embassy employees who perished due to acts of international terrorism. 
   This bill increases the death gratuity for foreign service officers and foreign national employees. It also authorizes additional compensation to family members of foreign service employees or government executive branch employees killed as a result of an act of international terrorism. It also requires the Secretary of State to provide compensation to foreign service employees killed in an act of international terrorism that occurred from 1998 to the date of the enactment of this act, including the victims of the Nairobi bombing. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill and provide proper compensation to the families of the United States Embassy employees killed by brutal acts of international terrorism.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 635, which recognizes the commencement of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal, and expresses respect to Muslims in the United States and throughout the world on this occasion. 
   Regarded as the holiest month in the Islamic calendar, Ramadan signifies a time of deep reflection for the 1.5 billion Muslims across the globe. During this month, special emphasis is put on prayer, giving to charity, daylight fasting, and self-examination and improvement. 
   It is tragic that radical Islamists have used selective interpretations of Islam to justify and encourage hate, injustice, oppression, violence, and terror. They have indoctrinated many young Muslims to hate and target for violence America, Israel, the West, other Muslims, and non-Muslims. 
   Worse still, some have exploited the month of Ramadan, which should be devoted to spirituality and self-perfection, to stoke the fires of fanaticism and destruction. 
   It is important to note that a growing number of Muslims, including many in America, are rejecting radical Islam and its culture of death. Instead, they are articulating interpretations of Islam that embrace the values of human life, liberty, and democracy. 
   Indeed, today we are seeing a clash within Islamic civilization between those who wish to step into the light of progress and those who wish to return the entire world to the dark ages. 
   Given the threat that radical Islam poses worldwide, the clash within Islamic civilization affects everyone throughout the world. That is why this House should take the opportunity to pass H. Res. 635. This resolution commends Muslims who reject interpretations of Islam that justify and encourage hatred, violence, and terror. 
   May Ramadan this year truly be a time when Muslims and people of all faiths embrace freedom and tolerance for all, and reject violence and extremism. 
   I thank my friend and distinguished colleague from Texas, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson, for introducing this resolution; and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (CONDEMNING THE PERSECUTION OF LABOR RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN IRAN -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution condemning the persecution of labor rights advocates in Iran. 
   During the past 2 years, the already brutal regime in Tehran has increased its repression of its own citizens, cracking down on religious and ethnic minorities, human rights and pro democracy activists, even university students, and now the labor movement. 
   Like many supposedly revolutionary governments, this regime has been particularly harsh to workers and their representatives who have dared to protest the injustices that pervade the present system in Iran. 
   On April 9 this year, Iranian agents arrested Mahmoud Salehi, the founder of an independent bakery workers association. And then on three separate occasions since 2005, this same Iranian regime has arrested and imprisoned Mansour Osanloo, the president of the Syndicate of Workers of Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company, an independent labor association of transportation workers. 
   Most recently then, on July 10, 2007, reports indicate that plainclothes Iranian agents kidnapped, assaulted and imprisoned Mr. Osanloo. 
   When transport workers have attempted to strike in order to protest their lack of rights and the arrest of their representatives, the Iranian regime has beaten them and compelled them to return to work. Iran's deplorable behavior violates its own legal obligations under its own Constitution. 
   Article 26 of the Iranian Constitution permits, and I quote, ``the formation of parties, societies, political or professional associations,'' and Iran's labor law recognizes that ``it is prohibited to force a person to perform work against their will.'' So much for following their Constitution. 
   Mr. Speaker, while Iranian thug-in-chief Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke freely at the United Nations last week, labor representatives Mahmoud Salehi and Mansour Osanloo, both of whom suffer from medical conditions and medical problems, languished in Iran's infamous prisons without access to any medical attention. This current situation is intolerable. 
   The Iranian regime must stop its persecution of its own workers and systematic human rights abuses, release all the imprisoned labor representatives and fulfill its obligations in ensuring the right of Iranians to work freely and to organize freely. 
   I want to thank Mr. Kirk of Illinois and Mr. Andrews of New Jersey for introducing this resolution, and also labor unions in the United States for bringing this issue to the forefront. 
   This resolution condemns the Iranian regime for the arrest and imprisonment of Iranian labor leaders and demands their release. It also sends a simple but yet powerful message. As the people of Iran struggle to live freely and exercise their basic human rights, Congress and the United States stands with those people. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (COMMISSION ON THE ABOLITION OF THE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the poet Maya Angelo once said, ``History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.'' I find these words fitting as we consider H.R. 3432 today. 
   For over 200 years, countless Africans died in brutal conditions during the so-called Middle Passage, the overseas voyage of their lives to enslavement in America. The United States formally prohibited the importation of slaves nearly 200 years ago, although the institution of slavery persisted in this country for another 50 years afterwards. 
   This bill will establish a commission to ensure that this important anniversary is appropriately commemorated within the United States and also abroad. In essence, the bill seeks to ensure that all Americans, no matter their age, race, gender, culture, or even religion, are afforded the opportunity to learn more about the institution of slavery and its vestiges so that we may understand this tragic aspect of history. 
   While we cannot unlive our past, it is hoped that this commission will promote greater tolerance and understanding among all Americans, while shedding light on the fact that slavery still exists in the modern world. Yes, even 200 years after the transatlantic slave trade was abolished, slavery still goes on. It exists through human trafficking and wherever any group of people is systematically robbed of its fundamental human rights. 
   So I stand in support of H.R. 3432, in the hopes that this commission will help Americans confront the past with honesty, while committing themselves to the eradication of modern-day slavery in all of its forms, no matter where it may be found. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (RECOGNIZING THAT VIOLENCE POSES AN INCREASINGLY SERIOUS THREAT TO PEACE AND STABILITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today of H. Res. 564 and join my colleagues in recognizing the efforts taken by the United States and seven Central American countries to confront gang violence in Central America. 
   The tragic nature of gang violence in Central America threatens the peace and stability of its neighbors to the north and to the south. Geographically located between the world's largest drug-producing and drug-consuming countries, Central America faces a seemingly insurmountable problem when forced to counter gang violence on its own. 
   For this reason, I was pleased to see that earlier this year, the United States and seven Central American countries took the first step towards finding an international solution to the growing level of violence in Central America by holding the first-ever dialogue on democratic security in Guatemala City. 
   As the transnational nature of gangs causes crime and violence in Central America to bleed into the United States, this resolution recognizes the importance of a continuing United States involvement and commitment of funds towards dealing with youth gangs in Central America. 
   Gangs have become more organized, more violent, and affect North America, Central America and South America. It also encourages Central America and U.S. officials to meet on a regular basis for further cooperation in combating crime and violence and commends these countries for taking the first step in the struggle for security by developing the United States' strategy to combat criminal gangs from Central America and Mexico. 
   While I am pleased to see the progress made this year, I also recognize the grave importance of sustaining these efforts while increasing our understanding of the roots of this epidemic. I look forward to our continued cooperation with our neighbors to the south and once again applaud the efforts already taken to counter this increasing threat to peace and security in our region.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (TAIWANESE SELF-DEFENSE CAPABILITY -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 676, a resolution reiterating that it is the policy of the United States to make available to Taiwan such defense articles and services as may be necessary for its self-defense.  
   At the outset, I want to thank Chairman Lantos and the gentlewoman from Florida, the author of this resolution; Mr. Lantos being the cosponsor; as well as many other members from the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Taiwan Caucus. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a very straightforward resolution. It simply says that the executive branch should follow the law, in this case the Taiwan Relations Act, TRA, of 1979, and make available to our friends in that vibrant democracy such defense articles as may be necessary for their self-defense. 
   While the Chinese Air Force and Navy continue to be upgraded with modern Russian-made combat aircraft, Taiwan's Air Force is literally falling from the sky. In fact, some 17 obsolete F-5 fighters have crashed in the last 10 years, including one this May which killed a number of Singaporean servicemen. 
   Yet despite Taiwan's clearly compelling needs and the fact that Taipei has not only increased defense spending but also has budgeted and appropriated for the F-16s, the United States is refusing to respond to Taiwan's entirely legitimate request for military sales. In so doing, the clear intent of Congress and the law of the land as articulated in the TRA is obviously being ignored. 
   In this regard, section 3(b) of TRA stipulates that both the President and the Congress shall determine the nature and quantity of such defense articles and services based solely upon their judgment of the needs of Taiwan. 
   In life there are times when you can outthink yourself by overanalyzing issues and events, hoping to find that perfect moment to make a major decision. This is one of those times. Given China's ongoing and notorious military buildup, as well as its ceaseless efforts to isolate and belittle Taiwan, there will never be an ideal time for the United States to make defense sales to this island. The ideal time, obviously, is when the time is right, which is now. 
   The reality is that any major U.S. sale at any time will be objected to by the Chinese Communist regime. Should that affect our commitment to the stability of the Taiwan Strait? Mr. Speaker, are we timid because of China? Likewise, should our defense commitment to Taiwan be held hostage to a clash of personalities, the political season in Taiwan, or Washington's desire to accommodate Beijing? 
   In conclusion, this commonsense resolution simply says that consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, the TRA, the United States should make decisions about prospective arms sales to this island based upon Taiwan's legitimate self-defense needs and our assessment of the relative balance of power in the Western Pacific. 
   I urge the adoption of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, in the third world country of Sudan, the government is controlled by the religion of Islam. Religious hard-liners were successful in prosecuting a British first grade teacher for insulting Mohammed. She was sent to jail. Her crime: her 7-year-old students named a class Teddy Bear ``Mohammed,'' and that was supposedly an insult to the Prophet. The punishment could have been worse. She could have received 40 lashes. In fact, thousands of Sudanese citizens marched demanding the school teacher be executed for the insult! 
   Of course, the teacher never meant to insult Islam, but the truth was not an issue in her trial. 
   The Sudan, this is the same ``righteous'' government that is allowing ethnic cleansing and genocide of its own citizens in Darfur. 
   But thanks to two Muslim members of the British House of Lords who disagreed with the arrest, the school teacher, Gillian Gibbon, was pardoned after serving 8 days in jail. 
   This case is an example of what happens when government punishes people for violating a religious doctrine. 
   And, by the way, the Teddy Bear was originally so named to honor the great President Theodore Roosevelt. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE FIRST AMENDMENT--RELIGION -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the first amendment is first in our Bill of Rights because the provisions in it are the most important. Without those provisions the rest of the Bill of Rights are meaningless. 
   The first amendment states in part that ``Congress,'' that's us, ``shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'' 
   This amendment, like many others, was a reaction to colonial life under King George III. The Church of England was the official Church of England and some of the colonies. The Framers hoped to protect the exercise of any religion by prohibiting the establishment of a national religion. A national religion like the Church of England was supported by taxation. Attendance at services was even mandatory. No marriage or baptism outside of the Church was sanctioned. There were civil and even criminal penalties for members of religious minorities. 
   So the U.S. Constitution's framework made it possible for all religious groups to gain legal protection. The freedom to practice one's own religion is the reason why the colonists settled and founded this great country. That is the primary reason why people left England, to seek religious freedom. 
   The Founding Fathers did not believe that government and religion had to be entirely separate, however. The first President, George Washington, said in his first inaugural address, declared as his ``first official act'' his ``fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe'' and that this Almighty Being ``might bless this new government.'' 
   President Washington also echoed this religious attitude in his farewell address in 1796 when he said, ``Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.'' 
   When our Constitution was drafted, the elderly statesman Benjamin Franklin said that if the Good Lord is concerned about a sparrow that falls from the trees, He certainly would be concerned about a new Nation at its birth, and he encouraged Congress to go in prayer. And Congress did so that morning and prayed, and ever since then our Congress starts each morning with a prayer. 
   The first Congress recognized the importance of religion in government when it enacted the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, and it begins: ``Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.'' 
   The first amendment includes the free exercise clause. Like the establishment clause, the framers included the free exercise clause to protect religious minorities from persecution. The establishment clause prohibits government creation of, support, or endorsement of a national religion. And the free exercise clause protects individual religious beliefs and practices from government interference. 
   The significance of the free exercise of religion clause is that it affirms the value of religion in American culture and even promotes public display of religion. 
   Many Americans believe that the first amendment created a separation between church and state, but those words do not exist anywhere in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, nor the Declaration of Independence. 
   These words came from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson in 1801 to the Danbury Baptist Association, who was concerned about the Congregationalist Church becoming the national religion, and that is why Jefferson made the comment to the Danbury Baptist Association that there is a separation between church and state. These words do not promote a prohibition by government against religion in the public sector. 
   Billy Graham once said that ``The Framers of our Constitution meant we were to have freedom of religion, not freedom from religion.'' But antireligious radicals are on the offensive, trying to make the United States free from religion. These radicals want the United States to be a secular government like France. But that's not what our Founding Fathers intended when they created our country. 
   When Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, he proclaimed that God gives us all of our rights. He wrote that ``all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.'' 
   Jefferson's reference to God is echoed throughout this Nation. Our currency mentions God. Our government buildings have religious scenes and words etched into them. We pledge allegiance to the Nation under God. We even have the great lawgiver Moses on the far wall looking directly down on the Speaker's chair. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, the mention of God in our culture is not an establishment of religion. It's a fact that this Nation was founded on religious beliefs and religious values. That is an historical fact. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, U.S. Border Agent Luis Aguilar, Jr. was on patrol in January on the Arizona border chasing two vehicles of suspected drug dealers. As the vehicles, a Hummer and a pickup, realized they had been discovered and fled back to the Mexican border, Agent Aguilar put road spikes in front of the vehicles. The Hummer, however, went off the road and ran over and killed Agent Aguilar. 
   The driver, Jesus Navarro Montes, was quickly arrested by the Mexican government and held on unrelated drug charges. However, he was released 6 months later because the U.S. Government never requested extradition proceedings. 
   Members of Congress have asked the Justice Department what happened. We received a standard bureaucratic, nonsensical letter saying, ``we're not telling you.'' In other words, our Justice Department blundered by not requesting extradition, and now won't admit it. 
   This is incompetence. Montes, meanwhile, is still probably running drugs into the United States. 
   We owe it to all border agents and the family of Agent Aguilar to capture this killer. Maybe we should offer an old fashioned reward for his capture, and let our friends in Mexico do the job our government won't do.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (TEXAS IGNORES WORLD COURT -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Texas, the State of Texas, has ignored the order of the World Court in Geneva. Let me give you the facts of this case. 
   Fifteen years ago in 1993 there were two young teenage girls by the name of Jennifer Ertman, 14, and Elizabeth Pena, 16, headed home as the sun set in Houston, Texas. 
   They took a shortcut so they could get home in a timely fashion, as ordered by their parents. That was their fatal mistake. They came in contact with a group of gangsters headed by Jose Medellin. It was a gang initiation. The girls stumbled upon the gang of gangsters, and these gangsters kidnapped, held hostage, and brutally sexually assaulted these two girls for as long as they wished.     
   After they were through, they tortured them, and Jose Medellin strangled each of them with their shoelaces. Medellin was proud of his conduct. He was later arrested by the Houston Police Department along with others from his group of bandits, specifically Derrick O'Brien, Peter Cantu and two others. 
   These individuals were tried by Texas juries. A Texas jury found that Derrick O'Brien committed the worst crime in our society, ordered the death penalty, and he's been executed. 
   The ringleader of the case, Jose Medellin, well, his case has been on appeal for 15 years. Here's what has happened in his case. He was convicted. His case worked its way all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court upheld this conviction. Then years later he says, I should have been allowed to talk to my Mexican consulate at some time during the proceeding, even though he never requested it upon his arrest. 
   Of course, then, the Federal Government gets involved in the case. The case works its way back through the Supreme Court. Before it gets to the Supreme Court, the administration, the White House, intervened and told Texas courts to give Medellin a new trial because he was not allowed to ask or see his Mexican consulate, even though he didn't request it. Remember, Medellin was illegally in the United States, even though he had been here since he was 6 months of age. 
   The State of Texas, the Texas courts, in all due respect to the President of the United States, ignored his request. The case went back to the Supreme Court, right down the street. 
   A few months ago the Supreme Court of the United States said, World Court has no jurisdiction. The President of the United States has no jurisdiction to tell the courts in Texas what to do and upheld his conviction and ordered him executed. 
   But, once again, the World Court intervened yesterday, and said the State of Texas cannot execute Medellin. 
   Well, let me tell you something, the State of Texas on August 5 is going to execute this defendant for what he did. The State of Texas has decided that the World Court has no jurisdiction to tell the State of Texas or any other State what to do. I think it was put appropriately by the fathers of these two girls. 
   No parent wants to see their child die before their time, especially the way that these two girls died. I have four kids, three of them are girls; and seven grandkids, four of them are girls. Here's what one of the fathers had to say about the death of his daughter. He said, ``The World Court doesn't mean diddly. This business belongs in the State of Texas. The people of the State of Texas support the execution. We thank them.'' 
   More appropriately, the other father, Adolfo Pena, the father of Elizabeth Pena, said, ``I believe we have been through all the red tape we can go through. It's time to rock and roll.'' 
   Justice must be served for victims of crime. 15 years justice has been waiting, in this specific case, 15 years, longer than one of the girls even lived. This defendant arrogantly has been sitting on death row. 
   I was a judge when this case was tried back in Texas in the 1990s, and it was one of the worst crimes we had ever heard in our city, where two teenage girls minding their own business were kidnapped by a bunch of gangsters, sexually assaulted, tortured, murdered and the criminals bragged about this conduct. 
   Today is judgment day for Jose Medellin. He deserves the death penalty, he earned it, and justice demands it, whether the World Court likes it or not. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Spain had control of what is Texas and Mexico for centuries. Mexico revolted and set up a constitutional government in 1824. But in 1825, Santa Anna, the Saddam Hussein of the 19th century, became dictator of Mexico and used military force to subject all of Mexico, including Texas. 
   Hispanic and Anglo Texans resisted, and wanting a return to constitutional government declared independence, stating that Santa Anna had forced a new government upon them at the point of a bayonet. Santa Anna massacred freedom fighters at Goliad and the Alamo, but independence was gained at the swampy marshes at the Battle of San Jacinto, when Sam Houston and his boys routed and defeated the invaders. 
   Texas was an independent nation for 9 years. Some say we are still an independent nation. Then later Texas joined the Union. And, Madam Speaker, the rest, they say, is Texas history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, ``To be born free is an accident, to live free is a privilege, and to die free is a responsibility.'' Powerful words spoken by Brigadier General James Sehorn that are embedded into the minds of our valiant soldiers protecting nations from a cowardly enemy that burrows beneath the Iraqi desert sands, those individuals that seek to annihilate our freedoms that all people should have. 
   The American soldier believes in freedom more than any other individual on Earth because they witness the inhumanity of tyranny. They see it in the fierce trenches of battle. Our soldiers secure life and liberty, and they give it to those folks in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Edward Charles Reynolds, Jr. was one of these soldiers. He was an 8-year Army veteran. Staff Sergeant Reynolds had been stationed among the terrorist Iraqi insurgents, fighting against them to ensure a free nation of Iraq. 
   He is a native of Port Arthur, Texas, and he was a 1997 graduate of Thomas Jefferson High School, where he was a star tight-end and middle linebacker on the football team. As a Texan, Staff Sergeant Reynolds spent fall football seasons cheering for one of the greatest teams in college football, the University of Texas Longhorns. Those who knew him knew a man who took care of others, whether it be his family, his friends, or his country. Staff Sergeant Reynolds was their protector. 
   Family was the most important thing to Staff Sergeant Reynolds. He was a devoted father to his children, two daughters and a son. He was dedicated to his fiancee. He was the guardian of his older sister. Friends knew him as the man that kept them out of trouble, pushing them to succeed in life. And his country knew him as a defender of our freedoms. 
   In December 2005, Staff Sergeant Reynolds was deployed to Iraq, worlds away, but he remained a constant presence in the life of his family and all of his friends. He sent out cards and letters, constantly reminding his fiancee of their New Year's Eve wedding date. During the next 10 months, assigned to the U.S. Army 1st Battalion, 67th Armor Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, Staff Sergeant Reynolds dodged bullets, IEDs, and Iraqi outlaws throughout the Baghdad desert. 
   But on September 26, less than 2 months from coming home to Texas, Staff Sergeant Reynolds and a fellow soldier were crossing a Baghdad bridge in a military convoy when that bridge collapsed, plunging their vehicle underwater, trapping both soldiers inside. 27-year-old Staff Sergeant Reynolds and his colleague were killed in action, becoming victims in the struggle for Iraqi freedom. 
   A decorated soldier, Staff Sergeant Reynolds was the recipient of the Combat Infantry Badge, the Kosovo Campaign Medal. He was also awarded the Iraqi Combat Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Bronze Star. He was a lifelong member of the Borden Chapel Missionary Baptist Church. And like his mother and father, Staff Sergeant Reynolds had a devout faith in his Almighty God, believing that everything he was given was a gift by Him. 
   On October 7, the Borden Chapel Missionary Baptist Church in Beaumont, Texas, and the Reverend Airon Reynolds, Jr., gave this brave soldier a hero's memorial and homecoming. Family and friends were not the only ones who memorialized and honored Staff Sergeant Reynolds. The Patriot Guard Riders and the Southeast Texas Veterans Service thanked him for his valor. More than 200 Patriot Guard Riders, with flags of tribute raised, stood in honor of Staff Sergeant Reynolds, the son of Texas, an American soldier, as he reached his eternal resting place. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have a photograph of Sergeant Reynolds, the way that he was when he was protecting freedom across the desert sands of Iraq. American citizens are born into the privilege of freedom, and we must remember that the sacrifice given by Staff Sergeant Reynolds and all American warriors is responsible for the continuation of this great Nation. 
   Staff Sergeant Reynolds chose to protect the freedom that he was born into from the violent militants robbing nations of life and liberty. So God bless Staff Sergeant Reynolds and his family. 
   In the words of George Orwell: ``We sleep safely in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the anti-crude oil crowd has an ethical dilemma. You see, they don't want to drill for crude in Alaska, they don't want to drill offshore, especially off that sacred west coast. They don't want any refineries to produce that crude into products. They are just against all this nonsense. After all, they say, crude is the demon of the Earth. 
   However, they don't have a problem with using everything that comes from crude, like gasoline that comes from crude off the Texas east coast, refined in American refineries. And it seems to me that the irrational non-drillers should lead by example, rather than being hypocritical by preaching damnation to crude oil, but using its by-products every day. So no more plastic water bottles, no using insecticides, no more fertilizer, medicine, candles, nylon, paint, makeup, perfume, computers or detergents. No more car rides or plane rides, and no more home heating oil come winter. After all, all of these things come from crude oil. 
   The radical don't-drill folks should literally walk the walk, instead of talking the big talk about how they are going to save us all from that demon crude oil, but sanctimoniously use its products every day. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL STRATEGY IN CHAD AND DARFUR -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise in support of H. Res. 1011, which calls on the United States and the international community to develop, fund, and implement a regional strategy which addresses the increasing intertwined security and humanitarian crisis in Chad, the Darfur region of the Sudan, and the northern region of the Central African Republic. 
   Borders in this region of the world are more of a concept than a reality. Ethnic groups straddle lines on a map, and conflict with each other or within one country inevitably spills over into the other countries. While this body has been seized by the horrific situation in Darfur, we have devoted far less attention to the broader regional crisis, particularly as it relates to Chad. 
   Chad has been plagued by intermittent conflict, both internally and with its neighbors since it gained independence in 1960. The current President of Chad, Idriss D&#233;by, took power after launching a coup across the border in neighboring Darfur, Sudan, with the support of Libya and his fellow ethnic Zaghawas who straddle the border between Chad and Sudan. He has since faced at least five coup attempts, including one just this past February. 
   The Sudanese government's genocidal campaign in Darfur, which forced hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees across the border, has made the tensions within Chad, particularly among D&#233;by's fellow Zaghawas, much worse. These tensions became further inflamed as the relationship between Chad and the Sudan deteriorated, with each government accusing the other of funding and supporting rebel movements within their respective borders, as well as in neighboring Central African Republic. 
   The spillover of conflict from Darfur into Chad and the Central African Republic, from Chad into Darfur, and from Central African Republic into Chad, has led to the displacement of more than 3.1 million people. 
   In Darfur, an upsurge in fighting among rebel groups, government forces, militias and armed ethnic groups has led to the displacement of more than 80,000 people since this past January. 
   In February of this year, 12,000 new refugees from Darfur arrived in Chad, bringing the total number of Sudanese refugees in eastern Chad to 250,000. Chad also is hosting an additional 152,000 refugees from Central African Republic. 
   At the same time, more than 180,000 people from Chad have been displaced by internal conflict, and in February, 30,000 people from Chad were forced to seek refuge in neighboring Cameroon after rebels, backed by the Sudanese government, attacked the capital.     
   As the wars in Chad, Sudan and Central African Republic become increasingly intertwined, and as the massive displacements take on a regional dimension, the United States and the international community must resist the urge to deal with each crisis in a vacuum. This resolution recognizes that reality and calls for a comprehensive strategy to protect civilians, facilitate humanitarian operations, contain and reduce violence, and contribute to conditions for sustainable peace and good governance throughout the region with all nations. This is not only a moral imperative, but also a significant strategy requirement. 
   I thank the sponsor of this resolution, Mr. Wolf, for introducing this important resolution, and I urge Members to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that there was a time when we could honestly hope that Russia was playing a fair and supportive role with regard to the resolution of the separatist conflicts in the Republic of Georgia. Unfortunately, our optimism in that regard is almost exhausted. It now appears obvious that Russia seeks to play a destabilizing role in Georgia, with the goal of undermining Georgia's political and economic development and, ultimately, its own sovereignty.     
   Over several years Russia has reportedly supported the separatist forces  with arms and trained personnel. It has applied boycotts on Georgian goods and shut off energy supplies to Georgia. It has broadly granted Russian citizenship and issued Russian passports to people living in Georgia's separatist regions. It has provided economic subsidies to the separatist regions and granted residents of those regions the right to vote in Russian elections. Its so-called ``peacekeeping'' forces in the separatist regions appeared to have played a biased role in favor, of course, of the separatist regime. More recently, on April 16, the Kremlin issued a decree further expanding its ``official'' ties with the separatist regions. 
   Most objective observers would affirm that the Georgian Government has tried to be fair and open-minded in its efforts to negotiate a settlement in the separatist conflicts. One has to wonder, however, if sporadic and mysterious incidents involving small-scale attacks on Georgian territory and forces are meant to provoke the Georgian Government. 
   One such incident occurred on April 20. An unmanned and unarmed Georgian reconnaissance aircraft was shot down over Georgian territory, reportedly by a Russian MIG-29 fighter. Since neither Georgia nor the separatist regimes have MIG-29 jets among their forces, it seems difficult for Russia to deny its involvement. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Georgian people have made tremendous progress since the ``Rose Revolution'' of 2003. Georgia is not a perfect democracy, but it's heading in the right direction. It certainly compares very well with the trends in Russia, where a totalitarian regime is steadily being constructed once again. 
   Georgia deserves the support and encouragement of leading states of Europe and the support of the United States. Democracy and reform in Georgia will only succeed if the European Union, the leading states of Europe, and the United States remain engaged and strongly support it. 
   The resolution calls for the Kremlin to immediately revoke its decision to expand ``official ties'' with the separatist regions in Georgia. The resolution expresses strong support for the restoration of the territorial integrity of Georgia and for the peaceful resolution of conflicts within Georgia's borders. It also restates the declaration made by the NATO heads of state at the recent summit in Bucharest, Romania, in which they confidently stated their belief that the Republic of Georgia will become a member of NATO some day. And it urges NATO allies to favorably consider Georgia's application for admission in the Membership Action Plan, or MAP, during the NATO Ministers meeting this December, MAP being a program to simply help interested applicants for membership and prepare them to meet the standards required of all NATO allies. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is intended to support the sovereignty of Georgia and support an end to any irresponsible actions by the Russian Government that undermine its sovereignty and the prospects for a peaceful resolution of the separatist conflicts in that country. 
   I note again as well that nothing stated in this resolution with regard to NATO and Georgia's interest in membership in that alliance is any different from what was stated at the recent NATO summit. 
   I support this resolution and urge all my colleagues to do the same as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (CONDEMNING BURMESE REGIME'S UNDEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, which points out that the smoke screen of a sham constitution and a bogus referendum is not a path leading to free Burma. 
   It seems a particularly callous decision for the Burmese junta to go forward with its planned referendum on May 10, just 1 week after a tropical cyclone devastated the people of that nation. The generals, by ignoring the almost 4,000 dead and 100,000 homeless, are concerned only about their narrow political agenda. 
   We in Congress offer our heartfelt condolences to those in Burma who lost family and friends in this tragic natural disaster. We urge the junta to immediately lift its irrational restrictions on international humanitarian organizations operating inside Burma. Only then can they provide the emergency relief necessary for the suffering people of this country. 
   The generals in Rangoon, however, have cynically determined that time is on their side. They are convinced that, while the world's attention turns away from the bloody events of last fall to other crises in other parts of the world, they can carry on business as usual oppressing their people. That business includes implementing plans for the May 10 referendum on their undemocratic constitution. This constitution ignores the will of the people of Burma as expressed in the streets of Rangoon and other cities last fall. This one-sided constitution seeks to legitimize military dictatorship rule. The current junta seized power by crushing a mass democracy uprising over two decades ago. We and the people of Burma will commemorate the 20th anniversary of that uprising on August 8, the very date the Beijing Olympics begins. On that date, advocates of a free Burma will hold activities around the world to remind the Burmese generals and their Beijing allies that the torch of Miss Liberty shines brighter than any Olympic torch. 
   The generals have turned to a sham constitutional provision in an effort to ignore the international call for a genuine dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and members of the opposition and minority groups. The goal of that dialogue is to achieve ``inclusive national reconciliation.'' This call for dialogue was contained in the statement released by the U.N. Security Council President on October 11, 2007, with the unanimous consent of all members of the council. 
   Instead of heeding the urgings of the international community, however, these generals have brazenly continued their roundup of those involved in the Saffron Revolution last fall, including Buddhist monks, and they have put them in jail. They have also refused to release Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners. 
   The Burmese junta treated the U.N. special envoy to Burma with disdain during his last visit. They refused him access to the top leadership and flatly rejected his offer of independent monitoring of the referendum vote. The U.N. envoy himself has admitted the visit did not yield any tangible results. 
   The junta's attitude of brazen indifference following its bloody suppression of the Saffron Revolution cannot stand unchallenged by the world community.     
   This Congress must raise strong objection to the junta's cynical plan to try to maintain rule through a sham constitution. 
   I urge that my colleagues stand for a free Burma by voicing vigorous support of this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. And I want to thank Mr. Young from Alaska for offering this resolution. I'm certainly proud to support this resolution honoring Charlton Heston's iconic life. 
   Charlton Heston has done much for this country in many, many different areas of public involvement and public service. He appeared in over 100 films during 60 years, but he's best remembered by me as Moses. To many Americans, Moses died on April 5, 2008. 
   As a kid, I actually thought Heston was Moses. I can remember sitting in a Sunday school class as a young kid when the teacher asked me if I'd ever read about Moses and the 10 Commandments in the Bible. And I said no, but I saw the movie version. 
   Charlton Heston brought Moses to life in a way that no one else could. As Moses, Heston lifted his staff in the 10 Commandments to rally the Israelites. But in his personal life he lifted his musket to rally millions of Americans. The second amendment was his tablet of stone, proclaiming the right to bear arms. 
   Heston was quite the intense actor, and wonderful patriot. Heston once said, ``It's been quite a ride. I loved every minute of it.'' And his life was certainly extraordinary. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I thank ``Moses Heston'' for bringing life to history and for being a great American during his life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution which serves as yet another reminder of the haunting words inscribed in the Holocaust Museum: ``Never again.'' 
   The Khmer Rouge-led slaughter of over 1 million innocent people took place more than three decades after the Holocaust ended. Yet the world was again largely silent and indifferent to this tragedy. There was no one person who more embodied the tragic and horrific story of this genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia than Dith Pran. His harrowing personal story of courage, abandonment, struggle, escape and ultimate survival was recorded for all time in the gripping Academy Award-winning film ``The Killing Fields.'' 
   After escaping from the Khmer Rouge and making his way across a treacherous border laden with mines, Dith Pran reached a refugee camp in Thailand and ultimately came to the United States. Here while continuing his career as a photojournalist, Dith Pran was a firm and clear voice appealing to the world's conscience to remember the genocide which occurred in his homeland. He worked tirelessly to achieve the establishment of an Office of Cambodian Genocide. It was officially called the Office of Cambodian Genocide Investigation in the Department of State. 
   It is a note of some consolation that Dith Pran lived to see the start of the genocide trial last November of surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Sadly, it took almost 30 years to bring these architects of the killing fields to justice. There is thankfully no statute of limitations for those who carry out world genocide. 
   Without Dith Pran's steadfast determination, however, this aging Khmer Rouge cadre may have escaped their final hour of judgment. This trial now taking place in the Cambodian capital should give solace to Dith Pran's family and his friends at his passing. It also represents his greatest legacy as an advocate on human rights. 
   The current trial should also remind us to redouble our efforts to ensure that the words ``Never Again'' are finally realized. The best final tribute for Dith Pran would be for the world community to work together for a swift end to the current genocide in Darfur and the killing fields in North Korea. 
   I urge my colleagues to give their whole-hearted support to this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3658, introduced by my good friend from Puerto Rico (Mr. Fortu&#241;o). 
   This bill will make a long overdue clarification to the Foreign Service Act that will allow American foreign service officers to take rest and recuperation travel, commonly referred to as R&R, in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and, of course, the United States Virgin Islands. 
   American diplomatic personnel who serve at hardship posts overseas are allowed to take State Department-funded R&R travel either at locations abroad or locations in the United States. But the phrase ``locations in the United States'' has been interpreted by the State Department regulation to exclude U.S. territories for some reason. That interpretation has placed a distinctly unfair burden on foreign service officers from those territories who might wish to spend their R&R with families at home. 
   It also puts U.S. territories at a disadvantage compared to other destinations abroad or in the United States where our diplomatic personnel may want to travel to rest and recuperate. 
   I want to commend our colleagues who have sponsored this legislation to remove this inadvertent and unfair provision. H.R. 3658 is a worthy bill that deserves our unanimous support.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Fortu&#241;o), the author of this bill. 
   Mr. FORTU&#209;O. I thank my colleague. 
   I want to begin by thanking Chairman Berman for ushering H.R. 3658 through the committee process. In his short time as chairman, Mr. Berman has shown intelligence, generosity and strong bipartisan spirit, the same leadership qualities displayed by his predecessor, the irreplaceable Tom Lantos. 
   I want to thank my good friend, Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, as well. I continue to marvel at her devotion to her constituents in south Florida and at her tireless efforts to help light the lantern of freedom in dark places around the world. 
   I also want to thank the representatives from the other U.S. territories, all of whom are original cosponsors of H.R. 3658. And I want to thank you, Ms. Watson, and you, Judge Poe, for your support for this bill. I note that Ms. Watson served as a U.S. Ambassador to Micronesia and therefore brings a special expertise to this subject. 
   Mr. Speaker, the specific purpose of H.R. 3658 is to permit Foreign Servicemembers to take rest and recuperation travel, known as R&R, in the five U.S. territories. The broader objective of the bill is to ensure that Federal employees from the U.S. territories enjoy the same rights and privileges as their fellow citizens from the 50 States. 
   I am pleased that the American Foreign Service Association supports H.R. 3658, and that the State Department does not oppose its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Foreign Service Act lists the instances in which the State Department may pay the travel-related costs of Foreign Servicemembers. One section of the FSA states that the Department may pay the travel costs incurred by Foreign Service personnel for what is known as home leave. The purpose of the home leave is to ensure that Foreign Servicemembers who have been sent abroad undergo a period of reorientation to the United States. The FSA provides that home leave may be taken in the 50 States and the U.S. territories. 
   Another section of the FSA states that the Department may pay the costs incurred by Foreign Servicemembers for R&R travel. Unlike home leave, which is granted to all Foreign Servicemembers who serve abroad, R&R is granted only to those stationed at hardship posts. Under the current FSA, R&R may only be taken in locations in the United States. State Department regulations have interpreted this phrase to exclude U.S. territories. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no principled basis for allowing Foreign Servicemembers to take home leave but not R&R in the U.S. territories, and H.R. 3658 amends the FSA to eliminate the distinction. Just as they proudly serve in our Nation's Armed Forces, residents of the U.S. territories also represent this great country abroad as diplomats. These men and women from the territories take the same risks and endure the same long absences from their families as their colleagues from the States. Making certain that our laws treat these public servants on equal terms is the only right thing to do. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask you to consider the case of Mr. Ramon Negron. Mr. Negron is a U.S. citizen born and raised in Puerto Rico, a graduate of West Point, and a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve. Mr. Negron currently serves as a political economic officer at the U.S. Interests section in Havana, Cuba, which is a hardship post. Mr. Negron's next posting, to begin this summer, is as the Embassy Office Director in Basra, Iraq. It is neither sensible, nor fair, that under current law the State Department will not cover the cost of airfare so this U.S. citizen, U.S. soldier and U.S. diplomat can travel home to Puerto Rico to be with his family before leaving for the Middle East. H.R. 3658 will correct this disparity.

   On April 17, Tina left her 4-month-old in the back seat of her car as she quickly ran into a store to pay a bill. But as Tina approached the store, she saw a car pull up beside hers, and a bandit jumped out and tried to steal her vehicle. She fought the outlaw and screamed, ``My baby! My baby!'' But the carjacker stabbed her, murdering her in front of her child and fled with blood on his hands. All this was caught on video surveillance. 
   The killer is 22-year-old Timoteo Rios, an illegal trespasser from Mexico. In addition to murdering Tina, Rios and his fellow hijacker, Kennedy Escoto, carjacked four other people. Rios had spent time in jail last year but was never deported. 
   Rios remains at large. He's believed to be back in the safe sanctuary country for criminals, Mexico, basking in the sun and unaccountable for this murder, while Tina Davila's children are motherless this Mother's Day.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (U.S. ATTORNEY GONE WILD -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, before I came to Congress, I had a career in public service in Texas, first as a prosecutor for 8 years. I was a chief felony prosecutor and tried felony cases in Houston, Texas. And then I assumed the bench for 22 years and tried felony criminal cases and heard over 25,000 felony cases. 
   And I say that to say during that time, both as a prosecutor and as a judge, I heard cases where peace officers were the victims of crime and I  heard cases where peace officers were accused of criminal conduct against other individuals, people they had arrested. And I want to talk about a situation that has occurred down to the Texas-Mexico border involving a Border Patrol agent by the name of David Sipes. David Sipes was a Border Patrol agent patrolling the south Texas area, and he came in contact with a coyote. A coyote is a phrase we use in the vernacular for a person who is a smuggler of human beings into the United States. He makes money off of the plight of people who want to be in the United States for economic reasons. 
   David Sipes arrested a coyote by the name of Jose Guevara, who resisted arrest. There was a fight that ensued and David Sipes hit Jose Guevara in the back of the head when he resisted arrest and he was charged with smuggling people into the United States. 
   But what happened was, the U.S. Attorney's Office, rather than prosecute the human smuggler, they decided to prosecute the Border Patrol agent for using too much force in arresting the coyote and charged him with civil rights violations against the illegal in this country smuggling other human beings. 
   David Sipes was tried for that offense. This all occurred back in April 2000. He was tried for that offense, civil rights violations, and the U.S. Attorney's Office vigorously and relentlessly prosecuted him for this so-called offense. But after the trial it turned out, after he was convicted of the civil rights violation, that the U.S. Attorney's Office hid evidence from David Sipes and his lawyer. 
   So the district judge ordered a new trial because the U.S. Attorney's Office cannot hide evidence in a criminal case, but they did so against this Border Patrol agent. Why? We don't know, but they did. So the district judge ordered the case to be retried. But before it could be retried, the U.S. Attorney's Office appealed the judge's decision, and the Fifth Circuit agreed with the trial judge that David Sipes was entitled to a new trial and the Federal Government's appeal was thrown out and this year David Sipes was retried. 
   The jury heard all of the evidence, evidence that the U.S. Attorney's Office hid from the jury when it was first tried, and in less than an hour David Sipes was found not guilty, and properly so. 
   The evidence that the U.S. Attorney's Office hid from the jury, well, first of all they never told the jury that the U.S. Attorney's Office gave this drug smuggler travel expenses so he could go back and forth to Mexico, that they gave him witness fees, that they gave him free telephone access, that they gave him a border crossing permit, that they gave him a U.S. Social Security card, and they even gave him a Texas driver's license. But the biggest thing that the jury never heard about, besides all these benefits, back room deals he was given, it turns out that this human smuggler brought in another load of humans into the United States and the jury never heard about the second situation. 
   Why does our U.S. Attorney's Office hide this type of evidence from a jury? We are going to find out why, Madam Speaker. Not only that, but Guevara was given $80,000 by our United States Government when he threatened to sue our government for his so-called illegal arrest, and reports are that he has gone back to Mexico and bought himself a ranch down there with American taxpayer money. 
   Madam Speaker, just last week David Sipes asked to receive back pay. Of course, our Federal Government fought that, too, but he received back pay for the 6 or 7 years that he was out of service with the Border Patrol. But his life was destroyed. His wife divorced him because of this. He went bankrupt. He is destitute and he lives with his original trial lawyer. All of this because our Federal Government fought every inch of the way to prosecute a Border Patrol agent for arresting a criminal on our border smuggling human beings instead of prosecuting a human smuggler, a coyote. 
   Our government had the choice, prosecute border agent or prosecute human smuggler, and our government chose poorly, and they prosecuted a Border Patrol agent. 
   Of course we all know this isn't the end of the story because with agents Ramos and Compean the same situation has occurred. But, Madam Speaker, justice is the one thing we should always find. And finally, after 7 years, a jury heard all of the evidence in this particular case and David Sipes was vindicated and our government chose the wrong side. We are going to follow this case and other cases and see why the government has gone wild about prosecuting Border Patrol agents. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, they told us that ethanol from corn would save us all--save us from global warming and dependence on foreign oil, but it just isn't so. 
   The rush to till up more farmland may turn out to be a crop disaster. Science Magazine reports that ``using good crop land to expand biofuels will increase global warming.'' The reason is, now farmers will need to plow under more forests and massive grasslands to grow enough of that ``savior'' corn. But doing so will release carbon stored in plants and soils. 
   The new evidence indicates, ``after taking into account worldwide land use changes, corn-based ethanol will increase greenhouse gasses by (a staggering) 93 percent compared to gasoline over a 30-year period.'' 
   It is only logical that if farmland once used to grow corn that we eat is used to grow corn that we burn as fuel, more land will be needed for both agricultural production and ethanol production. 
   So here comes the big wipe out of massive amounts of land, all to subsidize an unproven, unpredictable industry that is potentially hazardous to our health. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the great giveaway of American land has not occurred. The Amnesty International plan to grant legal permanent residents to 12 to 20 million illegal people from all over the world did not succeed in the Senate, and rightfully so. 
   The bill that the Senate tried to push off on the American public was too massive, too complicated, too long. It was almost longer than the Bible and had less to say. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people get it. They understand that the first problem that has to be solved is the border. Border security is the number one issue. The Federal Government, our government, the most powerful superpower that has ever existed, cannot protect the borders. Or is it that they don't protect the borders or refuse to protect the borders? 
   The American public want our borders secure before we start talking about immigration, whether it's legal or illegal. And that's what our Federal Government should do, simply follow the law that's already existing. 
   We have enough laws now to protect the border, but for some reason, the law does not get enforced by the executive department. We hear all kinds of reasons why it doesn't occur, but the bottom line is our borders are porous, on the northern border and on the southern border, and the first duty of government is to protect the people, and that means protect our borders and protect it first. When we solve that problem, then we can move on to the other issues. 
   And the second issue is not what to do with the people that are here illegally. We first close the gap, close the border, keep people from coming here illegally, but the next thing we have to deal with is the immigration service. It's in chaos, it's in turmoil, and this last week's example is a perfect example. 
   The passport service. Now, the law requires that all Americans traveling anywhere, including Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean islands, have passports. Congress passed that law 3 years ago. The Federal Government, the executive branch, had 3 years to get ready to make sure that Americans had those passports, and sure enough, 2007 came, Americans were following the law. They started applying for passports, and all of the sudden, there are lines all over the United States for people waiting for their passports. First it was 4 weeks; then it was 6 weeks. Now, it's 3 months to 5 months. The Federal Government cannot even process a simple passport for an American citizen, and it is a relatively simple process to deal with a passport. 
   And now, what has happened? The Federal Government says, well, since we can't follow the law, we'll suspend the law until we're able to get it together. Now, it's not the fault of those workers in the passport office. They're working as long as they can, as hard as they can, but those people that run the passport office, the Federal bureaucrats, never were organized enough to make sure that Americans, in a streamlined process, could get passports. 
   So now the law's not going to be followed until the passport service gets it together, and that's very unfortunate because the problem is we're going to use this same department, the immigration service, to so-called legally legalize the 12 to 20 million people in the amnesty bill, the so-called Z visas which are very complicated to understand, something that will take a lot longer to process than a passport. So the Z visas for 12 to 20 million illegals will take forever to process if we ever go to that service. 
   What I'm saying, Madam Speaker, is we deal with the border first. Second, we fix and streamline the immigration service so it doesn't discriminate against people who are coming to the United States legally, that we make it efficient for Americans to travel abroad. And once we fix that problem, then down the road we deal with the third issue, the issue of what to do with people that are here illegally. 
   Until we take it in that order, until Congress addresses those three respective acts with three bills, we will never solve the problem. And a massive, so-called immigration reform bill, the American public is suspect and skeptical of that plan because, frankly, I  don't think the American public trusts the Federal Government to do the job of securing the border and reforming the immigration service. 
   But we know that the Federal Government does have the capability to grant amnesty to people that are here illegally. So, hopefully, Congress will do its job, get organized, pass three separate bills so that we have border security; that we have an efficient, workable immigration services; and then down the road, we deal with what to do with the people that are here illegally in the U.S. 
   The American public expect it. They have expected it for a long time, and it's time for us to get about the people's business and resolve these three problems as efficiently and quickly as we can. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, Noe Aleman is a 12-year veteran of the U.S. Border Patrol in the El Paso sector. He and his wife, Isbell, who have no children of their own, plan to adopt his wife's three fatherless nieces from Mexico. 
   They hired a U.S. immigration lawyer and paid him $40,000 to help with the process. The girls were given temporary visas, but when they expired after 6 months, Agent Aleman went to the immigration service to find out why. 
   Aleman was arrested for harboring illegals and making false reports on the application. Apparently the lawyer listed the girls as adults instead of minors. In any event, Aleman was prosecuted and convicted. The girls were arrested and deported back to Mexico and live in an orphanage where they have been for 2 years. 
   Today, Aleman went to a Federal penitentiary. And yes, he was prosecuted by the same U.S. Attorney's Office, the same judge heard the case as the Ramos and Compean cases. 
   Unfortunately, every time a border agent is prosecuted in the Western District of Texas, the U.S. Attorney's Office has a credibility problem; and this case is automatically suspect and suspicious.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, new Colorado State law requires local law enforcement agencies to report illegals to Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities when those individuals are jailed for crimes. Then the Feds are to deport these criminals back to their countries after they serve their sentences, but there is a problem. 
   The Federal Government doesn't deport these criminals. According to a Colorado newspaper, 37 out of every 38 illegals that are convicted and are reported to ICE for deportation are just released back on the streets of those towns. What does this mean for homeland security, for citizens and law-abiding legal immigrants? It means criminal illegals, instead of being sent home by Uncle Sam, are set free to roam our communities, to continue to steal, rob and hurt people. 
   Colorado police are doing their job, but, once again, when it's time to ante into the pot, the Federal Government folds its hand. 
   Instead of our Government trying to figure out ways to keep illegals in the United States with these amnesty giveaway plans, it ought to figure out ways to deport criminal illegals back to where they came from. Once again, our Government is missing in action.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the NYPD is one of the most recognizable police departments not only in the United States, but the world. 
   Nearly 38,000 strong, these brave men and women protect and serve the greater New York metropolitan area and its citizens. Being a peace officer in New York City is a dangerous job. It has always been a dangerous job, and New York peace officers risk their lives daily. 
   The starting salary for a peace officer in New York City is $25,000, and once they graduate from the academy, it is only $32,000, almost poverty wages in one of the most expensive cities in the country to live in. 
   Yet, each year's recruiting classes, young men and women choose to wear the blue uniform and badge of NYPD. They choose to serve New York City and its citizens with honor and bravery. 
   Madam Speaker, I have had the opportunity as a former judge in Texas to address NYPD peace officers, and after we got through the language barrier, I found them to be dedicated keepers and protectors of the law. 
   Officer Patrick Lynch, Christine Schmidt and Joseph Cho are three of the valiant PD police officers from New York City. Little did they know that in the early morning hours of February 5, just a few days ago, they would make and become a cut above the rest of us. 
   It all started with a guy by the name of Danny Fernandez. He was broke, and he was in debt, so he decided how he was going to get some money to pay his debt and pay off other expenses, and he wanted to commit many serious felony crimes ranging from robbery to attempted murder. 
   So to begin his crime spree, he needed a weapon to commit these robberies. So he decided to attack an NYPD officer to get a firearm. His choice was 30-year-old Officer Joseph Cho, a 2-month rookie assigned to late-night foot patrol on the tough New York streets. 
   That night, Officer Cho unknowingly became Fernandez's target. Fernandez attacked him and smashed Cho twice over the head with a baseball bat. 
   Meanwhile, Officer Patrick Lynch, another rookie, who was also out of the academy just 2 months and assigned to the latenight foot patrol, was on patrol. Around 1:00 a.m., Officer Lynch came face-to-face with the menacing Fernandez, armed with a baseball bat, standing over Officer Cho ready to strike him a third time, even though Officer Cho was on the ground. 
   So seeing Officer Cho on the ground, unconscious, with the bat-wielding outlaw standing over him, Officer Lynch charged after the suspect, and then he radioed for backup. Responding to his calls for assistance was Officer Christine Smith, a 26-year-old, yes, that is right, rookie within NYPD. 
   She, like Officers Cho and Lynch, had only been out of the academy for 2 months, and she was on foot patrol just a few blocks away. She had given up a career in teaching to become a peace officer. 
   Together, this dynamic duo quickly caught the outlaw and held him and charged him with serious crimes. 
   Their bravery and heroism has earned these three rookies commendations from NYPD Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. It has also earned them the respect of their fellow officers and the gratitude of the entire city. 
   Officer Cho received numerous skull fractures and required 20 stitches, but eventually he will recover. The criminal will be facing a jury in New York City for his crimes against New York City's finest, the NYPD. 
   Lawmen and women like Officers Lynch, Smith and Cho are a rare breed, but they are the Americans who wear the badge to protect and to serve. So, today, we thank rookies Lynch, Schmid and Cho and the thousands other peace officers in this country for their daily valor, courage and sense of duty to the people. These individuals fight the local thugs, child molesters, robbers, killers and street terrorists. They do our work for us. They are what stands between us, the law and the lawless, and we thank them for that. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court is the most powerful Court in the world. These nine black-robed individuals rule on constitutional matters that affect all Americans for lifetimes. The third branch of government holds its session in public, as it ought to be. 
   The theory behind public court proceedings is that the more public and open, the more likely they are to be fair. More courts throughout the vastness of America are expanding on this public trial concept by allowing unobtrusive cameras in the courtroom. This allows citizens to view court proceedings. When I was a judge in Texas, I allowed cameras to film criminal trials, including a capital murder case. I found that this enhanced the concept of a fair public trial. 
   Those that have never been a trial lawyer or a trial judge say that lawyers play to the cameras; but lawyers don't play to the cameras, they play to the jury or the court. 
   So open Supreme Court proceedings to cameras. Let America see what takes place. And to those judges who are opposed to this openness, maybe they shouldn't be doing what they do when the camera is not rolling.

   It seems, however, that Juan Quintero-Perez had already been deported before from the United States. In 1998, Quintero was arrested and convicted of indecency with a child in Texas and then was deported back to Mexico. But Perez was able to return to the United States a few months later because his employer, Robert Camp, sent money to Mexico to hire a smuggler that snuck Perez back to Houston. 
   Camp knew that Quintero-Perez was an illegal immigrant and a criminal, but Camp hired him again anyway. Camp even rented a home for Quintero-Perez, and then Perez murdered Officer Johnson.  
   Those who knowingly hire and house illegal immigrants, all in the name of making a little money, should go to jail. Rodney Johnson's blood is on the hands of the employer who brought the illegal outlaw back to the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I also thank Mr. Ackerman, Mr. Lantos and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for sponsoring this resolution. 
   On December 27, 2007, the world reeled as it received news that a suicide terrorist and others had assassinated Pakistan's freedom fighter and beacon of democracy, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, during a peaceful political rally. 
   She was educated in the tradition of western democratic philosophy, and received her higher education training at Oxford and Harvard University. She has been the voice in support of a democratic Pakistan for more than 20 years. 
   In 1988, at the age of 35, she became the youngest person and the first female elected to lead a Muslim state. Since that time, Ms. Bhutto has remained committed to the restoration of a true democracy in Pakistan. When Ms. Bhutto returned to Pakistan last year, she knew she was putting her life at risk because, Madam Speaker, the violent enemies of democracy throughout the world are numerous. But her commitment to democracy in Pakistan was stronger than her fear of death. 
   As the daughter of a former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Bhutto used to say she did not choose her life but that it chose her instead. The truth is she chose freedom and democracy, and her love for those principles compelled her continuous bold, even boisterous voice of democracy for the Pakistani people. 
   Ms. Bhutto has been described as a defiant and strong-willed leader. In life and in death, her charisma and determination have been admired by people throughout the world. 
   She was a beacon of democracy in Pakistan, and I join my colleagues in condemning her assassination with the expectation that the current government will seek out and find all of the assassins. 
   Pakistan has been a loyal ally and friends of the United States since 1947.     
   The United States stands with the people of Pakistan. We affirm our commitment to the Pakistani people in combating terrorism and promoting a free and democratic Pakistan. The long lamentable history of human conduct is filled with the names of martyrs who have been murdered for the cause of freedom. Today, we add the name of one more.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I thank the gentleman from California, and also your leadership on the Immigration Caucus. This important issue, border security, immigration is a national security issue, Mr. Speaker. And the people from Southeast Texas who I represent have long been concerned about the open borders that we have in the United States and the continuing problems that arise from that. 
   It is said, Mr. Speaker, that money is the root of all evil. And companies like Bank of America think making a buck is more important than knowing who their customers really are. By issuing credit cards and bank accounts to people who show little, if any legitimate documentation, banks are leaving the door wide open for money laundering, fraud, and identity theft. They contribute to the magnet that drives people to the United States to come and stay here illegally. And they are blatantly sending a message to drug cartels and terrorists around the world that they are open to business for anybody that has got a little money. 
   Bank of America's slogan is ``Higher Standards.'' Higher standards, Mr. Speaker. It seems they have no standards. Whatever happened to good corporate citizenship, where integrity takes a back seat to banking greed? Since when does greed override their responsibility? 
   Let me read to you what the Bank's Director of Latin American Card Operation, a Mr. Brian Tuite, I think that is his last name, T-U-I-T-E, said about this recent bank program of giving credit to illegals in the United States. He said, ``These people are coming here for quality of life, and they deserve somebody to give them a chance to achieve that quality of life.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, since when did Mr. Tuite write Federal immigration laws? And what part of illegal immigrant does he not understand? You know, with that attitude, I suggest he and Bank of America change their name to Bank of Mexico. 
   While on the subject of Federal immigration laws, let me read Title 8 of the U.S. Code, section 1324(a) which defines several distinct offenses related to illegals. The law prohibits, among other things, encouraging or inducing unauthorized aliens, that is Federal language for illegals, to enter the United States, and engaging in a conspiracy or aiding and abetting any of the preceding acts. 
   So what is the Department of Homeland Security doing about all this? Are they working to strengthen document standards for banks like my colleague from Tennessee is attempting to do, Ms. Blackburn? No. They are using Bank of America's position to argue for more guest workers and for amnesty that would reward illegals en masse. They seem not to get it. 
   The Department of Homeland Security spokesman, Russ Knocke said banking products aimed at illegal immigrants reinforce the need for a temporary worker program. This is nonsense. His idea rewards the unlawful activity of being in the country illegally by now saying it is permissible activity to be here illegally. 
   Banking products aimed at illegal immigrants do not reinforce the need for a temporary worker program. They reinforce the need to enforce the border rules, strengthen interior enforcement of immigration laws and punish companies who openly flout the rule of law. 
   How do we expect to hold employers who knowingly hire illegals accountable when American banks are rolling out the welcome mat to illegals and giving them credit? 
   Issuing credit cards to people without valid and legitimate documentation makes no sense. The banking industry would have you believe it has to do with helping these poor individuals with bad credit history. This is nonsense, again. It is all about banks cashing in on the underground illegal cash economy, pure and simple. It is all about money. It always has been, and it always will be. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 1314, the Photo Identification Security Act that Mrs. Blackburn has spoken about and offered tonight. This legislation will close the Federal loophole created in the PATRIOT act that allows for financial institutions to accept these bogus alternate forms of identification when opening accounts or obtaining credit cards. 
   Like Mrs. Blackburn pointed out, many American citizens and lawful immigrants have difficulty obtaining credit or credit cards, but banks are making it easier for illegals to obtain credit and credit cards. 
   This bill will require any official business with the Federal Government or financial institutions to accept one of the forms of identification that are normal, such as a Social Security card, with a government issued identification card, including a state driver's license, a U.S. or foreign passport or U.S. citizenship and immigration service photo identification card. 
   The Mexican government-issued matricula consular card under this new legislation will no longer be accepted. Now, Mr. Speaker, the MATRICULA CONSULAR CARD, issued by the nation of Mexico, is an identification card made by the Mexican government for Mexican nationals that are illegally in the United States. Banks and even our Federal Government have now begun to accept this as a valid identification form. We need to work with the banking industry and convince them to maintain the integrity of our laws and provide strict guidelines on acceptable and secure identification policies. Banks like Bank of America need to stop encouraging illegal entry into the United States and quit pandering to the illegals that are here, all in the name of the all mighty peso. 
   So I appreciate the time the gentleman from California has given me and, hopefully, working together, we can stop this nonsense of allowing illegals in this country to obtain special privileges over American citizens and lawful immigrants.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, behind the thick walls of some Federal prisons, inmates are being put to work. Not on chain gangs tarring roads and hacking rocks, but in prison factories. 
   Private industries are bringing their businesses behind the barbed wire fortresses, realizing the benefits of incarcerated inmates going to work. Prison industries are operated to achieve two goals: First, they occupy the prisoners' time to keep them busy and out of trouble. The second goal is to provide those incarcerated inmates a trade and valuable work experience, a trade and experience that can be applied to the American workforce once they leave the penitentiary. Prison industries give an inmate a sense of accomplishment and achievement, and the ability to have a chance to work and live as a law-abiding citizen beyond the prison walls. 
   In the Federal prison system, UNICOR, the Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated, contracts out to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and hires inmates to work behind those tall prison walls. The inmates earn 35 cents to $1.15 an hour. Now, Mr. Speaker, this money is paid by private industries, not taxpayers. 
   And, here is the best part: The money that the inmates earn goes to, first, pay their fine; second, partial restitution to the victim through the Victims of Crime Act; and, third, the rest goes into a savings account that the inmate will get once they leave the penitentiary. This way, the prisoner literally earns his keep in the big house. He helps pay for the system he has created, relieving the taxpayers of this burden. 
   I have had the opportunity to tour one of these prison units in Beaumont, Texas, at the Beaumont Federal Correctional Complex in my congressional district. In the Beaumont Federal prison system, prison inmates craft state-of-the-art military helmets for our troops fighting in Iraq. I have one of those helmets right here with me, Mr. Speaker. 
   This is officially called by the Federal Government the ``personal armor for ground troops helmet.'' I just call it a helmet. It is used by our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is made of Kevlar, and it provides our warriors protection from shrapnel and bullets. These helmets have been credited with saving several of our troops' lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, each month the inmates at the Beaumont Prison produce 30,000 of these helmets; 360,000 of them a year are being provided for our military. The Beaumont Prison factory also has the distinction of being the only UNICOR factory that produces these  helmets. Currently, the prison is designing a more protective helmet that will soon be used in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   The 320 inmates in the Beaumont factory making these helmets are patriots, and they think they are because they are patriots; they are doing their part in the war efforts. This is a medium security facility, and it is not the only war contributor in the Beaumont prison system. 
   The minimum security system in Beaumont repairs damaged tanks. They receive a facelift from the inmates and their engines are overhauled. The mechanics that work in these prisons are experts in diesel mechanics, and they take a once unusable piece of machinery that has been damaged and they turn it into a war-worthy military tank once more. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a former judge, I believe in using inmate labor; make them help pay for the system they have created. The taxpayer has paid for the system long enough. Some of these inmates in the Beaumont prison I met earlier on a professional basis at the courthouse, and now I am glad to see that they are turning their lives around. For behind the steel doors and tall walls of the prison, these men go to work each day producing helmets that safeguard American troops from enemy fire. They are not forced to work in the factories, but they choose to. They choose to volunteer. 
   The inmates I talked to are proud of our troops overseas and feel a sense of connection to them by making these helmets. Prison labor programs are a good idea for inmates and for America, and certainly for the American taxpayer. Some inmates are locked up behind bars because they harmed another person's life. Now they have the chance to redeem their past deeds; they now work to save the lives of our American soldiers. After all, Mr. Speaker, we are all in this together. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Well, what does that really mean? Does that mean more U.S. foreign aid? Or have U.S. companies expand to Mexico and use those Mexican workers? Either way, Calderon expects the United States to solve his problem. Mexico alone cannot or will not take care of its economic problems, thus making their problem our problem. 
   Currently, Mexico exports its people to the United States to work and then have them send money back to Mexico. Mr. Speaker, if the United States invests in Mexico and more Mexican workers stay home, is there going to be a cross-border conflict over who gets the worker?

   Mr. POE. I thank the gentlelady from Florida for yielding time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I was a prosecutor and a judge in Texas for 30 years total, and I can tell you that I saw the results of poppy and opium fields in my courtroom. Opiates make victims out of capable, independent citizens, and they turn decent people into monsters, and I have seen it with my own eyes. Case after case after case. 
   Illicit drugs take complete control of people's lives, and they are now strangling the democracy in Afghanistan. Opiates not only poison Americans, the poppy trade funds our enemies. The Taliban, or more appropriately, those demons in the desert, are getting rich off of the poppy fields, and they are using that money against American troops and NATO troops. 
   They are using their wealth to become more numerous, more organized, and more deadly to the military of NATO and the United States. They are promoting intolerance and propping up evil and propelling Afghanistan really back toward the dark ages to a fundamentalist rule. 
   In the 2005 and 2006 growing season, poppy production in Afghanistan actually grew to almost 60 percent. That resulted in a net growth of almost 50 percent in the production of illicit opium, and all the profit from this drug trade lined the pockets of our enemies, the Taliban. Those poppy fields are growing like weeds, and they are choking Afghanistan's freedom. Also, those narcotics are eventually choking the lives out of many Americans addicted to opiates. 
   The administration, I know, recognized the importance of counternarcotics operations. However, judging from the rapid spread of the poppy production in Afghanistan, it's evident that whatever we are doing is not working. The time has come for a clear and comprehensive and truly wide-reaching counternarcotics strategy in Afghanistan. 
   That is why I rise in support of this bill, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act. This bill does numerous things, but it specifically provides a comprehensive strategy and a priority to deal with the narcotics. It allows the military to give greater logistics support to the Drug Enforcement Administration, and, more importantly, though, this bill creates a coordinator role that will reach across government departments to develop a comprehensive strategy in how to deal with this problem. 
   Our military is unmatched in its ability to get the job done. Any time, anywhere. But including enhanced civilian interdiction teams, the fight against the drug trade will help our troops get the bad guys, the kingpins in Afghanistan, these people that are making money off of the drug trade.     
   Also, the team will receive support from our military, international resources and Afghanistan law enforcement officers. I believe that allowing law enforcement to participate in taking down these desert kingpins will give the Afghanistan police a sense of ownership over their own security and help further train them in counternarcotics operation. That could only be a good thing for the citizens of Afghanistan. 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the administration's commitment to taking care of the poppy fields in Afghanistan that fund our enemies, but I think we're missing a link somewhere in our strategy. Provisions in this bill focus on funding that link, and that's a good start. All of our sacrifice and that of our NATO allies and the future of Afghanistan depend on establishing a stable and viable democracy in that region of the world. That democracy can only thrive amidst a legitimate economy. Our troops, our allies, and, most importantly, the Afghanistan people deserve a chance to live unfettered and free of the rule of kingpins of the drugs and the Taliban.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (FIX THE LEAK OR BUY MORE BUCKETS -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, when Hurricane Rita hit southeast Texas, a pine tree fell on our house and caused a leak in the roof. The water came into the house, and I couldn't put enough buckets under the leak to catch all that water. I didn't really know what to do. Eventually it dawned on me, I had to go up on the roof and fix the leak or water would have continued to fill all those buckets and more. The ``grand bargain'' immigration plan is really a plan to buy more buckets for the big leak on our border. 
   The government is missing the obvious. Until we fix the leak, we can never deal with all of the water from the leak. Until Uncle Sam enforces border security, we cannot solve the problem with the illegals already here. 
   The so-called immigration reform bill deals with the wrong issue first. It legalizes the illegals while inadequately securing the border. Secure the border and then come up with a plan that is not amnesty in dealing with the people here illegally. Otherwise, we will keep buying more buckets and the real problem will never be solved. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (LAST CURTAIN CALL FOR FREE SPEECH IN FRANCE -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the curtain has dropped on the stage of free speech in Paris, France for actress Brigitte Bardot. The birthplace of enlightenment has now become home to conformity and political correctness, and rigid speech control. 
   In France, if speech is offensive, a person can be fined and imprisoned. That's what French prosecutors are trying to do to Brigitte Bardot, claiming she incited racial hatred toward the Muslim community. 
   Bardot wrote comments in a letter to Nicolas Sarkozy that offended Muslims. Bardot, an animal rights activist, denounced a Muslim festival that including slaughtering sheep by saying she was ``fed up with being led by this population which is destroying us, and destroying France.'' 
   Now the French speech control police claim it's a crime to speak ill of Muslims. So much for freedom of speech in progressive France. 
   Speech control is a throwback to the Dark Ages when no one could say anything bad about the king. Gone is the citizen Voltaire's philosophy of ``I may disapprove of what you say, but I will defend it to the death for you to say it.'' 
   But today French citizens that speak their mind may face the modern day Bastille if they offend Muslims or hurt their feelings. It looks like the last curtain call for actress Brigitte Bardot and free speech in France. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (SERGEANT SHAUN PAUL TOUSHA: HULL, TEXAS HERO -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, today the small town of Hull Texas, population 1,800, is mourning the loss of a native son who grew up to be a mighty warrior for the United States Army. He gave up everything he had to protect everyone else's freedom. 
   Army Sergeant Shaun Paul Tousha was killed in Baghdad, Iraq on April 9, 2008 when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. 
   Madam Speaker, the IED is the way our cowardly enemy fights this war. And in my Congressional district area, Shaun Paul is the 26th area resident that has been killed in Iraq or Afghanistan during these wars. 
   He was a man from small town Texas who had a playful heart, and he made a big impression on everybody that knew him growing up. He died as a war hero at the age of 30, and he will forever be recognized as how he lived, that being a loving husband, a caring father and a great friend to all those people in rural America. 
   Shaun Paul Tousha was born February 11, 1978 in Silsbee, Texas. He grew up in the town of Hull, Texas, and he was the son of the late Tommy Gene and Roberta Tousha. He was a husband to Christy Tousha, and loving father of the two children, Colton and Maycee. 
   As a teenager, Shaun played football, like most Texas rural boys do. He played at Hull-Daisetta High School. And he also liked to ride horses. And being a cowboy, he enjoyed bull riding. 
   His stepmother, Doris Tousha, was very proud of Shaun. She described him as outgoing and an individual who had a lot of friends. He was always cutting up, acting silly, and made friends easily. He liked to joke around, and his personality drew people toward him. She said that he may have been a handful growing up, but she was proud of the way he turned out. 
   And after graduating from Hull-Daisetta High School in May of 1996, Shaun got a job at a wire company in Dayton, Texas. He worked there for several years before he heard his Nation's call and joined the United States Army at the age of 22 in February of 2000. 
   His father, Tommy Gene Tousha, was extremely proud of his son's decision to serve in the Army, and even went with him to the local recruiting station when he joined up. 
   Madam Speaker, General Patton once said ``we should live for something, rather than to die for nothing.'' Shaun sought to live his life in duty to this country. 
   Shaun attended basic training in Ft. Benning, Georgia and later was stationed at Ft. Hood, Texas. He was assigned as a Generator Equipment Repairman in the 1st Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, in Ft. Hood, Texas.  
   General Patton reminded us that ``wars may be fought with weapons but they are won by men.'' Shaun was a skillful soldier, and he and his comrades in arms are the ones with the boots on the ground that are winning this war. Shaun realized this, and during his first tour of duty in Iraq he decided to re-enlist in the United States Army and make the military his career. He served three tours of duty in Iraq. 
   When Shaun's father died in 2002, he helped his stepmother, Doris, through many difficult times. He took care of his family back home in America. 
   Doris said that she was impressed at Shaun's emotional strength during that painful ordeal of the family father's death. Doris said that she was proud that the Army really helped him become a mature individual. 
   George Washington once said that ``discipline is the soul of the Army.'' And with Shaun's character, background and career in the Army, Shaun was able to overcome even the most trying circumstances because of that discipline. 
   One of Shaun's best friends, Johnny Fregia, described him as a ``good ol' boy that died for his country.'' They became friends when they worked together in Dayton, Texas. Shaun was Johnny's helper, and he kept work interesting for Johnny with his humor, ever-present smile and his constant good mood. They enjoyed even shooting pool after work, and Johnny said that Shaun was pretty good at it. 
   Johnny described the high caliber of character and love for their country that his friend Shaun had and the rest of our military men and women possess. 
   Johnny went ahead and said, ``freedom ain't free. And sometimes we take it for granted. There's a price to pay, and those guys like Shaun are willing to pay for it. They are willing to lose everything they've got to keep this country free.'' 
   Madam Speaker, this is a recent photograph of Shaun Paul Tousha right before he died. Shaun Tousha paid the ultimate price with his life, the price for freedom in our country. 
   Aristotle once wrote that ``we make war so that we may live in peace.'' Shaun served in order that we may have freedom and have real peace in this country. 
   Americans, even in this chamber, cry peace, peace. But Madam Speaker, there can be no peace as long as there are people who are trying to kill Americans somewhere in the world. And Shaun Paul tried to protect us from that threat. 
   He had a heart as big as Texas, and we are proud of Sergeant Shaun Tousha. The light of his life has been extinguished, buy Shaun's joyful spirit will burn bright forever in the hearts and minds of his friends, his fellow soldiers, and the Texans that loved him. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (U.S. COURTS VS. WORLD COURT -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, teenagers Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena were viciously raped, beaten, strangled and stomped to death by six gang members in Houston in 1993. One of these killers, Mexican national Jose Ernesto Medellin, was given the death penalty. But the World Court claims that Medellin was denied access to the Mexican consulate during his arrest. The U.S. administration sided with the World Court in Mexico and ordered Texas to hold a new hearing for Medellin based on a treaty the United States signed in 1969. But the Texas court, highest Texas court, ruled 9-0 the administration had no constitutional authority to order Texas courts to do anything; upheld the conviction, ordered the execution, especially because Medellin never objected at trial that he did not see his consulate. The killer, with the support of the administration and Mexico, has appealed the Texas court decision to the United States Supreme Court. One wonders why the administration is siding with Mexico over the American court system. 
   Madam Speaker, the ironic thing is the United States has withdrawn the consulate treaty provision. The United States justice system and the sovereignty of the United States Constitution should be paramount to the wishes of Mexico, the World Court and the administration. The Supreme Court should uphold this valid conviction and not give in to the wishes of Foreign Courts. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (LISA BEAULIEU--TEXAS POLICE OFFICER -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, peace officers are the last strand of wire in the fence between the law and the lawless. They do society's dirty work for us. They are a cut above the rest of us because of who they are and what they do. 
   For Lisa Beaulieu, becoming a police officer was her life's ambition. She wanted to protect and serve the citizens of the community that she loved. Lisa worked hard at becoming a peace officer, and it didn't come easy for her. To gain experience, she worked as a jailer in Dayton, Texas while putting herself through the police academy at Lamar Institute of Technology. And when she graduated, Lisa got a job as a dispatcher at the Beaumont Police Department. To gain more experience as a law enforcement officer, Lisa became an unpaid part-time reserve officer with the Kountze Police Department in Texas. After years of determination, Lisa was hired by the Beaumont Police Department as a patrol officer in 2001. 
   For 6 years, Officer Lisa Beaulieu was, as many officers are, the first line of defense between the good and the evil of our community. She was dedicated to her job, and she took it seriously. Friends of Lisa stated that, when off duty, she was a girly girl. She loved the color pink, she always had manicured nails and pedicured toes, and had a closet full of shoes. Lisa had a smile that could light up a room and a great sense of humor, often telling men that would hit on her that she was just a driver's education instructor. She was dedicated to the family she had and her friends, and she cherished the moments she spent with them. She was also an avid animal lover, housing two dogs that she adopted from the animal shelter. 
   During the devastation of Hurricane Rita, Lisa took care of the citizens of Beaumont and her law enforcement family. She worked long, tireless 12-hour days, patrolling the hurricane's aftermath and caring for the residents of Beaumont. For her fellow officers, she turned her own garage into a makeshift shelter, offering them a place to come and get some rest before heading back into the disaster zone. 
   Friends stated that when she put on her uniform, however, she was all business. She was fearless and Texas tough, invincible when she wore the badge of a peace officer. Known as the type of officer who would set an example for others, Lisa's police file was filled with commendations from Chief Tom Scofield.  
   Around 1 a.m. Friday morning, April 27, the seasoned Officer Beaulieu responded to the scene of a motorcycle accident on the Eastex Freeway in Beaumont. She began directing traffic around the accident, allowing motorists to pass. While controlling the accident scene and out of the darkness of the night, a car driven by 24-year-old Willie McCray slammed into Officer Beaulieu, knocking her over the guard rail and onto the road below, killing her. She became the first female police officer in Southeast Texas killed in the line of duty. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a photograph of Lisa Beaulieu. The Beaumont Texas community was stunned by the loss of this veteran peace officer. Some news reports, however, have tried to portray the person who ran over Lisa as the victim instead of her. McCray was not the victim, he was the offender. McCray's driver's license was suspended and he had no liability insurance. He had been arrested eight times for minor crimes. And the worst part, McCray was allegedly drunk and believed to be high on marijuana when he was blasting down the road. McCray has been charged with the intoxicated manslaughter in the death of this peace officer of Texas. He robbed the Beaumont community and Officer Beaulieu's family of a dedicated law officer. 
   Yesterday, I had the honor to attend her funeral, where over 1,000 citizens, law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency personnel throughout Southeast Texas were all in attendance showing their support for their fallen comrade. The peace officers present wore a black ribbon of sorrow across their badges as they paid a last farewell to Lisa Beaulieu. 
   Mr. Speaker, Officer Beaulieu exemplified what it meant to be a peace officer. She was a protector of the innocent, the community, and her fellow peace officers. Officer Beaulieu wore the badge with pride, honor, and courage. The people and peace officers of Texas are saddened by the loss of one of their dedicated servants. 
   As a former Texas judge, I have known a lot of peace officers in my day, and some of them were superior peace officers. Lisa was one of those superior officers. Officers like Lisa Beaulieu serve us well and are on duty in the middle of the night so that the rest of us can sleep with safety and security. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, New Haven, Connecticut, has become exactly that: a new haven for illegal immigrants. 
   The city will be granting illegals an ID card that will allow them to access city services, such as parks, the library, and the ability to open bank accounts. This ID card for illegals will become the first of its kind in our Nation issued by a city. 
   Even though the American public is opposed to free-pass amnesty, this city doesn't understand it is still against the law to be in the United States illegally. 
   But New Haven doesn't seem to care. They have already recruited banks that will allow use of these cards. Yale Law School volunteered free legal services. All in the name of helping people get away with breaking the law. 
   New Haven, Connecticut, flaunts its encouragement of illegal entry. So since the Feds won't adequately enforce immigration laws and don't seem to know what to do with illegals, let's just invite all illegals to go to New Haven, Connecticut, where the city wants to have a safe sanctuary for them. 
   Mr. Speaker, there should be consequences for cities like New Haven, Connecticut, that are bastions for illegals. Cities that openly promote violations of Federal law should lose Federal funds. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (HONORING THE LIFE OF PFC. BRANDON KEITH BOBB -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Winston Churchill said that, ``We are masters of our fate, the task which has been set before us is not above our strength; that its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance. As long as we have faith in our own cause and an unconquerable will to win, victory will never be denied us.'' 
   Army PFC Brandon Keith Bobb believed in these words. He believed in the mission of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He believed in freedom and liberation from tyranny and terrorism. 
   Private First Class Bobb was born and raised in Port Arthur, Texas, a small town in southeast Texas that I represent. He attended Memorial High School and was a member of the track and field team. His high school coach remembers a young man who exhibited leadership as a high school student. His fellow students looked up to him and followed his examples. 
   Private First Class Bobb did not get the opportunity to graduate from Memorial High School because of Hurricane Rita. Hurricane Rita reared her vicious head and forced Bobb and his family to evacuate southeast Texas, and they relocated in Florida. He finished high school there.  
   He did not always want to be in the United States Army. It was in Riverview that he decided his career path in life, to become a chef. So, after high school, Bobb enrolled in the Orlando Culinary Academy. However, he quickly decided that this career choice was really not for him, and he decided that he wanted to belong in the United States Army. He knew the United States was at war in action and Iraq, but he enlisted in the Army because he knew it was his duty. 
   As private first class in the Army, Bobb became a military police officer in the 401st Military Police Company, 92nd Military Police Battalion, 89th Military Police Brigade stationed at Ft. Hood, Texas. 
   He enjoyed being a military police officer, maintaining law and order on the Army base. According to Private Bobb, he said, ``As of now, being a military police officer is the best job in the world.'' 
   He was a man of many friends, especially among his brothers in arms in the United States Army. Those who knew him knew a young man that had an easy going personality and a positive outlook on life. He was always cheerful and was a soldier that others looked to for support and to lend a helping hand. He was always thinking of others, according to his friends. 
   He knew he was lucky in life, and he admitted on his personnel Myspace page that he hadn't always followed the straight and narrow path and had engaged in potentially dangerous activity growing up. But he was confident that that part of his life was behind him, and regardless of how tough he thought he was then, he knew in his heart that he was a real soldier in the Army. 
   Private First Class Bobb continued and said, The United States Army is where the real tough men are at, my drill sergeants, my battle buddies, my commanders, and first sergeants that stand ready to die for the rest of us every day. 
   Private First Class Bobb was deployed to Iraq in 2006 and was proud to go over to the vast desert sands of Iraq and defend freedom for the Iraqi people and represent the United States. He believed in his heart what he was doing was right. 
   But on July 17, a week ago, Private First Class Bobb was traveling in a military Humvee in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad when a bomb detonated near the vehicle. The bomb killed Pfc. Brandon Bobb and two of his fellow soldiers. He was 20 years old. He was due home from duty on July 26. That would have been tomorrow, one week after he gave his life for his country. 
   This is a recent photograph taken of Private First Class Bobb. This past Monday, this southeast Texas warrior, this son of Texas, came back to his beloved hometown. The citizens of Port Arthur turned out and honored him with a patriot's welcome. A water-made rainbow arch greeted the plane that carried the fallen soldier as hundreds of individuals from the town waving American flags lined the streets to pay final respects. Mr. Speaker, that's what people do in southeast Texas when our heroes come home. 
   A lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps, in a recent letter from Iraq, described what it meant to be an American warrior. He said, ``Our highest calling: to defend our way of life and Western civilization; fight for the freedom of others; protect our family, friends, and country; and give hope to a people long without it.'' 
   Pfc. Brandon Bobb was that American warrior. He embodied what it meant to serve one's country with duty and honor, to put others above himself, and to defend the freedom of all Nations. 
   We are a grateful Nation for the sacrifice of Pfc. Brandon Bobb. Our hearts and prayers are with his family and his Army buddies. 
   Mr. Speaker, our young people who go to the valley of the gun and the desert of the sun are relentless, remarkable characters. They go where others fear to tread and where the faint-hearted are not found. These warriors represent the best of our Nation. They are the sons of liberty and the daughters of democracy. These few, these noble few are American warriors who take care of the rest of us. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (LIMITING USE OF FUNDS TO ESTABLISH ANY MILITARY INSTALLATION OR BASE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from Florida for yielding me the time. 
   There has been a consistent message that has been put forth by Congress that we are not interested in permanent bases in Iraq, but that should not diminish our need to have a presence there at this time. We must not jeopardize United States security interests. At issue here is the definition of the word ``permanent.'' No one can quite agree on what that really means. 
   This bill is similar to one we passed earlier when we passed language in the supplemental on this topic. The point is, we do not intend to be in Iraq permanently. We are not interested in Iraqi oil. 
   I do believe our military is stretched too thin throughout the world. We literally have a U.S. troop presence in almost every country on the globe, from military bases in Germany to Korea and other places in between. Some of those bases seem like they are permanent because we have been in those areas for so long. Our troops in those nations remain an issue of really another debate. 
   The issue here is over permanent basing in Iraq. We should have installations or naval ships in an area where our troops can quickly deploy, and Iraq really should be no different. But we've never set out to occupy any nation. We are not an imperial Nation. We do not intend to violate the sovereignty of another nation by occupying it. This has always been United States policy. The United States came to liberate, not conquer, Iraq, and this is our policy. 
   In a letter one of my colleagues addressed to Chairman Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Pace was asked his thoughts on the need to have the U.S. enter into and retain the ability to enter into agreed military basing rights agreements with Iraq and in Iraq. In his response, General Pace stated it's the intention of the United States military to ``work closely with Iraq's sovereign government to decide the terms and what foreign military forces . . . will remain in Iraq.'' 
   Historically, basing rights agreements have been a necessary part of diplomatic relations with foreign governments, but they've always been agreed to by the United States and that other nation. These agreements outline guidelines and conditions for operating American military bases and troops worldwide. 
   It is both common and responsible for the United States to enter into temporary basing agreements with other countries hosting our troops. This is being done in every country hosting United States troops, and the representative Government of Iraq should not really be an exception. And we should continue to work with them on temporary basing, but not permanent basing. 
   We shouldn't somehow put Iraq in some type of different category than we have other allies in the world, but we should make it clear that our basing rights are only temporary. So, designating that we may have temporary basing rights is only logical in Iraq, but a permanent presence in Iraq is not desired. And it has been the statement of this Congress before. 
   So I support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, I want to talk briefly on the Poe-Costa-Moore amendment. As stated in the amendment, this is a bipartisan amendment. And I want to thank the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Kansas for their support for crime victims under this amendment and the VOCA fund. 
   The VOCA fund was established under the Reagan administration. It's a novel concept where criminals who are convicted of crime pay fees into a fund that goes to victims of crime. It's kind of like criminals pay the rent on the courthouse, as they should. And so this fund has been established to supply victims and victims services throughout the country necessary funds for those victims and those projects. 
   At this present time, the fund is up to $1.3 billion. But this year the fund is capped at $625 million for victims services and victims throughout the United States. 
   This amendment is asking that 10 million more dollars be applied to this fund because of two reasons: Unfortunately, there are more crime victims in the United States than there ever have been. And also, by necessity, there are more programs that are victims services than ever have been in the United States. 
   Over 4,400 different programs and agencies receive funding under the VOCA fund. Over 3 million victims receive funds from this fund every year. And this covers the gamut, from sexual assault victims to child victims, to robbery victims and victims and families of homicide. 
   These funds are needed for these families. But they're also needed for domestic violence shelters. They're needed for child assessment centers. Those are centers throughout the United States that take sexually exploited children and help them through the process; not only the medical process, not only the psychological process, but the criminal justice system as well. 
   There are 26 organizations that support an additional $10 million for this crime victims fund, because it is necessary to help victims throughout the United States. So under this amendment, we're asking for 10 million additional dollars taken from human resources that would be applied to crime victims organizations throughout the United States and money for crime victims. This money, as I stated, is necessary. Unfortunately, it is necessary to help victims. 
   As chairman of the Crime Victims Caucus, and my cochair Mr. Costa, and other Members like Mr. Moore from Kansas, we all support this additional funding for crime victims. Take it and place it where it is necessary. 
   It is a novel concept to allow people who violate the law to contribute to a constant fund, and we want that to continue, but this year there needs to be 10 million additional dollars contributed to that fund so that numerous organizations that provide specifically victims services that funding has been cut in the past will be allowed to continue those victims services in the United States. 
   List of Organizations Who Support the Poe-Costa-Moore Amendment 
   American Probation and Parole Association; American Society of Victimology; Break the Cycle; Jewish Women International; Justice Solutions; Legal Momentum; Mothers Against Drunk Driving; National Alliance to End Sexual Violence; National Association of Crime Victim Compensation Boards; National Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators; National Center for Victims of Crime; National Children's Alliance; and National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, in my previous life before coming to Congress, I was a prosecutor in Texas for a long time. Then I was a criminal court judge. Justice is one thing that we should always find in our country, but we don't always find it in our courts, unfortunately. 
   This case that has now become very famous throughout the United States happens to deal with two border agents doing their job. They come in contact with a drug dealer on the violent Texas-Mexico border. The drug dealer bring in a million dollars' worth of drugs in a van. He abandons the drugs and the van, takes off, tries to run back to Mexico, gets in a confrontation with our border agents. Shots are fired. He is shot in the buttocks and disappears into Mexico. 
   Our Federal Government brings the drug dealer back to the United States and grants him immunity from prosecution of a million dollars' worth of drugs in order to prosecute the border agents who were doing their job. He was given that immunity and testified against the two border agents. They were convicted and sent to a Federal penitentiary for 11 and 12 years. And for the most part of their sentence, which started in January, they have been in solitary confinement, what we reserve normally for the hardest and meanest and most violent criminals in our society. 
   It turns out that this drug dealer was not just a mule bringing in drugs to get a little money for his sick mother back in Mexico, but while he was waiting to testify, given immunity, he goes back to Mexico and brings in another load of drugs worth about $800,000. 
   Our Federal prosecutors knew about that second load of drugs, but they insisted that the jury not know about that second load of drugs, and the jury never heard about that second load of drugs. 
   It is relentless prosecution in this case that is chilling the effect of our border agents on the border to do their job, which is to enforce the rule of law, to arrest drug dealers. Our Federal Government had the choice to prosecute two border agents that violated  policy, or a drug dealer bringing in a million dollars' worth of drugs. 
   Now, you would think that public policy would say we would go after drug dealers. But no, our Federal prosecutors went after the border agents. We still don't know why they were so relentless in that prosecution, but they were. So tonight, while we are here, we have two border agents serving time in the penitentiary. 
   This amendment simply tries to right a wrong. It requires that no funds be used to incarcerate either one of these two border agents, Ramos and Compean, any further, and that they can be released from custody. 
   Almost everyone agrees that the punishment is way out of line. Even the prosecutor said that once. Last week the Senate held hearings on the prosecution of this case in a bipartisan manner and said that these sentences were way out of line. And so this amendment will simply allow no Federal funds to be used to incarcerate these two border agents. 
   Hopefully the House will continue to have hearings on why these two agents and other border agents have been prosecuted by the Western District of Texas while ignoring other violations of the law by drug dealers. 
   I hope that my fellow colleagues on both sides of the aisle would agree to support this amendment and to allow the release of these two individuals, and not allow any Federal funds to be used to incarcerate two men who were simply doing their job for the rest of us on the violent Texas border.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I appreciate the support. I would like to comment on the comments earlier by the gentleman from California. 
   It is true. I don't know if the American public knows this, but if drug dealers bring in $5,000 of drugs or less, they are not prosecuted. But this wasn't a $5,000 case. The drug dealer first brought in $1 million worth of drugs, and in the second case he snuck in $800,000 worth of drugs. The jury was never told about that. 
   The other thing I would like to point out is that Members of Congress met with the Homeland Security inspector general about this case. They gave us information that turned out not to be true. Mr. Skinner finally testified under oath before Congress that the information they gave us about this case was false. That is disconcerting in this type of matter when we have Homeland Security telling Members of Congress things that are not true about this particular matter. 
   I don't have time to go on that, but I would ask for support of this case. This is the only remedy available. In my judicial experience, I do believe in our court system, and our courts eventually will work this case out. It will be reversed, but meanwhile they are in jail. The only way they can get out of jail is if we pass this amendment. I appreciate it.

   Mr. POE. I thank the gentleman from Iowa for yielding. 
   I know that we've discussed this issue a lot tonight, but it's important because it has to do with the most important concept that any of us have, liberty. And we have found in the investigation of this case that the U.S. Attorney's Office has done everything it can to make sure that these two people stay in jail. 
   The key to this is that the jury did decide the facts of this case, but the jury didn't get all the facts given to them under the law. There was another case where the drug dealer brought in another $800,000 worth of drugs while he's running free at American taxpayer expense, and brings in these drugs while he's waiting to testify. Anybody who served on any jury in the country would want to know about that second case. This jury was prohibited from knowing about that because of the insistence and the relentless prosecutor who demanded that the jury not hear about all of the facts. 
   The question is why? Why wouldn't the prosecutor want the jury to know all the truth about this case? 
   We don't know. We do know that the Mexican Government, in its righteous indignation, sent a speedy letter over to the U.S. Attorney's Office demanding prosecution of these border agents. The Mexican Government dealing in our court system, their opinion is irrelevant, I submit, Mr. Chairman. 
   And this case is a case where our Border Patrol agents are in Fabans, Texas. I don't believe there's been a person here that's been to Fabans, Texas, unless they've gone there on purpose to see the border. It's a violent, dangerous, desolate area. And based upon the rules they have to follow, they cannot fire their weapon unless they are fired upon. In other words, they've got to take a bullet before they can defend the border. And they operate under that environment because of the national security of our border. 
   In this case, overreaching by the prosecutor; too heavy a sentence. He even said so later after the prosecution. And what this does is release these two individuals while the appeal goes on. It releases them from custody of our Federal Government. And it's the responsibility of Congress in further investigations to find out why our Western District of Texas is so relentless in prosecuting border protectors. And this is one way we can do something. We have that authority. We can cut the funds, and we ought to cut the funds that incarcerate these two individuals. We ought to pass this amendment in a bipartisan manner.

   Mr. POE. There was a grand jury investigation. I do not know who testified. The border supervisors were on the scene and were aware of the entire circumstances. 
   No one knew that the drug dealer who disappeared back into Mexico had even been shot, and so they thought that the person was shot at and he disappeared. And the next thing they know, they are being questioned about 30 to 60 days later about the incident that occurred.

   Mr. POE. The border agents were offered, if they pled guilty to the offense, 2 years incarceration. If they did not plead guilty and went to trial, the prosecutor added the section under our law, 924(c) section that required or would allow a mandatory additional 10 years incarceration because a weapon was used. That is subject to appeal as to whether that applies to peace officers or not. That was added. Therefore they received 11 and 12 years in the penitentiary after the trial and after sentencing because they would not plead guilty for a crime they didn't do.

   This bill will put American troops at risk. And for some odd reason, this emergency Iraqi bill is loaded with squealing pork that has nothing to do with our troops or the war. One provision is to give $3 billion to farmers hurt by bad weather, like my rice farmers in southeast Texas that were  devastated by Hurricane Rita. But I will not barter my position. I will not betray our troops for 30 pieces of silver or $3 billion of squealing pork.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (DEPORTING AFTER SIXTH OFFENSE FIVE TOO MANY -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, according to a memo that was just released from the U.S. Justice Department from 2005 and reported in the Houston Chronicle today, it reveals procedure and criteria for arresting, detaining, prosecuting and deporting illegals that come into the United States. 
   It is a very interesting memo. Apparently the Department of Justice did not want to make this memo public for some time. Now we understand why. According to this memo, Texas prosecutors along the Texas-Mexico border generally do not prosecute illegals until the sixth offense. In other words, they have to come over, get caught; come over, get caught; come over, get caught; come over, get caught; come over, get caught; come over, get caught, and the sixth time our Federal Government decides, okay, we get the message, we are going to prosecute you for your sixth illegal entry into the United States. 
   So we don't prosecute them the first time like most Americans would want. And, of course, the illegals on the other side of the border from whatever country they come from know this is our procedure. 
   According to this Department of Justice memo, it says because of a ``lack of resources and bed space to detain and prosecute every illegal entry violator,'' we are not able to prosecute them the first time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this ought not to be. This is bad American policy. According to the border agents who work on the Texas-Mexico border and throughout the South, they arrest 1 million illegals a year coming into the United States; and we are telling them you have to work six times harder because the first time just doesn't count. 
   According to T.J. Bonner, the head of the Border Patrol Association, he said: ``It's devastating on morale. Our agents are risking their lives out there, and then they're told, Sorry, that doesn't meet the criteria,'' and they must be released.  
   So what does this mean? This means that the Federal Government and the Justice Department and the Federal prosecutors along the Texas-Mexico border and the entire border with Mexico need to get their act together and prosecute people that illegally come into the United States. 
   They need to quit prosecuting the border protectors and spending all of the American money going down into Mexico and finding drug smugglers and giving them immunity for bringing drugs into the United States and prosecuting border agents like Ramos and Compean. They need to quit making deals with seven or eight illegals who came into Texas and were caught by Deputy Gilmer Hernandez, and then they were given a deal to stay in the country, given green cards, all to prosecute Deputy Hernandez because he fired his gun. 
   We need to find the resources to protect our border. Whatever it takes, we have to protect the border. It is the duty of our government to protect the sovereignty of this Nation. 
   Today this House just spent billions of dollars dumping money for spinach farmers and peanut farmers and for all kinds of little special pork projects in this country. Maybe that money would have been better spent to find more facilities to detain the illegals, to find more immigration judges to hear these cases, and to find more prosecutors who will do their job and prosecute the illegals in this country and deport them back where they came from no matter where they are. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is the first duty of government to protect its people, and that includes the people that live in the United States. Part of that protection is to keep us protecting from the unlawful invasion of foreigners who come to this country without permission. Whether they come here just for illegal reasons, criminal intent, whether they are human smugglers or drug smugglers, or whether they are terrorists, they need to stay out. And when caught, they need to be deported the first time, not the sixth time. This six time rule, five get-out-of-jail-free cards by our Federal Government, and this absurd policy needs to be eliminated immediately. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time saying that's just the way it is.

   But whoever committed such dastardly deeds should be quickly captured by the local sheriff. After these grave-desecrating criminals are convicted, they should be sentenced to serve time at Gitmo prison in Guantanamo Bay. After all, that is where America houses other war criminals.

   Mr. POE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   General Westmoreland said: ``I do not believe that the men who served in uniform in Vietnam have been given the credit they rightfully deserve. It was a difficult war against an unorthodox enemy.'' I agree with General Westmoreland, especially in light of those events when, last month, Vietnam veterans were dishonored when outlaw vandals desecrated the memorial. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Judge Carter, for introducing this resolution that deplores this despicable act. I'm glad to be a cosponsor of it. 
   It has also been said that in this war, Vietnam War, ``all gave some, and some gave all.'' And the Vietnam Veterans War Memorial lists the names of over 58,000 Americans who gave all for their country. And of course the men and women who sacrificed their lives in Vietnam deserve better than what happened to the memorial that honors them. 
   The thugs who desecrated the wall ought to be tracked down and be brought to justice because justice is the one thing we should always find. I certainly know what I would do to them if I were still on the bench, and I'm sure Judge Carter would like to do the same if he caught them. Be that as it may, they should be brought before the bar of justice. 
   Many of the friends that I grew up with in Texas served in Vietnam, and there are five of their names on that wall. We can honor them today by passing this resolution and demanding justice. 
   It has been said that in the Vietnam War it cost our troops everything, and it cost the American public almost nothing. It's time for the American public, by standing up for this resolution, to stand up for our troops and honor their memory in Vietnam.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, more news from the second front: the border war with Mexico continues. 
   According to Reuters and NewsMax, illegals and drug cartels are increasing the tax on U.S. border protectors by the use of rocks, firearms, and even Molotov cocktails. Here is what Webb County, Texas Sheriff Rick Flores in Laredo says: ``The attacks against us are becoming more brazen. Drug cartels are telling their people to go down fighting and do whatever is necessary to get those drugs through.'' He says, ``Mexicans fire weapons from across the border at our law enforcement agents.'' In Arizona, illegals injure border agents by pelting them with large rocks and Molotov cocktails almost on a daily basis, according to one border agent. 
   And where are the two governments? Well, it seems Mexico could care less what happens to American border agents since it encourages illegal entry, and our own U.S. Government takes the side of drug smugglers and illegals if border protectors allegedly use force to stop this invasion. Meanwhile, some in Washington fiddle the silly song of tolerance, amnesty and ignorance.

   His staff not only told Congress inaccurate things about the case, they said they have the documents to prove their assertions. Even after repeatedly asking for such documents, they were never produced. Why? Because they don't exist.

The Mexican Government, in its self-righteous arrogance and without knowing any of the facts, has already condemned the border agent. 
   President Calderon, like Generalisimo Fox before him, is partly responsible for this incident. Why? Because his government encourages illegals to sneak into America. The blood of the dead is on the hands of the Mexican Government. 
   Meanwhile, back in Texas, a criminal illegal from Mexico, having been deported several times, is charged with  the murder of a Houston police officer by shooting him in the back. Don't hear much outrage and protest from President Calderon on this case. Why not? President Calderon needs to quit blaming the U.S. for problems he is responsible for in Mexico because his people are fleeing Mexico's third-world environment.

   National forest firefighters have reported seeing illegals and drug smugglers move right on through fires as the firefighters try to put out the fires. Once assaulted with rocks, cars, guns, now agents must worry about fires. And these arsonist illegals are not just stopping at setting those fires. Reports indicate some illegals have engaged in throwing Molotov cocktails--a crude bomb made from gasoline--at our agents.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (RADIO FREE AMERICA AND THE SPEECH POLICE -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, it is written, ``Congress will make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or bridging the freedom of speech or the freedom of press or the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances.'' Of course, this is the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. And Mr. Speaker, it is first because, without these first principles, the rest of the following amendments are meaningless. These are rights that Americans take very seriously, particularly in regard to freedom of speech and freedom of the press. 
   There are some in Washington, D.C., however, that feel if someone is saying something they don't like, they ignore this freedom of the right to speak and try to control speech. This is where the so-called Fairness Doctrine comes into play. 
   In the early 1940s, the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, established the so-called Fairness Doctrine. It was instituted in an attempt to ensure that all broadcast station coverage of controversial issues be fair and balanced. This mainly applied to radio stations. This means allowing equal time for each side on an issue. If a radio station wanted to talk about the need to secure the borders, they would have to grant the same amount of time to individuals who wanted open borders. 
   The Fairness Doctrine was considered by many journalists a violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and freedom of press. And I agree with this assertion. It even led many journalists to avoid reporting on controversial issues to protect themselves from having to report on the other side of the issue. This led to the opposite effect of the doctrine that the FCC had intended. It actually stifled free speech. 
   So, by 1987, the FCC revoked the Fairness Doctrine, realizing the gross error in their ways in total disregard for the freedom of speech. There have been several attempts by speech-control advocates to reenact the Fairness Doctrine, and all of these attempts have continued to fail. But this decision still does not sit well with many in Washington, D.C., who feel that broadcast talk radio is one-sided. What it really means is that talk radio largely boasts conservative views and not liberal viewpoints. Liberal radio doesn't go over well with Americans, and these stations generally fail financially and with the American listeners. So the critics of conservative radio  have started a movement to eliminate conservative talk radio unless equal time is allowed for liberal viewpoints. Basically, they want a reinstatement of the unfair Fairness Doctrine. But what the critics may really be irate about deals more with illegal immigration than it does with talk radio, because that is the current controversial issue on talk radio stations. 
   Since their voices are so rarely heard in Congress, the American public has come to express their opinions by talk radio, especially on this issue of illegal immigration. The backroom, closed-door meetings the Senate has had to reach a deal on amnesty that the American public certainly doesn't want has encouraged talk radio shows to inform the public of this absurd nonsense of amnesty. 
   Talk radio has been one of the only vehicles that has kept the public informed about the ``give America away'' amnesty program and the political pandering and preference policies for illegals that the Senate bill is advocating. 
   So because the amnesty crowd doesn't like what they hear on the radio, they want the Federal Government to control this speech by forcing radio stations to give them free air time. If the liberals don't like talk radio, it is patently unfair to force radio stations to pay for and give away air time to them. You see, liberals can't make their case on their own radio station because no one listens to them. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, the Constitution protects free speech, not equal speech. Congress is to make no law abridging the freedom of speech whether we like the speech or not. 
   It's simple, Mr. Speaker, speech is to be free, not fair. Fair is too subjective a word. Our grandfathers guaranteed us free speech, not fair speech, and there is a big difference. 
   Congress is to stay out of the controlling of speech business because it says so in the U.S. Constitution. Our ancestors wrote the First Amendment mainly to protect two types of speech, political speech and religious speech. Those are the most controversial of all types of speech and the most important types of speech. That's why they are protected in our Constitution. 
   By trying to regulate what is said on the airways, the Federal Government and the speech police are speaking out of line. 
   And that's just the way it is.

That's right, foreigners commit a crime, go to jail, then cities let them hang around to commit more crime in the ``Land of the Free.'' 
   The Federal Government has even dumped taxpayer dollars into jurisdictions to help the cost of jailing these foreign criminals. Some jurisdictions take the money but don't help with sending these outlaws back home. San Francisco took $1 million, but, folks, it is a ``City of Refuge''; in other words, give us your tired, your poor foreign criminals who steal and rob that are yearning to be free, and we will let them stay in the City by the Bay.

Energy byproducts from these areas are shipped all over the country, even to States that won't allow refineries and, heaven forbid, those offshore rigs near their shores.

It will increase gasoline prices; it will discourage American exploration; it will increase dependence on foreign countries and OPEC; it will cost Americans jobs, especially those in my district.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the justice system has broken down for Jamie Leigh Jones and other female contractors sexually assaulted in Iraq by their coworkers. 
   In June 2005, nearly 3 years ago, Jamie Leigh Jones was drugged and gang raped by her KBR coworkers in Iraq. After 2 1/2 years and no real answers from our own government agencies, Jamie decided to go public in hopes of finding the answers and getting justice. She testified before the House Judiciary Committee in December of last year. And despite Jamie's experiences and the national attention that this issue garnered, nothing changed in Iraq. There continues to be a hostile living and working environment for female contractors that are Americans working overseas for American employers. 
   A ``boys will be boys'' atmosphere seems to appear where assaults occur, and then they're covered up. The Department of Justice says it has several active investigations, but it has not prosecuted any contractor for a sexual assault since the invasion of Iraq 5 years ago. 
   The Justice Department has over 200 employees in Baghdad. The question is, what are they doing? Why aren't they prosecuting crimes by Americans against Americans? There are 180,000 civilian workers in Iraq; not all of those people are good folks, some of them have committed crimes, but yet not one of them has been prosecuted for an assault that has occurred. These assailants remain free and unaccountable while the victims continue to suffer. 
   And yet there is more. This week we learned of another victim. She identified herself this morning at the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations as Dawn Lemon. Dawn Lemon's story is brutal. She went to Iraq as a KBR contractor. She was stationed in the hostile red zone as a paramedic. She awoke in January of 2008, just 3 months ago, to the sound of incoming rocket attacks. But when she woke up, she was naked in a chair, covered in blood and feces. She had feces in her mouth. She found a U.S. soldier lying naked in the bed next to her with his clothes and his gun on the floor. All she could remember was screaming at this unknown soldier that was laying on top of her. She sought help from a KBR colleague, thinking that he would save her, but he didn't. As a soldier anally raped her, her KBR colleague forced her to perform oral sex on him. And when Dawn told her KBR supervisor about the incident, she was told to be quiet. When she reported the incident to the camp's military liaison, she was told again not to say anything. 
   In order to leave Iraq, Dawn had to cooperate with KBR. She had to sign documents agreeing not to discuss the rape in public. She decided to send those documents via e-mail to an attorney in the United States, but 20 minutes after she sent those documents Army investigators showed up and confiscated her computer. They were obviously tracking her e-mail communications. 
   Before she left Iraq on leave, she was assigned to sleep guarded by two Army Criminal Investigative Division officials to keep her safe. Her alleged assailants, however, were in the same camp, but they roamed freely, doing what they wished. 
   As the Federal Government agencies refuse to take responsibility and implement change and as these agencies have continued to pass the buck back and forth, still, nothing has occurred in these cases. There are no jurisdictional problems. The law exists to prosecute these individuals in Iraq, and these laws have been applicable for some time. There is nothing but excuses from our government agencies for failure to prosecute these criminals. 
   We knew in December that Jamie Leigh Jones was not alone. Three years later, this is still occurring. Dawn Lemon now joins a growing number of female contractors who have been sexually assaulted in Iraq by their coworkers. 
   Justice has failed these women. Is our government hiding these crimes? Why don't companies like KBR cooperate rather than stonewall these investigations? 
   Mr. Speaker, we will find the answers to these questions, I assure you. Victims like Jamie Leigh Jones and Dawn are to be admired for coming forward. Our duty is to protect them and their rights. We can do no less because, Mr. Speaker, justice is the one thing we should always find, even in Iraq. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, free speech is under attack again. This time the so-called U.N. Human Rights Council passed a resolution encouraging the criminalization of freedom of expression by the U.N. chief spokesman on speech. Egypt and Pakistan proposed the anti-speech resolution. What it does is promote specific criminal restrictions on individuals in the world who criticize or make negative comments about Islam. 
   According to the International World Tribune, ``Muslim countries have been demanding world limits on free speech ever since a Danish magazine published those not-so-flattering cartoons of Mohammad.'' So now the U.N. Human Rights Council wants to limit the human rights of free speech and religious discourse. Of course, this limit only applies to those who criticize one specific religion, Islam. Muslims are still permitted to bash Christians, Jews and Hindus.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (NATIONAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION SYSTEM ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   This legislation will turn 26 million acres of land, the same size of all of New England, or 16 States, that are now in the Western part of the United States into vast tracks that will be walled off from almost all human use to the United States except illegals. And here is the reason I say that. 
   This bill is nothing more than another land grab by the Federal Government to restrict land use in America. Under current law, the Border Patrol is prohibited from patrolling these areas in the West and the Southwest. Remember, we are talking about the size of New England. And they are prohibited from doing so because of current law. And this measure will make it actually worse. All in the name of protecting the environment, we are going to restrict land use by our Border Patrol and American citizens. 
   Here is part of the problem that is already occurring on current land that we are trying to protect the environment from. This is a place called ``Amnesty Highway'' in Arizona where illegals come through the United States in an area where the Border Patrol cannot patrol with their vehicles. They are dumping all kinds of garbage and then moving into the vastness of the United States. This bill should be called the ``Illegal Immigrants Paradise Land Act'' because the area in question under this act will be a safe haven for illegal immigrants. In fact, just 2 months ago in the Tucson Weekly, it reported rampant illegal immigrant activity in Arizona's Ironwood Forest National Monument, that is this area right here, an estimated 180,000-acre preserve managed already by the Federal Government. People in Arizona call this the ``Amnesty Trail,'' the ``Amnesty Highway.'' The article reports that probably hundreds of illegals a week make it into the Ironwood area because of the ``Amnesty Trail.'' Areas that were once pristine wilderness now resemble dump yards because of the illegals already coming into this area. This bill will make this problem worse. In Arizona's Ironwood National Monument, 2 tons of trash left by illegal immigrants is removed every week. Trash like this that we see. 
   Federal land management officials can't even do their job now, and they want to restrict use of this land to Americans. In fact, for several weeks last year, Land Management officials did not even enter this area because three people were found executed. Supposedly they were illegals coming into the United States, maybe drug dealers. 
   So why doesn't the government do something about this problem and resolve this problem before we restrict the use of land in America to Americans? Almost all the lands included under current law have prohibitions against Border Patrol and law enforcement officials performing regular patrols by vehicles. And as I said, this bill will make the problem worse. 
   This other photograph is on the same trail, the ``Amnesty Trail.'' It is not a very good photograph, but it is taken with a telephoto lens. It shows a vehicle bringing in approximately 40 to 50 people in a pickup truck coming from south of the border into the United States, presumably illegals, traveling the highway that the Border Patrol is not even allowed to travel with their vehicles. 
   So it is important that we, for several reasons, don't pass this legislation. You know, the Border Patrol cannot protect the land, so the smugglers and the illegals have a sanctuary area in our national landscape. So much for protecting the environment. What we don't hear is that the Ironwood National Forest Monument is part of the largest human trafficking corridor in the world. Even government officials now acknowledge that there is a human trafficking problem in this area. They admit that smugglers are bringing people further north every year, giving them drugs and then abandoning them on this monument land where many of them die of starvation. So naturally, this is where all the drug runners and human traffickers go into the Arizona area.

   Mr. POE. What our government ought to be doing is opening up these lands to our law enforcement, so they can protect our Nation rather than putting another layer of Federal bureaucracy on these lands, which is what this legislation does. This bill does nothing to protect our lands, but makes our lands more susceptible to the land invasion by coyotes and drug smugglers. 
   There is a border crisis occurring on Federal land, and this bill ought to address that issue instead of making this bad situation worse.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (TO RENT OR NOT TO RENT TO ILLEGALS -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, the citizens of Farmers Branch, Texas, voted overwhelmingly to make it a crime for landlords to rent to people illegally in the United States, fining landlords $500 a day. The people have spoken. They want only citizens and legal immigrants to live in the city. 
   Oh, but some landlords object. I find this odd. It is illegal to be in the United States without permission. It is illegal to hire illegals that are in the United States without permission. So if illegals aren't supposed to be here in the first place or work here, it is only logical they shouldn't be able to rent here. 
   In spite of this new law, some landlords want to take this American city to court and demand that they, these money-grabbing landlords, be able to rent to the illegals. 
   This is perplexing. The Federal Government doesn't adequately protect the border or prosecute or deport illegals, so cities like Farmers Branch, Texas, are simply trying to make their city a sanctuary city for Americans and legal immigrants. And good for them. 
   But who knows what the Supreme Court will do. Let's see if in the name of the almighty dollar these rogue businessmen will convince the Supreme Court that illegals should be able to rent property, even though they are illegally on the land they are renting.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, as we begin the debate on Iraq today, I have received input from Brian in Humble, Texas. He says, ``I am a veteran of Vietnam. My father is a veteran of World War II, Korea and Vietnam. I have four brothers that are veterans, and my oldest son is serving his fourth tour of duty in Iraq. If winning in Iraq takes more resources, it is far better than the alternatives. You owe the young men and women, and yes, my son in harm's way, your total support.'' 
   The cost of our security does not come without a price. The alternatives, the loss of American freedoms and security and leaving Iraq before our duty is done, is not the option. If more troops are needed, then it is our duty to supply them. 
   What message does this Nation send its heroes deep within the belly of combat to tell them no troops are coming to their aid? This leaves those left behind stranded without the resources in front of a deadly enemy. 
   Mr. Speaker, the words of this veteran, whose family holds a proud history of service to America, are wise words. This Nation owes its gratitude and support to its U.S. soldiers fighting to protect our interests; otherwise, we will be judged to be the ungrateful Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (EYE ON THE SUPREME COURT -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, last week hundreds of citizens stood in the first snow of winter in Washington, D.C. for 2 hours, hoping to get a coveted seat in the United States Supreme Court building to see the oral arguments on the case of the detainees in Guantanamo prisoner of war camp and what rights, if any, they have under our Constitution; however, the Supreme Court gallery has a mere 50 seats for spectators. 
   One of those would-be viewers was a lawyer on my staff, Gina Santucci. I wanted her there to find out more about the case and take notes. But she, like most of the people in line, never got in to see the arguments. There was no room in the room. Those that were allowed into the proceedings were only permitted to stay 5 minutes before they had to leave and make room for other people in the room. 
   Public interest in what takes place in the Supreme Court is a good thing. It is important that Americans are concerned about what occurs in the Supreme Court, and citizens want to observe the most powerful court in action anywhere in the world. But most Americans will never have this opportunity to see the questions asked by the Justices of the Supreme Court or to hear the arguments over the meaning of our Constitution or hear constitutional cases that will go down in history. 
   Earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 1299 to allow television cameras to televise Supreme Court proceedings. Since then, both the House and the Senate Judiciary Committees have heard arguments as to why cameras should be allowed inside the Supreme Court. 
   Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee marked up Senator Specter's bill to allow cameras in the Supreme Court. Some Senators were concerned that the Department of Justice opposed this bill. Justice Department opposed this bill because they say they want to protect the ``collegial environment'' of the Court. I don't mean to intrude on what a ``collegial environment'' is, but what is it? 
   I thought the business before the Supreme Court is a matter the American people have an interest in, not just the college of lawyers that appear before the court. 
   We have cameras in these House Chambers, and I never thought about whether the camera here on the House floor affects the collegiality between the fellow representatives that we work with. Most of us hardly notice the camera at all. And today's cameras are so small and unobtrusive, they are not noticed. They don't affect our daily routine here in the House, but they allow Americans across the vastness of the fruited plain to tune in to see what their government is up to every day. 
   Now, I doubt if the Supreme Court TV channel will win the fall sweeps, but it will allow Americans who live in the 50 States to observe the oral arguments that take place. Some say they are against cameras in the courtroom because attorneys play to the camera and try to impress the viewing audience. 
   Madam Speaker, attorneys don't play to the camera, they play to the jury. I know because I played to the jury for 8 years as a prosecutor in Texas. However, there isn't even a jury to impress in the Supreme Court. In fact, there really isn't a time to grandstand in the Supreme Court. Oral arguments in the Supreme Court involve the best appellate attorneys in the country, facing a spew of questions from nine Justices who are asking a barrage of legal questions to these lawyers making them justify their legal positions on their case. 
   I only explain how the oral arguments work in the Supreme Court because most Americans are unaware of the proceedings and the procedures since they don't have the opportunity to view Supreme Court oral arguments personally. Unless there are cameras, Americans will never have the chance to see what takes place in a courtroom, the most powerful courtroom in the whole world, the Supreme Court courtroom. 
   I know cameras can be placed in a courtroom without disruption or distraction because I did it. For 22 years,  I served as a felony court judge in Houston, Texas. I heard over 25,000 criminal cases and a thousand jury trials. Some of those were filmed by the TV media. I even televised a capital murder trial. My rules were simple and always obeyed by the media: No filming of rape victims, children, the jury, or certain other witnesses. The camera filmed what the jury saw and heard. And, Madam Speaker, I had no problem with the media at all. We need to let the public see a real trial in progress, and cameras have made that possible. 
   Americans have the right to watch Supreme Court proceedings in person. We have the best judicial system ever created in the history of the world. Why not prove it by filming these proceedings? Americans should not be deprived of the right to observe just because they cannot physically sit in the Supreme Court courtroom. It is time to remove the veil of secrecy from the hallowed halls of the Supreme Court and allow cameras to film these important proceedings. 
   Justice would be better served if we open the doors to the Supreme Court to cameras because justice is the one thing we should always find. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 842, as amended, expressing sympathy and support for the victims of Cyclone Sidr in southern Bangladesh. At the outset, I would like to commend the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman) for introducing this timely measure, and also extend my appreciation to Chairman Lantos, as well as Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for helping to expedite its consideration before the House today.  
   As my colleagues may know, on the 15th of November a powerful, category five-equivalent tropical cyclone struck low-lying areas of Bangladesh from the Bay of Bengal. Mr. Speaker, in the West we call these tropical storms hurricanes, and in the Far East they call them cyclones. Be that as it may, they both have destructive power. Being from southeast Texas on the gulf coast, we call the area ``hurricane alley,'' and we are not unfamiliar with hurricanes. Even this year, Hurricane Humberto, and Hurricane Rita 2 years ago hit my area of the State of Texas. 
   So, the effects of hurricanes and cyclones are devastating. The effects of Cyclone Sidr has been extremely devastating to the people. Some 6.8 million people have been affected by this disaster, 3,000 people have died, 1,000 people are unaccounted for, and approximately 15,000 people have been injured. In the immediate aftermath of this storm, President and Mrs. Bush offered condolences to the victims, especially those who lost loved ones, people who lost homes and livelihoods in this tragedy. 
   The United States immediately conveyed to the authorities in Dhaka its willingness to assist in responding to this natural disaster. The United States Agency for International Development provided more than $19 million in emergency funds to support relief and early recovery activities, including shelter and water, sanitation, hygiene programs and emergency food assistance. The United States Department of Defense has also provided invaluable assistance, with 2,400 United States marines and sailors helping the Bangladesh Government provide clean water, medical aid, food, and other relief supplies to the victims of this cyclone. Indeed, more than 162,000 pounds of relief supplies have been delivered to Bangladesh by USS Kearsarge and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit as of early this month. 
   Mr. Speaker, Bangladesh and the United States have been close friends since 1971. Our hearts go out to those who have suffered so grievously during this disaster, and on behalf of the American people it is fitting that we reiterate our commitment to assist the people of Bangladesh as they recover from this devastating storm, and I urge support of this resolution.

   I am pleased to rise in support of H. Res. 708, which honors the life and accomplishments of Luciano Pavarotti and recognizes the significant and positive impact of his amazing and astounding musical talent, his achievement in raising the profile of opera with audiences around the world and his commitment to charitable causes. 
   On September 6th of this year, a legend of the opera would take his final curtain call. When the great Luciano Pavarotti passed away in September, the world lost one of its most beautiful voices. Those with a love of all kinds of music, everyone from opera singers to instrumentalists and pop singers, grieved at the loss of such a great talent. One of those musicians, the rock singer Bono of the group U2, described Pavarotti as, and I quote, ``a great volcano of a man who sang fire but spilled over with a love of life in all its complexity.'' 
   From the time that he made his first debut in 1961, Luciano Pavarotti was an inspiration, not just for the unmatched quality of God-given voice and talent, but for his generosity. Indeed, he used immense talent to raise funds for many worthy causes, including his concerts on behalf of refugees throughout the world. 
   In 1998, he was named United Nations Messenger of Peace. In 2001, the same year that he received the Kennedy Center Honors, he received a medal from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for his fundraising efforts on behalf of refugees throughout the world. 
   In memory of this giant man of music, beloved by all those who enjoy the great opera, I ask my colleagues to join in supporting H. Res. 708, introduced by our colleague from California, Ms. Loretta Sanchez.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the freedom of religion is under attack in Great Britain. 
   Last week British news reported that the daughter of a British Imam, we will call her Hannah, is living under police protection after receiving death threats from her father and brother because she converted to Christianity. 
   Hannah was born in Britain to immigrant Pakistani parents. She renounced the Muslim faith when she was a teenager and has been in hiding for over 10 years. 
   After multiple death threats and an attempt on her life by 40 men, led by her father, brandishing axes, hammers, and knives, Hannah has sought protection from the British Government. 
   According to her, her father believes that the Koran teaches that anyone who walks away from Islam should be killed. Well, murder is bad enough, but murder in the name of religion is worse, and it's legal, at least in a free state where all religions are to be tolerated, even Christianity. 
   Democracy values the freedom of other people's faith; it does not restrict it. That is the difference in a democracy and a government that is controlled by a religion.

   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased, as original cosponsor, to rise in support of this  timely resolution recognizing the significance of Christmas and the contribution of the Christian faith to the United States and to other nations throughout the world. While Christmas does not have the same religious meaning for all citizens, it nevertheless invokes the values of friendship and goodwill that are common to all nations. 
   December 25, or Christmas, as we say, commemorates a birth that influenced the world in an unmatched way. Christ's life, his teachings, his example, his sacrifice, and his death brought to life one of the great religions of the world, one which underpins the foundations of democracy in our own United States of America and even other countries throughout the world. 
   Even in complex times such as those in which we live at this time, the simple central message of Christianity endures: ``love thy neighbor as thyself.'' 
   For many, Christmas invokes the images of Santa Claus and exchanging of gifts. This comes from the patron St. Nicholas, who helped poor children hundreds of years ago by giving them presents. But Christianity is more. It is the birth of the Christian religion and commemorates the birth of its founder, Jesus, on Christmas day. 
   At its core are the fundamental important ideals of ``Peace on Earth, Goodwill toward men.'' The poor, the suffering, those left alone or far from their families, and those departed who were dear to us whom we remember from time to time are all recognized in this great religion of Christianity, and, through it, all have been offered hope. 
   At this time of year in this season of Christmas, I ask my colleagues to join in supporting House Resolution 847 introduced by our colleague, Mr. King of Iowa, recognizing the importance of Christmas and the Christian faith.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the world was rightfully shocked and outraged this past fall by reports of midnight raids on temples in Burma and televised images of monks and other peaceful demonstrators being shot down on the streets and arrested. 
   Appeals for human decency and restraint have fallen on deaf ears with regard to Burma's generals. It is thus time to send them a message that they understand, a message that is loud and clear. 
   The international community must no longer subsidize the leaders of this immoral regime by trading in the commodities they peddle on international markets. This rainbow coalition of contraband products for sale by the military junta has included red rubies, white opium, green jade and brown timber. 
   The legislation put forward today sends a simple, but clear and strong message: It will not be business as usual for the people in Rangoon until they stop their suppression of their own people in the nation of Burma. 
   Is there any Member here today who has any doubts about making economic sanctions against the current Rangoon regime permanent and hard hitting? This legislation has the full support of leaders of the American gem industry. They have seen the necessity of putting principle ahead of money and profit when it comes to the actions of the Burmese rogue regime. 
   And this legislation also seeks to put the blame squarely on the backs of those who have earned it, the ruling generals and their families, and not on the backs of the Burmese people who have already suffered too much. 
   It calls for frozen bank accounts for the generals, an ending to money laundering by the ruling junta, and no visas to the United States for those involved in the continuing acts of repression and no visas for their immediate families. 
   The urgency with which we are here today in view of this issue of the restoration of the democratic rights to the people of Burma is demonstrated by the fact that already over 240 Members of this House of Representatives have agreed to cosponsor legislation giving official Congressional recognition to Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and Burma democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi. 
   H.R. 4286, introduced December 5 by Mr. Manzullo and Mr. Crowley, would award a Congressional Gold Medal to Aung San Suu Kyi in recognition of her courageous and unwavering commitment to peace, nonviolence, human rights, and democracy in Burma. 
   There is no clearer indication than this legislation of the solidarity that exists between the people of the United States and the good people of Burma on the issues of human rights and democracy. 
   This legislation is also fully in keeping with administration policy. In a statement made on October 19, following the latest series of bloody and tragic events, President Bush announced an executive order imposing additional sanctions on Burmese leaders and entities. The President also instructed the Commerce Department to tighten export control and regulation over Burma. On that occasion, the President noted that ``Burmese leaders continue to defy the world's just demands to stop their vicious persecution. They continue to dismiss calls to begin peaceful dialogue aimed at national reconciliation. Most of all, they continue to reject the clear will of the Burmese people who wish to live in freedom under leaders of their choosing.'' 
   The President concluded with these observations: ``The people of Burma are showing great courage in the face of immense repression. They are appealing for our help. We must not turn a deaf ear to their cries. I believe no nation can forever suppress its own people. And we are confident that the day is coming when freedom's tide will reach the shores of Burma.'' 
   This legislation provides an opportunity to send a strong, bipartisan and loud message that where human freedom is concerned, politics does stop at the water's edge. 
   I rise today to urge my colleagues to join in voicing their enthusiastic support for a free Burma by supporting the Block Burmese JADE Act of 2007.

   The cloud of defeatism grows larger and larger in Washington, D.C. Numerous pieces of legislation have been introduced in this House, from outright retreat and withdrawal to letting Congress become the generals of the war.

The third choice seems to be the wisest.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, a young 8-year-old-girl in Florida is kidnapped, raped and buried alive under a large concrete slab by an illegal. 
   A decorated Houston police officer is shot in the back four times and murdered by an illegal. A Texas State trooper was shot six times at point-blank range and left for dead at the side of the road by an illegal. 
   ``The Railroad Killer,'' a violent predator who terrorized, stalked, raped and murdered 12 victims along the Texas railroads, an illegal. One study indicates that there are nearly 240,000 illegals who are sex offenders in the United States. They commit a total of one million crimes. These illegals create millions of victims who seek treatment and aid because they are victims. 
   The United States does a good job of taking care of crime victims. We have created crime compensation funds in States, programs that aid in the recovery and help with the cost of treatment, but the cost is paid by America. 
   Many victims are never compensated, however, and spend their life in pain and even in poverty. So why should not the country of the illegal pay for this crime as well? Countries who encourage the criminals to invade the United States should be held just as responsible as illegal perpetrators. 
   U.S. victims, Mr. Speaker, should be allowed to seek monetary compensation from the country the illegal came from. News sources report that a 2006 FBI report on undocumented illegals found that 95 percent of the murder warrants in Los Angeles are for illegals; 83 percent in Phoenix; 86 percent, Albuquerque. Seventy-five percent of those on the most-wanted lists in L.A., Phoenix and Albuquerque are illegals. 
   A recent Department of Justice study concluded that criminal illegals, once arrested, are likely to be rearrested six more times for other crimes. They are preying on innocent victims in the United States, both citizens and legal immigrants. When they are caught, some of them even flee back to their country. 
   These countries should be held liable for the crimes that their citizens commit. A victim of crime by an illegal should be entitled to receive damages from the country which encourages illegal entry into the United States. Many countries, such as Mexico, Brazil, El Salvador, encourage their citizens to illegally enter the United States. Because of that, these nations should be held financially responsible for the crimes of their citizens, and victims should be allowed to have a cause of action in American Federal courts against these nations. 
   Now, we know many times that these nations probably will not pay for that compensation for whatever reason. They just do not pay. If that is the case, then the victims should be allowed to apply through the State Department Foreign Aid Fund that we give these nations, like Mexico, and then receive just compensation, the compensation that they were awarded in Federal court. 
   Victims should not have to continue to pay for the crimes of illegals. Their nations must pay. Illegals and their nations should be accountable and held accountable for the failure by coming into the United States illegally. 
   Americans seem to always pay for illegal entry; those days need to end, and this is one way where countries should pay for the crimes of their illegals by compensating American crime victims and citizens or people that are here legally from other nations. 
   Mr. Speaker, that's just the way it is.

   According to news sources, the Federal prosecutor hid evidence at that trial that was beneficial to the border agent, such as the Federal Government had made deals and gave benefits to witnesses like Social Security cards, and the prosecutor had not revealed the criminal record of a witness. 
   Does this sound familiar to anyone? Anyway, Sipe was granted a new trial and last week a second jury, after hearing all of the facts and the truth, found the border agent not guilty. 
   Why does it seem our Federal Government is so zealous in prosecuting border agents who appear to be doing their job and give those who illegally enter the United States a free pass? Once again, it seems like the Federal Government is on the wrong side of the border war.

   Law enforcement officers are a special type of people. They put on the uniform and the badge of a law officer. They swear an oath to uphold the law of our land and vow to protect the citizens of all communities. 
   In carrying out their duties, law enforcement officers are routinely subjected to threats against their personal safety. According to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, more than 56,000 law enforcement officers are assaulted every year in the line of duty. They are subjected to being slapped, punched, kicked, bit, stabbed, and even shot by suspects. And this does not include what could happen in the course of high-speed chases that occur throughout our country. 
   Most of these peace officers that are assaulted walk away from that fight with minor injuries and the suspect generally is carted off to jail in handcuffs. There are those community protectors, however, that aren't as fortunate, because they give their lives in the line of duty. 
   Since the first recorded police department death in 1792, over 17,900 peace officers have been killed while performing the duty of a law officer somewhere in this great country. Statistics show that every 53 hours a law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty. Last year, 2006, 143 officers were killed in the line of duty. 
   We all remember September 11 and what occurred on that day, how many of us watched on television when those planes hit the World Trade Center, when they hit the Pentagon; how thousands of people, good people, as soon as that terror hit those buildings, those people were running as fast as they could to get away from that danger. 
   But there was another group of people, not very many, but they were there running as fast as they could to get to the danger, and those were the people who wear the badge. That also included our firefighters and our emergency medical technicians. Seventy-two of those peace officers that ran to those buildings that were being assaulted from the air were killed in the line of duty that one day. 
   Of course, it strikes all communities, even our community down in Beaumont, Texas, and the Beaumont Police Department and its recent tragedy of a peace officer killed in the line of duty. Last week, this community suffered the loss of one of their own, Officer Lisa Beaulieu, the first female peace officer in southeast Texas that has been killed in the line of duty. 
   She was a 6-year veteran of the Beaumont Police Department. She was on patrol by herself at 1 a.m. when she responded to the scene of a motorcycle accident in Beaumont. As she got out of her vehicle and started directing traffic, a drunk driver slammed into her, throwing her over the side of the freeway and killing her. It was a tragic end for a peace officer that loved to protect the people of our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, during the time that I was a judge in Texas for over 22 years, I encountered many, many peace officers who wore the badge, and proudly did so; and I considered those peace officers who would do that, that cross over the line to represent the rest of us and protect us, a rare and noble bleed. 
   So on Tuesday, May 15, thousands of local, State and Federal peace officers will gather across the Nation to remember their fellow officers. Known as National Peace Officers Memorial Day, established by President Kennedy in 1962, the day serves as a tribute to the men and women who daily put themselves in harm's way to ensure the safety and security of our country and our Nation. The flags will be lowered at half mast and ceremonies will be held across the entire country. 
   The national memorial ceremony is held right here on the lawn of the United States Capitol, where the President of the United States, thousands of law enforcement officers, and Members of Congress will be there. Those officers that are in attendance, their badges will be draped in black as a remembrance of their fellow officers who were killed in the line of duty. 
   Law enforcement officers are the first line of defense between law-abiding citizens and those who violate the law. They are public servants who dedicate their time and their lives to protect us. They wear the badge of courage with pride, and we as a Nation need to honor them for their service of the American people. 
   I hope that our Congress, these folks in this body, will pass this legislation as fast as possible.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, as the USS Cole patrolled the seas around Yemen, a boat piloted by al-Qaeda international criminals drew near to the Navy destroyer and bombed the ship. On that day in the year 2000, 17 American soldiers were murdered. 
   The families of these 17 soldiers are now suing the Sudanese Government for damages. Why? Because the Sudan funded and provided training for these terrorists. The Sudanese Government is outraged that they should be held financially responsible. However, a U.S. Federal court judge disagrees and is allowing the victims' families to continue their pursuit. 
   Sudan is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to dismiss this unique lawsuit. But the Supreme Court must allow this case to proceed and the victims to obtain justice. Sudan fed the terrorist cells that attacked the Cole. They gave them safe harbor and let them exist. 
   U.S. citizens murdered by international terrorists overseas must be able to seek damages from the country responsible for the crime. The message to these nations that sponsor terror, you too will pay for your sins when you sponsor international outlaws.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, crimes against children continue to be a crisis in our civilized communities. How society reacts to such crimes is a reflection on the value or lack of value it places on children. 
   Recently, a 10-year-old girl was raped in Australia by nine males. The victim and the nine rapists were all native-born Aboriginals. The nine deviants were captured, and all nine admitted their guilt. So what did the Australian judge do to these criminals? Well, none of them went to prison. All of them received a suspended sentence, and the judge made the absurd comment at the trial that the 10-year-old girl ``probably agreed to have sex with the perpetrators.'' I wonder what sentence the female judge would have imposed on the nine had the 10-year-old girl been of European descent. A prominent Aboriginal leader said he believed that ``the chronic leniency toward offenders contributes to the abuse of Aboriginal children.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, a society is judged not by the way it treats the powerful or the rich, but how it treats the weakest among its people, like 10-year-old little girls. The judge in this case is a new member of the Judges Hall of Shame. And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the speech police are at it again. This time they want to police and control the radio airwaves. I'm not talking about the former Soviet Union that controlled what Russians listened to on the radio, I'm talking about the American speech police. 
   Radio shows that air conservative ideas in the free enterprise market seem to be listened to by more Americans than those that listen to liberal ideas. I don't know why that is, but it happens. So some don't like that. They say it's just not fair. So they want to force the private radio stations, with the use of the government speech police, to air ideas that are liberal as well as conservative. They call this nonsense the ``fairness doctrine.'' 
   It is actually totalitarian state control of speech. And what does ``fair'' mean? Fair means different things to different folks. In some places in the country like Texas, fair is where you take your chickens to. That's why the word ``fair'' is not in the Constitution. The Constitution protects free speech, not fair speech. It says Congress--that's us, folks--shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. And the Constitution applies to the thieves of free speech and the government's speech police whether they like it or not.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (RAPE OF A LITTLE GIRL -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, she was 8 years old. She was asleep in her own room, in her bed dreaming about whatever little girls dream about. She thought she was safe in her home. Suddenly she was awakened by the demon from the night. Patrick Kennedy of Louisiana was on top of her, having his way with her, this petite little angel. Kennedy was someone the little girl supposedly could trust; after all, he was her stepfather. 
   This little girl was raped. So violent was the rape she fainted and the next thing she remembered she woke up in an ambulance speeding to Children's Hospital. 
   Official court records state, ``When police arrived, they found the victim on her bed wearing a T-shirt and wrapped in a bloody blanket. She was bleeding profusely from the vaginal area. The victim was transported to Children's Hospital. An expert in pediatric forensic medicine testified that the victim's injuries were the most severe he had ever seen from a sexual assault in his years of practice. A laceration to the left wall of the vagina separated her cervix from the back of her vagina, causing her rectum to protrude into the vaginal structure. The injuries required her to have emergency surgery.'' 
   The little girl survived this attack by the barbarian and lives, even though she has been sentenced to a life of mental torture, physical pain and emotional trauma that she may not ever recover from. Her physical scars will never disappear. 
   The child rapist was tried under Louisiana's law that specifically allows for the death penalty for criminals that choose to rape the most innocent among us, children. The law was passed by the legislature, signed by the Governor and is the wish of the people of Louisiana. A jury of 12 citizens heard the facts and they all agreed that Kennedy should die for his decision to rape his daughter. Several other states, including Texas, have the death penalty as a possible punishment for child rapists. 
   This case has been reviewed by numerous courts, and has taken 5 years to reach our Supreme Court. 
   In a decision this week by Justice Anthony Kennedy--no relation--the Supreme Court said the Louisiana law is just too severe and overruled the will of the people of Louisiana and a unanimous jury when he imposed his own moral code saying no one can be executed under these circumstances unless the villain also kills the child, otherwise it is a violation of the cruel and unusual provision of the United States Constitution. 
   Although the jury was unanimous in ordering the death penalty, the Supreme Court split in its decision 5-4 with the majority siding with the evil-doer. 
   Justice Kennedy focused on the fact that the victim survived the assault as the reason not to execute the rapist. In other words, the defendant got a break because the little girl had the will to survive. 
   When I was on the trial bench in Texas, I had a rape victim once tell me that rape was a fate worse than death. In the eyes of this little girl, she probably agrees. 
   When the ``cruel and unusual'' phrase was put in the Constitution, it was put there and based on constitutional history to outlaw torture and maiming of criminals. As history reflects, States decided what was appropriate punishment based upon these guidelines. 
   The five justices who sided with the rapist don't seem to have lived in the real world or have real life experiences. They don't seem to provide justice for victims, only leniency for criminal defendants. 
   I spent 22 years on the felony trial bench in Texas and heard over 20,000 cases. The Constitution was the basis for every decision I made. I saw those charged with the worst acts people can commit, and I saw the brutalized victims of crime. I only mention this experience because trial judges see the world as it really is, not how we wish and hope it to be. Trial judges see real people every day. 
   Unfortunately, eight of our nine Supreme Court justices do not have the benefit of this experience and have never been a trial judge and seen the effects of crime on people. They have spent much of their time in elite ivory palaces as law school professors and appellate judges removed from the world, second-guessing legislatures, trial judges and juries. 
   I doubt if Justice Kennedy has ever been to Louisiana or talked to a rape victim or a rapist, or a jury, for that matter. Now Justice Kennedy says the verdict of death is just too cruel and unusual for us that live in a sophisticated society to allow. His ruling is a misinterpretation of the Constitution. 
   Justice Alito said in his dissent that the death penalty laws should be allowed for child rape ``if they reflect society's evolving standards of decency.'' The State of Louisiana set the evolving standard for child rapists in Louisiana, and said leave our children alone or face the death penalty. 
   Society's standard was trumped by five black-robed justices who want it their way. They are wrong. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, for the last 5 years, civilians Keith Stansell, Thomas Howes, and Marc Gonsalves have been held hostage and bound by chains in the jungles of Colombia. Their captors were the Communist thugs: FARC. 
   The three American captors lived in constant fear and squalor along with hundreds of other hostages, mostly Colombians. These three men were held longer than any other American citizens currently being held captive in the world. 
   They also had 5 years of their lives stolen from them. During the last 5 years, they were unaware of most world events, including the birth of Stansell's twins, the invasion of Iraq, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Red Sox breaking the curse and winning the World Series, gasoline prices tripling, and the University of Texas defeating Southern Cal in the Rose Bowl for the National Championship. 
   FARC is an insurgent terrorist group that funds its activities by working with the drug cartels and kidnapping people and holding them for ransom. 
   But thanks to the people and the Government of Colombia, the three Americans and 20 others were rescued from the outlaws in a stealth, covert operation. We are glad the Americans are home, and our gratitude goes to the people of Colombia.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE KILLER OF BORDER AGENT LUIS AGUILAR IS RELEASED -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, in January, Border Patrol Agent Luis Aguilar was tracking drug smugglers on the Mexican-U.S. border. A Hummer apparently carrying drugs crossed into the United States and tried to flee back to Mexico when Aguilar and other Border Patrol agents gave pursuit. Aguilar got in front of the Hummer at some distance and he put spikes in the road of retreat, but the Hummer, rather than go over the spikes, drove off the road, ran over and killed Aguilar, and fled back to Mexico. 
   The driver was Jesus Navarro Montes. And he fled to Mexico, ditched the Hummer with some friends, but was arrested by Mexican authorities 3 days later and charged with certain offenses.     
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the facts get a little messy. Montes is the only suspect in the murder of Aguilar, but he has recently been released from jail in Mexico. Some Mexican authorities say he was not in jail for the murder but unrelated smuggling charges. Even so, he was not tried for those charges even though he waited in jail for 6 months. 
   Mexico also says that the United States has failed to file extradition papers from the United States to Mexico requesting the extradition of this individual Montes. Extradition papers are a legal requirement between countries to bring criminals from one country to another. It's been 6 months, Mr. Speaker, and certainly those papers should have been filed some time ago. 
   Our Justice Department, however, refuses to comment on whether extradition was requested or the papers were filed. This is a bit odd and curious why our government won't say whether or not they even filed the appropriate paperwork and what the problem is. Did our government fail to file this simple paperwork? And if so, people in our government ought to be fired. This is inexcusable. And if Mexican authorities released prematurely, Mexico has some explaining to do as well. There is obviously incompetence in somebody's government regarding the release of this individual. 
   Meanwhile Navarro Montes is running lose somewhere in Mexico, laughing at both governments and probably still smuggling drugs into the United States. The Aguilar family still weeps, and they are waiting for justice for the death and murder of their loved one. 
   Mr. Speaker, this ought not to be. Our government should be as concerned about prosecuting drug smugglers that murder American Border Patrol protectors as they are about relentless prosecuting border agents like Ramos and Compean that were doing their job when charged with violating the civil rights of a drug smuggler on the border. We need some answers, Mr. Speaker, and not blissful silence and excuses from our government. Navarro Montes needs a trial so that justice can prevail because justice is what we do in this country. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, it has been 16 months since two of America's border protectors have been locked up in Federal prison in solitary confinement. Ramos and Compean tonight are in two different places in the United States but both are in a Federal penitentiary for enforcing the law that we have entrusted them to enforce on the Texas-Mexico border. 
   Now, we understand that in this case, the case that was based upon the testimony of a drug smuggler that brought drugs worth $750,000 into the United States, the entire Federal Government's case was based upon his testimony. His testimony, when the Federal Government gave him a back-room deal, promised not to prosecute him, let him go back and forth across the Texas-Mexico border, all for his testimony to testify against two border agents, claiming in his testimony that he was unarmed when he was shot fleeing the two border agents a couple of years ago when he brought drugs into the United States. 
   Now, we know that while he was waiting to testify, this star witness, this back-room deal witness, he brought another load of drugs into the United States, and the U.S. Attorney's Office kept that from the jury that was hearing the case against Ramos and Compean. The U.S. Attorney's Office denied for months that that ever occurred, and finally, the truth came out when Members of Congress found out about it. 
   And last week, the drug smuggler, the back-room deal witness, the witness whose testimony was bought at a price of freedom, was convicted in Federal prison for bringing in that load of drugs the U.S. Attorney's Office denied ever occurred. 
   Mr. Speaker, Ramos and Compean were convicted on tainted testimony, testimony that, as the U.S. Attorney's Office admitted before Congress, had some lies in it said by this star, back-room witness. And it's time that these two individuals be pardoned, that their case be reversed, that the next year we find out the truth that the U.S. Attorney's Office hid that second deal. All the while, let's leave the drug dealer in the Federal penitentiary where drug dealers belong.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, gasoline prices keep going up, and Americans want some answers and some action. 
   One reason gasoline is rising is because the U.S. dollar continues to get weaker. The weaker it gets, the more it costs to buy that crude oil from the OPEC monopoly and the dictator of Venezuela. 
   Another reason is the U.S. is the only major nation that ignores its own natural resources. This stubborn, hard-headed Congress refuses to let American oil companies drill offshore. Plus, subsidizing the corn industry to make ethanol has driven world food prices to an all-time high; and now, African nations are even going hungry. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have crude oil in all of these red zones outside the United States. But environmental intimidation and fear tactics prevent drilling in this gold mine of crude. 
   We only drill off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The rest of these red zones don't have a problem taking that crude oil and gasoline, but they say ``No!'' to drilling off their shore.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I come tonight to talk to you, the House, about the murder of two girls. In 1993, two teenage girls were walking home, making sure they got there in time for the curfew. Their names were Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena. 
   As they were headed home, they took a shortcut through the woods, and that mistake cost them their lives. They came in contact with a person by the name of Jose Medellin, who was the gang leader of a group called the Black and Whites. He, along with his fellow gangsters, kidnapped these two girls and brutalized them, sexually assaulted them, tortured them, and then, when they were through having their way after gang raping them, they murdered them, these two teenage girls, Jennifer Ertman, Elizabeth Pena. 
   The Houston Police Department finally caught up with Jose Medellin and his gangsters. They were all tried lawfully in Texas courts. Jose Medellin received the death penalty, along with one other individual who's already been executed. A third individual's on death row waiting to be executed, and two more are serving life sentences in Texas penitentiaries. 
   Jose Medellin, when he was captured, he had in his possession, Mr. Speaker, a watch. It was a Mickey Mouse watch that Jennifer Ertman wore. And he was proud to carry this token of his murder. He bragged about the murder. He confessed to the murder, and a jury of 12 Texans convicted him and gave him the death penalty, which he earned and which he deserved. 
   His case was appealed. It worked its way all the way to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction based upon a complaint about the confession. 
   But during all of this process, 10 years after the conviction, in 2003, the Mexican Government filed a lawsuit against the United States in the World Court. You see, Medellin was illegally in the United States from Mexico. And the Mexican Government claimed that he should have been told by the arresting police officers that he had the right to talk to the Mexican Consulate. 
   Now, the Houston police officers didn't tell him he had the right. They certainly wouldn't have prevented him from having permission to talk to the Mexican Consulate, and he never, at the trial, objected to not being able to talk to the Mexican Consulate. He waited some 10 years until he got to the World Court before his government complained. 
   The World Court ruled in favor of Mexico, and here's where all of the irony begins. After the World Court ruled that the Texas court, or the Texas peace officers should have told him that he had the right to talk to the Mexican Consulate, the President of the United States intervened in this case and told the Texas courts they ought to review this matter; they ought to uphold the ruling of the World Court. And last year, the Texas courts, in all due respect to the administration, told the President he didn't have any authority to tell Texas courts what to do about anything, and they upheld this conviction and ordered him to be executed, this defendant. 
   Tomorrow the Supreme Court of the United States is going to hear this case. They're going to hear this case and have to decide this issue. Does the World Court, when it issues an opinion about a trial that takes place in the State of Texas, or any other State, have authority to tell a court of law in this country that they must overturn a conviction or not? 
   This is a big deal, Mr. Speaker, because, you see, Texas courts, like most  courts in the United States, all courts in the United States, are beholden to the United States Constitution as the supreme law of the land. The supreme law of the land is not the World Court in the Hague. So that's the first decision the Supreme Court's going to have to make; whether or not this is a lawful order by the World Court or whether the Constitution is to be held supreme. 
   Second, they're going to have to decide, does the President of the United States have the authority to order any court to review any case? 
   I hope they rule that he does not because as Ted Cruz said, the lawyer representing the State of Texas tomorrow in this death penalty case, it is not the providence of the President to say what the law is or is not. If this President's assertion of authority is upheld in this case, it opens the door for enormous mischief from Presidents of either party. What might these Presidents be inclined to do if they had the power to flick State laws off the books? 
   It's a big deal. Separation of powers. The judicial branch is independent of the administration, of the executive branch. The executive branch has no authority over the judicial branch. 
   And the third issue, and most importantly, is should this case be reversed because the defendant, according to the World Court, should have had the ability to talk to his consulate or not? 
   Texas courts, and even Federal courts have found that he gave up that right if he had a right by not ever objecting at the trial. 
   Meanwhile, this defendant has been on death row longer than these two girls were alive. Justice must be provided for the victims of this crime, and this horrible case should be upheld by the Supreme Court. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (MEXICAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STAY OUT OF AMERICA'S BUSINESS -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Mexican Government needs to stay out of America's business. Let me explain. 
   Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez of the town of Rocksprings, Texas, Edwards County, the size of Delaware, one of three deputy sheriffs on patrol at any given time in this massive area of west Texas, is on patrol in the middle of the night, and he sees a van with the lights off running a red light. He does what he is supposed to. He attempts to pull the van over. He notices as he approaches the van that numerous people are laying down on the floorboards. 
   As he gets closer, the driver speeds off, turns around and tries to run over Deputy Gilmer Hernandez. Deputy Hernandez pulls out his pistol, blows out two of those tires, and the vehicle finally stops. One passenger in the van was slightly injured, but the people in the van jump out and take off running because they are all illegally in the United States, seven or eight of them.     
   Deputy Hernandez immediately calls the sheriff of the county to show up. The sheriff shows up; he calls the Texas Rangers to make an independent investigation of this shooting. The Texas Rangers--there is probably no finer law enforcement group in the United States, or in the world for that matter--make an independent investigation and determine that Deputy Hernandez acted lawfully and within the law when he fired his weapon. But then the Mexican government gets involved, and in their arrogance, demand in writing from their consulate general to our Federal Government that Deputy Hernandez be prosecuted. And our Federal Government, like the cavalry, shows up later and reinvestigates the case; basically uses the same facts, talks to all of the illegals, and prosecutes Deputy Hernandez for shooting his weapon in self-defense. 
   It is ironic that the consulate general wouldn't even allow our government to talk to the illegals until the consulate general got them all together in a room and apparently got their story straight. And once that happened, they talked to Federal prosecutors, and the Federal prosecutors prosecuted Deputy Hernandez, where they were saying he should have stopped firing his weapon after the van went on by. How ridiculous a statement that is. 
   Deputy Hernandez was convicted, and this week he was sentenced to 1 year and 1 month in the Federal penitentiary. The Federal judge apparently did everything he could to get the lowest possible sentence under the Federal guidelines, even though Deputy Hernandez should not have been prosecuted. The illegals in the van should have been prosecuted. The human smuggler driving the van, he should have been prosecuted. But no, they got a deal; they got green cards to stay in the United States. It seems like our government is prosecuting the wrong people. 
   It is interesting that Deputy Hernandez was also ordered to pay $5,000 to the illegal who was slightly injured. That is nonsense. It is like someone who breaks into your home, you try to stop that person, they are injured in the scuffle, and the next thing you know you have to pay for their injuries when they illegally broke into your home. That is the same thing that Deputy Hernandez is supposed to do under this court order. 
   It sounds to me like the Mexican government ought to be paying restitution. They ought to pay restitution to the American taxpayers for the cost of the illegals that come into the United States and get all the social programs that the rest of us pay for. The Mexican government ought to pay restitution for their drug smugglers that come into the United States, bringing that cancer that has spread across our land. 
   Our Federal Government obviously needs to get on the right side of the border war, and that is the American side of the border war. It is interesting how our Federal Government is so relentless in prosecuting border protectors who are protecting the dignity of this country, doing everything they can to keep people from illegally coming into this country, while our Federal Government gives lip service to border control. Of course that is the  news that the drug smugglers and the illegals like, that our Federal Government prosecutes the border protectors rather than prosecute them. 
   And why does our Federal Government jump when the Mexican government arrogantly demands that our border protectors be prosecuted? Hopefully we are going to find out the answer to that. Who is driving the process, the Mexican government or our own government? And anyway, who cares what the Mexican government thinks, they are irrelevant to border security and what our border protectors do. 
   Mr. Speaker, the border war continues, and the Federal Government needs to get on the right side of the border war because right now they are missing in action. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Even after being stabbed, Cruz, a 15-month rookie with NYPD, was able to shoot and wound the outlaw. 
   When backup arrived, Cruz, with blood spouting from his head, had chased Hernandez down the subway stairs, and was trying to handcuff him. 
   The criminal, Hernandez, was an illegal from Guatemala who had already been deported for assaulting six New Jersey police officers. 
   Our Nation appreciates the relentless work of Officer Cruz and NYPD. 
   And as for the illegal, he should go to jail, be deported back to Guatemala, and Guatemala should pay restitution to Officer Cruz. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the French president addressed a joint session of Congress today, and he, like General Lafayette before him, talked about the American soldier, the warrior's courage, determination, resilience and love of freedom more than life itself. 
   As we approach Veterans Day, French President Nicolas Sarkozy's words are appropriate to show how the world, that has benefited from the American GI, view our military. 
   He said this morning: 
   ``The men and women of my generation heard their grandparents talk about how in 1917 America saved France at a time when it had reached the final limits of its strength. 
   ``The men and women of my generation heard their parents talk about how in 1944 America returned to free Europe from the horrifying tyranny that threatened to enslave it. 
   ``Fathers took their sons to see the vast cemeteries where, under thousands of white crosses so far from home, thousands of young American soldiers lay who had fallen not to defend their own freedom but the freedom of all others, not to defend their own families, their own homeland, but to defend humanity as a whole.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the world's freedom fighter has always been the American soldier.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, in the days of the recent past, when a child was sexually assaulted, the criminal justice system continued to victimize the child, because the victim was bounced all over town relating the story to numerous strangers. 
   Sometimes a child, when interviewed at the police station, actually came in direct contact with the offender. Also, the child could wait for hours in the same county emergency rooms as other victims of stabbings, car wrecks and overdoses. 
   But times have changed. There are over 680 child advocacy centers in the United States, including one in Houston, where victims go when assaulted. At the center are trained police, therapists, doctors and lawyers that are experts in dealing with children. Here the child is helped before the trial, during the trial, and, yes, after trial. 
   The National Children's Alliance, led by Nancy Chandler, is the umbrella organization that helps these 600-plus centers throughout the Nation. All these child crusaders are in Washington this week working to make our land safer for kids. 
   America is grateful to these members of the victims' posse that help protect our greatest resource, children. After all, it shouldn't hurt to be a kid in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the war in Iraq is the most difficult and important issue facing our Nation today. The stakes there are simply too high for us to ignore the consequences of failure. Most military analysts agree that an arbitrary immediate withdrawal from Iraq would spiral that country and the surrounding region into chaos. 
   Failing to secure Iraq will provide a fertile ground for terrorist actions that affect not only Iraq, but America and the rest of the free world. Extremist organizations will tout an American retreat as a major victory for terrorism. Once again saying that America doesn't ever have the stomach to finish a war. Terrorist leaders will make use of a fractured Iraq to train, equip, and provide sanctuary for their forces in much the same way that Afghanistan provided a haven for the Taliban and al Qaeda. Radicals will exploit the anarchy and abandon Iraq and will seek to spread jihadist movements to moderate Arab States. Arbitrary withdrawal will only encourage our enemy. 
   War is hard, but a planned defeat by retreat is hardly an answer to success.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, I am strongly a proponent of this amendment. I represent southeast Texas. We have a TRACON at Houston Intercontinental Airport. We have one in Beaumont, 90 miles away. And I am not convinced that the consolidation of these two TRACONs in Houston is a good idea for safety. 
   I'm also concerned about the fact that we have more and more planes in the air, but yet the FAA wants to have fewer and fewer facilities in the United States to control that aviation. 
   I'm also concerned, as the gentleman from Florida is, about security. Down in southeast Texas, what I represent, I represent the number one refinery in the United States, the number two refinery in the United States. Twenty-two percent of the Nation's aviation fuel is produced in my area.     
   And if there was some tragic event, some terrorist attack on Houston and the Intercontinental Airport, who would be controlling the skies? Some TRACON unit in Oklahoma City and New Mexico? I think not. I think it is good that we have two TRACONs in the area. 
   And, lastly, I am not convinced that this would save any money. Just as we went through with the BRAC military base closures, we are finding that that did not save the taxpayers any money, especially with Ellington Field in Houston. 
   So for all those reasons I think this is a wise amendment for safety and security, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the politics of fear has won the day. The Secretary of Treasury has in essence told the country, ``Give me money and give it to me by the close of the business day or the country is going into the financial abyss.'' 
   His fear tactics have caused the stock markets to tumble, and by putting a financial shotgun to the head of America, he has collected a $700 billion ransom to pay for the financial mistakes of Wall Street. There are two problems: we still don't know what he's going to do with America's money; and second, those who caused this mess are the ones who will profit from their bad gambling debts. 
   These Wall Street elites are free market capitalists until they start making mistakes, and rather than pay, they arrogantly expect Americans who did nothing wrong to pay the cost. 
   Well, I didn't come to Congress to sell out to Wall Street and let Americans be ripped off by intimidation tactics. Americans should not be expected to pay for the sins of the Wall Street money barons. 
   But the bill that passed today benefits a few in New York City; it raises taxes; there is no assurance it will even solve the problem; and the good old American patriot is left holding the bag because of the politics of fear.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, border agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean were the victims of an overzealous and media-hungry Federal prosecutor that seemed to be a political puppet of the Mexican government rather than seeking American justice. 
   While patrolling the border, Ramos and Compean shot an illegal trespasser and drug dealer who was smuggling $1 million worth of dope across our border into Texas. Ironically, the two agents were tried for civil rights violations and sent to prison. 
   Last year, a Federal judge said that the prosecution overreacted in this case. Here is what occurred. The drug dealer was given immunity to testify against the agents, and the bought-and-paid-for witness's testimony, believability, and credibility, was the basis of the entire prosecution. But the prosecutor hid from the jury that the drug smuggler witness continued to bring in drugs into the United States while the trial was pending; and the U.S. attorney has now admitted the back-room-deal witness also lied. 
   Our justice system should free these two border agents because of the lying paid-for witness, and our government needs to get on the right side of the border war.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, U.S. technology in the Nation's defense industry is unsurpassed anywhere in the world. Because of this, our enemies want to steal it, use it against us, or copy it. They want to do it for their own military operations. 
   Private American corporations are to be commended for their expertise in national defense technology development. However, fifth column individuals and businesses that sell this sensitive military equipment to our enemies are nothing more than modern-day Benedict Arnolds and should be treated as such. 
   Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, use night-vision goggles and night-vision rifle scopes to search out and destroy our enemies, but this equipment is being stolen in record numbers by businesses and individuals that are selling out America for that filthy lucre, or money. I think these people need to be treated as the treasonous traitors that they are. 
   According to USA Today, more than 40 businesses or individuals have been charged with stealing or exporting night-vision technology to people who are our enemies. Some charged are alleged to have sent the equipment to Iran, to China and to al Qaeda affiliates. Nations such as China can use reverse technology and copy the highly sensitive equipment and use it for their own benefit. 
   This equipment is also very costly. Each pair of new, high-tech, night-vision goggles cost around $4,500. These goggles help our troops in the desert of the sun and the valley of the gun in Iraq and Afghanistan.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, today the House considers a timely resolution supporting Taiwan's fourth direct and democratic presidential elections which will take place in just a few weeks. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this resolution. 
   In 1979, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which caused our Government to consider Taiwan in nearly all respects a sovereign partner. President Ronald Reagan reinforced this stance in 1982 when he publicly reiterated the US position regarding Taiwan's sovereignty. Since that time, the United States and Taiwan have enjoyed increasingly close relations, and our two countries maintain a strong strategic alliance. Today Taiwan remains one of the strongest democratic allies of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region. 
   The United States and Taiwan share a common vision of freedom and democracy. Since Taiwan's first democratic presidential election in 1998, Taiwan has successfully held routine, free, and fair elections in a multiparty system. As a beacon of democracy in the Asia-Pacific region, Taiwan deserves recognition and support from the United States. 
   I am pleased to rise in strong support of Taiwan's continued commitment to democratic elections. Now is the time for the United States to reaffirm its unwavering commitment to Taiwan's democracy and security. For an ally that shares our values of freedom, security and prosperity, we can do nothing less.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 951, a resolution condemning the ongoing Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians. 
   Since January 1st of this year, Palestinians have fired more than 450 mortar shells into Israel. Let's put that number into perspective, that's 7 shells a day or 45 shells a week every week since the beginning of this year. 
   Since the Israeli forces withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005, more than 4,000 rockets and mortar shells have been fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip by Hamas and other terrorist organizations. 
   This rocket fire has intentionally targeted civilian communities in Israel and made life for these people a living nightmare. 
   Even folks at the U.N.--an institution that has consistently where Israel is consistently discriminated against--have condemned these acts of violence. John Holmes, the U.N. undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, said recently ``We condemn absolutely the firing of these rockets. There's no justification for it. They are indiscriminate, there's no military target.'' 
   Did you hear that no military targets. Hamas rulers in the Gaza Strip are intentionally injuring and killing innocent civilians. In recent years 12 people have been killed and dozens have been wounded. In fact, just last an 8 year old boy lost his leg in one of the attacks. These acts of brutality have to stop. 
   These acts of terror are unacceptable and it's about time the world community collectively expresses its opposition to Palestine's rocket attacks on innocent civilians and supports the sovereign right of Israel to defend its territory and stop the rocket attacks. 
   And that's just the way it is.

Punish success. Tax them. Take their money and give it to Uncle Sam, who will redistribute it to more government programs. 
   Maybe Congress should try a novel idea: cut spending. Cut out useless programs. Tell special interest groups, no, they can't have taxpayer money for their special pork projects. Cut taxes. Let Americans keep more of their own money.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (CAMERAS, COURTS, AND JUSTICE -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Americans have a right to a public trial. This right dates back to the founding of this Nation, and it is based on our values of fairness and impartiality. The more open and public a trial is, the more likely that justice will occur. That's why in this country we don't have the secret STAR Chamber. This is a right reserved for defendants, but the public also sees it as their right to be informed. Cameras enhance the concept of fairness and openness. 
   Any American could walk into a courtroom and observe that proceeding. But if a person does not physically sit inside that courtroom, that person is denied the ability to see and observe the proceedings. This doesn't make any sense. 
   Placing a camera in a courtroom would allow the trial to be more public, more just, just like a trial is supposed to be. While Federal court hearings are open to the public, not everyone can actually attend Federal hearings. This is certainly true of appellate and Supreme Court hearings. And because of the impact that the United States Supreme Court and its rulings have on all Americans, those proceedings especially should be filmed. It is time to allow cameras in our Federal courts, at the discretion of the Federal judge. 
   I personally know how important it is to make courtroom proceedings in trials accessible by camera to the public because I did it. For 22 years I served as a State felony court judge in Houston, Texas. I heard over 25,000 cases and presided over 1,000 jury trials. I was one of the first judges in the United States to allow cameras in the courtroom. I tried violent cases, corruption cases, murder cases, undercover drug cases, and numerous gang cases. 
   I had certain rules in place when a camera filmed in my courtroom. The media also always followed the rules that were ordered. Court TV even successfully aired an entire capital murder trial that was conducted in my courtroom. My rules were simple: No filming of sexual assault victims or children or the jury or certain witnesses such as informants. The unobtrusive camera filmed what the jury saw and what the jury heard. Nothing else. 
   After the trial juries even commented and liked the camera inside the courtroom because they, too, wanted the public to know what they heard instead of waiting to hear a 30-second sound bite from a newscaster, who may or may not have gotten the facts straight. 
   Those who oppose cameras in the courtroom argue that lawyers will play to the camera. No, Mr. Speaker, trial lawyers don't play to the camera. Lawyers play to the jury. They always have done so and always will whether a camera is present or not. I know. I played to the jury in my 8 years as a trial prosecutor. 
   Those who oppose cameras in the courtroom argue that it would infringe on a defendant's rights, but based on my experience, the opposite is actually true. Cameras in the courtroom actually benefit a defendant because a public trial ensures fairness. It ensures professionalism by the attorneys and the judge. A camera in the courtroom protects a defendant's right to that public trial. 
   And some members of the bar and judges may not want the public to see what is going on inside the courtroom because, frankly, they don't want the public to know what they are actually doing in the courtroom. Maybe these people shouldn't be doing what they are doing if they don't want the public to know by seeing their actions through a camera. A camera reveals the action of all participants in a trial. 
   If a judge fears that any trial participant's safety is in jeopardy or that the identity of an undercover agent or security personnel will be revealed by filming, the judge can refuse to have that camera in the courtroom and film that trial. I know how it is when you have certain undercover agents such as the DEA and informants testify. I had them testify in my courtroom, and we took the precautions to secure their identity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am no law school academic, but I have 30 years experience as a trial prosecutor and a trial judge. And based on those real experiences, cameras should be allowed in our courts. 
   The public has a right to watch courtroom proceedings and trials in person. America should not be deprived of this right to know just because they cannot physically sit inside the courtroom during those trials. 
   We have the best justice system in the world. We should not hide it. Many times citizens wonder why certain things happen in courts and why the results turned out the way they did. Openness, transparency, and cameras will help educate and inform a public that still continues to be enthralled with the greatest court system in the world. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   By proclaiming a day to the world that we plan to ``get out of Dodge,'' no matter the situation, no matter the consequences, because some lack the moral will to win defies commonsense and basic military logic. You never tell the enemy that you will retreat, much less give them the day, month and year. 
   I am sure that in the rat holes of Iraq where the cowardly enemy hide there is joy and laughter. Congress knows as much about running the details of a military operation as FEMA does about disasters. 
   Let the generals finish America's duty. We have the duty to give them the tools, weapons, money and the troops to take care of business.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, growing up in Houston, Texas, I always liked April 21 because it was a school holiday. I believed there was no school on that day because it was my mother's birthday and she never really told me differently. I was proud to be the only kid that had a mom with a school holiday. 
   It was only later that I came to find out the holiday also represented the most important day and most important military victory in Texas history, one that is studied in military schools throughout the world. It occurred near what is now Houston, Texas. It was a unique holiday for southeast Texas called ``San Jacinto Day.'' 
   After Santa Anna, the Dictator of Mexico, invaded Texas with his massive army, and then stormed over the Alamo walls, killing William Travis, Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and the other Texas Volunteers on March 6, 1836, he went looking for the rest of the Texans that wanted independence from Mexico. 
   General Sam Houston had been building the Texas Army, and Santa Anna's three armies were giving chase. The Texas army and their families fled east in what historians call the ``runaway scrape.'' 
   Finally, near the San Jacinto River and the Buffalo Bayou at Lynch's Ferry, Sam Houston stopped to fight. He and his army of 700 faced Santa Anna and his army of over 1,600 on the marshy plains of San Jacinto, Texas. 
   Scout Deaf Smith was ordered to burn the only escape bridge, thus trapping both armies between the river and the marshes. 
   It was April 21, 1836. General Sam wanted to charge into battle the next day at dawn, but decided not to wait any longer. So in the middle of the afternoon, General Sam and the Boys marched in single line in broad daylight with little cover towards the Mexican army. 
   The outnumbered Texans were an odd, terrifying-looking bunch. Without regular uniforms, they were dressed in buckskins, with pistols in their belts, bowie knives, long muskets, and tomahawks. They came from every State in the United States and from Mexico. The Tejanos, Mexicans loyal for Texas independence, were led by Captain Juan Sequin. So as not to confuse the Tejanos with Santa Anna's army, General Sam had Sequin put a playing card in the headband of each Tejano so they could be easily recognized. 
   This was General Houston's first Texas battle. Santa Anna's veteran army had yet to lose any battle. The Texans charged, yelling, ``Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!'' They carried a flag of a partially nude Miss Liberty, and the fife played a bawdy house song called ``Come to the Bower.'' 
   Santa Anna army's, caught napping, was routed. Most of the enemy were killed or wounded. The rest were captured or disappeared. The victory was stunning. Only a dozen Texans were  killed. Santa Anna was captured, disguising himself in a private's uniform. 
   Texans wanted Santa Anna hung because of the Alamo and for murdering Colonel Fannin and his 300 volunteers at Goliad after they had surrendered to the Mexican army. Wise and politically astute General Sam Houston would have none of the lynching and spared Presidente Santa Anna for later bartering power. 
   Texas became a free and independent nation that day and claimed what is now Texas, and parts of New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and even Wyoming. It was one of the largest land transfers in world history as a result of just one battle. The latter land was sold to the United States to pay Texas' war debts. Texas was a republic for over 9 years, and then it was admitted to the Union in 1845 by 1-vote margin. Some now wish the vote had gone the other way. 
   In 1936, Texans built the San Jacinto Monument to honor the Texas War of Independence and General Sam's Victory. It looks exactly like the Washington Monument, but it has a star on top, and, of course, it is bigger. 
   Today, the bugles are silent and the battlefield is surrounded by petrochemical plants. Not much is said nowadays about Texas independence or San Jacinto Day. It is not even a school holiday anymore. But tomorrow, proud Texans will be at the San Jacinto Battleground to honor the few brave Texans and Tejanos that made Texas a new, free, independent nation. 
   We remember our past knowing we were a nation once, and sometimes we still act like an independent people and country. And the rest, they say, is Texas history. 
   I will fly the Lone Star flag proudly on San Jacinto Day, and I will take my mom a bunch of flowers, remembering that this glorious day was once a school holiday to celebrate my mother's birthday. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, small towns and rural America are historically notable and courageous for sending their young sons and daughters off to fight the wars of America. When volunteers are called for duty, it is these close, small communities that seem to always answer America's call to arms. When one of their number is killed in war, the entire community is emotionally affected. 
   In southeast Texas, the small town of Vidor has lost one of its daughters of democracy. Army Specialist Kamisha Block was killed in Baghdad August 16, 2007, in the hot war for Iraq. 
   Kamisha Block became the first female from southeast Texas to die in this war. She enlisted in 2005 at the age of 18 in the United States Army. 
   Mr. Speaker, Kamisha volunteered for the Army when this country was at war, and she probably expected to be sent to the desert of the gun and the valley of the sun. She joined the Army right out of high school. Specialist Block was a military police officer, and eventually wanted to be in law enforcement with a career in the FBI or the CIA. 
   She was assigned to the 401st Military Police Company, 720th Military Police Battalion and 89th Military Police Brigade out of Fort Hood, Texas. 
   Kamisha and her best friend, Amanda Buck, grew up together. As Amanda says, we rode the school bus together from kindergarten all the way up through high school. Amanda said Kamisha knew where she was headed in life, had a big heart and genuinely wanted to help people. 
   Specialist Block's death hit her family hard, and the whole community mourns for her. Her loss has not gone unnoticed. Let me explain. 
   Local newspapers, the Examiner and the Beaumont Enterprise, carried numerous front-page stories about Block and her life. In this small town of Vidor, Texas, almost every business had posted a message for Block and words of support for her family on signs and placards. 
   When Specialist Block was returned to Texas draped in the cloth of the red, white and blue, the funeral procession traveled through rural areas and small towns. The Patriot Guard led the procession with their 75 motorcycles, many carrying large American flags. Next were the numerous police vehicles from the nearby communities. 
   As the funeral proceeded, hundreds of teary-eyed people lined the streets of Beaumont, Texas and Vidor, Texas, removing their hats, placing their hands over their hearts, and waving American flags. Cars even pulled off the road and drivers stood out of their vehicles to pay honor and respect to this warrior. People came out of their homes and stood on their porches in honor of the dead. 
   According to a local paper, The Examiner, Jamie Reynolds, a friend and coworker of Block's at the Waffle House in Vidor, said, ``It was so amazing. I had chills all up and down my arms. It was overwhelming.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, showing silent respect and tribute is what people do in southeast Texas when one of their kids is killed in war. 
   People who knew Block from the Waffle House said that she was always happy with her bright eyes and endearing smile as she served waffles, eggs, and grits and a happy spirit. 
   While Jerry and Jane Block, the parents of Kamisha, mourn the death and absence of their daughter, America owes them our gratitude and our patriotic appreciation. 
   Specialist Kamisha Block while serving in Korea and Iraq was awarded several commendations. She was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Good Conduct Medal, Operation Iraqi Freedom Service Ribbon, and the Bronze Star. 
   Here is a photograph of Kamisha Block, not yet 21 years of age. She died at the age of 20. It has been said ``that how we yet live will echo throughout eternity.'' 
   Specialist Block showed in a mere 20 years the example of compassion, duty, determination, love of country, and love of God that will echo in her small town of Texas throughout eternity. 
   Rare breed these women warriors who go to war for the rest of us. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Does clever calculating Calderon want the United States to become a union with Mexico? Time will tell. 
   Meanwhile, I wonder if anyone in charge of protecting our homeland is aware of and disturbed by these indignant words. In the history of nations, it appears that when one country invades, colonizes, infiltrates or occupies another without permission, the invaded country either resists invasion at the border or just loses its existence. Time will tell what the United States will do. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, in 1814, Francis Scott Key wrote of a star-spangled banner which America ``so proudly hailed .....'' through a night of bomb blasts and rocket-fire. The flag consisted of fifteen stripes, alternating red and white, and fifteen white stars on a field of blue; it united a brand new Nation under the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
   In the 194 years since our national anthem was written, we've come a long way--Old Glory has acquired 35 more stars, and has become the most recognized flag in the world. But its power to unify a nation hasn't changed. Our flag has become synonymous with Freedom, Justice, Prosperity, and all the principles upon which our great Nation was founded. 
    On this, the 58th National Flag Day that our nation has celebrated, let's fly our flags with reverence in honor of our men and women who have given their lives, and for those who continue to fight to defend our great Nation. 
    For a country whose trust is in God, our flag is a precious reminder of how we've gotten here as well as a beacon for which we strive.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, it seems like Indiana Jones is at it again. This time the search is on for the secret underground tunnels of Egypt. 
   The United States Army in Texas is training Egyptian soldiers to locate and destroy underground tunnels used by criminals to smuggle arms from Egypt into the Gaza Strip. Our troops are out there teaching digging techniques to the Egyptians looking for the lost treasure tunnels of guns and rockets. We are doing this to help protect the borders of Israel and Egypt. 
   Meanwhile, the U.S.-Mexican border is still porous for underground smuggling. Since 9/11, more than 40 smuggling tunnels from Mexico to the United States have been discovered. Last year, the DEA located a high-tech, sophisticated concrete tunnel 85 feet underground filled with two tons of drugs. Law enforcement expects there to be more tunnels found. 
   Rather than just protecting the borders of other nations by training Egyptian tunnel raiders, maybe we ought to send the military to protect our own southern border from the underground secret tunnel invasion of guns, drugs and people coming into the United States without permission.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (JIMMY STEWART--ACTOR--U.S. GENERAL -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, he was born in Indiana, Pennsylvania, on May 20, 1908. 
   Jimmy became a Boy Scout and remained active in the organization throughout his adulthood. 
   Of course, I'm talking about Jimmy Stewart. He made more than 80 films, including comedies, Westerns and dramas. 
   Jimmy Stewart won an Academy Award for best performance by an actor in 1940 for his performance in ``The Philadelphia Story.'' He also received four other Oscar nominations for his performances in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' a movie which by the way all Members of Congress should be required to watch, and my personal favorite, ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' He also appeared in ``Anatomy of a Murder.'' 
   Jimmy Stewart was voted the third greatest movie star of all time by Entertainment Weekly. Jimmy Stewart appeared in a number of television shows and Broadway plays and received a Tony award. 
   Although Jimmy Stewart would have preferred to attend the Naval Academy, Stewart entered his father's alma mater, Princeton University, in the fall of 1928. He initially considered engineering, but he finally settled on architecture as his course of study, at which he excelled. He graduated from Princeton in 1932. 
   While he was building his reputation as an actor, the rest of the world was about to go to war. Germany occupied numerous countries in the early part of 1940, and it led Congress to be concerned. And on September 16, 1940, this Congress passed the Selective Service Bill, which we now refer to as ``The Draft.'' 
   Stewart's draft number was 310, and when his number was called, he appeared at Draft Board No. 245 in Los Angeles in February of 1941. 
   A 6-foot-3 Stewart weighed only 138 pounds. He was 5 pounds under the acceptable weight limit. He was turned down, but Stewart wanted to fly and serve his country, but by May of 1941 he would have been too old to get into flight school. He went home after that day of being rejected by the draft, and he ate everything he could that fattened him up. He went back and he enlisted in the Army Air Corps, and he passed the physical with 2 ounces to spare. 
   While others tried to avoid the draft, Jimmy Stewart actually wanted to serve in the military. Later, he would actually campaign to see combat. He was already a licensed pilot. He was interested in aviation as a child. He had taken his first flight while still in Indiana from one of those barnstorming pilots that used to travel throughout the Midwest. 
   He was a successful actor in 1935, and so he was able to afford flying lessons. He often flew cross-country to visit his parents in Pennsylvania, and he navigated by watching the railroad tracks. 
   In the military, he was to make extensive use of his pilot training. In March 1941, at the age of 32, he reported for duty as Private James Stewart at Fort MacArthur and was assigned to the Army Air Corps. To comply with the regulations of the Army Air Corps Proficiency Board, he was required to take 100 additional flying hours, and he did so and bought them at a nearby field at his own expense. 
   Then, in January 1942, Stewart was commissioned a second lieutenant. He was then sent to California at Mather Field as a twin engine instructor which included both B-17s and B-24s. Much to his dismay, Stewart stayed stateside for almost 2 years, until his commanding officers finally yielded to his constant request to be sent overseas and to see combat. 
   So, in November of 1943, Captain Stewart, now a captain and operations officer for the 703rd Squadron, 445th Bombardment Group, of the Eight Air Force, he arrived in England. Later, he was transferred to the 453rd Bombardment Group. 
   While stateside, Stewart flew B-17s, commonly called the Flying Fortress, and in England and over Europe he flew B-24s, referred to by historians as The Liberator, and he did so for the remaining years of the war. 
   Stewart's war record included 20 dangerous combat missions as command pilot, wing commander or even squadron commander. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with two Oak Leaf Clusters; the Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters; the French Croix de Guerre with Palm; and at the end of the war, he had risen to the rank of colonel. 
   After the war, he remained in the United States Air Force Reserves and was promoted to brigadier general in 1959. Mr. Speaker, he remains the highest ranking officer in U.S. military history that was also a Hollywood actor. 
   In 1985, President Ronald Reagan awarded Jimmy Stewart the Nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
   Jimmy Stewart believed in hard work, love of country, love of family, love of community, and love of God. Jimmy Stewart passed away on July 2, 1997, at the age of 89. Jimmy Stewart would be 100 years old today, and America still needs heroes, and Jimmy Stewart still continues to fit that bill. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (OFFSHORE DRILLING -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   As gasoline prices soar to almost $4 a gallon, the American driving public wants Congress to do something about it, and it is our responsibility. 
   Where I live, I represent a good part of rural southeast Texas, and many of these individuals are rice farmers, and they work the land, and they can't afford the diesel for their pickup trucks and for their trucks to go and work at the refineries in southeast Texas. All people throughout the country have this same common issue: Why are gasoline prices so high? Why isn't Congress doing something about it? 
   Well, part of the reason is Congress, instead of exploring our own natural resources, Congress has decided to make the decision to punish energy consumption in this country and to make it more difficult for America to take care of Americans. Congress' policy is let's rely on OPEC; let's rely on that dictator Chavez and get their crude oil while we figure out something else to do on how to take care of ourselves down the road, but the problem is immediate, and we need to deal with it, and we can deal with it. 
   The first issue: Drilling for crude oil and natural gas. Now, because of Congress, we have made it impossible to drill offshore. This map of the United States shows two areas offshore. This blue area is down by Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This area in the Gulf of Mexico is where we drill offshore, and we are glad to do that. That crude oil that we take from the Gulf of Mexico and distribute throughout the United States is good for America. But you see, Mr. Speaker, there is also more crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico by Florida. There is also crude oil over off the east coast. Mr. Speaker, there's also crude oil off the sacred coast of California, the west coast, but we don't drill over there. We don't drill in the Gulf of Mexico. We don't drill on the east coast. Why? Because of Congress. 
   So one thing we could do is lift the offshore drilling prohibitions, not the regulations, but the prohibitions. But because of the environmental fear lobby that is so strong in this Congress, we don't drill where there's crude oil or natural gas. Way up here, not even on the map, is a place called ANWR where there is nothing except crude oil, and we don't drill for crude oil in ANWR because of the environmental fear lobby and because of Congress. 
   Let's lift those restrictions and take care of ourselves rather than rely on foreign dictators and OPEC to get our crude oil. 
   Now, there is going to be another offshore drilling rig out in the Gulf of Mexico over here near this red zone, but it is not going to be built by Americans. Those rigs out there off the coast of Florida, about 48 miles, are going to be built by the Cubans, and it's financed by the Chinese. That's right. The Chinese and the Cubans are drilling where America ought to drill. 
   Doesn't that bother anybody? Lift the restrictions. 
   The second thing we need to do is have more refineries. I represent southeast Texas. We have the Nation's largest refinery and the second largest refinery. Down in the Sabine-Neches Waterway that borders Louisiana there are numerous refineries, but they're running at capacity because we haven't built a new refinery in this country in 30 years. 
   Why? The environmental fear lobby is prohibiting us from taking care of ourselves. So it doesn't do any good to produce more crude oil if we don't have the refinery capacity to produce gasoline and diesel fuel. So make it easier to have refineries in this country. We need to take care of ourselves. 
   I was somewhat embarrassed as an American citizen when our President, the most powerful person on Earth, had to go and ask OPEC last week to produce more crude oil so we could have gasoline. Of course, they in their arrogant way said, ``Well, we'll think about it. Maybe we will and maybe we won't.'' See, that is what is happening to our country. We are being held hostage because Congress will not let America take care of Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to produce the crude oil, the natural gas that we have. We need to even produce and to build more nuclear plants in this country. Right now, China is building nine nuclear plants, and they have 40 on the drawing boards. How many are we making? We're not making any because the environmental fear lobby will not let us build nuclear power plants in this country. 
   So how long is it going to take Congress to get the message that we need to reduce gasoline prices? One way to do that is to increase supply, and we can take care of ourselves. We are the only major power in the world that depends on other nations for our fuel and for our economy. This ought not to be, but it is just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, America cannot afford illegals. 
   Last year, according to the Los Angeles County Supervisor, ``Illegals cost the county $220 million in public safety, $400 million in health care, and $440 million in welfare. Total cost to taxpayers for illegals far exceeds $1 billion a year, not counting millions for their (free) education.'' 
   ``This new information,'' he continued, ``shows an alarming increase in the devastating impact illegals continue to have on taxpayers.'' 
   Illegals should not receive welfare or government assistance. Many Americans and legal immigrants don't receive needed social services and health care because money is going to those illegally on the land. Try getting treated in any hospital emergency room in the country. The silent secret in the crowded waiting room is that many there are illegals getting health care that someone else--Americans--pay for. 
   Still doubting? Then wander up to the maternity ward, where the mothers illegally in the United States are having babies at somebody else's expense. 
   Failure to control the borders allows illegal trespassers to reap what they have not sown and take what they have not earned from America and from legal immigrants.

   Next to the Pentagon is Arlington National Cemetery, where America buries its war dead. In sight of the Pentagon is the Tomb of the Unknown. 
   This tribute to our warriors has been guarded continuously, 24 hours a day since 1930, by the oldest active duty infantry unit in the Army, the 3rd U.S. Infantry, known as the Old Guard. 
   These soldiers that guarded the tomb on 9/11 already knew about the suicide attacks against America in New York. And when that third plane roared low and fast near Arlington Cemetery and crashed into the Pentagon killing 189 people, these remarkable soldiers did not seek cover or safety before or after the assault on the Pentagon. They continued to do their duty, and stayed on vigilant guard at their post, not forsaking their dedication to the Tomb of the Unknown or to America. In fact, after the news of the New York attack, the Old Guard brought in reinforcements to protect and guard the tomb. 
   Amazing soldiers, these people of the Old Guard that never leave their post.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Theodore Otto Herman Hill--with a nickname of ``Thunderhead'' because of his fiery red hair--was my mom's father. He was born in Texas in 1899 and his grandparents were early Texas settlers from Germany. 
   Theodore was a cotton farmer, raised bees, and raised cattle. He married young and had three daughters that he called ``the boys'' who were expected to help him pick cotton. 
   Papa, as we called him, was a hunter, a taxidermist and a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist. He found on his land hundreds of Apache and Comanche arrowheads that he organized, and his collection will soon be turned over to the Texas Ranger Museum. 
   He could tell the type of tree by looking at the bark or observing the leaves. He predicted the weather by watching the animals. 
   One afternoon in the 1950s while he was laying asphalt as a foreman of a work crew for the Texas Highway Department, a drunk driver broke through the barricade and killed my grandfather. I was 5 years old. My grandmother lived another 50 years after his death.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (PREFERENCE POLICY PLAN FOR ILLEGALS -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Senate's new repackaged immigration proposal, the ``Give America Away Act,'' has a provision that should be of concern to college students and parents who foot the bill for college. It gives the illegals in the United States a better deal than U.S. citizens or legal immigrants when it comes to the cost of college tuition for State universities.  
   If this idea becomes law, besides granting amnesty to 12 million to 20 million illegals in the United States, it will treat those illegals better than U.S. citizens and legal immigrants when it comes to college costs. The idea is to grant all illegals a status so they can attend State universities as an in-State tuition even though they illegally entered the United States. 
   Some States already allow illegals to attend State universities and pay in-State tuition. Unfortunately, my State of Texas was one of the first, along with California. 
   Currently there are about a dozen States that allow this absurd policy of preference. Some States are considering opposite laws that require illegals to pay out-of-State tuition. No matter what the people want or the States want, a proposal in this new immigration policy plan will require all States that allow illegals to attend State universities to pay only in-State tuition, not out-of-State tuition. 
   So, what's the difference in cost? Well, if you are an in-State resident in Texas and attend the University of Texas, you pay about $1,500 for 12 semester hours. If you are an out-of-State student, say a student from Tennessee, you pay over $4,000 for 12 semester hours. So this proposal will discriminate against American citizens and legal immigrants, and favor and prefer illegals. 
   An example. If you are from New York and you want to get admitted to the University of Texas, you have to pay out-of-State tuition because, simply, you are not from Texas. Or, as we say, ``You're not from around here.'' But if you are an illegal and get admitted to the University of Texas, you will get to pay in-State tuition. 
   If the Senate plan passes, this preference policy will be law and apply to every State, whether they like it or not. This is blatant discrimination against Americans and legal residents. So American students and parents, get your checkbooks out, because you are going to pay more for college than people who illegally enter the United States. You will be discriminated against by your own government. So, if you want to attend a State college somewhere in America other than your own State, and you don't have the money to pay the extra tuition, well, it's just too bad. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is just another reason this so-called new immigration reform proposal is a bad idea for America. It is nothing more than a preference policy for people illegally in the United States. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, ``amnesty'' is a trigger word for most Americans. While we as a people disagree on many issues, most Americans oppose the thought of legalization of illegal conduct; in other words, amnesty. 
   So the special-interest groups and the profiteers from plantation labor have been careful not to call the new, inclusive immigration proposal amnesty. But that's exactly what it is. It legalizes the illegals that are in America, some 12- to 20 million. All they need to do is a few things, including pay a fee, or as I see it, a government kickback, and they get to stay in America. But supporters of this proposal still refuse to accept the obvious: It's amnesty, or pardon for illegal conduct. 
   If somebody trespasses on your land, when they are caught they usually have to pay a fine, but they also must get off your property. If they pay the fine and are allowed to continue to stay on your property, it is amnesty. This is similar to what the special-interest groups are trying to repackage and sell to the American public and even illegal immigrants. But it seems to me these groups are selling out America. We shall see what the American public think.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, part of our process in this country as a Republic and one reason we broke away from a monarchy was because of the fact that Americans, by nature, want things in the public view.     
   Back in the days of the king, the king made all of the decisions and he made them based on any reason or lack of reason the king wished. 
   Americans want their government to be public. That's why this House meets in public instead of in a back room someplace, because when you meet in back rooms, things seem to happen that are not in the favor or the benefit of the public or the American people. 
   And in this whole appropriations process, the American public is watching us and we are being asked to appropriate billions of dollars for different projects, appropriations bills; but yet we don't know where the money is going. Now, most Americans probably would find that difficult to understand. I find that difficult to understand. Why you would ever appropriate taxpayer money, set it out here in some fund, you can call it a slush fund or a sludge fund it makes no difference. We don't know where the money is going. We are being told trust us, we are the government; we will decide later how to spend your money. Trust us. 
   And how is that decision going to be made? It is going to be made really by one person and his staff, a good person no doubt, but will that decision be made upon partisan politics, how these false, fake, secret earmarks are going to be determined? Will it be based upon longevity in the House? Will it be based upon where a person happens to live in the United States? Will it be based upon other factors that are subjective as opposed to objective? Who knows.  We don't know because we don't know, first of all, where the money is going and how those decisions will be made. 
   But we are all asked in this House, including those on the other side, to write a letter and ask for one earmark, and then that letter will be reviewed by the staff. And the staff will meet with the one Member of Congress and the decision will be made whether to grant or not grant that earmark. 
   It seems to me that one person should not have that ability, that authority, that power. It goes back to the phrase from Orwell's ``Animal Farm'' that all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. And this is probably one of those examples. 
   So why not be open about it? Why not be democratic about it and air those public earmarks in the public sector. Let's argue and debate them on the House floor. Let's vote them up, let's vote them down, but let the American people see exactly what those earmarks are and then they can see where we stand and see how we vote as 435 as opposed to one person. 
   So deals made in back rooms are not good deals for the American public. All we are asking in this legislative body is that we take the taxpayers' money and we tell them up front where that money is going to be spent before we take it away from the taxpayers and say trust us, we are from the Federal Government, we are here to help you. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to Judge Carter.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, in my other life, before coming to Congress, I spent 22 years on the criminal court bench in Houston, Texas, trying all kinds of criminals. During that experience, I learned a lot about the way the world really is. 
   It is unfortunate that, in the society we live in, the Immigration Service cannot protect the United States as far as interior enforcement goes. There aren't enough interior enforcement agents to track down people who are illegally in the system. When I say ``in the system,'' I am talking about the criminal justice system. 
   What happens too often is a person is arrested for a crime. He is put in jail. The person is illegally in the United States, but nobody knows about that. They are sentenced to some term in jail or in prison. They get out, and they continue to stay in the United States illegally. That continues to be a problem, especially in big jurisdictions like Houston, Texas, where I am from. 
   They are committing more crimes, yes. The last three peace officers in the City of Houston that have been shot, Mr. Speaker, were all shot by people illegally in the United States. Two of those individuals had been arrested several times and yet kept being released. The problem breaks down in the local jails. 
   It needs to be clear that this program, the 287(g) program that is being funded and that we are asking more funds to be appropriated for, is voluntary. Cities are not required to participate. 
   Sanctuary cities, and we know what cities they are, that harbor illegals, they won't participate. They don't have to participate. But not all cities in the United States are sanctuary cities. 
   Some cities want to help clean up the crime problem in their neighborhoods. One way they can do it is to receive Federal funds, going to local law enforcement, who know best about policing and who the people are in the area and what criminals they are; to track those individuals illegally in the country and make sure they are legally deported back where they came from. We find that it works, and it works very well. 
   For example, in local jails, sheriffs use the 287(g) program to find out who foreign gang members are, like the MS-13 gang members. Once they are in custody, they can determine who those individuals are, that they are illegally in the United States, and, as soon as they are released from jail, which happens to all of them, rather than be released back on the streets of our cities, they will be deported back where they came from. 
   Now that doesn't seem to happen as much as it should. We have ``catch and release'' of illegals in our county jail system. Then we got to go catch them again and then try to have them deported after some crime is committed. 
   So I think it is wise to use the 750,000 local peace officers in the United States, those peace officers that want to participate in the 287(g) program, train them with Federal funds and allow them to police their own jails and their neighborhoods so that people who are convicted of criminal conduct,  that are illegally in the United States, once they are captured, we can deport them rather than continue to release them back on our streets. 
   So I want to commend the gentlewoman from Virginia for proposing this important amendment asking for more funds for local law enforcement to do their job. Obviously, the Federal Government cannot, has not done its job in protecting interior enforcement, and I think it is a wise use of money to allow local law enforcement to do so.

It seems his overzealous desire to make headlines by appealing to political pandering and making false allegations against three innocent Duke University lacrosse players has landed him in trouble. 
   The State Bar Association charged Nifong with making outlandish prejudicial public comments against the players and hiding evidence, and they want him disbarred. 
   Independent special prosecutors have found the sexual assault charges against the players to be unfounded, but Prosecutor Nifong tried to put them in jail anyway. 
   The mere accusation of sexual assault, even when false, can ruin an individual. 
   The role of the prosecutor is to seek, not convictions. 
   Rouge D.A. Nifong is yet another example of a prosecutor gone wild and an abuser of power. If the allegations against him are true, he joins the wall of shame and should never be allowed near the courthouse again, except maybe as a defendant.

   Even though this criminal activity is highly organized, at least 11 drug dealers have been captured bringing thousands of dollars worth of drugs into our country using these fake State vehicles. 
   But when the U.S. Attorney prosecuted these criminals, they received relatively light sentences. Some people received only fines.

As a former judge in Texas for over 22 years, I like to spend time in our schools, our elementaries, junior highs, high schools and even our law schools, discussing all aspects of the United States and our history. And I would often ask this question to the groups that I was talking to: ``Where do we, as Americans, get our rights?'' 
   Sometimes asking that question would cause people some concern that made them somewhat uncomfortable, especially the elites in our law schools. I would ask those questions to not only law professors but justices on our courts throughout the fruited plain. 
   But the answers would vary from the students. Some would say we get our rights from our parents. Others would say, well, we get our rights from the President. Even one student last week told me we get our rights from Harry Potter. But most of the kids that I would talk to and most of the professors I would talk to say, well, we get our rights as Americans from government. 
   All of those answers, I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, are wrong because we don't get our rights from any of those entities. We talk about our rights, we claim we have rights, but we never talk about where we get them. I think it would be easier to describe a story that occurred shortly after the Iron Curtain, as Churchill called it, came down, the Berlin Wall, the wall that separated East from West, freedom from slavery. When the wall came down, there were numerous political prisoners in Eastern Europe that were finally freed but put in prison by those oppressive governments for exercising what they believed to be freedoms. One was a Prague, Czechoslovakian student who had gone to prison for 7 years and was serving time because he was reading on the steps of Prague University a forbidden document, a document that that Communist regime said that no one shall read in public. 
   I would like to read a portion of that document here tonight. He quoted someone from the United States. In that statement where he spent 7 years in prison, he stated, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, the pursuit of Happiness, that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving the just powers from the consent of the governed.'' 
   Yes, Mr. Speaker, that Prague student who spent 7 years in prison understood where his rights came from. It was not from government, but it was from the Almighty, the Creator, as quoted in the Declaration of Independence that he chose to read and cost him 7 years of his freedom, that Declaration of Independence that was written and authored by Thomas Jefferson. 
   Of course that document was the status and the statement and the indictment against King George, not the people of England, but King George, the Government of England, for why the United States had a right to be a separate and independent nation. It was an indictment stating the causes, and finally the Constitution was the government that we set up to preserve the rights in the Declaration of Independence. 
   We get our rights from the Creator. Because if we get our rights from government, governments can take those rights away from us at any time government wishes to do so. Mr. Speaker, 49 of the 50 States have in their preambles a reference to the Almighty. Many of those preambles mention the fact that they get their rights in the States from the Creator. 
   The Bill of Rights in our Constitution limits government. Government does not have rights. Government has power. And government gets power from us when we choose to give up individual liberty and give up individual rights. Government has the power to control us and control our liberties only if we let it. So the Bill of Rights and the Constitution says government was set up to protect the rights that we have, those God-given rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In fact, the ninth amendment to the Bill of Rights says there are more rights that aren't even listed in the Bill of Rights that we have. 
   Mr. Speaker, on the Jefferson Memorial down the street from where we all are is written a quote by Thomas Jefferson which says, ``God who gave us Life gave us Liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?'' 
   Mr. Speaker, if we fail to acknowledge this legal principle of God-given rights, then we deny our heritage as Americans and our reason to be a free people.  
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (CONDITIONS AT WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Thank you, Judge Carter. Thank you for an opportunity to make some comments on this important issue. 
   It has taken less than a week for the American public and this Congress to find out what was taking place at Walter Reed Hospital. It is one of the premier hospitals in the world for treating the injured. But yet there were some problems and those problems, rather than being overlooked, are being dealt with, and that is very, very good. 
   A couple of observations that I would like to make about this whole episode. As you mentioned, Judge Carter, American troops if they are found after an injury within a few minutes, the likelihood of their survival is in the 90 percent range. That is a tremendous percentage of recovery for these individuals to live if they are wounded. And they live from wounds that just years ago, even back in Vietnam days, they would have died from. But because of medical science, expanding as it has, they will recover from those wounds, although they will have, many of them, lifetime recovery periods. And that is where we must make sure that we take care of our military, that the recovery for many of these individuals is going to be a long, long time. Sometimes the rest of their lives.  
   An observation I would like to make about this situation at Walter Reed is that the American public expects us to take care of our soldiers. I think this is good. I think it is good that the American public is upset about the fact that some of our troops are not being taken care of the way they should be because our people in this Nation, regardless of how they feel about Iraq or Afghanistan, the issue of taking care of the wounded is not a political issue. It is an American issue, and Americans expect the best care for our troops. And that is important that the American public support our military in the recovery process. 
   To try to illustrate how the American public supports our wounded warriors, I had the opportunity to go to Landstuhl Military Base in Germany where wounded Americans come from Afghanistan and Iraq, many of them with severe injuries, and they are treated there before they are even brought back to the United States because of the critical care facilities they have at Landstuhl. 
   And when I found out I was going to be able to go over for this short trip with about 3 days' notice, I notified my two district directors in Texas to see if we could get some kids from local schools to make some cards to take over and give to the wounded. They met me at the airport with two suitcases full of handmade cards from third, fourth, and fifth graders of the Second Congressional District of Texas, and a little over 6,000 cards. I checked one of the suitcases. The smaller one I took on the plane with me, and I started reading them as I was flying over. The person next to me wanted to know what I was doing and I told him. And so he wanted to see them. He started reading the cards. Next thing I knew, the whole plane was reading. The cards were going up and down the aisle, and there were a few tears in the background. 
   But the point being that the American public supports our military, supports our military even when they are wounded, and cares a great deal about them, to the tune of 6,000 handmade cards from a bunch of kids in Texas. Of course the troops were very grateful for those cards. But it is a sign and observation that the American public will always support our troops when they are wounded and expect us in the Congress to make sure they have the care that they deserve. 
   The President acted very decisively and quickly, and I congratulate him for that because when things go bad at a hospital like it did at Walter Reed, the person in charge of the hospital needs to be removed. They need to get somebody over there that will take care of business and make sure that we don't have problems with our military. 
   How we treat our warriors in aftercare really defines us as who we are as a Nation. 
   One other comment I would like to make is it goes back to something that is tradition with our United States military, has been for a long time through many wars. The American fighting man always has the role, the obligation, the duty to never leave anyone behind on the battlefield. People in other cultures do not understand why Americans are so relentless in making sure we take care of not only our wounded but those that have fallen on the battlefield. They don't understand why we do that. We do that because we are Americans. 
   One way that we leave no one behind is to make sure we don't leave them behind in the hospitals, we don't leave them behind in aftercare. We take care of them for as long as necessary, and if it means taking care of them the rest of their lives, so be it, because that is what we do in this country: we leave no one behind. 
   So I commend you, Judge Carter, for this Special Order and bringing awareness of this whole plight of hospital care and the care of our warriors to the American public.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, there is a new candidate for the ``Villains Hall of Shame.'' What began as a Sunday morning journey to church for Rose Morat of Queens, New York, ended up in ambush, robbery, and 4 days in the hospital. 
   Ms. Morat is 101 years old. She was leaving her apartment complex when a shameless woman-beater pretended to help her out the door, but smashed her three times in the face, breaking a cheekbone. He stole her purse; then he threw her to the ground and hit her again. And after making his getaway, this dastardly menace struck again 30 minutes later. This time he beat up an 85-year-old lady and stole her purse. 
   New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has made it a priority to capture this outlaw. Angry New Yorkers are already flooding the airwaves with suggestions for punishment for this criminal that would make the hanging of Saddam Hussein look mild. 
   Madam Speaker, even in our current culture of tolerance, there are some things you just don't do, some things we just don't tolerate. No one beats up elderly grandmothers, or they will face the wrath of the public and the long arm of the law. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, because Wall Street money grabbers have made bad judgment calls, the American taxpayer is being forced to bail them out at $700 billion. Why is it, Madam Speaker, that the bigger the business, the more the Federal Government thinks it should swoop in and save incompetent businesses? Small businesses, mom and pop grocery stores, don't get this break. When they make bad financial decisions, they go out of business. But the rich and famous Wall Street New York City fat cats expect Joe Six-Pack to buck it up and pay for all this nonsense. 
   Reward people for being irresponsible and expect responsible people to pay for the sins of the financial industry? I think not. Putting a financial gun to the head of each American is not the answer. 
   Madam Speaker, I have this bill; it's over 100 pages long. That means it's seven billion dollars a page. The New York City fat cats expect us to pay for it. I think not. 
   This year alone, Madam Speaker, it's a sad time to be an American taxpayer. Here's Uncle Sam, all beat up because he's broke, and the reason is we have paid out Bear Stearns, a bailout, $28 billion, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $200 billion, AIG bailout, $85 billion. Last week, the automobile industry got $26 billion. And today, lo and behold, $700 billion. 
   The American taxpayer is tired of paying for the sins of other people. It's time for them to pay and be responsible for their own misconduct. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (SECURE THE BORDERS FIRST -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the American people overwhelmingly support border security, but for some reason, some political pandering pundits in Washington, D.C., want to pursue an unwise, open house amnesty policy before dealing with the real first important issue of national security. 
   It's an issue of trust. I don't think Americans believe our government will really ever secure the border, no matter how many empty promises are made. The reason is too many special interest groups want lax border enforcement for their own political agenda. 
   Those who want cheap plantation labor and those who want greater political power seem to want the border  laws we have ignored. The motives appear to always be about money or power. 
   However, our government would do well to assume its constitutional responsibility to protect America. The government has the ability, but not the will, to protect the border. 
   Congress needs to provide adequate resources for border security. The government has the responsibility then to enforce the law and not give in to special interest groups. Then we can deal with the people that are here illegally after the government proves it has the will to secure our homeland. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (TEXAS SHERIFF OMAR LUCIO -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, during the last week I had opportunity to go to the Texas Rio Grande Valley and visit with some relentless lawmen that represent the State of Texas down on the Texas-Mexico border. I had the privilege to be the guest of Valley Sheriff Omar Lucio. We call it the Valley. It's really the Rio Grande Valley that separates the United States from Mexico. And he is the Sheriff in the tip of Texas where it meets Brownsville and Metamoras. 
   This map here has a photograph or a drawing of where Sheriff Lucio is Sheriff in Cameron County, the red area. Most of his county borders the water. Some of it borders the Gulf of Mexico. Some of it borders the Rio Grande River. And he's been Sheriff there for 3 years. 
   I went there as his guest to see the way it really is on the Texas-Mexico border and how the violence and the crime is causing a tremendous problem to the locals who live in that area. 
   Sheriff Lucio is from the Valley. He was born in San Benito, Texas, and he started his law enforcement career in Harlingen, Texas, as a peace officer; and he retired as a captain of police from Harlingen. He's an educated individual from Pan American University. He has a degree in criminal justice and a degree in sociology, and he's also a graduate of the FBI academy at Quantico. 
   Prior to being Sheriff, he was also the Chief of Police of the City of Mercedes, and he is on the Texas Sheriff's Association, and more importantly, the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition. What that is, Mr. Speaker, is the Sheriffs, the 16 county Sheriffs that border Mexico and Texas, all the Sheriffs form a coalition because of the tremendous problems they have as law enforcement officers protecting their communities. 
   Let me try to explain it to you this way: When a crime is committed in a county, even if it is committed by some outlaw that has crossed the border illegally into the United States, the people affected do not call the border patrol, they call the local Sheriff, whether it is a burglary, auto theft, robbery, or a murder. The Sheriffs are the ones who are called because of the crimes that are committed in those counties and not the border patrol. 
   The border patrol patrols, as the law says, 25 to 30 miles inside the Texas-Mexico border. Most of the Texas counties are a lot bigger than 25 miles. In fact, Cameron County, where Sheriff Lucio is Sheriff, is 1,300 square miles. Now, 300 miles of that is water border. And his biggest concern is the drug cartels that infiltrate the United States from Mexico. 
   I want to mention that some of the information I received from Sheriff Lucio was quite remarkable, and I'm very impressed with the intelligence-gathering network that he has. Without going into that--it would not be proper for me to tell you how he gathers his information--but he gathers information from all sources, and he knows as much as anybody, including Homeland Security, as to what is taking place with the drug cartels that are infiltrating especially his county. 
   And he's concerned about the turf wars in Juarez, Mexico, and Laredo, and concerned that they will spread down further south into Metamoras, which is across the border from his main town of Brownsville, Texas. He says that the illegal criminals that come into his county are the biggest threat to not only national security but the security of the folks who live in that area. And he was very concerned about some of the proposals that the Homeland Security has for trying to protect that area. 
   There are 70 miles of fence proposed in that area, and Homeland Security is even proposing a fence so far inland that it cuts part of Texas' southmost college in half. Half of that college will be on the southern side of this fence. And that is probably not a good idea, and I would invite the Homeland Security chief to go down to that area and see some of the area and why it's impractical in that area to have a fence. Maybe in other parts of Texas, but certainly not in this particular part of the area. 
   His deputy sheriffs, Mr. Speaker, make $24,000 a year, $24,000 a year patrolling this rugged territory between Mexico and the United States. And I met a good number of those deputy sheriffs and some of his lieutenants, and I insert the names of The Posse, as I call them, into the Record at this point.  
   Gus Reyna, Jr., Chief Deputy; Javier Reyna, Captain; Lt. Carlos Garza, Investigations; Mike Leinart, Chief Jail Administrator; Lt. Domingo Diaz; Lt. Tony Lopez; Lt. Rick Perez; Lt. Dionicio Cortez; Sgt. Andy Arreola; Inv. Alvaro Guerra; Inv. Leo Silva.  
   And to a man, they are all determined to protect the citizens of Cameron County, Texas, from criminals from any source. 
   But they talk about the biggest problem they have is the fact that the border is not secure, that criminals come across the border, whether it is drug cartels or just old-fashioned robbers, and then they go back home across the border. And he is asking that he and other border Sheriffs get more manpower down on the border. 
   I told him that fence was going to cost $1 million a mile. He said he would rather take that $70 million that's going in his county for fences and have more personnel, more equipment, because the drug cartels have better equipment, more money, better fire power than he does. 
   In fact, speaking of equipment, I noticed that he didn't really have a lot of patrol vehicles. The way they get their vehicles, because they don't have a budget for vehicles, is they have to confiscate the drug dealers' vehicles, and they turn those over and become part of his operation. 
   So I want to thank him for his work down on the Texas-Mexico border, and the Cameron County folks are safer because of Sheriff Lucio and his relentless deputy sheriffs. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, there is alarming news from Newsweek magazine. I read the article in part: ``There are ominous signs the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may cause a drastic decline in food production. The evidence in support of these predictions has now begun to accumulate so fast that meteorologists are hard-pressed to keep up with it ..... The central fact is that after three quarters of a century of extraordinarily mild conditions, the Earth's climate seems to be cooling down ..... If the climate change is as profound as some of the pessimists fear, the resulting famines could be catastrophic ..... The present decline has taken our planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average.'' 
   Madam Speaker, this article was written in Newsweek in April 1975. Those doomsayers said we were all going to freeze in the dark. Now these are the same people who say we're going to roast because of global warming. Were they correct in 1975 or are they correct today? Before we panic, we need to separate science from junk science and get the facts about global warming.

   Mr. POE. Thank you to the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation as a cosponsor. Being from Texas, we get the brunt of trucks coming from Mexico into the United States. Mexican truck drivers shouldn't be treated any better or worse than American truck drivers. 
   The general reputation of the American trucking industry is very good. They maintain their vehicles, and they maintain competence of their drivers. This legislation will require the same of Mexican truck drivers that come into the United States to have vehicles that don't pollute, that are not overweight, that are maintained as well as American trucks, and it will require the simple but very logical principle that Mexican truck drivers that drive throughout the United States, those massive 18 wheelers, be able to read a street sign.  
   I think it's important that people who drive our freeways are able to read the directions and the signs of the cities into which they travel. This legislation makes a lot of sense; it's common sense. It's needed to equalize the crossings into the United States of Mexican truck drivers with the competence of American truck drivers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding some time. 
   Madam Speaker, I was a former prosecutor for 8 years and a judge in Texas for 22. I spent all my life basically in the criminal justice system as a prosecutor or as a trial judge, and I can attest to the high workload, long hours and low pay attributed to our Nation's prosecutors and to public defenders. 
   I have found over the years that most of them do what they do because they are committed to serving the public, either as a prosecutor or a public defender. They certainly don't do it for the money. 
   According to the Law Schools Admission Council, however, the average law school debt for an individual who borrows Federal or private loans is anywhere from $90,000 up. The starting salary for local and State prosecutors and public defenders starts anywhere at $25,000 and sometimes it reaches $50,000. It is not nearly enough to cover the expenses and keep up with the high loan repayments every month that these lawyers have to deal with. 
   This leaves many qualified and dedicated lawyers leaving the district attorney's office and the public defender's office for work in the private sector where they can make more money. What happens is these lawyers get trial experience at taxpayers' expense, then leave for the big law firms because of their low government salary and their high law school debt. 
   When I served in the criminal courts as a judge for 22 years, I saw many good prosecutors and public defenders just leave public service because of this problem. 
   The people of our Nation and the victims of crime need to have the best trial lawyers we can find to prosecute criminal cases. Defendants, likewise, need conpetent public defenders to represent the rights of the citizen accused. 
   I am honored to be a cosponsor of H.R. 916, the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007. Prosecutors and public defenders can have up to $30,000 of law school debt erased if they serve 3 years in their current position in public service.     
   Of course, this is a renewable debt forgiveness. If the trial lawyer is willing to work another 3 years as a prosecutor or public defender, then a total of $60,000 of law school debt can be forgiven. Most of the time, this will still not cover the majority of their law school debt. 
   Of course, local and State courts will benefit because they will be able to keep qualified and competent trial lawyers. We need the best trial lawyers in our legal profession to try criminal cases for the State and the defense. 
   Madam Speaker, we basically have two types of lawyers--trial lawyers. We have civil lawyers, and there are a lot of wonderful trial lawyers who are civil lawyers. 
   But, basically, civil lawyers argue in the courtroom over money. Nothing wrong with that, but that's what they are arguing over. 
   But in the criminal courts, we are arguing over something much more important than money, and it's the liberty of the person on trial. It is very serious business, and that's why you need the best prosecutor and the best public defender that we can find to represent both sides because the stakes are so high. 
   I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 916. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for introducing this important piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (STAFF SERGEANT TERRANCE DUNN, TEXAS WARRIOR -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. ``We shall not flinch or fail. We shall go on to the end. ..... We shall fight on the seas and oceans. We shall fight with growing strength in the air. We shall defend ..... whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight everywhere. We shall never surrender.''  
   These are the words of Sir Winston Churchill showing the dedication and determination of military warriors who fight for liberty. They never give up; and, of course, they never give in. Army Staff Sergeant Terrance Dunn was one of those soldiers. 
   Calling Atascocita, Texas, home, Staff Sergeant Dunn graduated from Pascagoula High School in Mississippi in 1987. In high school, he was known as the student always helping others. 
   In 1991, Staff Sergeant Dunn enlisted in the United States Army. He volunteered to serve this country and to become a part of an organization that accomplished great things. For him, the Army was his life. 
   For 16 years, Staff Sergeant Dunn devoted his life to protecting United States and its citizens from those who wanted to destroy us, freedom and liberty. He was always taking time to make sure that his Army uniform was in perfect shape, and he was proud of his service. 
   In one of the first letters he sent to his mother after enlisting into the United States Army, he told her that he was a real soldier now and he loved it. 
   Staff Sergeant Dunn was routinely away from the comforts and luxuries of home in Texas. He served tours of duty in Germany, Bosnia, Africa, South Korea, and, of course, two tours of duty in Iraq. He was committed to the service, he was committed to the American people, he was committed to his family, and he was committed to his duty. 
   As most military soldiers, Staff Sergeant Dunn was a very humble person about his service. He considered it an honor. 
   Family was one of the most important things to Staff Sergeant Dunn. He was the youngest of six children. He was close to all of his brothers and sisters and his numerous nieces and nephews. Even while amid the cannons of battle, he would call home to his family and check on them to see how they were doing, making sure they were okay. 
   Staff Sergeant Dunn was coming home to Texas in April, next month, after finishing that second tour of duty in that land far, far away that we call Iraq. He was assigned to the 210th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division. He was a mechanic for the United States Army and responsible for servicing vehicles and Army tanks. He was also tasked with fixing any broken equipment because he was a technological whiz. He could fix anything. 
   To his fellow soldiers, they called him the ``Dunnaman.'' If something needed done, Dunnaman did it, and it was given to him to do because they could always count on Staff Sergeant Dunn. 
   On February 2 of this year, Staff Sergeant Dunn called home to one of his sisters, checking on the status of the folks back home. With all the dangers of the Iraqi desert, his mind was always on his family. His sister had no way of knowing that that would be the last time that she spoke to her brother. 
   This is a photograph of Staff Sergeant Dunn taken shortly before his life was stolen from him. Because, several hours later, on patrol in Baghdad, an IED, an improvised explosive devise, hidden by faceless enemies that will not come out and fight, detonated near Staff Sergeant Dunn's patrol vehicle, killing this American warrior. He was 38 years of age. 
   Sergeant Dunn is the 18th American warrior associated with my southeast congressional district to be killed in this war in the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   For his bravery and service to his people, Staff Sergeant Dunn was awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star. He was brought home to Louisiana, his birthplace. Staff Sergeant Dunn was carried by his fellow soldiers in the Army Honor Guard, and he was laid to rest with full military honors. 
   Staff Sergeant Dunn was an American patriot. That is a word sometimes we don't like to use, but he was, and he was proud to be a patriot. He was a hero to his family, his fellow soldiers, and to us. He served his country for 16 years, and he accomplished great things in the United States Army. 
   And remember, Mr. Speaker, he, like all the people in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting for this Nation and for the Iraqi people, are volunteers. They asked to join the fight. 
   So God bless the Dunn family and God bless Staff Sergeant Dunn. He fought for our Nation. He defended liberty in lands far, far away. And he never surrendered. 
   In the words of George Orwell, ``We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would try to do us harm.'' The American soldier. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the days of tax and spend are back. The new reform budget passed by the House just a few minutes ago actually is for more taxes, more spending. So Americans need to get out their checkbooks because they are going to be paying more because here is the deal: 
   This budget will increase tax rates on all Americans who pay taxes because the tax cuts will expire. It will cut the tax credit for children by half, and it will punish married people by taxing them more because they choose to be married. And it will also tax Americans when they die, literally tax them to death. This bill is the largest tax increase in American history. Furthermore, this fat and sassy bill increases wasteful spending. 
   We ought to be cutting taxes, cutting wasteful spending because that is the American way, that is the right way. Because Americans pay, they always pay, and they are going to pay a lot more.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Iraq defeat bill that this House has passed sets the day certain that American troops will leave Iraq. By doing so, Congress is trying to legislate ``defeat day'' no matter the consequences. 
   In other words, retreat, retreat, at any price, retreat. Quit, quit, at any price, quit. Withdraw, withdraw, at any price, withdraw. Flee, flee, at any price, flee. Surrender, surrender, at any price surrender. 
   Congress has changed the phrase, ``when the going gets tough, send in the U.S. Cavalry, send in the U.S. Marines,'' to, ``when the going gets tough, leave,'' leave in the darkness of the night and let the Iraqis go it alone. 
   I am sure there is joy in ``Desertville'' in the fanatical minds of the enemies of freedom. Mr. Speaker, war is hard. This war is hard. But we cannot neglect our duty because it is hard. 
   The stability of the region and our national security depend on our U.S. success in defeating the enemy. We need to make it hard on them. Give them a day to remember.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (POLITICAL PRISONERS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, as we talk about the war on the first front in Iraq and Afghanistan, we must remember that there is another war going on on the second front, and that is the border war between the United States and Mexico. All of the politicians that are running for President this year are talking about everything. Some things are just not important. But one thing they're not talking about is the border war in the south part of the United States, between Mexico and the United States. 
   Two years ago, two border agents by the name of Ramos and Compean were tried and convicted for doing their job on the Texas/Mexico border. What happened was, that in February of 2005, Ramos and Compean came in contact with a drug dealer. He came into the United States at Fabens, Texas. Most of America's never heard of this little small Texas town. 
   He's driving a van. He sees the border agents and he turns around and he tries to run back to Mexico. He abandons the van. The border agents give chase. An altercation occurred down in the Rio Grande riverbed. Shots were fired. The drug dealer disappears into Mexico. 
   It turns out that the drug dealer had been shot by one of the border agents, and it turns out that the van that he was driving had, get this, $750,000 worth of drugs in the van. 
   So what does our Government do? Instead of trying to find the drug dealer to prosecute him, our Government goes to Mexico, finds the drug dealer and promises him a back room deal, a deal to testify against the border agents, claim that the border agents unlawfully used their firearms, even though they said they fired in self-defense. And they make a deal with him not to prosecute him for his drug smuggling if he testified. And he did testify against the border agents, and 2 years ago they were convicted.     
   But unbeknownst to the jury, and what the U.S. Attorney's Office would not let the jury know, is that before the trial took place, this star witness, backroom-deal witness, brought in another load of drugs into the United States for money. The U.S. Attorney's Office knew about it. They didn't want the jury to know about it, and they kept it out of the trial. Now the whole world knows the U.S. Attorney's Office was deceitful in that trial. 
   Those border agents are serving 11 to 12 years in the Federal penitentiary. The President pardoned 157 people in his administration. Fifteen of them last week. Some of them were drug dealers. But why doesn't the President pardon these border patrol agents for doing their job? 
   The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has heard this case. I suspect they will reverse it because the U.S. Attorney's Office was deceitful in the trial and prosecution of these two border agents because they were relentless in prosecuting them. 
   Our government is on the wrong side of the border war. We're trying to hire more border agents, and people don't want to join the Border Patrol. One reason is because our government doesn't support them. When an altercation takes place, they side with the other guys instead of siding with our border agents. 
   And this is not the first time the U.S. Attorney's Office has been caught cheating in a trial. A border agent by the name of David Sipe was arrested by our government because he was in a fight and assault with a drug dealer down in Texas. And he was prosecuted for a civil rights violation, but it turns out in his trial the U.S. Attorney's Office hid evidence in that case as well, but they got caught; and that case was retried and the jury found David Sipe not guilty because the U.S. Attorney's Office, once again, didn't want the jury to know the truth about the person that came in contact with our border agent. 
   So it's time our government gets on the right side of the border war. Defend our boarder patrol agents. Secure the border. Make sure that the war on the second front is won, that people not be allowed to come into the United States illegally for any purpose, especially drug smugglers; and our government needs to quit taking the side of drug dealers from foreign countries and start siding with the American Border Patrol because they're doing their job to protect the rest of us. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (PARDON BORDER AGENTS -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Constitution gives the President absolute authority to grant a pardon. He has exercised that power 157 times. Last week, he pardoned 15 more people convicted of everything from importation of drugs to bank fraud and other crimes. 
   But two people not on his pardon list are Border Agents Ramos and Compean, who are serving 11 and 12 years for enforcing the law on the Texas-Mexico border. They were convicted of civil rights violations when they shot a drug smuggler bringing in $750,000 worth of drugs to the United States. 
   The United States Government gave the drug dealer complete immunity for his crimes to testify against the agents. Then the Justice Department hid from the jury the fact that the drug dealers smuggled in another load of drugs shortly before the trial. The U.S. Attorney made a backroom deal with the smuggler for his testimony and got the tainted testimony they bartered for. 
   Last session, this House passed legislation to prevent taxpayer money from being used to incarcerate Ramos and Compean, but they are still in prison. Because of the U.S. Attorney's actions of deception in this trial, and the fact that the agents were just doing their job, are grounds for the President to pardon both of the border agents immediately. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the U.S. Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, is the chief law enforcement officer in this Nation. He is the most powerful prosecutor in America. As such, his credibility is based on his word. He must never deceive, mislead or misstate. 
   There have been two different accounts by his office about the firings of some U.S. Attorneys. Gonzalez says he never has discussed the firings, but secret memos show a meeting to discuss such was held in his very office where he was present. Both statements cannot be true. His word is tarnished. 
   The issue is not whether the administration can fire U.S. Attorneys. It can do so for almost any reason under the law. 
   Madam Speaker, growing up, my grandmother was the Chief Law Enforcement Officer. Her word was the law. I never doubted what she said. I respected her because she was always bluntly truthful. If she had told me it was raining in my house, I would have rushed home and started putting plastic over the furniture, because she never misled or misstated the truth. 
   This Nation deserves better than to have an Attorney General who cannot be forthright with Congress and misleads the citizens he has been sworn to protect. He has a credibility issue. His word should be as bluntly truthful as my grandmother's.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I will address this house tonight on a very special issue. It is good to hear that the speakers prior to me used as the basis of their dialogue the Constitution. 
   Far too often it seems to me that in this House we talk and pontificate about all kinds of things, but sometimes we forget the basis for all legislation, the basis for what we do, the basis for the oath that we took as Members of Congress, was to support the Constitution of the United States.     
   Like many Members of Congress, I carry a pocket Constitution with me to refer to from time to time. I want to read just one portion of the U.S. Constitution. It is the eighth amendment to the Constitution. We call the first 10 amendments to our Constitution the Bill of Rights. 
   It says in the eighth amendment that excessive bail should not be required, nor excessive fines imposed. It also says nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. You notice the phrase is ``cruel and unusual punishment.'' Far too often some quote this phrase in the Constitution as cruel or unusual. That is not the law and it has never been the law. The law is punishment should not be cruel and unusual. 
   A little history is in order. Our forefathers that wrote this Constitution did not come up with that phrase. It  goes all of the way back to the English Bill of Rights from 1689. Most of the colonists had English heritage, and when they formed their federations and the States and colonies, they enacted certain laws. In those laws and later their State constitutions, they included the phrase that punishment should not be cruel and unusual. 
   Then when our forefathers wrote this Constitution and made it the law, this eighth amendment was added to make sure that punishment was not cruel and unusual. So that is a little basis for where we came up with this phrase. There have been many debates over the years as to what does that mean, cruel and unusual punishment. Not many Supreme Court cases are involved in what the definition is. But there is one. In 1878, the Supreme Court of the United States in a case called Wilkerson v. Utah tried to define what the phrase ``cruel and unusual'' meant. Here is what they said: It is safe to affirm that punishments of torture, such as drawing and quartering, emboweling alive, such as took place in the movie Braveheart with William Wallace, beheading, public dissecting, and burning alive, and all others in the same line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbidden by the eighth amendment to the Constitution. I doubt there are many Americans who would disagree with that interpretation of what ``cruel and unusual'' means. 
   But we have a new issue before us today, and this issue is coming before the United States Supreme Court which meets right down the street from us. Those nine members of the Supreme Court have decided to take two cases from Kentucky that deal with the issue of cruel and unusual punishment. 
   Two men in Kentucky received the death penalty for crimes against the citizens of Kentucky. And they argue now, years later, that the means by which they are executed is cruel and unusual. That means, Mr. Speaker, is by lethal injection. Kentucky's lethal injection procedures are the same as many States, including my home State of Texas. Just to be clear, three chemicals are used for lethal injection. The first is sodium thiopentothal which renders a person unconscious, and pavulon which paralyzes the muscles, including those which control breathing, and then potassium chloride which causes cardiac arrest. Those are the three chemicals that most States use and are administered to the person who has received the death penalty and is to be executed for their crimes. 
   The Supreme Court will consider one of these cases, it is called Baze v. Rees, the way that lethal injection is actually administered by the administrating process, whether it causes severe pain such that it is a violation of the cruel and unusual punishment provision of the eighth amendment. Baze was scheduled to die on September 25, 2007, for the 1992, that's right, 15 years ago he murdered a sheriff and deputy sheriff who were trying to serve him with a warrant. The Kentucky Supreme Court stayed his execution pending the outcome of the Supreme Court decision. 
   The second case involves the execution of a Thomas Bowling, also from Kentucky. In 1990, that is 17 years ago, he killed Tina and Edward Early outside their Lexington dry cleaning business. He also shot the Early's then 2-year-old son, but the son did not die. He was able to survive. Bowling was supposed to be executed 3 years ago, in 2004, but his execution was halted in part because of a challenge on how the State of Kentucky executes prisoners. 
   Both of these offenders, Baze and Bowling, sued the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 2004 claiming lethal injection amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and violates the eighth amendment to the Constitution. The State Supreme Court of Kentucky ruled against both of these men, but the U.S. Supreme Court now will hear their case. This marks the first time that the United States Supreme Court will address the merits of lethal injection without also a request for a stay of execution. 
   The Supreme Court's precedent is that the death penalty and the method of execution must not be ``contrary to evolving standards of decency'' and may not inflict ``unnecessary pain.'' Let me say that again. The Supreme Court says that the method of execution must not be contrary to evolving standards of decency and may not inflict unnecessary pain. 
   Our Supreme Court really has only ruled on a direct method of execution once, and that was in 1878 when it upheld the use of a firing squad for execution. But since that time, the Supreme Court in 1972 stopped all death penalty cases because of a different legal issue. The issue was that juries that decided whether a person should get the death penalty or not had too much discretion in making that decision. So the Supreme Court struck down death cases in the United States until State law conformed with the Supreme Court ruling, and then jurors were given a more exact way of determining whether the person should live or die. I am not going to go into those issues at this time, but basically the jury is asked a series of questions, and based upon the way they answer the questions, the person would receive the death penalty or a life sentence. In 1976, juries once again started hearing death penalty cases and making that decision. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you know, prior to coming to this House, I served in Texas first as a prosecutor in the district attorney's office in Houston for 8 years, and I also served on the bench trying felony cases after that for 22 years. During those 8 years when I served as a prosecutor, I tried death penalty cases. And those people that I tried when I was a prosecutor have all been executed. 
   When I served on the bench, most of those individuals who were tried and juries heard those cases, those people who received the death penalty have also been executed. But there are still some even now who are on death row. 
   I want to make it clear that judges do not determine the death penalty in this country. We do not give that power to one person. We want and make juries determine whether a person should live or die for the crimes they have committed. It is a mistaken belief among a lot of Americans that judges assess the death penalty. We just sentence the person to the death penalty if the jury has ordered the death penalty in that particular case. 
   So it is 12 people from the community who set the community standard on the conduct on the individual who appears in court. I am a great believer in that. I believe juries should be the ones and it should be a unanimous decision before we take a person's life for the crimes they have committed. 
   And guilt should never be an issue. What I mean by that, juries must be absolutely convinced beyond all doubt that a person committed this crime before they assess the death penalty. I was very careful as a trial judge over those 22 years on the numerous death penalty cases I tried to make sure that the rule of law was enforced in every situation because of the fact that the person that is on trial receives the ultimate punishment. 
   I am actually one who believes in numerous appeals on death penalty cases, to have it reviewed by other courts. I just wish courts, including our Supreme Court, would not take so long to make those decisions, that they should review those questions of guilt and the constitutional rights of the offender, make sure that those are reviewed quickly and not take years and years. That does not promote any form of justice either for the offender or for the victim in the case. 
   The State of Texas, as many know, has executed more folks than any other State. Let me just mention a little history here. Before it was even a part of the United States and before it was even a country, Texas was a country for 9 years from 1836 to 1845. But even before that time, Texas assessed the death penalty and death penalty cases were assessed by hanging. That was done until 1923, and then the State of Texas moved to the electric chair until the Supreme Court stayed all executions. And then lethal injection has been used ever since 1976. Texas was the first State to use lethal injection in 1982 as the means of punishing a person who received the death penalty. 
   There are 38 States now that assess the death penalty or have death penalty statutes on their books; 37 of those use lethal injection. Nebraska still uses electrocution. So 38 States, most of the States make that decision that some cases are so bad that the death penalty should be a form of punishment in those cases.  
   Now, I say all of that to address just one case. There are many cases that I could mention here. It would fill more than my allotted 60 minutes, but I want to talk of one case that occurred in my district back in Texas in Port Arthur. It involves a person by the name of Elroy Chester. He was born in Port Arthur in 1969. His criminal record begins in 1987 when he turned 18 years of age. I have before me here, Mr. Speaker, the 4-page resume of Elroy Chester. I don't have time to read all of the life and times of Elroy Chester, but I would like to put his rap sheet, as we call it in the vernacular, into the Record.

   NASA officials have said if the results are public, the airline customers' confidence in air safety will be jeopardized. The taxpayers paid $8 million for this survey, and the results should be open and not held hostage just because the results may reveal bad news. 
   The American public and the airline industry should know what the pilots say about air safety.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, crimes by illegals continue to plague American cities.  
   Jose Vallejo is another illegal charged with a vicious crime, this time rape of a 4-year-old in Illinois. The judge in that case set a $150,000 bond, and the defendant actually made the bond; but ICE arrested the individual and took him to an immigration judge for deportation. Vallejo begged the immigration judge to deport him so he wouldn't have to be tried in Illinois for the State charge. The judge, unaware of the rape charges, agreed and ordered Vallejo immediately deported back to Mexico. But before Vallejo could pull off this legalized jail break from Illinois, he was rearrested to stand charges on the rape case. 
   Federal authorities should not order illegals like Vallejo deported until they have been tried and served prison time for their crimes in State criminal courts; then they should be deported, otherwise more illegals will agree to be deported before their criminal trials and try to fraudulently avoid U.S. justice and the consequences of their crimes by hiding in their own homeland.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about immigration chaos that is occurring in this country. 
   There has been a lot of talk about immigration, border security and all of the problems that are occurring. But let's talk about one that has maybe slipped through the cracks and we don't hear too much about. 
   We have people in this country that have come from foreign nations that are illegally in the United States. Some of those people are criminals. They have gone to penitentiaries throughout this country. Our Federal Government then captures those individuals, takes them to an immigration judge. They are ordered deported back to their nations, and here is what happens: eight of those nations refuse to take back lawfully deported aliens. They won't take back their own citizens. Remember, all of these people are illegally in the United States, many are criminals. 
   How many people are we talking about? Well, we are talking about 136,000 individuals. The cost to the taxpayers to incarcerate those individuals while they are waiting deportation hearings is $83 million. Who are those nations? Well, seven of the eight, Vietnam, China, India, Ethiopia, Iran, Laos, and Jamaica. They get a permanent get-out-of-jail-free card in the United States because we cannot permanently detain these people in jail after they have been ordered deported and their country of origin refuses to take them. 
   So what do we do about it? Well, I think that these countries, any nation that refuses to take back lawfully deported individuals, should not receive foreign aid from the United States. But many of these seven or eight that I have mentioned do not receive foreign aid. So why don't we make sure that these people take back their aliens? Well, we already have a law on the books that says under section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, upon notification by Homeland Security that a country is not accepting or unreasonably delays repatriation of their citizens, the Secretary of State must discontinue granting immigrant or nonimmigrant visas to those citizens of that country until Homeland Security informs the Secretary of State the alien has been repatriated. 
   That sounds good, but the problem is Homeland Security doesn't enforce the rule of law; and the reason they don't enforce the rule of law, according to a letter we have received from Homeland Security, is that there are other sanctions that they must use because we have foreign policy issues specifically with the Chinese. So apparently Homeland Security is not even notifying our own Secretary of State to deport these individuals. 
   Mr. Speaker, this ought not to be. If a person is supposed to be lawfully deported back to their native country, even China, Homeland Security has the obligation to follow the law and tell the Secretary of State so these people can be shipped back to where they belong. 
   It is simple, if you come to America illegally, you go home after you are lawfully deported. If your own nation doesn't want you, then you don't get foreign aid, or you don't get any visas for any purpose. 
   These people that these countries will not take, 136,000, have become our problem because their nations don't even want their own citizens. Our government needs to be more concerned about the rule of law, the cost to the American taxpayer than it is about hurting the feelings of the Chinese on some foreign policy issue. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we urge that Homeland Security follow the law and if you are ordered deported and these nations won't take them, then they shouldn't receive any visas to come to this country for any purpose. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, they tell us that we are facing financial Armageddon. They tell us we must buy our way out of this. They tell us we must act now or the country will fall into the abyss. 
   The plan? A $700 billion bailout will be given to the very people who are responsible for this financial mess: Wall Street money grabbers. And to top it off, the idea for this bailout is from the same financial schemers who themselves are responsible for this chaos. 
   We in Congress have to resolve three issues first: What is the problem? What caused the problem? And what is the solution? 
   We are still debating what the problem is and what caused it. Until we figure that out, we should not come up with a shoot-from-the-hip, quick-draw decision on what to do. 
   We have spent more time in congressional hearings on steroids in baseball than we have in discussing this $700 billion ripoff of the American people. 
   Before we strong-arm American citizens into paying for the sins of New York City financial markets, we need to do more investigation. Then we can come up with the right thing to do and make sound judgments--sound judgments that the so-called experts from Wall Street don't make.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the gloom, doom, and depressed say the economy is in trouble. The naysayer's solution is a big government bailout. 
   Since Uncle Sam has apparently spent the money brought in by income taxpayers, he will just borrow $150 billion and give it away to Americans, many of whom don't even pay income tax. 
   The idea is that Americans will rush out and spend the free money and that will allegedly help the economy. But the last time the Feds gave away money, 75 percent of the recipients paid off personal debt rather than go shopping at the mall. 
   And where is Uncle Sam going to borrow $150 billion? Probably from Communist China, who already owns much of our debt. You know, the country that sells toys to America that contain lead. 
   How does borrowing billions with interest expecting our kids to pay off our debt make us better off? The big spending gimmick has all of the earmarks of vote pandering. 
   No individual or country can spend money it doesn't have and then blissfully claim economic victory.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, on September 11th, America honored those murdered by people who kill in the name of religion. 
   Americans held solemn tributes, prayers, and raised Old Glory across the plains and prairies of this heartland. But no American flags were displayed by students at Hobbton High School in North Carolina. The superintendent of this government school district banned the display of any country's flag on the clothing of students. Dr. Hobbs said disruptions have been caused in the school by the wearing of certain national flags. So on this almost holy day of September 11th, no American flags were allowed on clothes at this American school. 
   Dr. Hobbs, if you are going to ban the display or the wearing of flags, ban foreign ones, not the ones that fly over this Nation--the American flag. 
   Have we become so timidly concerned about offending foreigners that we now disrespect our Nation by banning the American flag? This unpatriotic paranoia is an insult to this Nation and the students of your school, and the superintendent should be ashamed. Mr. Hobbs, Betsy Ross would not be proud of you.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (DREAM ACT--BAD DREAM -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, there are some in Congress who have gone to sleep and blissfully are dreaming of ways to get more illegals benefits that American taxpayers are going to have to pay for. 
   It's called the DREAM Act, or specifically the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act. You notice that word ``alien.'' It only applies to aliens illegally in the United States, not to American citizens and not to foreign nationals who are here legally. It's a bill to give preference to illegals in our public universities. 
   Here's how it works under normal circumstances: Most States require that if you are not a resident of their State, you pay out-of-State tuition to go to their public universities. For example, if you are from New Jersey or from India and you go to school at Texas University, you pay out-of-State tuition because you are not from Texas. Most public universities have this rule. 
   The DREAM Act, however, will do something differently. It applies only to folks who are illegally in the country and who can attest that they came before they were the age of 16. If so, this person will be able to get a green card, later to get a permanent residence card, and then after that get a green card for the parents of this illegal who brought this child into the United States illegally in the first place. 
   It gives priorities to illegals over American citizens and foreign nationals who are legally in the country. It discriminates against Americans. It discriminates against foreign students because it only applies to illegals who are here so that they can go to our public universities and pay in-State tuition because if you are from some other State or some foreign nation and legally in the country, you pay out-of-State tuition, which, of course, is more. 
   It seems to me this violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. It treats illegals who are violating the law by being here in the United States already better than Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, as college costs continue to soar, most Americans who have kids that go to college have to foot that bill. I just had my four children finish college not too long ago and just paid off the last college loan. I have one daughter who is still paying on her college loan after she received her doctorate degree. 
   There are many Americans who will not be able to go to college because it now costs too much for them to go. But the dreamers want it to cost even more because they want us to subsidize illegals so they can go to school with in-State tuition. 
   This silly law goes further. It repeals a law that this body signed into law in 1996. In 1996, the legislation was enacted by Congress, started in this House, stating that States cannot give preference to illegals and let them pay in-State tuition unless those same States treat foreign nationals who are legally in the country and out-of-State students, students from other States, the same way. The law applied saying you have to treat everybody equally and you have to treat Americans the same as illegals if you let them go to your university with in-State tuition. 
   In spite of this 1996 law, there are 10 States who defy this law and have ignored the law and have allowed in-State tuition for illegals. Those 10 States: California; unfortunately, my home State of Texas; Illinois; Oklahoma; Utah; Washington; New Mexico; Kansas; Nebraska; and New York. You see, these 10 States violate Federal law because they already allow in-State tuition for illegals that are in their State. 
   This is called ``nullification.'' That's a legal term, Mr. Speaker, which means that a State ignores or passes legislation contrary to Federal law. Nullification is not a new concept. It started over 150 years ago when several southern States decided they could nullify Federal laws that they didn't like.     
   And so one reason for the Great War between the States was because of the nullification concept where States voted laws that were contrary to Federal law. 
   So this DREAM Act will legalize the conduct of these 10 States. It will then give amnesty and in-state tuition to illegals in this country at the detriment of American students and legal foreign students. Mr. Speaker, this ought not to be. Americans should not have to pay the cost for the education of illegals in this country. And illegals that come to this country and get in our universities should not get to pay less than Americans who live in other States. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Officer Timoshenko chose to be an American citizen and legally immigrated to the United States from Russia in 1993. He followed the law to get here and then became a protector of the law as a member of New York City's Finest. 
   Around 2:30 a.m., Tuesday, July 10, 2007 Officers Timoshenko and Herman Yan stopped an SUV on a dark New York City street. As the officers approached the SUV, the passengers turned and gunned down both officers. Officer Yan was shot in the chest and arm, and he will recover. Russel Timoshenko was shot twice in the face, and Saturday the 23-year-old officer died. He had been a New York City cop for only 18 months. Two outlaws have been arrested for murder. 
   Mr. Speaker, Officer Russel Timoshenko was the American Dream, a naturalized citizen who dedicated his life and service to American citizens. America can use more American immigrant citizens who wear the badge.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (RAMOS/COMPEAN CASE -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, a long awaited Senate judiciary hearing on the prosecution of border agents Ramos and Compean occurred today. I was impressed with the Chair, Senator Diane Feinstein from California, and the questioning of Senator John Cornyn of Texas at the hearing. 
   The hearing brought to light the overzealous, overreacting and overreaching prosecution of these two Border Patrol agents, Ramos and Compean. It also showed us and the American public the difficulty our border protectors have on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
   Chief Aguilar of the Border Patrol said today that violence against border agents has increased. In just the first 4 days of last week, 11 assaults occurred against border agents. Over 2,000 assaults have occurred in the last 2 1/2 years, and 12 officers have been killed in the last few years. 
   Not only is the border violent because of drug cartels, but violence occurs against these border agents. The border is not Disneyland, but the U.S. Attorney's Office showed they are living in Never Neverland by their relentless determination to see that these agents went to prison for 11 and 12 years a piece for just doing their job on the U.S.-Mexico border. 
   Much was said today, but I want to concentrate on the U.S. Government's main witness, the drug dealer who appears to have been a bought-and-paid-for witness that received immunity from prosecution. He received a get-out-of-jail-free card, received free medical attention for his wounds at the taxpayers' expense, and blanket amnesty to cross and recross the Texas-Mexico border whenever he wished. All this so he would testify against the two border agents, Ramos and Compean. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a former judge, it has been my experience that when prosecutors make deals with criminals in return for testimony, they usually get the testimony they want from the criminal, and the same is to be said in this case here. 
   These agents were sent to prison because one of them shot a drug dealer bringing in $1 million worth of drugs into the United States. The agents probably violated some Homeland Security policies, and maybe they should have been sanctioned or even fired, but to let the drug dealer go free because the agents violated a policy was an error in judgment on the part of our own government. 
   And the U.S. Attorney's Office had two choices, Mr. Speaker. They had the choice to prosecute a drug dealer bringing in $1 million worth of drugs, or they had the choice to prosecute two border agents that violated some policy, and our government chose poorly. 
   Of course, the Mexican Government got involved in this case and wrote an arrogant letter demanding prosecution by our government. It seems to me this may be the basis for the prosecution. 
   Let me tell you a little bit about this drug dealer. He received immunity from prosecution, but part of his deal was that he would cooperate with the U.S. Border Patrol and Federal prosecutors. The cooperation? Well, he never would tell who he was working for. He named no names of the drug cartels. He did not cooperate at all. And while he was waiting to testify in this case, he criss-crossed the Texas-Mexico border and brought in another load of drugs worth almost $1 million, and the Feds kept that from the jury. 
   Why wasn't it important to know about this second case? Because the entire prosecution was based on the testimony of the government's star witness, and the jury had the right to know that this drug dealer brought in another load of drugs while waiting to testify. So to judge his credibility as a witness, the jury had the right to know that, and that evidence was kept out at the insistence of the U.S. prosecutors.

   A policy of surrender and failure in securing Iraq would hold catastrophic consequences for the United States and the Iraqi people. We should be focused on victory, not pandering to the ``peace at any price crowd.'' 
   Those who want retreat, defeat and withdrawal while in the midst of this battle for Iraq have yet to understand that there are consequences for appeasement, and they are bad for the United States and the Iraqi people. Retreat will not bring victory and it will never bring peace.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (OPEN BORDER CHAOS -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, recent memos that have been released finally by the Justice Department regarding certain situations in the Federal Government, specifically in the U.S. Attorney's office, have revealed numerous things. No wonder the Justice Department fought releasing these e-mails and memos. 
   We now understand that the prosecution of Federal drug cases along the Texas-Mexico border has dropped dramatically. All the way from Texas to California, prosecutions of drug cases have dropped. In some places up to 25 percent of drug cases are not prosecuted that were prosecuted just a year ago. What is happening is the Federal Government is not able to prosecute drug smugglers, and they are asking the States to prosecute those cases. 
   Many States--especially those counties on the border with Texas and Mexico, same was true in Arizona and Mexico, New Mexico and California and Mexico--don't have the resources to prosecute all those drug cases. 
   So what is happening is many cases are dropping through the cracks, all because the Federal Government has dropped 25 percent of prosecution of drug smugglers into the United States because they say they are overwhelmed with cases. 
   How many cases are we talking about? What types of drug cases? Well, in some cases they are prosecuting cases of only 500 pounds or more of marijuana. Five hundred pounds, that is just a number. But we can relate it to money, and 500 pounds of marijuana is worth about $400,000. A drug smuggler smuggling in $400,000 worth of dope or less, in some cases is getting a pass by the Federal Government because they say they are too overwhelmed with the illegal entry into the United States by drug smugglers. 
   If the States don't prosecute those cases, as many States are not able to do, what is happening is those drug smugglers are getting a get-out-of-jail-free card. 
   Drug smugglers are not stupid. They can weigh their marijuana. So all they got to do, before they bring that dope into the United States, is make sure they have less than 500 pounds, because if they are caught by our border agents, the Federal Government won't prosecute them because the Federal Government says we have too many cases. 
   This is absurd; this is nonsense. This is chaos. Law enforcement is mad about this, and rightfully so. One former DEA official in the El Paso sector made the comment that if the Feds decline to prosecute, and the State lacks the resources to prosecute these drug smugglers, they just go free. You have people violating the drug laws who now get away with it in the United States, all because the Federal Government doesn't do its job. The job is bigger than prosecuting drug smugglers. The job is protect the borders, and our Federal Government doesn't do that.  
   They claim that they are not prosecuting drug cases because they are prosecuting folks that illegally enter the United States. But maybe that is not true either. These same memos now reveal that in the State of Texas an illegal coming into the United States has to be captured six times before they are actually prosecuted criminally for being in the United States. 
   What happens is if they are caught the first six times, they are just taken home. Of course, they come right back to the United States. They are not being prosecuted. In Arizona, sometimes it is up to 11 times illegals enter the United States before they are criminally prosecuted for being here illegally. 
   So what is the Federal Government doing? Well, we do know they are spending a lot of their time prosecuting border protectors. They are spending a lot of taxpayer money to make deals, back-room deals with drug smugglers so that they can prosecute the likes of border agents Ramos and Compean, deputy sheriffs like Gilmer Hernandez, individuals who are enforcing the law. 
   The Federal Government's duty is to protect the dignity of this Nation. It needs to protect the border from everybody coming into the United States illegally, no matter the reason, but especially those people who are criminals, especially those drug smugglers who bring drugs into the United States and make a profit off of that human weakness, and now giving them a pass, because they are not bringing in enough dope? This is absurd. Not prosecuting illegals until the sixth or eleventh time because we don't supposedly have the resources is absurd, and it is all because we don't protect the dignity of the United States. 
   Border control in this country doesn't seem to even exist. Third World nations protect their borders better than the United States, and the United States protects the borders of other nations like Korea. Why don't we protect our own border? 
   While all of this is going on down there on the lawless border of the United States and Mexico, now we hear about a new reform package, a comprehensive immigration plan that is supposed to have little border security, supposed to have a lot of amnesty and supposed to have a whole lot more guest workers in the United States. That is not going to work. 
   What we need is the National Guard on the border. We need to protect the borders, the dignity of the United States. 
   And that's just the way it is.

The damage is to Duke University who acted too hastily by suspending the players due to media hysteria. The damage is to those who are actual victims of crime based on race. 
   DAs who violate their oath to seek justice and then flaunt their power by relentlessly prosecuting people in spite of the facts, all to grab a headline, should be held personally liable in our courts and be accountable for their actions by removal from office and permanent suspension from the practice of law.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (GOLD STAR MOTHERS -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, yesterday, under the bright sun and blue sky of the Texas Sunday afternoon, American flags flew in the silent breeze over thousands of quiet marble uniform tombstones in the Houston National Cemetery. This is where Texans bury their war dead, men and women who go off to war for America. 
   In the center of the immaculately kept cemetery, a tribute of sacrifice was being made to the living: Those mothers who lost their children in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Mothers of Texas who gave their children that died in their youth so the rest of us could live in safety were honored on this Gold Star Mothers' Day. 
   I was present along with Congressman Gene Green and Congressman Nick Lampson and Congressman Kevin Brady to honor these special ladies. We, like those present, were emotionally affected. 
   Gold Star Moms are what we call them, is a mother who lost a child in combat. This concept started in World War II when Grace Seibold learned on Christmas Eve 1918 that her aviator son was killed in aerial combat in France. Grace Seibold directed her grief and sorrow to helping wounded doughboys in local D.C. hospitals. She formed the Gold Star Mothers to give support for other such moms. 
   During World War I, if a son had gone off to war in the War to End All Wars, as it was called, a banner was hung in front of the home in the window for each son in the military. This banner had a blue star in the center of it. If the son was killed, a gold star was superimposed over the blue one. 
   During World War II, my Grandmother Poe hung such a banner with a blue star in the front window of her home in the country. My dad went off to war when he was just 18. When my grandmother died, it was one of the few items she had saved. That banner never had to have a gold star placed on it because my dad returned safely. 
   Madam Speaker, here is a banner of a Gold Star Mother. It has the name of the soldier that was killed, William  Amundson, Jr. He was killed in Afghanistan. He was from Woodlands, Texas. He was a corporal in the United States Army. 
   The blue star banners are very similar to this except in the middle there is a blue star rather than a gold star. And when that son or daughter is killed in combat, the gold star is superimposed over the blue one. These banners have been carried throughout all of America's wars since World War I and applies to sons and daughters killed in war. 
   So yesterday these mothers of the fallen were there. And standing guard around them were the Patriot Guard motorcycle members, rugged Vietnam veterans who escort the fallen to this cemetery for burial. There was a 21-gun salute. Then after all of the speeches, these women were given yellow roses from Texas and the buglers played Taps for the fallen. 
   Madam Speaker, as a father of four, I can think of nothing worse than to lose one of my own kids. No parent wants their son or daughter killed in unknown foreign lands. No parent wants their child to predecease them, and no parent wants their child to die in their youth. But it happens, and the grief can only be understood by other such parents. 
   As Congressman Green said yesterday, ``Even the greatest heart surgeon in the world, Dr. Michael DeBakey, cannot repair such a broken heart of a mother like this.'' 
   Mothers are special, especially the mothers of those who wear the American uniform. Those who keep statistics on the last words of soldiers say more often than not that the dying words of many soldiers in combat is, ``Mother, mother.'' 
   It seems to me the strongest bond in all of creation is the bond between a mother and her child. The good Lord made it that way on purpose, and when that bond is broken by the loss of a child, that wound just never heals. 
   Madam Speaker, one out of every nine people in the military is from the State of Texas, and about 400 Texans, 10 percent of the total killed of 4,000, have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet sons and daughters throughout America continue to join our military knowing that they will no doubt go into the desert of the sun and the valley of the gun, and they leave behind their parents, their mothers. 
   So as we show honor and respect to America's children who serve, let us show American compassion and ultimate gratitude for the mothers of those troops who display the Gold Star sacrifice from their windows. And the next time we pass a house with one of these gold stars, one of these 4,000 throughout the United States, and they are being displayed in the window, maybe we should stop and say a prayer and say ``thank you'' because of that special mother who gave that child for the rest of us. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   It seems that over 200 marines from the combat fields of Iraq flew into Oakland, California, and were not allowed to deplane into the airport. They were forced off the plane between two runways and had to sit in the grass for 3 hours while waiting to fly to Hawaii. The troops had flown from Iraq via Kuwait, Germany, and JFK Airport. They had already been completely screened by Customs and TSA at JFK, but the officials at Oakland Airport wouldn't let them into the terminal. 
   One marine said no explanation was ever given. Interestingly enough, reports say this not the first time Oakland banned the U.S. military from its airport. 
   Most airports welcome our returning troops with patriotism, cheers, flags and enthusiastic applause. But not in Oakland. They should be ashamed. They should apologize to each marine, and Congress needs to find out why the marines were treated so poorly and even consider prohibiting Federal funds from going to this airport if it is shown that the airport is antimilitary.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (SYRIA AND NORTH KOREA CONSPIRE TO BUILD NUCLEAR WEAPONS -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, North Korea and Syria were working together with Pakistan rogue scientist Abdul Khan to build a nuclear reactor in Syria, capable of producing plutonium for two nuclear weapons within a year of when it was destroyed by Israeli jets in September of 2007. 
   Israel, by the way, has not confirmed or denied the air strikes. But Israel acted in self-defense and self-interest because of the fact that Israel is so close to Syria. 
   Mr. Speaker, here is a map of the area. We have Syria and, of course, we have Israel and Iraq and then, of course, Iran on the other side. And here is the location in Eastern Syria where the nuclear facility was being built, with the aid of the North Koreans. From that location, in Alkibar facility, it is only 450 miles to Tel Aviv, where the majority of the Israelis live.     
   This whole area, of course, is in somewhat of a turmoil because of the fact you have Syria and the rogue dictator in Iran working together with the North Koreans to facilitate the development of nuclear weapons for all three countries. 
   The CIA has reported recently that North Korea is building Syria a reactor similar to the one that they have in North Korea. And North Korea then helped the Syrians cover up the results of the bombing after the reactor was destroyed. 
   Here are four photographs that the CIA has released and declassified just this week. Over on the top corner here is a photograph of North Korea's nuclear reactor that is capable of producing plutonium. You will see right next to it Syria's nuclear reactor as it was being built. It was built with the same floor plan, the same design as the North Korean facility that is in North Korea. This photograph was taken of Syria's reactor shortly before it was blown up. 
   Here is an aerial photograph of Syria's reactor, and you can see, Mr. Speaker, it's camouflaged to the extent that it looks just like a boxed building just in the eastern part of Syria with nothing anywhere close to it. And after Israeli jets came in and bombed the facility, this photograph on the bottom corner shows the results of the Syrian reactor after it was bombed by the Israeli jets. 
   And what is interesting, after the Israeli jets came in and bombed this facility, the North Koreans and the Syrians started working together very quickly to destroy what was left of this facility and bury it in the desert and then put in its place another facility, a building that looks just like this one but obviously, based on intelligence, is just a shell and not really used for any purpose whatsoever. 
   The purpose, of course, to build the second building was to let the world know that they didn't have anything in this area, but of course, we know that they buried all of their equipment and all of their nuclear devices or equipment, I should say, in the desert underneath the bombing that was done by the Israeli pilots. 
   So it's important for us to be aware of the contact and the working of North Korea with Syria. It is not a recent development. North Korea started working with Syria to build this facility in 2001, and they have continued to work with them until they started actually building this facility that would be capable of producing plutonium and at least to be able to build two nuclear weapons within a year. 
   North Korea is a nuclear threat and appears to help any nation with evil intentions, and the whole world needs to know about it. The countries of Iran, North Korea, and now Syria need to be known to all the world that they are nations with hearts that are fatally built on mischief and with malice aforethought. They build nuclear facilities with no redeemable, peaceful intentions. The normal, peaceful countries of our planet, especially those in the Middle East, cannot allow these three nations to have nuclear nonsense continue. They are on a path of destruction for at least somebody else, other than themselves, if their intentions are not stopped. 
   As for the nameless Israeli bomber pilots who flew these missions to destroy this nuclear facility capable of later being able to build nuclear weapons, they are thanked for their job well done, and the world needs to be aware that North Korea, Syria, and Iran seem to continue to work together to thwart world peace by building facilities that are capable of destruction for other countries, especially their neighbors. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE AMAZING BORDER SHERIFFS -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the United States is intending to send $1.4 billion in taxpayer money to Mexico to fight the cartel drug criminals on the border. This may sound good on the surface, but there are problems with sending money south of the border. It's an unfortunate reality that border corruption exists between Mexican law enforcement and the drug cartels. America has no assurance that some of that money or equipment won't end up in the very hands of the people we're trying to stop. 
   This $1.4 billion would be better spent if it stayed in America. It should go to the Border Sheriffs Coalition. These are hard-nosed lawmen from Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego, California, that operate on a shoestring budget, and they know better how to stop the drug smugglers and coyotes from entering their counties. I have met with them numerous times along our southern border. These border lawmen are amazing crime fighters and protectors of America. 
   The 18 Texas border sheriffs unanimously believe that, ``the culture of corruption and smuggling both in narcotics and humans and the threat of terrorism on the border will increase'' if this money is sent to Mexico. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's help out our first responders and give them the tools to fight crime on the border and keep the money in America. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I am proud to have introduced this National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month resolution with my friend, Congresswoman Baldwin from Wisconsin. I appreciate her leadership in bringing this issue to the national attention of all of us. 
   When I was an assistant district attorney back in Texas, I prosecuted rapists for 8 years, and then I sat on the bench as a judge in Houston for 22 years, hearing felony criminal cases.     
   During those 30 years, I learned a lot about sexual assault and the devastation it has on victims. 
   Probably one of the best statements ever made about a sexual assault and how it affects the victim was a sexual assault victim who was 90 years old and had been raped. She testified on the witness stand that what happened to her ``was a fate worse than death.'' And, yes, many times it is a fate worse than murder itself, the crime that occurs against these individuals throughout our country. It devastates the victim, and after the crime occurs the victim faces a lifetime of battle to recover. In many cases, sexual assault or rape is an attempt on the part of the offender to destroy the inner soul and being of the victim, and sometimes that actually occurs. 
   When I came to Congress, I founded the Victims' Rights Caucus to advocate on behalf of victims so that this caucus could be a voice for all crime victims. The gentlewoman from Wisconsin who introduced this resolution is a member of this caucus and continues to be a leader in public awareness. 
   With this resolution, I hope we can educate the public about this horrendous crime, but also thank the outstanding victim advocates who hold the victim's hand from the time the crime is committed and sometimes throughout the entire episode until the trial is over with. 
   Rape and sexual assault statistics are difficult to determine because many victims are ashamed and afraid to come forward and report these crimes. There are outstanding support services in this country, like the National Sexual Assault Hotline, and many, many hundreds of thousands of crisis centers throughout the country, but still sexual assault victims are reluctant to come forward. By drawing attention to sexual violence and speaking about it on the national level here in our Congress, we can encourage victims to report these crimes and get the help they need. 
   Predators intimidate and threaten victims with the hope that these victims will never tell anyone about it. Victims need to understand that American citizens support victims and are on their side. Of those reported sexual assaults, there are haunting statistics. Three out of four victims knew the perpetrator that committed the crime against them. The rapist is not a stranger. 
   I would like to relate one case that occurred many years ago when I was prosecuting these types of cases. I will call this young lady Lisa, to protect the privacy of her family. She was a student at one of our universities in Houston. She left the university one night and stopped at a service station for help, because her car was having difficulty in moving down the highway. 
   She came in contact with an individual that I will call Luke. He was not a service station attendant. He was just a criminal. He kidnapped Lisa. He sexually assaulted her. He pistol-whipped her. He beat her so bad that he thought he had killed her, and when he was arrested, he was mad that he hadn't killed her. He was captured and he was tried. A jury in Houston, Texas, convicted him and gave him 99 years in the Texas penitentiary, which he earned and deserved. 
   But Lisa's life fell apart. She never went back to school. She lost her job. Her husband, the kind of individual he was, sued her for divorce, got all the children and left the State. She started using drugs, first alcohol and then everything else. Not long after the trial, I received a phone call from Lisa's mother telling me that she had taken her own life, and she left a note that I still have today that says, ``I am tired of running from Luke Johnson in my nightmares.'' 
   You see, crime occurs. Victims are victimized. But sometimes they live a short life thereafter because of the crime that has occurred. And no crime is more devastating to a victim than sexual assault. 
   So it is important that we designate April as National Sexual Assault and Awareness Month so we can educate our fellow citizens on these statistics and encourage rape and sexual assault victims to no longer be afraid. We need to promote justice for sexual assault victims, because justice is what we do in America. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, after returning from Iraq over the Easter weekend, I want to report my observations. The military situation is progressing positively with the Iraqi Security Forces, the National Police, and the new-found group of citizen soldiers called the Sons of Iraq doing ever improving job of securing their own nation. 
   The Iraqis and the U.S. troops are working better together as both nations use their troops in combined patrols. U.S. Commander and Four Star General Petraeus understands not only the military situation, but the complex political situation as well. The Iraqi government is showing signs of more stability than it has in previous months. 
   My observations of the U.S. troops: they have very high morale, a strong sense of purpose, and are well trained and ready to meet U.S. objectives in Iraq. The most notable concern I saw was the ever increasing interference and influence of Iran. The Iranians are funding insurgents and supplying weapons from small arms to rockets to any group that will cause chaos. It appears Iran wants instability in Iraq to further its own political and military objectives.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE MURDER OF TWO TEENAGE GIRLS -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the year was 1993, 15 years ago, when two teenage girls, Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena, 14 years of age and 16 years of age, were walking home one evening. Unfortunately for them, when they took a shortcut, they came across a gang by the name of the Black and Whites. Their gang leader was Jose Ernesto Medellin. 
   He and his fellow gangsters kidnapped these two teenage girls, brutally assaulted them, taunted them, raped them for over an hour, and then with the shoelaces from the tennis shoes of these two girls, they made a noose and strangled both of these girls. 
   The brutal killing that took place, Madam Speaker, as you are aware being from Houston, incensed the people of the Houston area, especially the way in which these two girls met their death. But 5 days later, Jose Medellin was arrested, and in his possession, he had on his wrist a Mickey Mouse watch that he had stolen from Jennifer Ertman, his token of the murder of a little girl. He was proud of what he had done. He was so proud of it he even bragged about it and confessed to the Houston Police Department of raping and killing these two girls after he was properly warned. 
   He was tried for capital murder. The State was seeking the death penalty, and 12 jurors in a court in Houston, Texas, convicted him and gave him the death penalty, which he earned and deserved for what he did to these two teenage girls. He appealed his case all the way to Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court of the United States upheld his conviction saying it was lawful. But that was not the end of the story. 
   Because, you see, 15 years later Jose Ernesto Medellin is still alive. And back when this trial occurred 15 years ago, I met the families of these two teenage girls, and they to this day continue to suffer and wonder if justice will ever be served. And the reason that he has not met his just reward is because he appealed his case again to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court right down the street last week upheld the conviction for a second time. 
   His second appeal was somewhat unique because, you see, it turns out Jose Ernesto Medellin, who was fluent in English, apparently is illegally from the nation of Mexico, and he was an illegal immigrant when he committed this homicide. Back in the days of 1993, the Houston Police Department didn't even ask people what nationality they were when they arrested them, but be that as it may, the Mexican Government then decided to sue the United States of America in the World Court, claiming that the State of Texas should have told Jose Ernesto Medellin that he had the right to consult with the Mexican consulate before he confessed. Of course, the Houston Police Department never told him he couldn't consult with the Mexican consulate. He was warned properly under Federal law and under State law. 
   But the Mexican Government was not satisfied with that after the conviction was upheld, and 10 years later, they filed this lawsuit in the World Court. And the World Court ruled that the State of Texas had to retry Jose Ernesto Medellin for capital murder because he was not told he should have been allowed to talk to his Mexican consulate. 
   Of course, this gets more complicated because, you see, the President of the United States intervened on behalf of the nation of Mexico. After this decision was made in the World Court, the President of the United States told the courts in Texas to follow the World Court order, retry Jose Ernesto Medellin for capital murder, and the Texas courts, in all due respect to the administration, ignored the President's request because, as they said, the judicial branch is independent of the executive branch, and the President has no jurisdiction over telling any court, much less Texas courts, what to do. 
   It turns out that Jose Ernesto Medellin is not the only Mexican national on death row in the United States. There are 54 others who have been tried throughout the country, most of them in Texas, and have been given the death penalty for heinous crimes committed against people in the United States. 
   So, after that second case came before the Supreme Court, the issue was, after being sued in the World Court by  Mexico, whether or not the State of Texas must abide by a World Court decision telling them to retry a case. And the second issue was, does the President, any President, have the authority, as the executive branch of government, to order a State court to do anything, including retry somebody for a case where they have been found convicted. 
   Well, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the World Court opinion has no bearing in Texas courts and that the President of the United States, the executive branch, has no jurisdiction over Texas courts to tell them what to do. The International Court of Justice, as the World Court is called, lacks jurisdiction in this case to order the courts of Texas to do anything because, you see, part of the problem was Jose Ernesto Medellin never complained for over 10 years that he didn't have the chance to talk to his Mexican consulate, and as most lawyers know in the legal profession, and as a former trial judge, if you don't object at the trial, you've waived that right indefinitely. 
   So, Madam Speaker, maybe justice will be served in this case if Jose Ernesto Medellin will meet the fate he deserves, and maybe our Federal Government will stop taking the wrong side of this issue of supporting illegal immigrants over people in the United States, like little girls who are murdered. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (ESTABLISHING MARCH 2008 AS NATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I also want to thank the chairman for moving this piece of legislation. 
   I introduced this legislation to declare March as National Criminal Justice Month, and the purpose is to educate Americans on how important our justice system is and encourage discussion on how to prevent and respond to criminal conduct. 
   Our criminal justice system employs over 3 million Americans at the local, State and Federal levels of the government. And the word and the emphasis should be on the phrase ``justice system'' because it involves the cooperation of law enforcement and prosecutors, courts, correctional officers, and many other persons. 
   In my former life, I spent 8 years as a prosecutor in the Houston area, and then I spent 22 years on the criminal court bench in Houston, hearing over 25,000 felony cases. 
   When I came to Washington, D.C., I established the bipartisan Victims Rights Caucus to advocate on behalf of crime victims and law enforcement. It is apparent to me that victims need a voice in Congress. They don't have high paid and high-dollar lobbyists; they expect Members of Congress to be their advocates. 
   Each year, millions of Americans become victims of criminal conduct, everything from stealing to homicide, and these individuals do not choose to become victims. They are thrown into the criminal justice system without ever having a say. The devastating consequences of crime remain with the victims long after the crime is over with; and the purpose of the criminal justice system is to provide closure for victims and punish people who commit crimes against the rule of law, which is society's rules of law. 
   I hope this resolution encourages communities to discuss the causes and the consequences and long-term effects of criminal conduct. When a crime occurs, a community must respond by apprehending the individual and ensuring appropriate punishment if that person is found guilty, and, of course, helping the victim that is in need. 
   According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 35 percent of Americans have little or no confidence in our criminal justice system. It is unfortunate that one-third of the people in this country feel that way. If you turn on your local news each night, the first thing that most local newscasts have is the latest crime that has been committed in a neighborhood. It is mostly bad news, and much of that bad news is about criminal conduct. Americans should have more confidence in our criminal justice system. I am convinced that our criminal justice system is the best system in the world. 
   I had the opportunity to visit the former Soviet Union. They don't have a criminal justice system. They just have a system. The same is true with China, when I visited their system on how they administer their laws. There is no justice in that system. It is just a system. 
   And here in the United States, we do have the best criminal justice system in the world on determining the guilt of an individual and giving defendants and victims of crime certain rights in the court, and maintaining the worth of the individual. Every year individuals, communities, businesses, and all levels of government spend millions and billions of dollars administering our justice system. The cost of crime is not cheap, and the aftermath of crime is not cheap either. Yet the price is worth it because of the price we pay to ensure our order, safety and appropriate punishment for those who fail to follow our laws. 
   As my fellow Texan and former judge, Judge Gohmert, has mentioned time and time again, there are numerous cases where we both have seen individuals who have come to the criminal justice system that have been victims of criminal conduct. And long after that trial is over with, even if the offender is convicted and sent to the Texas penitentiary for the maximum period of time, they suffer the repercussions of criminal conduct. Many of them are never able to cope with that conduct, and spend the rest of their lives in desperate hope, and wishing that crime had not occurred against them. 
   We as Americans need to be sensitive to those individuals. We need to be sensitive to the people who live among us who have crime committed against them. 
   So I hope this resolution gets more communities talking about the best way to prevent and respond to crime, and I want to urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (CONGRESS CHOSE POORLY -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, if you tax something, you get less of it. If you subsidize it, you get more of it. So in this day of homegrown energy depletion, Congress made the absurd choice of putting more taxes on American oil companies and, instead, chose to subsidize the special interest groups of unproven, undeveloped, and even nonexistent sources of energy. 
   More taxes means the price of crude oil will rise, not diminish; thus, gasoline prices will rise. This tax will be passed on to us, the consumer. Taxes are always passed on to the consumer. 
   The tax will not encourage, but lessen, domestic oil production. The tax will encourage oil companies to go to some other country to drill for oil and encourage American refineries to move offshore to areas not hostile. 
   The tax will make us more dependent on Third World countries like Dictator Chavez for oil. 
   Congress should lower taxes on U.S. oil companies to encourage domestic production. 
   So Congress had the choice to encourage domestic oil production by opening up places to drill like ANWR and off the coast, or to tax the black gold and lifeblood of our energy--crude oil. Congress chose poorly. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE COLONIZATION OF AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I asked a question tonight, whether or not the United States of America is becoming a colony. A colony is made up of people from one country owing allegiance to their home country, not the country that they're in. And a colony serves the purpose of supporting the home country and exploits the new land. And has this happened to the United States? Have people illegally entered the United States with the purpose of colonizing this country for the benefit of another nation? 
   I think the question is a valid question when it comes to Mexico. We know that the previous President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, actually encouraged illegal entry of his citizens into the United States. His government provided maps and documents so that people could enter illegally into this land. 
   At the border of Texas and Mexico on the Mexican side, you can find numerous markets where an individual can buy documents of identification that are sold so that people can use them when they come into the United States to pretend to be here legally. 
   And when we talk about the issue of immigration and what to do with the people here in this country that are illegally here, we must ask the question, why did they choose to be here illegally as opposed to coming the legal way? The reason may be that many of the illegals don't want to become Americans. Of course this country has a great number of individuals who are legally here that want to be loyal to this country and do the proper thing according to this Nation, but there are many that are here illegally and they're here illegally on purpose. They pledge allegiance to another flag, many to the Mexican flag, not to the American flag. And that is the current problem with many illegals in this Nation; they want to be colonists, not citizens. 
   Part of being an American means that individuals pledge loyalty, wherever they come from, to this Nation, not some other nation. Many of them living in America want to accept the benefits of being in this country, but they don't want to accept the conditions of being an American. They want to remain colonists, not Americans. They refuse to learn the language, they refuse to assimilate, and most importantly, they refuse to be loyal to this Nation. 
   And the effects of the colonization of our land means that the money that these illegals make does not stay in this Nation. Like colonies in the past, the money is returned to their home country. Many statistics report that over $22 billion a year is sent back to Mexico in the form of money sent from this Nation, from Mexican citizens in this Nation returning their money to their home country. They are feeding the Mexican economy at the expense of the American economy. 
   Since many of them deal in a cash economy, they don't pay taxes the way legals do and American citizens. In fact, there is an organized system in this Nation where money is shipped back to Mexico through a complicit alliance of the banking industry in this country. And many of them do not contribute to the social programs provided for Americans and legal immigrants. They don't pay into the health care system, the education, and many of them don't pay into Social Security, but they receive those benefits at a drain to the American economy. It sounds like colonization of this Nation; they reap the benefits without the responsibility of being American. And the American taxpayer is stuck with the bill. 
   We have heard that illegals do contribute to the economy, that they pay their taxes, and we've heard the other extreme that they don't pay anything. If we're to believe the Heritage Foundation, they say that for every dollar that an illegal pays into the American tax system, they get in return from benefits $3. So yet that extra $2 the American taxpayer is caught with. 
   And of course this has happened before in history. If we use the example of the African continent, the African nations were raided by the Europeans in the last several centuries. They became colonies of Europe. Those colonies ended up, the minerals, the diamonds, the ivory and the gold were all taken from those nations and returned to the mother countries; sent it back to Europe so their country, the mother country, could benefit and the colonies were bankrupt. The results are known; they left many of those African nations in ruins, and many of these nations are still struggling to recover because of the colonization of their nation. 
   So, the United States, Mr. Speaker, should not be a colony of Mexico. Imperialism of Mexico is not welcomed in this Nation. And this country needs to get back to some basics of securing both of our borders, the northern and southern border. We should not grant amnesty to people who don't want to be Americans, and I'm referring to those illegals that are in the United States. We should strengthen requirements to enter this country. And we should end the good deal for illegals and the bad deal for American citizens and American legal immigrants. I suggest that the colonization by third world countries of the United States must end. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the blissfully ignorant British bureaucrats have decided to ignore who they are fighting. In the name of political correctness, Prime Minister Brown is refusing to acknowledge acts of terror are committed by Islamic radical insurgents. 
   The British Government has banned the use of words such as ``Muslim'' and ``war on terror.'' Acts of terrorism are now referred to as ``criminal acts.'' The Islamic extremists who commit the attacks are being referred to as ``communities.'' 
   Islamic terrorists can go ahead and continue the barrage of terror because proper Britain won't even acknowledge who they are. 
   When did the great nation of Britain turn into the timid, politically sensitive, fearful country that is more concerned about hurting the feelings of terrorists than protecting their island? It's time for Britain to boldly name the enemy at the gate, to turn around and fight for their country, not hide behind niceties. 
   Winston Churchill wasn't afraid to name and fight the Nazis when he said, ``We shall go to the end; we will defend our island whatever the cost will be; we will fight on the beaches; we will fight in the fields and on the streets. We will never surrender.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, in the small border town of Rocksprings, Texas, where drug smugglers and human smugglers sneak across the Rio Grande into America, lone Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez was on patrol. In the stillness of the vast night, a speeding Suburban runs a red light. Deputy Hernandez, 25, stops the vehicle, but suddenly, without warning, the vehicle takes off. Deputy Hernandez says the vehicle tried to run him down. The lawman fires several shots, one of which shoots out the rear tire, just like in the movies. 
   The vehicle stops, and eight or nine illegals jump out and take off running into the sagebrush. One illegal had a minor injury from a bullet. The U.S. Government rounds up six or seven of the illegals and, guess what, prosecutes Deputy Hernandez, claiming he recklessly discharged his firearm and uses the illegals as witnesses against the lawman during a trial. 
   Citizens of his town are mad. One said, ``Our deputy's in jail for doing his job.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, another example of how the Federal Government is more concerned about people illegally invading America than it is about the men who protect America. Once again, our government is on the wrong side of the border war.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (BORDER AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, it is said that justice is the one thing you should always find. You have to saddle up the boys, you have to draw a hard line. Justice is the one thing you should always find. 
   Those lyrics are from a song by Willie Nelson, not quite the legal scholar most of us would think, but a true statement nonetheless. 
   But justice is the one thing you can't find on the Texas-Mexico border, and recent events show that. 
   Not too long ago, two of our border agents, Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos were doing their job on the Texas-Mexico border, on patrol keeping illegals out of the United States. 
   They come in contact with a drug dealer who sees them and takes off running in his van. His van happened to have 700-plus pounds of marijuana. That is not just for personal use, Mr. Speaker, that is worth $1 million on the market in Texas. He sees the two drug agents. He flees, jumps out of the van and tries to cross the Rio Grande River. The facts are in dispute as to what occurs. There is a fight with the agents. The agents say the drug dealer had a weapon pointed at them. After the smoke cleared, the drug dealer gets shot in the buttocks and runs back to Mexico. 
   I say: Well done, border agents. Give them a medal. But that is not what our Federal Government decided to do. Our Federal Government decided to go to Mexico, find this drug dealer, a habitual offender that brings drugs into the United States, and give him immunity to testify against the two border agents, bring him back to the United States and let him testify in a so-called trumped up civil rights violation. 
   But while waiting to testify, he crosses the border again and given immunity, yes, a second time for bringing drugs into the United States. 
   After the trial was over with, both of these drug agents were prosecuted for enforcing the law, doing the job that they are supposed to. A week from today, these two border agents will be taken to the Federal penitentiary to serve 10 and 11 years respectively. 
   Mr. Speaker, this ought not to be. Our Federal Government chose the wrong side in this case. They chose the enemy side in this case. 
   Mr. Speaker, what are our border agents to do when somebody flees, being a drug dealer, and tries to go back to Mexico? What are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to say, ``Halt in the name of the law''? 
   Mr. Speaker, those days are over in this country. 
   So either they can enforce the law or they can't enforce the law. Enforcing the law on the Texas border is unenforceable. It is a lawless border because our Federal Government always chooses the wrong side. 
   Today, Jose Compean and his wife, Patty, were here in Washington, DC. Many Members of Congress in this House on both sides talked to them about the facts of this case and their lives and how it has been changed. All Jose Compean ever wanted to do was be a border agent for the United States and protect the dignity of this country, and he is being punished for that. 
   So our government had a choice, the choice to be on the side of the drug dealer or the border agents; the choice to be on the side of the illegals or the legals; the side of crime or crime fighters. And our government chose poorly, Mr. Speaker. This ought not to be. 
   My prior career before becoming a Member of Congress was as a judge in Texas. I heard over 25,000 felony cases of all types. And I am here to tell you, based on what I know about this case, a great injustice has occurred not only to our border agents but to our country. 
   Our Federal Government needs to take a stand for border security, enforce the rule of law and support those that we have put down to the border with few utensils to protect the dignity of this country. 
   Yes, Mr. Speaker, justice is the one thing we should always find. We had better find it on the Texas-Mexico border, or injustice will rule the day and this country will pay for it by failing to enforce the rule of law in failing to keep illegal drug dealers out of this Nation. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (AMNESTY NEEDED FOR BORDER PATROL AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government, this body, the body down the hallway, for some time has been talking about amnesty, amnesty for anywhere between 12 million and almost 20 million illegal people in the United States. 
   Well, I would like to talk about amnesty, but not for people who are illegally in the country, because I am opposed to that. But I would like to talk about amnesty for Americans, citizens, and I only want to talk about amnesty for two of those citizens. They are border agents who have been convicted of so-called civil rights violations of an illegal drug smuggler bringing drugs to the United States.     
   Two border agents, Compean and Ramos, today went to the penitentiary for 11 and 12 years for doing this. They work on the Texas-Mexico border, a volatile war zone. The border is the second front, and while on duty patrolling the sovereignty of our country, they come across a drug dealer driving a van full of about 780 pounds of marijuana. That does not mean anything, but it is worth a million dollars. That does mean something, something we can relate to. 
   A confrontation occurs, drug dealer abandons the van, tries to flee back to Mexico, has an altercation with the border agents, shots are fired, he runs to Mexico. 
   The next thing we find out, our Federal Government chooses to go to Mexico, find this drug dealer, learns that he has been shot, bring him back to America, treat his wounds at American expense, give him a deal, a backroom deal, to testify against the border agents because they did not follow some policy of reporting shots being fired. So they go to court, give the drug dealer amnesty, give the drug dealer immunity. 
   While waiting to testify, the old drug dealer goes back to Mexico and picks up another load of dope, almost 1,000 pounds of drugs, gets caught by different border agents. Once again, not prosecuted by the Federal Government because the Federal Government is so determined to prosecute border agents, not drug dealers; and after the trial, the border agents were convicted, and now they went to the penitentiary. 
   Our Federal Government had a choice to make in this case, whether or not to stand on the side of the lawless drug dealer or stand with our border agents who try to enforce the rule of law. Our government chose poorly. They sided with the enemy. They sided with the outlaws. They sided with illegal drug dealers and prosecuted our border agents. I ask the question, why? 
   If the border agents violated some policy or rule, suspend them, give them days off, demote them, but send them to the penitentiary for 12 years when the drug dealer goes free? This does not pass the smell test or, as we say in Texas, that dog just don't hunt, Mr. Speaker. 
   So we are asking a very simple thing, some of us from Congress, about 55. We are asking the President to grant amnesty to these two border agents. The administration, Federal Government, talks about amnesty. We just want it for two folks, and the President has the constitutional power to pardon and parole. The President exercised that power, that is his right under the Constitution, almost 100 times in the last 6 years. We are simply asking that the administration exercise the pardon power and pardon these two border agents and send the message to the Border Patrol and all these sheriffs who work on the border, trying to enforce the law, that we will stand beside  you when you try and enforce the law; and also send the message to drug dealers that we are not going to work with you, we are not giving you a deal, we do not work backroom deals with drug dealers; we support our Border Patrol on the Texas-Mexico border. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we hope that we get a response from the Federal Government on this pardon. So far, we have not received anything. I think the Federal Government is blissfully indifferent to the plight of these two border agents, and so we would hope that this gets some attention from folks across the country. Over 200,000 people have signed petitions asking that the President pardon both of these border agents; and we hope that that does occur because justice in this case did not occur, because our government chose to be on the wrong side of the border. 
   And that's just the way it is, Mr. Speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, a new terrorist has just been captured in Florida. Not an international terrorist, but a homegrown domestic one. 
   The facts are hard to comprehend, but here they are, according to the Associated Press. A husband took his wife on a canoe trip, and finding a wilderness spot, he took her ashore and then he raped her. He tied his naked wife to a tree and assaulted her with the butt of a knife. He let her hang on the tree for over 2 hours, then he took her off and raped her again. All the while, get this, he was videotaping this ghastly, dastardly crime. This crime is one of intimidation, degradation and humiliation. 
   Mr. Speaker, rape is a crime where the deviant tries to destroy the soul of the victim. When the assault occurs in the family, the domestic rape is even worse. 
   Now the hubby is facing a multitude of criminal charges, as it ought to be. Wives are not male property and these crimes are not to be excused as a domestic problem. 
   The offender should be given quick, accurate justice, and then tell him to pack his toothbrush, because justice is a thing we are going to find and demand life behind bars in this case. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Chairman, I am proud to introduce this Amendment with Congresswoman Louise McIntosh Slaughter. 
   Nearly 3 years ago, a distraught father contacted my office asking for help for his daughter, Jamie Leigh Jones. Jamie was a 20 year old, KBR contractor in Iraq. After only 4 days in the Green Zone, Jamie was drugged and gang-raped by her coworkers. When she woke up in the morning, she was naked, bruised, and bleeding. She saw 1 of her coworkers beside her and he confirmed that they had unprotected sex. She immediately contacted her supervisors and was taken to an Army hospital, where an Army doctor performed a rape kit. Rape kits are essential in future prosecutions because they preserve forensic evidence. The Army doctor took photographs of Jamie and informed Jamie that she was raped by multiple men. She has had reconstructive surgery.  
   What happened next is appalling. Jamie was locked in a guarded shipping container for 24 hours. Her supervisors told her this was for her safety, but she was not provided food or water and she was not allowed to contact anyone. Jamie finally convinced a sympathetic guard to let her use his cell phone and Jamie called her dad for help. 
   After speaking with Jamie's father, my staff and I contacted the State Department and within 2 days, 2 agents from the State Department had rescued Jamie. 
   Since Jamie's return in America, she has not had justice. Although a grand jury was finally convened, 2 1/2 years later, there is still no indictment. We learned that Jamie's important rape kit was turned over to her employer, KBR, instead of to the proper law enforcement personnel. KBR then lost and recovered the rape kit, but it is incomplete. KBR has stonewalled cooperation with authorities on the investigation regarding what occurred to this and other victims in Iraq. 
   This Amendment is very straight forward. It requires defense contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan to report violent crimes committed against or by their contracted employees to the Department of Defense and that the information must be made public. It also requires defense contractors to provide for victims with medical and psychological assistance. 
   This Amendment is one step in the right direction for bringing justice to victims. And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. ``From this day to the ending of the world, we in it shall be remembered. We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Shakespeare penned this in Henry V. It represents the unfailing commitment soldiers have for their fellow comrades. 
   Since 2004, 26 men and women from the Second Congressional District area of Texas have served honorably and given their lives for the cause of freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan; 26 times I have come to this House floor to talk about one of them. 
   This Memorial Day I would like to honor them again by name. They aren't just a statistic, Mr. Speaker. They are real people who gave their life for the American cause. They are the sons and daughters of America, and they are our heroes. 
   In America's first war fighting for freedom, it was said by Patrick Henry, ``The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, and to the brave.'' We are fortunate that those words still ring true today and that American troops overseas carry those values into battle.  
   I keep the photos of the fallen in all of my offices here in D.C. and in Texas, and the noble few who have died for the rest of us in the Second Congressional District of Texas are on this chart, Mr. Speaker. They are: 
   Russell Slay, Staff Sergeant in the United States Army, from Humble, Texas. He was killed on November 19, 2004, at the age of 28. 
   Wesley Canning, Lance Corporal, United States Marine Corps, from Friendswood, Texas, killed November 20, 2004, at the age of 21. 
   Fred Maciel, Lance Corporal, United States Marine Corps, from Spring, Texas, killed January 26, 2005, at the age of 20.

   William Meeuwsen, Sergeant, United States Army, from Kingwood, Texas, killed November 23, 2005, at the age of 24. 
   Robert Martinez, Lance Corporal, United States Marine Corps, from Cleveland, Texas. He was killed December 1, 2005, at the age of 20. And a post office in his hometown is named in his honor. 
   Jerry Michael Durbin, Staff Sergeant, United States Army, from Spring, Texas, killed January 26, 2006, at the age of 26. 
   Walter Moss, Tech Sergeant, United States Air Force, from Houston, Texas, killed on March 30, 2006, at the age of 27. 
   Kristian Menchaca, Private First Class in the United States Army, from Houston, Texas, killed June 16, 2006, at the age of 23.

   Anthony Aguirre, Lance Corporal, United States Marine Corps, from Houston, Texas, killed February 26, 2007, at the age of 20. 
   Brandon Bobb, PFC, United States Army, from Port Arthur, Texas, killed July 17, 2007. He was 20 years of age. 
   Zachary Endsley, Private First Class, United States Army, Spring, Texas, killed on July 23, 2007, at the age of 21. 
   Kamisha Block, Specialist, United States Army, from Vidor, Texas, killed August 16, 2007. She was 20 years of age. She is one of our female warriors who was killed in combat. 
   Donald Valentine III, Corporal in the United States Army, from Houston, Texas, killed September 18, 2007. He was 21. 
   Jeremy Burris, Lance Corporal, United States Marine Corps, from Liberty, Texas, killed October 8, 2007, at the age of 22.

   Shawn Tousha, Sergeant, United States Army, from Hull, Texas, killed April 9, 2008. He was 30. 
   Mr. Speaker, these 26 warriors represent the best of our Nation. They are the sons of liberty, the daughters of democracy. These few, these noble few, on this chart are American warriors who take care of the rest of us. 
   In the words of George Orwell, ``We sleep safe at night in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would try to do us harm.'' The American soldier.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I am alarmed by news in Newsweek magazine. I quote: ``There are ominous signs that the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically, and these changes may cause a drastic decline in food production. 
   ``The evidence has begun to accumulate so massively that meteorologists are hard pressed to keep up with it. The changes in temperature have taken the planet a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average.'' 
   That's right, Mr. Speaker, this article from April 1975 predicts the next ice age. It even suggests melting the polar cap and stockpiling food. 
   I believed these scientists and thought we were going to all freeze in the dark. Now meteorologists are claiming we're all doomed because of global warming. These meteorologists can't even predict tomorrow's weather, but claim to know as fact about global warming in the future. 
   The climate is changing, but is it man's fault? Is it getting too cold or too hot? Can we control the weather? Scientists even today disagree. 
   Before Congress continues to practice the religion of global warming and passing expensive legislation that takes away our personal liberty, we'd better come back to Earth and deal with the truth. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without a legal driver's license. Illegals, who aren't even supposed to be here, broke the law to get here, and they break it every day by staying here. 
   Some States pander to illegals and encourage them to stay. Seven States: Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Oregon, New Mexico, Utah and Washington, issue legal driver's licenses to illegals. These illegals then can use the driver's license to travel to other States, set up credit, obtain free social services, and in some States that don't verify citizenship, use these licenses to vote. Thus, these States encourage illegals to stay here. This is an absurd policy that gives the same recognition status to illegals that should be reserved only to citizens and legal immigrants. 
   We need stricter requirements for driver's licenses, not more lax enforcement. The 9/11 terrorists used fake driver's licenses to ``move about the country freely.'' So States that promote violation of Federal immigration policy by issuing these driver's licenses to illegals should lose Federal transportation highway funds. 
   Millions for border security, not one cent to highways for illegals.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (LANCE CORPORAL LUKE YEPSEN, TEXAS WARRIOR -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, it has been said, ``We are United States Marines, and for two and a quarter centuries we have defined the standards of courage, spirit, and military prowess.'' 
   These are words spoken by United States Marine Corps General James Jones. This describes the elitism of those chosen few who wear the title of United States Marines. 
   Luke Yepsen was one man whose life was making a difference at a very young age. He personified the core values of the United States Marine Corps of honor, courage, commitment. 
   He was from Kingwood, Texas, a close-knit community near Houston, Texas. He was a graduate of Kingwood High School, and he was known for his big heart and ability to live life to its fullest extent. He enjoyed travel and he was proud of the fact that he had already traveled to 20 different foreign countries in his short lifetime. 
   Luke deeply cared about his family back home in Texas and his military family. His fellow Marines said he was more than just a friend; he was a brother, a brother to everyone who knew him. 
   Like many Texans, especially those Texans who go to war, Luke chose to enroll in Texas A&M after high school. During his freshman year, he made a decision to leave Texas A&M University. Gary Yepsen, Luke's father, asked him why he didn't want to graduate college and then enter the United States Marine Corps as an officer. Luke said, ``I don't want to go into the Marines to tell people what to do. I want to go into the Marines so they can tell me what to do.'' 
   Here is what President Ronald Reagan said about the Marines: ``Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world. But the Marines, they don't have that problem.'' 
   Luke Yepsen was one of those Marines. With faith in God and country, at 18 Luke enrolled in the United States Marine Corps. He was an assaultman, later a mechanic, which came easy to him because of his love of cars. ``He had so much courage and pride, you can't even imagine. You could hear it in his voice how proud he was,'' said Luke's brother, Kyle. In October of 2006, Luke was deployed to Iraq with the 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. Amid the violence and anarchy in Iraq, Luke's thoughts never waned from the security of home and American freedom. When told by his college roommate that he was praying for him, Luke quickly responded, ``Well, I'm praying for you.'' 
   On December 14, 2006, at the age of 20, Luke, while fighting the forces of evil, was killed by enemy action in Iraq. For his military service, he was awarded the Purple Heart, the Combat Action Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. 
   On the morning of December 22, 2006, hundreds of Kingwood, Texas, residents lined the streets of this community paying tribute to the family of this patriot. Many of those on the streets carried flags, yellow ribbons. Many held banners saying ``Proud of You,'' ``Proud to be an American.'' Some said, ``Thank You.'' As the funeral procession made its way to the church, the residents of Kingwood, with tearful eyes and grateful hearts, saluted the Yepsen family. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you that patriotism is alive and well in the United States. And as the Kingwood, Texas, community mourns the loss of America's son, Luke Yepsen, and all those who came before him and all those that will come after him, we know that freedom is not free, and we thank this fearless Marine for dedicating his life to America. 
   Luke's sacrifice will be etched in the catalogue of history as another Marine  who was always faithful. A sacrifice made for his parents, Sheila and Gary; his brother, Kyle; and his fiancee, Sandra Bruman; the Kingwood community; and this great Nation. 
   As we honor the life of Luke Yepsen, reflect on those timeless words from the Marine Corps Hymn that say: 
 ``In many a strife We've fought for life And never lost our nerve. If the army and the navy Ever look on heaven's scenes, They will find the streets are guarded By United States Marines.''  
   Mr. Speaker, I suspect that Lance Corporal Luke Yepsen is patrolling the streets of heaven tonight and guarding the pearly gates. 
   So Semper Fi, Lance Corporal Yepsen. Semper Fi. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, during the great World War II, the U.S. aircraft carrier Monterey faced its fiercest naval battle, not with the Imperial Japanese Navy, but the storm of the sea, Typhoon Cobra. 
   A naval lieutenant (jg) answering the call to action motivated the crew to combat against the Cobra's bone-crushing waves, torrential rains, and consuming fires it caused on board the ship. 
   Refusing the order to abandon the ship, this warrior valiantly went below, marching into the mouth of the fire, rescuing those trapped within its grasp. He ignored the searing heat of the flames and the blackness of the smoke. Hour upon hour this man led others in the charge to extinguish the demon fire, saving fellow sailors and officers. 
   He did not seek recognition in the darkness of 1944; it sought him. When it called, this naval officer answered in a manner of all American patriots, with courage, valor, and victory. 
   Twenty-nine years later, this same individual helped rescue an entire Nation from the fire of corruption and war. And he brought peace. His name was President Gerald Ford, and we thank him.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, two delivery services, UPS and FedEx, take a package and deliver it for a customer anywhere in a world in just a handful of days. Amazingly, a customer can even track one of those 23 million packages on the Internet and know exactly where it is on any given day. Maybe the Federal Government could learn something here. 
   The Federal Government doesn't seem to even know where 20 million illegals are in this country, much less track their whereabouts. A good example of how private industry works and the Federal Government does not. 
   Anyway, it has been suggested that the way to solve the case of the missing illegals is to give every illegal that crosses into the United States a FedEx or UPS package. The package could contain items for their stay illegally in the United States. Then we could record when people enter the U.S. and know where they are at any given time. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a disgrace that the Federal Government can't handle border security any better than it does. The Feds owe it to the American citizens to come up with ways to stop the flow of illegals into the United States.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, judges have the public duty to protect children from sexual deviants, including those from Vermont. 
   Mark Hulett molested a 6-year-old girl for 4 years. Reports indicate he even had a history of abusing women. But when he went to court for the child molesting charge, Judge Edward ``Cushy'' Cashman of Vermont put the molester in jail for only 60 days and ordered some ``Kum-Ba-Yah'' type of treatment. 
   The crime against this little girl is a human rights violation. The judge condoned the violation by not punishing the criminal. Has the judge made Vermont a safe sanctuary State for child molesters? 
   Almost everyone in America knows, except Judge Cushy, that you cannot cure child rapists. You keep them away from kids. You lock them up in jail. Why do you think we build those prisons? Judge Cushy should be held accountable and removed from the bench, then given sensitivity training on the effects of being raped as a child. 
   Justice will only be served when judges are as concerned about the molested as they are about the molesters, but for now the Judges Hall of Shame has a brand new member.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, last Wednesday, January 10, 2007, the flag flew at half mast in the small coastal town of Sabine Pass, Texas. The neighbors had learned of the sacrifice of their hometown son, Specialist Ryan Berg, who was 19. He was fighting the war in the land of Iraq. 
   Army Specialist Ryan Berg was an American soldier. When others his age were talking about going to college or working in the nearby refineries, Ryan went to the local Army recruiter's office on his 18th birthday and joined the United States Army, knowing America was at war in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   He was proud to be an American, and Ryan chose to serve his Nation. He wanted to make a difference by being an American soldier. Ryan Berg had spent his entire life in Sabine Pass, Texas, and he knew everybody in town. Ryan always planned on returning to his home to live and raise a family after he finished his duty with the United States Army and for America. 
   Like his mother and his father, Ryan attended and graduated from Sabine Pass School. The Sabine Pass School has all the grades in just one building. Ryan played football, basketball, and golf. Childhood friends of Ryan knew him as an outgoing and friendly guy. One of his friends said, ``There wasn't anything or anyone he didn't like, and everybody liked him.'' He was a gentleman who always helped others who needed it in Sabine Pass. 
   Ryan knew his calling after high school was to join the United States Army. He simply wanted to protect his country, like he had protected those he knew and loved all his life. He was stationed in Fort Hood, Texas. Ryan met his wife, Katy, in September of 2006, just a few months ago. The young newly wed couple soon received the news that Ryan, like so many others before him, would be sent to the desert sands of Iraq. 
   He was deployed to Iraq on October 4, 2006, and he was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 12th Calvary Regiment, 3rd Brigade, Alpha Section, 3rd Platoon.  
   Ryan called home weekly, but the thunder of battle sometimes forced him to quickly end those phone calls. As the 2006 Christmas season approached, Ryan was given last-minute leave to spend the holidays at home in Texas with his family and his neighbors in Sabine Pass. 
   During Christmas, Scottie, Ryan's mother, held her son tightly and told him that she was not going to let him go back to Iraq. Ryan replied, Mr. Speaker, ``I've got to go back over there. I've got to make it safe for my wife, my mom, my dad, and all those I love.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, amazing people, these Americans who go to war. On January 4, 2007 with nearly a year to go in Iraq, the teenager returned to the battlefront to fight against these insurgents and their terror against the people of Iraq. Ryan was only in Iraq for 5 days when he was shot by a hidden enemy sniper. The wound was fatal. 
   Last week, 19-year-old U.S. Army Specialist Ryan Berg became the first son of Sabine Pass, Texas, to be killed defending freedom in that land far, far away, of Iraq. For his courage during combat, Ryan was awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star. 
   The news of his death at the hands of the anarchists stunned the Berg family and the people of Sabine Pass. Through their tears, Ryan's mother and father, Scottie and Travis; his brother Brad, his sister Marissa, and his new wife, Katie, and countless other relatives and friends have, in their anguish, honored the American warrior. 
   Ryan's loved ones expressed their pride of his service to America and the bravery their soldier exhibited throughout his career. They also asked for the community to pray not only for Ryan but for those soldiers still amid the dusty trenches fighting for freedom and securing liberty. 
   Those who knew Ryan, and I have a photograph of him, Mr. Speaker, those who knew him, remember his loyalty to his family and to his friends, but not only as a man who never knew a stranger, but Ryan devoted his life to guarding them from danger, those especially who could not stand up for themselves. 
   This Nation owes its gratitude, its liberties, its freedom, to people like Specialist Ryan Berg and to brave soldiers who have walked the path of sacrifice for the rest of us. 
   So God bless Sabine Pass, Texas and God bless the Berg family and God Bless Ryan Berg. 
   It has been said that when the Roving Legions went into battle one of their generals once told his men, ``How you yet live will echo throughout eternity.'' 
   Ryan, your deeds will always speak the example of the spirit of the American soldier. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, I am glad that we are finally discussing the U.S. Constitution. So much legislation goes through this House from both sides where the Constitution is never mentioned as to whether it is constitutional or not. 
   No question about it: the folks in Washington, D.C. ought to be represented in the House. But the Constitution does not allow it except by constitutional amendment. And history is on the side of what I say. 
   The 23rd amendment to the Constitution that was approved in 1961 gives the District of Columbia and the people here representation or voting in the Presidential election by giving them three electors. It took a constitutional amendment to give them that right. The arguments were made then that are being made now. D.C. was not a State in 1961 any more than it is a State today. 
   So let us proceed. Let us proceed with a constitutional amendment if need be and give the folks in Washington, D.C. a representation in this House of Representatives. But do it the right way. Do it the constitutional way, not by just some legislation of Congress.

   America would have never known the greatness of General George Washington if his dog, Mopsey, had not saved the young lad when he wandered far from home. 
   Fido, Lincoln's dog, allegedly jumped in front of a knife-wielding drunk, saving President Lincoln from injury. Gandalf is the latest of these heroes. 
   Gandalf, a 2-year-old Shiloh shepherd heard the cries for help and answered like a true soldier. He led searchers to Michael Auberry, a 12-year-old Boy Scout who had been lost for 4 days in the woods. Thanks to Gandalf, Michael was safely returned to his family. 
   Gandalf, a search-and-rescue dog, is a trailing dog trained to pursue specific individuals by following their scent. When time is short and the situation is extreme, it is man's best friend who answers the call. Rescue dogs, bomb sniffing dogs, and drug dogs are always loyal to guide, reassure, rescue, and save us.

   Congresses before us have tried to run the war, even as far back as the Continental Congress. They were so upset with George Washington, they wanted to get rid of the Commander in Chief and replace him with somebody else. His comments to the Continental Congress then are worth noting today. He said, ``We should never despair. Our situation before has been unpromising and has changed for the better. So it will again.'' 
   And that is what we must do. Support our troops. Give them the troops that they need to finish the mission that we have asked them to accomplish on behalf of national security.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (BALLAD OF THE ALAMO -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. 
 In the southern part of Texas In the town of San Antone There's a fortress all in ruins That the weeds have overgrown.  You may look in vain for crosses And you'll never see a one. But sometime between the setting And the rising of the sun You can hear a ghostly bugle As the men go marching by. You can hear them as they answer To that roll call in the sky. Colonel William Barrett Travis, Davy Crockett And 180 more. Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie They're all present and accounted for.  
   Mr. Speaker, these are the lyrics to Marty Robbins' ``Ballad of the Alamo.'' 
   It was there in an old beat up Spanish mission in south Texas called the Alamo on March 6, 1836, 171 years ago today, that 187 men stood defiant against oppression and tyranny. They were an odd looking bunch. They were dressed in buckskin. They had large knives, tomahawks and long rifles. They were of all races, of all States, and 13 foreign countries, including Mexico. They were facing a professional army over 20 times their size. 
   They were there because of the new dictator of Mexico, Santa Anna. He had abolished the democratic Mexican constitution and made himself dictator of all of Mexico. 
   Hispanics and Anglos living in the Texas part of Mexico wanted the Mexican constitution restored, or independence from Mexico. 
   Santa Anna then invaded Texas with three armies to put down the dissenters. The men at the Alamo were led by a 27-year-old lawyer from South Carolina and Alabama named William Barrett Travis. 
   There is a lot of legend, lore and tradition about the defense of the Alamo. But what is true, Mr. Speaker, is that the Alamo defenders believed that some things were worth living for and dying for. One of those being the word, liberty. 
   Being surrounded, Travis knew he could not hold off Santa Anna's army and he sent out numerous dispatches for help. I have a copy of one of those letters on my office wall. It reads, ``Fellow citizens and compatriots, I am besieged by 1,000 or more of the enemy under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannon fire for over 24 hours, but I have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded surrender at its discretion, otherwise this fort will be put to the sword. I have answered that demand with a cannon shot and the flag still waves proudly over the north wall. I shall never surrender or retreat. I call upon you in the name of liberty and patriotism and everything dear to our character to come to my aid with all dispatch. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself for as long as possible and die like a soldier that never forgets what is due his honor and that of his country. Victory or death, William Barrett Travis, commander of the Alamo.'' 
   Travis held out for 5 days and 6 days and up to 13 days. But no troops ever came to help the Alamo defenders except the 32 men from Gonzales, Texas. 
   Eventually Travis and the boys were overwhelmed, and not one was spared by Santa Anna. But victory was expensive for the dictator Santa Anna. Travis, in his last letter from the Alamo said, ``Victory will be more costly for Santa Anna than defeat.'' He was right. Santa Anna's losses were staggering. He also had a crippled army and lost the moral victory to the Texas war of independence. 
   Then on April 21, 1836, General Sam Houston routed Santa Anna's larger army at the marshes of San Jacinto. Texas became an independent nation and was so for 9 years. And Mr. Speaker, the rest, they say, is Texas history. 
   William Barrett Travis is my favorite person in all of history. My grandson is named Barrett Houston in his honor. 
   I conclude these remarks about the Alamo with Marty Robbins' closing lines: 
 The bugles are silent. There's rust on every sword. There's a small band of soldiers That lie asleep in the arms of the Lord. And like a statue on his pinto Rides a cowboy all alone. And he sees the cattle grazing Where just a century before Santa Anna's guns were blazing And the cannons used to roar. His eyes turn sort of misty And his heart begins to glow And then he takes his hat off slowly To the men of that Alamo. To the 13 days of glory At the siege of the Alamo.  
   Mr. Speaker, that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, being a lawman in the vastness of west Texas has always been a rough task. Now it is more difficult because the Federal Government has taken the side of the lawbreaker over the lawman. 
   Deputy Gilmer Hernandez of Edwards County, Texas, was recently on patrol in the darkness of the night in Rocksprings, Texas, when he spotted a van violating Texas traffic laws. He pulls the van over and notices numerous people lying down on the floor. 
   Then without warning, the driver suddenly drives off and tries to run over Deputy Hernandez. Hernandez shoots out the tires of the van in self-defense. The other illegals jump out and take off. 
   The Texas Rangers do a thorough investigation and clear Deputy Hernandez of any wrongdoing, but the Mexican Government arrogantly demands the Federal Government prosecute Hernandez for using his gun, and the Feds do exactly that. 
   Hernandez is convicted, and now he is in jail awaiting sentencing by a Federal judge, all because he did his job. Our government ought to support the border protectors like Hernandez and prosecute the border violators. Why is our Federal Government taking the wrong side in the border war?

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Americans are under vicious attack in Mexico. The new threat comes from south of the border in the form of organized and violent Mexican kidnappers. 
   Last year, 26 San Diego, California residents were kidnapped and held for ransom while traveling to Mexico. Numerous Mexican nationals also were kidnapped. Some victims were murdered. Only a few of the people kidnapped were ever rescued. They reported that they were beaten, tortured and sexually assaulted. 
   The FBI says that these sophisticated kidnappers are growing in number. The State Department has even issued a travel alert for U.S. citizens living and traveling in Mexico. This new form of terrorism is very disturbing. 
   While President Calderon is here in the United States lobbying for illegal immigrants to get amnesty, Mexican and U.S. citizens are being victimized in his home country. President Calderon would do well to stay home in lawless Mexico, get his house in order and protect the rights of hundreds of his own people and the U.S. citizens who are being abducted and held for ransom by these outlaws.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER? -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, it's 4:14 p.m. on the 14th day of the second month of this year. This House is basically empty except for a few of us. Everyone has gone home. 
   We found time today to do important business for the people of the country.  I have some of the bills that we passed today. One of those was that we had the time to vote after debate on regulating insects, roaches, fungus, and rats in the United States. Oh, such an important piece of legislation that the House of Representatives debated and voted on. 
   But while we had the time to vote on these important issues of regulating the rats and roaches and fungi in the United States, we didn't take the time to protect the American people from those people throughout the world who want to kill us, who want to do harm to us and our families. And not to America only, but to all freedom countries throughout the world. 
   Because we didn't have time to work on the Protect America Act, a bill that does exactly what it says, Mr. Speaker, it protects America. It protects America from terrorists. And one of those ways is being able to eavesdrop into conversations when one terrorist overseas talks to another terrorist overseas, amending the FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance, Act. But, oh, we didn't have time to do that. 
   Mr. Speaker, it troubles me because has the House of Representatives, without firing a shot, raised the ``white flag of surrender'' to those people who wish to do us harm? The head of the National Intelligence Service has told us that 50 percent of the intelligence that they attained is through FISA. And yet we have cut off that resource by failing to vote on that, failing debate on that. But yet we had time to talk about roaches, rats, and fungi. 
   Mr. Speaker, this ought not to be. Under FISA, we have been able to prevent crimes from being occurred against the United States. One of those was the bombing of the Brooklyn Bridge, another was the bombing of Fort Dix in New Jersey. Those were prevented because of FISA, because we had the intelligence, because we had the eavesdropping, the legal eavesdropping capability. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives has not done a service to the people of the United States by failing to debate this issue and at least have an argument, a lively debate, and then vote on it to protect the United States. The people of the United States deserve better from us. Our job is to protect America through legislation. And, Mr. Speaker, I think we have not done that today because we are off doing other things. 
   So I hope that I am proven wrong by history that this did not hurt the United States down the road for failing to act on this important legislation. And it's important that the House come back as soon as possible and deal with the issue of protecting America first and making sure that we know what they're saying throughout the world when they want to do us harm, because the people we fight, the war we fight against are people who will do anything to get their way and their radical beliefs including killing children and women and the innocents and car bombs and anyone else that gets in their way. 
   And there is probably joy throughout the terrorist cells in the world that the United States Congress did not do its duty today. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, with all the discussion about protecting our vulnerable borders from illegal intrusion by smugglers, criminals and fortune hunters, Homeland Security is missing the obvious. 
   Legal ports of entry are as easy for illegals to cross as the remote areas of America's porous borders. Media sources report that the Government Accountability Office did a study that showed at least 10 percent of the illegals who try to unlawfully enter the U.S. at ports of entry are successful. 
   These failures to detect include drug and weapons smugglers and one individual who had an incurable type of TB who was allowed to illegally enter the United States 76 times. Homeland Security doesn't argue with the results of the GAO but simply makes excuses. 
   One solution, however, is to require all people entering the United States at ports of entry to have a valid passport where the U.S. can record who enters and who leaves our country. The 9/11 Commission recommended the passport, but politics and the governments of Mexico and Canada and the open borders crowd seem to keep this common sense idea from becoming a reality. The security of this Nation deserves better. We need to use passports.

   Shame on Mayor Bates. He has flippantly and pompously denounced those noble few--the proud--the chosen--the Marines that represent everything that is good and right about America. These defenders of democracy deserve better than Berkeley's arrogant disapproval. 
   These deplorable anti-Marine city council members must still have a sixties peacenik, hippie mentality that world peace can occur by sitting around smoking dope and banging on the tambourine. 
   Berkeley should lose all Federal funding for their smug denouncement of the Marine Corps. Patriotic Americans should not subsidize cities that tell the Marines to ``get out of town.''

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, our path to energy independence is anything but that. We have become more energy dependent on foreign governments, and our own government continues to find new ways to control our lives regarding energy use. The government is in the toilet bowl control business. Now toilets must meet strict Federal regulations, but these expensive toilets must be flushed more than once to be effective. 
   The government now polices our washing machines. But new regulations that limit water usage are so ineffective with these new gizmos that Consumer Reports states the government machines don't get dirty clothes clean unless they're washed multiple times. So much for saving energy. 
   And now the government is in the light bulb police business, requiring expensive new bulbs to be used that are only made, ironically, in China. Instead of finding new ways to punish and police Americans for using energy, we should find new efficient sources of more energy. 
   I doubt if our forefathers fought for independence at Valley Forge just to give us an all-controlling government that demands how citizens use washing machines, light bulbs and toilet bowls.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, who do we fight against? We have been at war in Iraq and Afghanistan for years. We heard that we are fighting a war on terror. But what does that mean? Who are the people at war with America? 
   Now, after all this time, our government has decided we must have a politically correct name for our enemy. No longer can we use the term ``Jihadist,'' the primary meaning being a holy war to subject the world to Islam. After all, using that term might hurt our enemies' feelings. 
   And certainly the most accurate term, ``Islamo-Fascists,'' is strictly taboo because it might further anger our enemies by insinuating they are a bit radical when they murder in the name of religion. 
   So the government insists that we call the bad guys ``extremists'' or ``terrorists.'' 
   That vague term won't indicate the war against us is waged in the name of radical Muslim religious doctrine. But isn't that the reason for this war? 
   The term ``Jihadist'' is not a reflection on all Muslims. After all, many Muslims are literally fighting these radical ideas. 
   In a war, we must specifically define our enemy. Otherwise, we don't know who they are or why we fight.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (WAR POWERS COURT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, forget about the days of judicial restraint. Those are the days when the Supreme Court thought their job was to interpret the law and follow the Constitution. The Supreme Court now has ushered in a new era power grab called judicial imperialism. 
   Recently, the deeply divided Supreme Court, or the war powers court, as we shall call it, issued a ruling by Justice Kennedy that gave terrorists the right to argue their cases in Federal courts. In this 5-4 decision, the court held that terrorism detainees captured on the battlefield engaged in war against America now held at Guantanamo Bay prison and other prison facilities under U.S. control have the same rights as American citizens. 
   When I was at Gitmo prison, which I doubt Justice Kennedy has ever seen, I saw several detainees that had been captured, released, and captured again on the battlefield trying to kill Americans. I'm sure these enemy combatants are partying in Guantanamo prison tonight. 
   Under the current law, individuals captured as enemy combatants have their cases reviewed by military commissions. It has always been the law under our Constitution that the President is the Commander in Chief of the military, and the President and Congress control war, not the nine justices on the Supreme Court. But the imperialistic war powers court ruled that these military commissions aren't fair enough for enemy combatants trying to kill American troops. It's interesting. These terrorists hate America, hate freedom, hate our way of life but quickly run to American courts to seek redress against Americans. 
   The five war power judges on the Supreme Court say these poor little misfits should have access to American courts, even though it is the first time in history we have given constitutional rights to combatants against the United States. Even in the War between the States, captured Confederate soldiers who were actually born in the United States were not allowed access to U.S. courts. They were tried by military tribunals. The same occurred in World War II when Nazis were tried by military tribunals. During the Revolutionary War, British spy John Andre was caught on U.S. soil spying with traitor Benedict Arnold. Andre was hung by the Commander in Chief, George Washington, and a military court without any judicial intervention. 
   So what is next? Are we going to make our boys read terrorists their Miranda rights in the battlefield before they capture them? Justice Scalia was right, Mr. Speaker. In his dissent he argued that this ruling will make the war on terror harder on us and will ``almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.'' 
   The Supreme Court is running roughshod over the Constitution of the United States and changing 200 years of judicial precedent. In fact, at the end of World War II, the Supreme Court explicitly determined in a series of cases that the writ of habeas corpus--that's an action that allows a person to seek relief from detention--does not apply to foreign combatants held outside the United States. 
   It gets down to this question, Mr. Speaker: Who should be running our wars? Should Congress and the executive branch be in charge of war, or should the Supreme Court, in all of its supreme knowledge, be running the war? 
   Well, according to the war powers court, they are the commanders in chief of the war. Now what does the imperialist war court want us to do with captured terrorists? Not capture them at all, or let them go so they can kill again? 
   While terrorists continue to use innocent women and children as shields, continue to bomb our troops, shoot our sons and daughters in the battlefield and behead American civilians and our troops without granting them any rights, the Supreme Court tells us these terrorists ought to be treated  like American citizens. The five imperialist judges on the Supreme Court have asserted the power of the Constitution that is reserved specifically to the executive branch and to the legislative branch. 
   Mr. Speaker, this ought not to be, but that's just the way it is.

Hardworking citizens are going to be robbed of Social Security money that they are entitled to. Now many Americans and legal immigrants may not receive Social Security benefits because they will be going to illegals. 
   Mr. Speaker, illegals are not citizens of this country, and they should not be taking the benefits entitled to law-abiding American citizens and legal immigrants. It is morally wrong to expect Americans to pay money to people that are not even supposed to be on our soil. Illegals should not receive Social Security benefits.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (PANCHO VILLA RIDES AGAIN -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I bring you news from the second front: the border war continues. 
   Ninety years after his example, Pancho Villa would be proud knowing that armed banditos from Mexico continue to invade the United States border to harass U.S. citizens, and the U.S. Government won't do what is necessary to stop this invasion. 
   The Associated Press reports on January 3 of this year: gun-toting Mexican outlaws encountered U.S. National Guard troops along the U.S.-Mexico border near Sasabe, Arizona. After supposedly bringing drugs into our land, these outlaws were headed back home to Mexico when they overran this Arizona National Guard ``outpost.'' 
   Make no mistake about it. These criminals were not ``undocumented migrant workers'' who daily cross the U.S. border illegally, but fierce outlaws armed with AK-47 automatic rifles. They were taking full advantage of our weak border rules of engagement policy, or shall I say non-policy. 
   According to the National Guard, the gunmen defiantly approached our border troops in what was described as an ``aggressive manner.'' But instead of holding steady against this threatening approach, our Guardsmen fled. That's right, they retreated. Why? Because it is the policy that the National Guard may not fire their weapons unless fired upon or in danger of serious bodily injury and can only fire if no civilians are in close proximity. 
   In other words, when approached by armed intruders, the National Guard must flee. With these restrictions, the hostility left troops with the only choice they had, follow the retreat when confronted policy. 
   An ongoing investigation into the January 3 threat is being conducted by the U.S. Border and Customs Patrol. A spokesman for the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol stated, ``The exceptional job of these agents and troops is angering drug dealers, and that is probably the reason that they were so bold, and that heightened frustration may be connected'' with the incursion on January 3 and overrunning the outpost. 
   These narcoterrorists act as if America is their country and the National Guard are the intruders. Our government must allow our troops to engage the criminal invaders. If they come onto our land armed, we should fight, not flee from the scene. The war on the border is escalating. Ignoring these attacks only encourages Mexican drug dealers to be more aggressive in their criminal enterprises. 
   Homeland security begins at home by protecting our borders from these illegal invaders. In the days of Pancho Villa, banditos encroached upon the border on horseback. But U.S. soldiers and Texas Rangers fought back and took control of our border. Now these banditos come across by any means necessary: in Humvees, in the backs of trucks, on foot, and they are saddled with deadly fire power. They traffic drugs, illegal aliens, and they are armed while doing it. 
   In 1916, our government ordered thousands of National Guardsmen to protect the borders and to protect U.S. citizens. General John J. Pershing did that. He defended our borders, and he chased banditos back to Mexico. 
   In 2007, the U.S. Government has once again called the National Guard to protect and defend. But the U.S. engagement policy is beneficial only to the intruders by not allowing the National Guard to defend themselves or our sovereignty with their weapons. 
   How is the National Guard to shield our country from this invasion when they can't capture armed bandits? Or should they be called ``undocumented firearm enthusiasts''? If our National Guard is on the border, they should be allowed to protect our country from hostile invaders using any means necessary. After all, they are the National Guard, not national bird watchers. Let's not send our National Guard or border agents to perform a task with a no-detain or no-shoot policy. Otherwise, how can they protect America? 
   Armed renegades attacking our borders are invaders and should be treated as such. Mexico refuses to crack down on their criminals encroaching on U.S. land. In fact, they encourage this intrusion. 
   Has our Nation lost the moral will to protect our border? We protect the border of other nations. We protect the Korean border. We protect the Iraqi border. Let us protect our own border. A line must be drawn in the sand ordering these desperados to leave or the U.S. Calvary will deal with them like General Pershing did 100 years ago. 
   And that's just the way it is.

Then after kidnapping Soto, whom Perez later shot, Perez sped off into the night. He was later captured. Oscar Perez had been illegally in the United States for years. 
   According to reports, the last three police officers shot in Harris County, Texas, were all shot by people illegally in the United States.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for yielding time. 
   Sudan is responsible for the genocide in Darfur. ``Genocide'' is a fancy term, Mr. Speaker, that means organized murder by a government. The violence has displaced over 2 million people, and it has claimed at least 500,000 lives. President Bush has announced tougher sanctions on businesses and individuals dealing with the government of Sudan, but the perpetrators of evil are also propped up by China. 
   Seventy percent of Sudan's oil goes to China, and loads of Chinese arms regularly find their way to these demons of the desert. No wonder China is road-blocking change in Sudan. It is all about money and who gets it. 
   Though the Chinese have appointed envoys, they haven't done anything to pressure the Sudanese to stop murdering their own people. I think it is safe to say, Mr. Speaker, that as long as China continues to prop up the evil in Sudan, the Chinese government is complicit in this atrocity; and I don't think it is too much to ask Congress, in the name of basic human rights, to demand that China use its influence in Sudan to help stop the genocide. That is why I am proud to cosponsor this resolution offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). 
   Mr. Speaker, the Chinese have an opportunity to show the world that they care about innocent people and take this blemish off of their historical record. It is in their best interest, not to mention the best interest of the victims of Darfur, that they pressure Sudan to stop the killing of their own people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I want to thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding. 
   Across the Sabine River from southwest Louisiana is southeast Texas, and the citizens of southeast Texas are still reeling from the beating that they got from Hurricane Rita in 2005. The hurricane devastated rice farmers who were struggling even before the wind and rain destroyed most of their crops. 
   It hit the oil refineries in my congressional district and across the gulf coast, which account for one-third of the Nation's domestic oil production, and it brought our fuel supply to a screeching halt. Gasoline prices soared, and citizens can no longer afford to heat and even cool their homes. 
   Amidst the chaos of Hurricane Rita and its aftermath, lawlessness preyed upon the real victims. Some of those who weathered the storm took advantage of FEMA's incompetence in its attempt to distribute money to those in need. The cheaters took FEMA debit cards and spent them on gentlemen's clubs and brand-new cars. The real victims languished homeless and helpless, waiting for the Federal Government to do something. 
   The folks in my congressional district can still feel the impact of the hurricane 2 years later. People are still trying to just survive; and, as Mr. Boustany has said, another hurricane season is now upon us. We cannot forget how a few short hours in southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas caused so much destruction. We cannot forget in historical terms Hurricane Katrina or Rita, and we must remember they are not rare events for the gulf coast. 
   In 1900, an unnamed hurricane was the deadliest natural disaster in our Nation's history. It killed between 10- and 12,000 people in Galveston, Texas. It destroyed most of the buildings on the island, some 3,600. With remarkable determination, the survivors of the great storm of 1900 raised the whole City of Galveston, Texas, 12 feet to protect it from future disasters.     
   We cannot forget the victims of the past, and we must remember how the victims of Katrina and Rita are still fighting to recover their homes, their towns and their livelihoods, and we must be better prepared in the future. 
   That's why, Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to rise in support of this resolution offered by my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Louisiana. 
   The National Hurricane Museum and Science Center in Southwest Louisiana will honor these victims and those of previous hurricanes, preserve their history. It will tell the stories of all the hurricanes of the past, but also encourage new solutions for natural disasters of the future. So I'd like to commend Dr. Boustany for offering this important resolution. It's a long time in coming.

   The people coming here want what the United States has. Some claim the land in the Southwest actually belongs to their native country and are retaking it. Some here are to commit lawless acts, but most are here as occupiers that have intentions of living here and reaping the benefits of the United States. No matter the reason, they are all here illegally. It is an invasion when masses of people move to someone else's country without permission. 
   So, we have been invaded by people from other Nations. So what do we do? Some want the invasion to stop. I am one of those. Some in the United States want the invasion to continue. And some here in the United States are indifferent. 
   But what about our government? Is it fighting to protect our sovereignty? Well, no. Rather than protect the United States border, the United States Federal Government is raising the white flag and has already drawn up terms of surrender. It is called the ``Grand Bargain.'' It's a plan to allow the illegal occupiers to just stay in America. The United States Government appears to take the position that it cannot stop the invasion so it will just legalize the invasion. So the occupiers will win the day and they will get to stay. 
   The propaganda machine of our government is trying to convince Americans that this proposal is not amnesty. The idea is to change the meaning of the word ``amnesty.'' Sort of a new take on what definition of ``is'' is. The political propaganda people are trying to convince Americans it is better to surrender to the occupiers than to prevent illegals from coming across our borders, but it's still amnesty. 
   Even though I was a judge in Texas for over 20 years, you don't have to have a law degree to know that amnesty means forgiveness or pardon. To give you an example, if somebody trespasses on your land or is a squatter on your land, as some people call it, if that person is caught and they pay a fine but they get to remain on your property, it's still trespassing, and if they get to remain on your property, even paying a fee, it is amnesty. 
   Trespassers are required to leave when caught, no matter how long they have been trespassing on somebody else's property. This has been the law of nations for thousands of years. But our government's going to legalize trespassing and let squatters stay whether Americans and legal immigrants like it or not. 
   Make no mistake. This plan, or treaty of capitulation, lets the illegal occupiers stay here. It's cold hard amnesty. The Feds have their priorities wrong. 
   When a Nation is invaded, the duty of government is to stop the invasion. That is the first duty of our government, to defend, protect and secure the Nation. We protect the borders of other nations, but we don't protect our own. Our government has not protected the border but talks about legalizing the illegals. In other words, agree to the invasion and give in to the demands of the occupiers. And this is absurd. This is surrender. 
   The first answer to an invasion is to defend the land, seal the border. Stop the people from coming here and don't give in to them. Simply stop the invasion. 
   It's in the best interest of America that the government realizes there's a border war going on, and rather than surrender the government needs to get on the right side of the border war, the American side, and stop the invasion. Secure the border, then decide what to do with the people that are here illegally. But if the border's not protected, more occupiers will continue to come here illegally, and our government will continue to be missing in action. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the people of Houston, Texas, are in mourning today because they have lost another brave protector of our community. While working undercover surveillance on February 21, Harris County sheriff deputy Craig Miller was killed when an 18-wheeler darted onto I-10 in Houston and recklessly drove across three lanes of the freeway crashing into Miller's SUV. Miller's vehicle became airborne, and he was fatally injured in the crash. 
   Narcotics Officer Miller was 43 years of age, married to Michelle and has two young children. Friends described him as a comedian that could have been a regular on Saturday Night Live. Deputy Miller grew up in Houston and attended Stratford High School. He enjoyed protecting and serving the people of the Houston area. 
   So as peace officers wear the black band of sacrifice across their badges in honor of Deputy Craig Miller, we remember that lawmen are all that separate civilization from the uncivilized. 
   The driver of the 18-wheeler was charged with negligent homicide. He is a foreign national and his legal status is undetermined. Deputy Miller is yet another recent death in a series of Houston area lawmen that have been killed by foreign nationals. Deputy Miller is a casu alty of a weak, chaotic, and inconsistent and overbroad immigration policy this country has.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about one of the novel concepts that Congress has come up with over the years. It goes back to the Reagan administration and a bipartisan bill signed by President Reagan, the VOCA Act was established. It is called the Victims of Crime Act. It's a novel idea in that convicted felons in Federal court who are assessed fees and fines must pay those fees and fines into a fund. That fund then is saved and reserved for victims of crime for restitution. It also establishes and takes care of domestic violence shelters where spouses can hide away from those abusers. It establishes rape crisis coalition centers. It promotes and sends money to the victim advocates throughout the United States who go to court with victims of crime, especially in violent crime. It does many good things. And over the years, because our Federal judges have continued to fine and assess greater penalties to criminals, that VOCA fund, as of today, is $1.7 billion, money contributed by criminals that goes to crime victims. What a wonderful idea. And let me make it clear, this is not taxpayer money. Taxpayers didn't fund this. Criminals did. Criminals paying the rent on the courthouse, paying for the system that they have created. 
   So what is the problem? The problem is, Mr. Sp eaker, that that fund, every year, that's administered by the Federal Government continues to be robbed by other bureaucrats and continues to be less money that's available for crime victims. This year we have $1.7 billion in the fund. Last year $635 million of that was used for crime victims, but this year the fund is being cut by the bureaucrats to $590 million. That's not a lot of money, but it means that victims shelters throughout the country will be closed, that these rape crisis coalition centers wil l be closed because they're barely keeping the lights on. 
   So why is that happening, Mr. Speaker? I do not know. 
   I do know that the Justice Department now is going to charge a surcharge on the victims fund of 5.5 percent to administer the fund. They are doing so without the approval of Congress. They have no right to take $30 million to pay for their own bureaucracy. That's not authorized by Congress. 
   We also know that the administration wants to take part of that money and apply it to other prog rams out there. 
   Once again, this is not taxpayer money. It's money that belongs to victims. And the Federal Government and, specifically, the Justice Department and the Federal bureaucrats need to keep their hands off that money, because it's not their money. It belongs to victims of crime. 
   Mr. Speaker, victims of crime do not have a lobbyist up here in Washington, DC, a high-dollar lobbyist advocating on their behalf. They expect us, Members of Congress, to be their lobbyist, and it's important tha t we do not let the bureaucrats, the robber barons take money out of that VOCA fund and apply it to other programs. 
   Find that money somewhere else. This money belongs to crime victims. It should not be robbed by the bureaucrats. It should be left alone. And, if anything, we ought to raise how much money we take out of that fund for victims of crime. 
   It's $1.7 billion this year. Next year it's going to be $1.9 billion criminals contribute to that fund. And yet our government continues to let less and less money be applied to victims. We have more crime victims in this country than we did last year, and we need victims assistance. 
   The Victims of Crime Act is a good idea. Let's leave it alone and quit robbing it to pay for other Federal programs. And if the Federal Government needs money to pay for these other programs, take money out of foreign aid or something. But leave victims alone. 
   Victims are a unique breed of people in our country, Mr. Speaker, and it's our responsibility to take care of them and make sure that they get the compensation they need, paid for by criminals who commit crimes against them. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   As we honor these lawmen, I give special attention to the Capitol Police Officers. These officers are on duty 24 hours a day in the halls, on the roof, and in the shadows of this Capitol diligently protecting this shrine of democracy. 
   Ten years ago, a madman entered the Capitol, shot and killed Officer Jacob Chestnut. He headed to the majority leader's office and wounded Officer Douglas McMillan and tourist Angela Dickerson. His shooting stopped after he murdered John Gibson, who literally gave his life for a Member of Congress. 
   In these hallowed halls, we have portraits and statues of great Americans that have lived before us, but the spirit of duty, sacrifice, and honor is still alive and on display daily by those Capitol Police who serve us so well. They carry on the tradition of Chestnut, McMillan, and Gibson, those noble three that stood in the line of fire for the rest of us.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I offer today will help reduce the lengthy delays consumers are facing when applying for passports, while at the same time strengthening security at our borders. 
   The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated that the U.S. Secretaries of Homeland Security and State develop and implement a plan to require all U.S. citizens and foreign nationals to present a passport or some other document when entering the United States, as of January 1, 2008. 
   For many years United States citizens and citizens from other countries in the Western Hemisphere have not been required to present a passport to enter the United States. They were admitted by stating verbally that they were from a country that didn't require passports or by presenting a wide variety of less secure documentation, including up to 5,000 documents that our border agents must be versed in. 
   The 9/11 Commission in their findings highlighted ``for terrorists travel documents are as important as weapons. ..... In their travels terrorists use evasive methods, such as altered and counterfeit documents, and they study and exploit America's vulnerabilities.'' The 9/11 Commission rightfully recommended we end the practice of traveling without passports. I am glad Congress took action on that recommendation. However, here we are 2 1/2 years later, and it seems we are still going further and further away from putting this policy in place due to the bureaucracy in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department through the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. 
   It seems bureaucrats implementing the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative continue to spend large amounts of time and money to come up with other ``alternative documents to passports'' to comply with this law. The answer is why? We have a secure document, the passport, that has been implemented and is being used. But the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State, even though they continue to say the passport is the ``gold standard'' for identity and citizenship documents because of its security, have come up with all different types of forms and documents that they are studying. All of these documents are unproven. They are called the Pass card, the BCC card, the SENTRI card, the Nexus card, the Fast card. And we are spending taxpayer money experimenting on these, while not implementing the proven document like the passport. 
   So this bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to use and implement only passports and quit spending money on documents that are unproven. And that is the purpose of this amendment: to spend money on passports only. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the chairman, I understand his concerns, but the problem is exactly as he stated. There are too many documents to allow people to travel back and forth across U.S. borders. The United States discriminates against citizens from other nations because we require all those people that enter the United States to have a passport. Because of the different special interest groups that have thwarted the implementation of passports by having other types of documents, those documents are unproven. In fact, Homeland Security is still studying those, which means they are spending money on trying to come up with various systems. 
   So rather than have three or four or five systems, I think it is important that we have one system, as the 9/11 Commission recommended. And that passport system is the one that is the most foolproof. It will take time to implement, but these other systems haven't been implemented at all. 
   So the purpose of this is to make sure that we are on the same page: Require a simple document, a passport document, one that I have here; one that is faster than trying to examine numerous documents; one that you can, as we say, slide and glide by coming across the border. It won't take any more time. In fact, it will take less time than some of these other unsecured documents. 
   So with that, I ask the approval of this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, binge drinking is the silent health epidemic attacking America's underage college students. It is defined as five consecutive drinks for men and four consecutive drinks for women. According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, 43 percent of college students state they are binge drinkers. Parents and college communities are rightfully concerned. 
   However, some universities ignore the problem and, in fact, are complicit in this drinking binge. Middlebury College in Vermont claims to have the cure for binge drinking: lower the minimum drinking age from 21 to 18. The former college president proposes that lowering the drinking age will encourage students to drink responsibly. That is an irresponsible statement. This will only encourage younger people to get drunk. 
   The answer lies in admitting the problem, enforcing underage drinking laws, and educating students on the effect of binge drinking. Lowering the minimum drinking age just adds fuel to the epidemic and gives students a legal license to drink. Colleges cannot consent to the binge drinking by ignoring the problem and making outlandish statements.

So when Shawn Sage, a foster child of 17, appeared before her to obtain permission to early enlist in the United States Marine Corps, she summarily denounced his request and told him she was opposed to the war in Iraq. 
   Shawn appeared in court with his supporting foster parents just to be insulted by a judge who makes decisions based on politics. Judge Mackel is a repeat offender, however. Judge ``Gone Wild'' Mackel has shown prejudice against the military before when she prevented a foster child from joining the United States Navy, all because of a political bias. 
   As a former judge, it appears to me the abuse of power by this anti-American military, peacenik judge is the perfect example of her having a terminal case of black robe disease, a disease some judges get when their personal politics cloud their judgment. Keep politics and wacky judges out of the courthouse. Judge Mackel is the newest member of the Judges' Hall of Shame.

   He gave numerous contradictory accounts about why he had the White House BlackBerrys. Then he said he was innocent. When all else failed, he claimed diplomatic immunity, and left the United States for Mexico. 
   Mr. Speaker, Rafael Curiel is just misunderstood. Obviously, when the White House discussion centered around free trade with the two countries, Curiel took the phrase ``free trade'' literally and did a little free trading on his own with those American BlackBerrys.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, brutal actions of local and state police are going unpunished; and, as the founder of the Victims Right Caucus, I bring this serious matter to the House's attention. 
   Two years ago, on May 3 and 4, 2006, there was a lawful protest in support of local flower sellers who had been displaced from their business because a new airport was being built. During the protest, law enforcement officers arrested and detained 47 separate women. The police officers didn't read the women their rights; the women were just arrest arrested, locked up, and taken into custody. Then, Madam Speaker, the officers beat and sexually assaulted them. I repeat, they beat and sexually assaulted the 47 women that were arrested. Obviously, lawmen have become outlaws. 
   One of the 47 women was Barbara Mendez, a 27-year-old student and a child advocate. Barbara went to the protest because she heard a child was killed in the violence between the police and the protesters. As a child advocate, Barbara went to show her support for the child and her community. But after Barbara arrived at the protest, the police beat her and arrested her because she was with the protesters and supposedly blocking a road. Barbara was placed in a police vehicle and forced to take off her clothes. She was then gang raped by the police officers, as other officers watched and cheered on the rapists. Barbara was then locked up in jail for 12 days. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a case of police gone wild. 
   Jail doctors then examined Barbara, but it just so happened that they failed to document her physical injuries or gather any forensic evidence of the rape. This evidence is crucial for any prosecution. 
   Madam Speaker, rape is a crime that tries to destroy the soul of the victim. And of these 47 women arrested and assaulted, 26 of them later filed complaints with authorities claiming physical, psychological, and sexual abuse during the arrest and detention. But since these assaults occurred, none of the police criminals have been brought to justice. No, not one. And this ought not to be. 
   Five months after the assaults, a national human rights commission called for criminal investigations into the assaults, but no investigations have occurred. 
   In February of 2007, the Supreme Court instructed a special judicial commission to investigate the crimes by the police in the arrest of these 47 women. 
   Then, Barbara Mendez and several other victims filed another complaint with federal authorities, but the federal authorities are sitting on these cases refusing to move forward. Why isn't there any justice for these women? 
   Next week marks the second year anniversary of these assaults, and yet none of these women have seen a courtroom. Obviously, no justice for these rape victims. Of the 47 women, two are from Spain, one is from Germany, two are from Chile, and the rest are Mexican citizens. But none of them received any justice. Basic human rights is obviously being denied. 
   Madam Speaker, these assaults did not occur in the United States. They occurred in San Salvador Atenco, Mexico, just 30 miles outside of Mexico City. 
   This issue is a world human rights issue, and this type of abuse cannot be tolerated and peace officers cannot enjoy impunity. Police officers are supposed to protect the community and keep people safe from harm, not cause harm to people. And, of course, this includes Mexican police officers. These officers must be held accountable. They need to have their day in court. And, if they are guilty, they need to be sent off to the jailhouse. 
   As we approach Mother's Day in the United States, Madam Speaker, we need to proclaim that mothers and women throughout the world receive the respect and honor due them. That includes justice, because justice is the one thing we should always find, even in Mexico. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Are we going to let a bunch of Potomac River bureaucrats determine if a radio station in Tomball, Texas is being fair when it discusses politics? Sounds like government control of speech to me. And fair means different things to different folks. It's too subjective a word for us to even agree on. 
   The Fairness Doctrine would not even promote public discourse. It would, in fact, force radio broadcasters to do away with controversy and maybe go to airing 24-hour music like Willie Nelson's greatest hits. Oops. Someone here might say Willie's not fair and balanced. 
   Anyway, the Constitution is clear. Congress, that's us, shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. You notice, it doesn't guarantee fair speech.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, recently this country has been very concerned about something that's taking place in lands far, far away. It seems as though that the Russians have decided to invade the Republic of Georgia. Many Americans didn't even know where the Republic of Georgia was. Now, most of us know where it is and where it's located. 
   In fact, the government has been doing much lately, talking about this invasion of another country and very concerned about the people of South Ossetia that have now occupied or have their country or territory occupied by the Russians. In fact, the country is so upset about this, our country, we have sent $1 billion to Georgia to help Georgia, supposedly for humanitarian aid. 
   But we seem to be somewhat concerned--and our rhetoric as a Nation is that one sovereign country has invaded the sovereign country of another, concerned about the borders of the Republic of Georgia. 
   It's interesting to me that we are concerned about the sanctity and sovereignty of other Nations and their borders, but yet back here at home we seem not to care about the sovereignty and sanctity of our own borders. We protect the borders of other Nations throughout the world. We're concerned about the border of Georgia, but yet this country still has no policy about being concerned and enforcing border security of our own Nation. 
   Yes, Mr. Speaker, I'm talking about the southern border with Mexico, and I'm talking about the northern border of Canada. Yet every day we still have hundreds of people crossing into the United States illegally. It's an invasion into our country. Without permission people are coming into this country, and they're here for all purposes. Sure we hear about those who are over here trying to look for jobs, that supposedly Americans won't take. 
   But there are also other people coming over here. We get the good, the bad and the ugly because we don't secure our borders, and right now we're getting a lot of bad and ugly. Mr. Speaker, if you don't believe me, I will take you down to the Texas-Mexico border and show you how the violence has gotten worse and worse because this Nation refuses to protect its own border from people coming in without permission. That's very unfortunate. 
   We are in a Presidential campaign. We hear a lot of talk about all kinds of issues, but yet I have not heard from either Presidential candidate about a plan to secure our borders. They're talking about everything else. I'd be glad to take either one or both of them down to the Texas-Mexico border and show them what it's like, the porous border, because we don't protect the sovereignty of our own Nation. 
   But yet we're concerned about the Republic of Georgia halfway around the world and their border. Doesn't make much sense to me. We should be just as concerned about our own borders as we are about borders of other people and give the money to our own people on our own border to secure it. 
   We send $1 billion quickly to the Republic of Georgia. What could our border patrol agents do with $1 billion on the Texas-Mexico border? They could do a whole lot more. And they're not getting it. They're not getting the support that they need. They're doing the best job they can. The sheriffs all along the border, from San Diego all the way to Brownsville, they're doing the best they can. 
   But let me tell you something, Mr. Speaker, the drug cartels have more money, they outgun our border security officials, and they're more tenacious and they're doing everything they can to come into the United States illegally. Yes, we're getting all of them, we're getting everybody because we refuse to secure our border. 
   And we don't need to do a whole lot except enforce the laws we already have. It's already illegal to come into the United States without permission. Why don't we enforce that law? We are trying to enforce the border security of Georgia. Let's enforce the border security of our own Nation. That's the public duty our government has.  
   We can work out the issues of what to do with people that are here illegally down the road. America will do the right thing, but we can never deal with that issue until we secure the border. 
   One of the things we ought to do is enforce the rule of law, and if businesses choose to hire folks that are illegally in the country and they know they're illegal, those business owners need to be prosecuted under current law. We see a few of those CEOs be carted off to jail in handcuffs, maybe they'll quit hiring folks that are illegally in the country. That's just one answer, but it's already the law. 
   So I encourage our government: enforce the law, protect our borders, secure our Nation first. That is the duty, obligation, and moral duty of our government. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (BURN THE BOOKS PART II -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, our country takes pride in the first amendment right of free speech and free press, but it seems that philosophy is no longer applicable when it comes to criticizing certain religions. 
   Random House Publishing has decided not to print the novel ``The Jewel of Medina'' because Islamic radicals are a bit upset. Apparently, American author Sherry Jones hurt some feelings by writing a fiction book about Muhammad's child bride Aisha. Now Random House has been intimidated into not publishing the book because a small radical group of Islamic individuals object. Random House has given in to the threats of the religious speech and press police. 
   Author Salman Rushdie, who was threatened by these same type of individuals years ago because of his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' said that, ``This is censorship by fear.''  
   These Islamic radicals go throughout the world and denounce free speech and free press if the content is critical of Islam. Further, they demand censorship of the offensive material. Radicals cannot control and suppress the first amendment because they don't agree with what people say or print. Too bad book publishers have given up their right to a free press because now a novel offends some religious group. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (WHAT WOULD THE DEFEATISTS HAVE US DO? -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, instead of praising and encouraging our troops in their relentless fight against the terrorist insurgents and seeing the success of U.S. troops, some choose to focus on the negative. They seem to preach gloom, doom and despair. They come across as defeatists, retreatists, and losers. 
   Do these people really want us to lose this war? Is their retreat political agenda more important than America's safety agenda? Now is the time, more than ever, that this Nation be behind our soldiers in this fight. 
   The dangers to freedom do exist. Right now in Afghanistan, Taliban forces are holding 22 civilians from a South Korean church. They have executed one hostage and plan to murder more. These Islamic radicals kill in the name of religion. Now, what would the surrender advocates have us do? Hide? 
   Fanatical militants are a threat to the security of free nations and the United States. It is the American troops, however, that are making a difference in beating back the forces of hatred and oppression. Our patriots deserve thanks, respect and our total commitment, not naysayers' words of criticism, contempt and complaining. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1495, WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to congratulate the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and Ranking Member Mica for their work on getting this long-delayed bill to the House floor, and I certainly support it. Both  the ranking member and the chairman have said, as long as I have been on this committee, that this is the most cooperative committee even though it is the largest committee in Congress. And it is true. It is a bipartisan committee that gets things done. We disagree, but we do it in a civil manner. 
   I am also impressed with Mr. Oberstar's knowledge of transportation history. He knows more about transportation that has occurred in the United States probably than all of us put together. 
   I do want to thank the committee for including in this WRDA bill the expedited completion of the study for the Sabine-Neches Waterway Project. I have been frustrated for the lack of progress by the Army Corps of Engineers to finalize this completion study. 
   The study report was started by the Corps in the year 2000, with a completion date of 2004. It was supposed to cost $6 million. And now it is 2007, and this project study is still not completed, and estimates on final cost of the project have now risen to $13 million. I appreciate the chairman's support for this study to be completed as soon as possible. 
   The Sabine-Neches Waterway is the riverway that separates Texas from Louisiana and flows into the Gulf of Mexico. Sabine-Neches is vital to not only southeast Texas, but it is essential for the national security needs of our Nation. It is the home of America's largest commercial military port and the Port of Beaumont, and it is second largest in the world. It is crucial for shipping military cargo to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and is America's largest importer of crude oil by tonnage. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of the Nation's jet fuel is produced by refineries on this waterway, including 80 percent of the jet fuel used by our military. This riverway supplies petrochemical and energy needs for southeast Texas and the rest of the Nation. 
   Section 508 requires the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite completion of this study whether or not to expand, widen, and deepen the riverway for the Sabine-Neches Waterway, and the joint statement further directs that this would be done as soon as possible. I hope this study is finished this year so that it will be included in next year's full WRDA bill and we can start moving dirt to widen, deepen, and make this riverway important not only for southeast Texas but for national security reasons as well. It is important for our economy, it is important for our recovering economy after Rita in southeast Texas, and I look forward to working on the next WRDA bill after this one is passed to have it completed. 
   Once again, I want to thank the ranking member and the chairman for their full support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the border war is increasingly more violent because of the drug cartels seizing control of areas in Mexico to manufacture drugs. 
   According to the Associated Press, President Calderon has called out the Mexican military to take out the drug smugglers. But some say the drug cartels have more money and outgun even the military. Recently, seven journalists reporting on the ``drug war'' have been murdered, the second most dangerous place for a reporter in the world next to Iraq. Thousands of Mexican citizens have been killed in the violence. 
   But the problem is not just in Mexico. As long as the United States does not protect our borders, the drug barons will continue to ship those drugs to America. 
   Some estimate the cartels make between $10 and $30 billion a year shipping that cancer to America. 
   But the problem has a third ingredient. It is not enough for the military to control the violence in Mexico. It is not enough for us to secure our borders. But the violence will continue until the American consumers curb their lustful appetite for narcotics. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the bill to bail out the elite financial industry in New York that caused this mess failed this House, but our Senate colleagues are sending us a new bill, four times longer than the 100-page bill rejected by us. 
   The bill to stabilize the financial industry is now packed with squeaky pork. One would ask, what does pork have to do with the financial industry? Well, nothing of course. But the Senate bill with the piglets will help these entities: new tax earmarks for film and TV production; litigants in the Exxon Valdez incident; wooden arrows used by school children. 
   There are more tax earmarks: auto racing tracks; Indian tribes; wool research; and get this one, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rican rum. I am not making this up. There are more breaks for the railroads and the mining industry. None of these solve our banking and financial crisis. Why are they in this bill? 
   The House needs to deal with this financial situation to make sure that those responsible are held accountable and that the American taxpayers aren't forced to go broke paying for this financial rescue.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, this House last night, about 11:30 p.m., authorized money for some absurd projects, including the study of bison hunting on the prehistoric Great Plains and, get this, the study of the sex lives of the Phayre's Leaf monkeys. 
   Meanwhile, our troops in Iraq are running out of money to fight the bad guys. Why? Because some Members of Congress think they know more about conducting the war in Iraq than the Generals do. So this congressional surrender group refuses to send more money without also demanding the day the United States will retreat and quit the fight.  
   This Nation is at war with the people of hate. Those ill-informed people who are determined that we lose this conflict by keeping a tight fist on the war money have their priorities wrong. 
   Money for the study of monkey business, but no money for the troops is a mockery. Money for our troops is more important than investigating the sex lives of the Leaf monkeys and the study of prehistoric bison anyplace in the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to work as late tonight to provide money for our U.S. warriors as we did last night to send money to the monkeys.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the suffering of a quiet group of remarkable individuals is often overlooked by our culture. Victims of crime sometimes spend the rest of their lives trying to cope with being someone else's prey. 
   These people are a cross section of America and include all races, ages, religions, and they come from all economic backgrounds. You see, violent crime plays no favorites and does not discriminate. 
   We, as neighbors, should be aware of and concerned about these victims. That is why we honor and remember them during this National Crime Victims Rights Week. Since 1981, each year in April, communities throughout these vast great plains have celebrated National Crime Victims Rights Week to promote victims' rights and to recognize victims, as well as those who advocate on their behalf. 
   We can do victims justice by raising awareness of their plight and demanding that justice prevail in their lives, many of whom spend quiet lives of desperation. They are the forgotten participants in the judicial system, and we will forget them no more.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (TEXAS MILITARY VETERANS POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Appreciate the comments by both sides on this very important piece of legislation. 
   The Post Office that we wish to name today is in my congressional district, it's in Humble, Texas, and it's a part of Southeast Texas where a great number of people continue to volunteer to be in our United States military. 
   Texans have always, when called upon by their country to go into service, have met that call with overwhelming numbers. And, in fact, today, serving somewhere in the world in a military uniform, one out of 10 people wearing the American uniform is from the State of Texas. 
   And it goes all the way back to 1836 when the first Texas veteran by the name of William Barrett Travis came to Texas from the State of South Carolina. He was a young lawyer, 27. And he was passionate about liberty and freedom. And he found himself at a beat-up old Spanish church in Central Texas that we now call the Alamo. The Alamo was over 100 years old at the time that he and 186 other brave Texans defended freedom. They were really from all States in the United States, six foreign countries as well, many of them, Mr. Speaker, from the State of Tennessee. 
   And he, like those defenders of the Alamo, were determined to seek liberty for the Republic of Texas. And as we all know, all of those first veterans gave their lives in that word that we praise today, that word of freedom. He was the first veteran that I wish to mention. And I will continue to mention just a few more so we know the importance of naming buildings after these wonderful people who have gone before us. 
   Of course, in that same struggle, all Texas armies were led by another Tennesseean by the name of Sam Houston. Sam Houston became the general of all Texas forces after the battle of the Alamo. He serves as the unique distinction of the only person in American history being governor of two different states, the governor of Tennessee and the governor of Texas. 
   But before he became governor of Texas he was president of the Republic of Texas. And because of the fact that on April 21, which we celebrate a week from today, in 1836, General Sam Houston, leading a ragtag army of volunteers, once again from all over the United States, several foreign countries, defeated the enemy, Santa Ana and his overwhelming army at the banks and the marshes of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. After that battle was over with Texas became a Republic and remained a free nation for over 9 years, and we owe much of that to General Sam, another veteran of Texas. 
   It's interesting to note that General Sam Houston's last words before he died, he mentioned to his wife 2 words, ``Texas, Texas.'' And then he died as a great military veteran of our State of Texas. 
   In World War I, there was an individual by the name of Kenneth Myers that served. In 1889 he was born. He joined the Navy in 1917, and he served on the battleship Oklahoma in World War I. And after the ``War to End All Wars'' was over with, he went ahead and became an agricultural expert in the State of Texas. He lived to be 107 before he died and became the third oldest survivor of that ``War to End All Wars,'' World War I. 
   In World War II there were many great Texans who served, but probably the most notable was a young individual who was a cotton farmer from Farmersville, Texas. Audie Murphy was too little and too small, they said, to join the Marine Corps, so he got into the United States Army, and he fought in the Army in World War II and he served 27 months in combat. He is the most decorated U.S. combat soldier in United States military history. He had received the Medal of Honor, of course the highest U.S. military award, along with 32 other medals from the United States, five medals from France and one from Belgium. 
   Audie Murphy symbolizes the great tradition of folks who joined the military, another wonderful veteran from the State of Texas. 
   A little-known veteran from Texas was an individual by the name of Doris Miller. That was his name, although he was a male, and he didn't even want his friend calling him Dorrie because his name was Doris. 
   He found himself, on December 7 on the USS West Virginia. He was a cook. Because of his race he was not allowed to be in combat, but when that battleship was attacked, he found himself behind a 50 caliber machine gun and shot down two, maybe three Japanese planes on December 7, 1941. And he was honored later as becoming the first African American to receive the Navy cross because of his heroism on that fateful day, that day of infamy, December 7, 1941.     
   Doris Miller later died in combat, and he was from the City of Waco, Texas. 
   A friend of mine who recently died was a Pearl Harbor survivor by the name of Luke Trahan from Beaumont, Texas, served in the United States Navy, a wonderful person and was a symbol of everything that is good and right about the veterans from our great State. 
   And, of course, having been the son of one of those individuals of the Greatest Generation, my father, Virgil Poe, served in Europe during World War II. He didn't say anything about his service in the United States Army because he went when he was a teenager, and after 50 years, he finally started talking about his service there after he and my mother went to that place in France that we call Normandy, where over 9,000 Americans are buried. He, along with both of my uncles, James Hamilton and Charles Willis, all three teenagers, served in that great war, World War II. 
   Also serving in World War II was Oveta Culp Hobby. She was a lawyer, and although she was a lawyer, she found herself in Washington, D.C., and when the war broke out, she became the director of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps which was later called and referred to as the Women's Army Corps. She has the distinction of being the highest ranking woman to serve in World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for her contributions in the war effort, becoming the first woman in American history to receive such award. 
   We're proud of the fact that Admiral Chester Nimitz is from Fredericksburg, Texas. Fredericksburg, Mr. Speaker, is a landlocked place. It's a long way from water. It is in the central part of the Hill Country of Texas; but Admiral Nimitz ended up being in the United States Navy, and during World War II, he was the Commander in Chief of all Pacific naval forces for the United States and Allied forces where he served with distinction. Even a high school is named for him in my congressional district.  
   Sometimes we forget the fact that Dwight David Eisenhower was born in Denison, Texas, in 1890; although he later moved to Kansas, and he served in World War II as a 5-star general in the Army, also being the first Allied commander in all of Europe, a great distinction for him. 
   In 1943, a young man was commissioned as a teenager in the United States Naval Reserves, and he was assigned to the United States Ship San Jacinto; and on this ship he was assigned to become a pilot for the TMB Avengers. And while piloting one such mission in Chi Chi Jima off the Japanese coast, this individual was shot down and rescued later by a submarine in the area. This individual flew 58 combat missions. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Air Medals and the USS San Jacinto was awarded the Presidental Unit Citation. That individual, of course, was former President of the United States, George H.W. Bush. 
   Mr. Speaker, there were many others who have served in the history of the State of Texas, but 12 individuals were remarkable in that these individuals, 12 brothers, these Band of Brothers, from a little town of Dayton, Texas, named the Ripkowsky brothers, all served in World War II and Korea. They served in all branches of the service. They served all over the United States and in foreign countries in combat, and after the wars were over, all 12 of them had the unique history of returning home to Dayton, Texas, where all of them lived except one who moved six miles away to the small town of Liberty. A great family that has served our country and veterans in their own right. 
   During the Korean War, Joseph Rodriguez from El Paso was drafted into the United States Army, although he later made the Army his career. Colonel Rodriguez, during the Korean War, received the Medal of Honor from President Truman because he attacked a Communist foxhole and then went on to attack four more Communist foxholes destroying all five emplacements and saving the lives of several of his comrades. 
   We have the unique distinction in this House of having a lot of great people who have served in our military in all branches of the service, both on this side and the other side, in this House and in the Senate. But one of those individuals grew up in Dallas, Texas, and he served in the United States Air Force for 29 years. He was the director of the Air Force Fighter Weapons School and flew with the Air Force Thunderbirds. He was a highly decorated fighter pilot who flew combat missions both in the Korean War and Vietnam, and in Korea he flew F-86s in 62 combat missions. In Vietnam, he flew F-4s. 
   And in 1966 while flying his 25th combat mission, our own Sam Johnson was shot down over North Vietnam. He was a prisoner of war in the Hanoi Hilton for 7 years, including 42 months in solitary confinement. During that time, he was repeatedly tortured. 
   He is a decorated war hero. He was awarded two Silver Stars, two Legions of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star with Valor, two Purple Hearts, four Air Medals, and three Outstanding Unit Awards as well. We are honored to have him not only from the State of Texas but to serve in this House of Representatives as many other veterans do as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (RECOGNIZING AND HONORING VICTIMS OF CRIME -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, this week is National Crime Victims' Rights Week, and in the criminal justice system, Madam Speaker, we've come a long way to the time that we recognize the importance of victims and honor them for a whole week. 
   Before I came to Congress, I was working in the District Attorney's office in Houston, Texas. That was even before I was a judge for 22 years. And I often reflect on one crime victim that taught me more about the way the world really is than maybe any other person. 
   Many years ago I had the opportunity to prosecute a case, and I'm going to change the names because the victim's family still lives in the Houston area and are concerned about their privacy. 
   This young lady was married and had two twin boys. And she had a good career. She was in her early 20s, and she was going to the University of Houston at night to get a second degree. 
   And one evening she was driving home, and she had car trouble. The lights came on in the dash of her vehicle. So she pulled over to a service station that she thought was open. But the service station was not open, it was closed. 
   She got out of the car, and she started talking to who she thought was a service station attendant. But the individual, Luke Johnson, was not a service station attendant. He was just hanging around. He pulled out a pistol. He kidnapped this young lady, Lisa,  and took her to a remote area in the piney woods of East Texas. He pistol whipped her. He sexually assaulted her, and he left her for dead. In fact, when he was later arrested, he was mad that he hadn't killed her. 
   But she was a remarkable young lady. She survived that brutal attack. Three or four days later, she was found in the woods by a hunter that was out there. Medical needs were met for her. She recovered that brutal attack. Luke Johnson was later captured and charged with aggravated sexual assault. 
   I was fortunate to prosecute that case. Lisa came and testified before a jury of 12 citizens of Houston, Texas. Luke Johnson was convicted. He received the maximum sentence of 99 years in the Texas State Penitentiary. 
   And, Madam Speaker, we would hope that all would be well with victims after that, that the world would go on and things would work out well. But that's not the world that we have ever lived in. 
   Lisa couldn't quite cope with being the victim of a crime. She never went back to that campus at the University of Houston. You can understand why. She couldn't hold a job. In fact, she was fired from her job because she couldn't focus. She started abusing drugs, first alcohol and then probably everything else that she could get her hands on. 
   Her husband, the kind of guy that he was, no longer wanted her, sued her for divorce, and was able to convince a judge in Houston that he should obtain both of the twin boys, and he left the State of Texas for good, claiming that she was not mentally capable to raise those two children. 
   And soon after that occurrence, I received a phone call from Lisa's mother telling me that she had received a note from her daughter saying that she was going to take her life. And she did. And I have that note with me today. I've always had that ever since this crime occurred, all the years I was a judge, and I have it in my office here in Congress, saying that she was tired of running from Luke Johnson in her nightmares. 
   She paid the ultimate price for being a crime victim, Madam Speaker. And because of the fact in those days there was no victim advocate, there was no one that she could turn to, she felt alone. She was alone, Madam Speaker. 
   But the criminal justice system in this country has come a long way. We have victims' advocates, who take care of the needs of victims, all the way from the time the crime is committed, through the trial, and after the trial. And we have people in the medical profession that donate their time to help in the recovery of crime victims. And now we have in the United States Congress a Victims' Rights Caucus. I'm proud to be the founder of that, but it's a bipartisan caucus. Jim Costa from California, a Democrat, is the co-chairman of this caucus. We have over 44 members, of Members of both parties, who seek and advocate rights of crime victims here in the United States House of Representatives. 
   Madam Speaker, we have come a long way. But we have a long way to go because crime victims are real people. Crime doesn't discriminate based on race, age, sex, or economic status. Crime affects so many people through this country. And we, as good neighbors, need to make sure that we keep up with people who have had that unfortunate experience of being a crime victim, especially of a violent crime. Because the same Constitution that protects the rights of criminal defendants protects the rights of crime victims. And we should always seek justice because justice is what we do in this country. And that means that we must always have justice for victims as well. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, murder in the name of religion has struck again. This time it happened in Dallas, Texas. 
   On New Year's Day law enforcement officials found the bullet-riddled bodies of two teenage sisters, 17-year-old Sarah Said and 18-year-old Amina Said. They were found in the back seat of their father's taxicab. 
   Now their father, Yaser Said, a Muslim and an Egyptian-born immigrant, is on the run. Authorities believe he murdered the girls after he found out they had American boyfriends. 
   Family members say the murder was motivated by a Muslim tradition known as ``honor killing.'' According to this tradition, religious extremists justify homicide in the name of religion in order to correct the ``shame'' that a family member has brought on the family. 
   Well, in the United States it is absolutely never acceptable, let alone honorable, to murder your own kids. This criminal needs to be tried and sent to prison. We live in a Nation that values life and liberty. And no father has a right to kill his daughters and try to claim the defense, ``My religion made me do it.''

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (DEATH PENALTY FOR CHILD RAPISTS -- (House of Representatives - January 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, soon our United States Supreme Court will hear the case of Kennedy v. Louisiana and decide whether capital punishment is permitted in rape cases where the victim is a child that is 12 or under. 
   Patrick Kennedy was sentenced in Louisiana to death after a jury convicted him of raping his own 8-year-old daughter. The facts show that he even tried to cover up the rape by cleaning up the evidence and then he blamed the rape on two neighborhood boys. 
   New Louisiana law allows the death sentence for raping a child that is under the age of 12, so Kennedy v. Louisiana asks the Supreme Court, among other things, to decide whether the eighth amendment of the United States Constitution, the cruel and unusual punishment clause, permits a State to punish the crime of rape of a child under the death penalty. 
   In 1977, the Supreme Court decided that a death sentence for rape of an adult woman was unconstitutional under a case called Coker v. Georgia. Coker really didn't discuss child rape, even though the victim in that case was 16 years of age. But since the Coker decision, State courts have interpreted it to limit death penalty crimes to certain murders. Those murders are what I call the murder-plus doctrine. There must not only be a homicide, but there must be some felony committed or some other unusual circumstance, like murder during a kidnapping, murder during a robbery, murder during a sexual assault, or murder of a police officer, and that is the doctrine that has been basically substantiated by the Supreme Court. 
   However, last year, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that Coker v. Georgia doesn't apply in their particular case of capital punishment and rape cases when the victim is under 12 because it would still be murder-plus, murder plus the victim was under the age of 12; thus, it would fulfill the Supreme Court's requirements under the Constitution. 
   No one has been executed in the United States for a crime other than murder since 1964. Many States, including my home State of Texas, before that time allowed the death penalty for robbery by firearm, kidnapping, and sexual assault. But since those days, only murder plus some other felony is allowed under our Constitution. 
   There are approximately 3,300 inmates on death row in the United States, and only two of them face the death penalty for an event that did not involve a homicide as well as a felony, and those two are the two that are on Louisiana's death row. One is the petitioner in the upcoming Supreme Court case that the Supreme Court will decide very soon; the other is an individual by the name of Richard Davis, who was recently sentenced to death in Louisiana for sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl. 
   Louisiana argues that the rape of a child is like no other crime. It also points out that the recent enactment of similar laws has occurred in other States such as Georgia, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas, my home State. Louisiana argues that it is compelling evidence of a national trend toward treating child rape as a distinct type of crime from other types of crimes. 
   But the issue will be whether the Supreme Court will allow States to make this decision for themselves, or will the Supreme Court continue to mistakenly go down the path and rely on international law, as it did when it barred the death penalty for 17-year-olds in a case called Roper v. Simmons. In Texas, 17-year-olds are adults, but the Supreme Court said no longer can 17-year-olds be executed for any crime. Hopefully, the Supreme Court will quit using international law and decide whether it is constitutional or not to execute someone for raping a child under the age of 12 based on American jurisprudence and our Constitution. 
   Madam Speaker, a death sentence fits the crime of child rape because a child rape victim suffers for the rest of their natural lives. Madam Speaker,  before I came to Congress, I was a judge for 22 years in Texas, and before that I was a prosecutor. 
   Many years ago, when I prosecuted cases, I prosecuted an individual who raped a 9-year-old. When her mother testified on the witness stand, she would not refer to the crime as rape or as sexual assault. She referred to that crime as a fate worse than death. And when she explained to the jury what that meant, she was saying that being sexually assaulted as a child is a fate worse than death. Hopefully our Supreme Court will not require a child victim to be murdered before the Supreme Court will allow the death penalty for the perpetrator, because it is, as this lady has testified many years ago, a fate worse than death. When a person commits a crime of sexual assault, they try to steal the soul of a victim. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I support a State's right to decide for itself whether or not a child rapist should be executed or not, because children are more important than rapists. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, now that the media sideshows and the press conferences are over for the Iraqi Surrender Group, and the President vetoed the day of surrender bill yesterday, and properly so, Congress needs to get on about the business of funding our troops. Failure to fund our troops not only will affect our troops there, but it will affect the Iraqi security forces, the National Guard, and, of course, our Reserves. 
   That first bill may have funded some of the troops, but it had the pork and beans provision, $26 billion for the shrimp industry, the peanut farmers and the spinach farmers. Eliminate that and eliminate the day of surrender provision in that bill. Have a clean bill to support our troops. No more complaining. Send them the money they need. 
   This reminds me of the same problem that General Stonewall Jackson had with the Confederate Congress when they were complaining about the war. He said, ``Send more troops, not more questions.'' 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (LONE STAR VOICE: BORDER AGENT'S WIFE -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, on the lawless southern border, Border Patrol agents are routinely assaulted by illegals. They are shot at. They are run down by smugglers in trucks. Officers who daily risk their lives protecting America are not always protected by America. 
   As a border agent's wife writes me: ``In Texas, agents are regularly assaulted, and no prosecution is sought. They are told their injuries are not severe enough to deem Federal prosecution. My husband and his partner were both shot while on duty. The criminal who shot them was never tried on Federal charges. Instead, he was tried by the State of Texas. Why is it when an agent doing his job injures a criminal, the highest level of prosecution is sought, but when agents are assaulted, rarely, if any, prosecution is sought?  Why also is it that hundreds of drug smugglers flee to Mexico, but we never try to track them down until they will aid in prosecuting border agents? Those who do a difficult job of protecting our borders need all the help they can get.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, America needs to vigorously prosecute criminals who assault our border agents. After all, they are the first line of defense from the illegal invasion into our homeland. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Thank you, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. I appreciate your leadership and the time you have given me to talk about this really important resolution, the resolution of retreat from combat. 
   You know, we in this House, in this warm House tonight at 5 minutes after the hour of 10 o'clock, we view this resolution from our own personal opinions. But maybe we should view something, and this resolution in particular, from a historical standpoint, for history has no opinion but is a teacher of hard facts of retrospect. 
   You know, this debate is not new to Congress. Years ago, after 5 long years of war, this Nation found itself at war with the greatest empire on Earth, Great Britain. The war of independence was not going well in 1781 and 1782. It looked bleak. The Commander in Chief, George Washington, had lost most of the battles he was engaged in. Public opinion was at an all-time low during the war. There were even mutinies in the Army from the Pennsylvania volunteers and the New Jersey volunteers. There was talk in the press of even reuniting with Great Britain, of all things, forming a truce and going back to be with the British. There were preachers of gloom, doom, despair and defeatism. There were generals on the battlefield that didn't like the way George Washington was handling himself as Commander in Chief and preaching to the public and their troops, We can't beat the British. 
   The debate was not new to this House, Mr. Speaker. Congress wanted to cut funding. The Continental Congress wanted to cut funding for the American Army and they not only wanted to do so, they did slash funds. Congress even in this time of bleak war reduced the size of the Continental Army. For the first and only time during the long war, George Washington left the field of battle and came to Congress and made the case for winning the war and not giving up, not surrendering, not reuniting with Great Britain. 
   And he made the comments. He said, ``We should never despair. Our situation before has been very unpromising. But it has changed for the better. So it will be again.'' 
   It's a good thing the Commander in Chief did not listen to the gloom, doom and despair of the Continental Congress in 1781. Then, as now, victory was the only option. Victory is simple. You defeat the enemy wherever they are. 
   So George Washington and a handful of barefoot soldiers at Yorktown defeated who the skeptics and cynics said could never be defeated--the British. The consequences of loss in 1782 would have been somewhat staggering. 
   Mr. Speaker, the flag that flies behind you now would have been the Union Jack instead of the Stars and Stripes, and this country, this people, this free people, would have been much different had we not won the war and stayed the course. 
   The consequences of abandoning our troops in the field by not giving them more troops would be joy to the terrorists that hate us and want to kill us. I  am sure the terrorists throughout the world would vote ``yes'' for this resolution of retreat and surrender, and those of us who want to defeat the terrorists should vote ``no.'' Our troops on the battlefield need to know help is coming. Like most Members of Congress in this House, they know people and they know people in their congressional districts that have died for this country in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, I carry with me the names of the fallen in my congressional district. The first one that fell was Sergeant Russell Slay, 1 day after I was elected in 2004. There are 17 names on these sheets of paper, all of them volunteers from southeast Texas, who went to Iraq and Afghanistan to fight terrorists, as they say in southeast Texas. Their names, Mr. Speaker, are more than names. They are real people. 
   Sergeant Slay died November 9, 2004, from Humble, Texas. 
   Lance Corporal Wesley Canning, November 10, 2004. He was from Friendswood, Texas. 
   Lance Corporal Fred Maciel, January 26, 2005, from Spring, Texas. 
   Private First Class Wesley Riggs, May of 2005 from Beach City, Texas. 
   Lance Corporal Robert Martinez, Splendora, Texas. He died December 1, 2005, at the age of 21. 
   Staff Sergeant Michael Durbin, January 25, 2006, from Spring, Texas. 
   Walter Moss, Jr. He was a tech sergeant from Houston, Texas. March 30, 2006. 
   Private First Class Kristian Menchaca, June 16, 2006, at the age of 23, from Houston, Texas. 
   Staff Sergeant Benjamin Williams, June 20, 2006, from Orange, Texas. He was 30. 
   Staff Sergeant Alberto Sanchez, Jr., at the age of 33, he was killed in Iraq on June 24, 2006, and from Houston. 
   Lance Corporal Ryan Miller, September 14, 2006, from Pearland, Texas. He was 20. 
   Staff Sergeant Edward Reynolds at the age of 28 was killed September 26, 2006, from Houston, Texas. 
   Captain David Fraser, killed in Iraq on November 26, 2006, at the age of 25, and he was from Houston. 
   Lance Corporal Luke Yepsen, December 14, 2006, at the age of 20, from Kingwood, Texas. 
   Specialist Dustin Donica, December 28, 2006, from Spring, Texas, at the age of 22. 
   Specialist Ryan Berg, January 9, 2007, at the age of 18 from Sabine Pass, Texas. Ryan Berg enlisted on his 18th birthday to join the United States Marine Corps. 
   And Staff Sergeant Terrence Dunn just a few days ago, February 7, 2007, from Houston, Texas. 
   Seventeen names from one congressional district, Mr. Speaker. There are names of over 3,000. And it seems to me that we owe it to these individuals, these American patriots, to send them the help that they need so that their lives meant more than just dying while the rest of the country decided to run away. We should finish what we have started. We should win this battle. We should fight the terrorists. We should look them in the eye and tell them, We're not going away until our job is done. 
   This resolution does not promote American unity to finish the job. This resolution does not hold in honor the names on this list, these real people, killed for this country and all volunteers. And they, like the ones that died in the Continental Army 200 years ago, died for a reason. The families that I have talked to believe in what their sons and daughters died for, and that was for fighting these evil people. We call them terrorists, these extremists, that hate us and will kill us if they have the chance. 
   So, I think history has taught us a lesson, that this Congress 200 years ago was faced with a choice and decided to take the funds away from George Washington. Fortunately, he was able to reunite the country and win that independence. And I hope that we reunite this country and finish the job and win this battle that we are fighting in a land far, far away for the same reason, and that are fighting people that are terrorists and hate us and people that are extreme in their beliefs in their hatred for America. 
   Because like I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, the flag that flies behind you is important. It is important that it is not the Union Jack or some other flag, and we owe it all to the military, the volunteers, the young men and women that have served recently and have served in our past for this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, journalism has taken a plunge into the depth of disturbing depravity at Central Connecticut University. A writer for the college newspaper wrote a slam piece against sexual assault victims. His article was entitled, ``Rape Only Hurts if You Fight It.'' He claims rape is a magical experience and a blessing for unattractive women. He and his Third-World college newspaper now say the piece was satire and humor. 
   This mean-spirited article shows no humor, but vile and vicious and abusive words about women. Journalistic attacks on rape victims dehumanize them and show a total lack of understanding of this crime. Rape is a physical and emotional crime that tries to destroy the inner soul of the victim. 
   Almost one-fourth of the women on college campuses are rape victims. Journalists who are out of touch with the real world do a disservice to this field, and tragically, like physical abusers, heap journalistic abuse on rape victims.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Steven Shulz joined the United States Marine Corps after 9/11 and wanted, as he said, ``to strengthen the United States military.'' 
   He did two tours of duty in Iraq, and in 2005 he was wounded by an IED in Fallujah. He had traumatic brain injury and was given up for dead. 
   Mr. Speaker, last rites were actually given for him. But Corporal Shulz refused to die, even though he has permanent brain injury, a weak left side, and is blind in one eye. No one ever expected Steven to even walk; but he continues to go through rehab, and his recovery is remarkable due to awesome medical personnel. 
   At a ceremony at the Baylor College of Medicine on Veterans Day, Corporal Shulz was presented with keys to a new home, especially designed and built for him, thanks to Houston area Rotary Clubs and benefactors in the Houston area. 
   It was a thrill for me and other Members of Congress to be present to see this young American hero. I was so impressed by his positive attitude and his love for America. He told me he would go back to Iraq and do it all over again if necessary. 
   Amazing men, these young guns of the United States Marine Corps.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, we're back. After a 5-week break, Congress has returned to do the people's business. 
   The number one concern among Americans is the high cost of energy, especially gasoline. Americans want Congress to come up with an energy plan to make our Nation independent from energy control of foreign powers. We send millions of dollars a day overseas to countries that don't like us and hold us hostage until we pay the ransom for that crude oil. 
   But Congress is not going to deal with energy legislation today. In fact, our first priority, our very first order of business after this long recess is to name a new Federal building in Virginia. And the second thing we're going to do is name a new Federal building in New York. 
   So no votes today on offshore drilling, no votes on drilling in ANWR, developing clean coal technology, building nuclear power plants, or anything else regarding energy. 
   For 5 weeks the lights were off in the House of Congress, and while we were gone they stayed off. We might as well leave them off now because Congress is still in the dark about energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, high-tech bounty hunting is now occurring in the United States. The Internet allows law enforcement to track down known sex offenders in the United States. States can find convicted sex offenders that must register under the new Adam Walsh Child Safety Act. Failure of a child molester to register is a Federal crime. 
   So these convicted sex offenders who do not register with local authorities are now being arrested using LexisNexis Internet tracking. 
   Florida police were hunting for a known sex offender. They traced him to Illinois, but Illinois officials claimed the offender was dead. The Internet search tools tracked the child molester to Indiana, where he was arrested for absconding and for failure to register as a known sex offender. 
   Studies show that convicted sex offenders often remain dangerous and become recidivists once released from prison. Sex offenders are now being held accountable for failing to register; law enforcement is informed of known sex offenders' whereabouts; future recidivism is prevented; and, meanwhile, children are safer because of high-tech bounty hunting.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Congress talks about feeling the pain of Americans. Well, raising taxes on them doesn't ease their financial pain. Working families are already burdened with high gasoline prices and increased expenses every day of their lives. Working Americans deserve to keep more of their money. It should be their responsibility how to spend it, not a bunch of tax-and-spend bureaucrats in Washington, DC. 
   We talk a lot about helping American families. Well, let them keep more of their money, instead of taxing them more. More government spending is not a strategy for helping Americans. More taxes on Americans, so special interest groups get more Federal money, is not a strategy for helping Americans. 
   President Kennedy and President Reagan both proved tax cuts work. Tax cuts, not tax increases, are the fundamental way to move our economy forward. We need to make permanent the tax cuts. And who benefits from tax cuts? Anybody that pays taxes benefits. And those that live off the taxpayer should not expect everybody else to pay more taxes for them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. ``Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy, or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes that he will encounter. The statesman must realize that once the signal is given, there are unforeseeable and uncontrollable events.'' 
   Winston Churchill's statement many years from the past indicates the truism of war. It is hard. It is always hard. 
   Next week, General Petraeus will be reporting to this Congress what progress has been made in achieving security and stability in Iraq. No doubt the report will offer mixed results, signs of progress and probably setbacks. 
   In the midst of all of this review, Mr. Speaker, the question is: Now what? 
   Regardless of what anybody thought about going into Iraq, we are there. Right now our military personnel are risking their lives every day in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect our interests at home and abroad. In my opinion, there are far too many people focusing on where we have been and how we got there rather than making decisions about the future and our involvement in Iraq. 
   The way I see it, Mr. Speaker, we just have two options. We can stay in Iraq and keep fighting for the American interest and what we believe is right, or we can turn our back and leave. There is not a third option. 
   To those who think we ought to leave Iraq and bring our troops home, what will happen if we withdraw before the job is done? The answer is chaos and more bloodshed. Without a stable Iraq, the power vacuum will inevitably entice more civil war like we haven't begun to imagine and, most likely, a regional conflict that will lead to serious security risks for those nations and the United States. 
   Congress is making the outcome of this war the same as the planned failure in Vietnam. That war lasted 10 years. The media didn't like the war. The American public got war weary and Congress then cut the funding and started bringing troops home. The results: We left before the mission was accomplished. We abandoned our friends, and when the communists gained control, they killed thousands of people because we lost our way. 
   Our enemies today believe we will abandon Iraq in the same way, and they hope we do. They feel we don't have the stomach for war. Our enemies believe they are more committed to their cause of killing in the name of religion than we are for our cause of life and liberty. 
   Abandonment and retreat is not a strategy. We stay because it is in America's best interest to stay and secure a victory before we turn the country over to the Iraqis. We stay because there are men and women laying down their lives for the cause of America. Twenty-one courageous men and women from my area in southeast Texas have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. What would the retreat crowd tell those families about their kids who died on the altar of freedom? War got too hard so we left? We don't quit because war is hard. War is always hard. We stay, Mr. Speaker, because we know that we are fighting a global enemy who doesn't intend to stop war. They want to destroy us. Success, Mr. Speaker, has never come from withdrawal; it never will. 
   General George Patton in World War II told his troops in 1944, he said, ``Sure, we want to go home. We want this war over with. The quickest way to get it over with is to get the ones who started it. The quicker they are whipped, the quicker we can go home. You must always do your finest and win.'' 
   That is the only option. And yes, Mr. Speaker, Patton and his boys successfully finished that war. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the violent El Salvadorian gang, MS-13, continues to spread violence in American cities. These thugs started in the eighties and have caused murder and mayhem in Central America. The son of a Honduran president was kidnapped and murdered in 1997. In 2002, gang members gunned down 28 people, including seven kids, on a school bus in Tegucigalpa. 
   Experts now say these gangsters are the number one problem in Central American countries. Recently, even Mexico stepped up campaigns to arrest these criminals, claiming them to be a threat to national security. 
   The brutal MS-13 gang has acted in major cities in the United States and are involved in everything from drug and human smuggling to murder. Many of these gangsters are illegally in the United States. Ironically, many major cities that are sanctuary cities for illegals, all in the name of compassion, are hotbeds for MS-13. These cities make law enforcement and deportation hard for the Feds. 
   Mr. Speaker, cities that give aid and comfort to illegals should be more concerned about protecting the safety of citizens than harboring and hiding out criminal illegals.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, San Francisco city officials are encouraging illegals to find their home in this California town. The city recently began an expensive public relations campaign reminding illegals that it is still a sanctuary city and that local law enforcement will not cooperate with Federal officials to enforce immigration laws. 
   This bold announcement comes at a good time. Many other American cities actually believe in enforcing the law and cooperating with the Feds to arrest international trespassers. This causes illegals that live in the shadows of those cities to be perplexed as to what to do. They certainly don't want to go home because they cannot receive free social services like health care, welfare, and education. 
   So to be completely compassionate and caring, San Francisco should expand its PR campaign to include those hardline, narrow-minded, nonsanctuary cities and encourage their illegals to go to San Francisco. The PR campaign should be ``The City by the Bay welcomes all, including those that violate the law.'' 
   Meanwhile, Congress should prohibit all Federal money from going to sanctuary cities like San Francisco that laugh at the rule of law and pander to illegals.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, ``I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of officers appointed over me according to the regulations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.'' 
   Each day, new Marines take this oath to serve and protect the United States and freedom-loving people. They live their lives by it, and they die by it.  
   LCpl Anthony Aguirre dreamed his whole life of taking this oath and becoming a member of this elite fighting force. Anthony was from Channelview, Texas. At a young age, he knew he wanted to be a Marine. He felt so compelled to serve our country that he took every opportunity to become involved in any military program that he could find, like the Junior ROTC at Channelview High School. 
   When he was in the Junior ROTC, Anthony was the company commander. During his senior year in high school, he achieved the rank of cadet captain. Many of those who were involved with the ROTC with Anthony remember him as a patriot. He always had a sense of duty to this country. Even after graduation, Anthony often stopped by the high school to proudly talk with the Junior ROTC cadets about the Marines. According to the ROTC instructor, Anthony wanted to be a Marine because he thought it was the toughest of military U.S. services. 
   Lance Corporal Aguirre joined the United States Marine Corps 1 year after graduating from Channelview High School and became a member of the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, III Marine Expeditionary Force in Hawaii. 
   His sister, Christine, said that Anthony thought of doing nothing else with his life but being in the Marine Corps. So Anthony Aguirre joined the United States Marine Corps. He served our country in Iraq, but he met a warrior's fate a few days ago. This is a photograph of Anthony Aguirre. Anthony was killed in Iraq, and the funeral for him was today. 
   Let me tell you a little bit about the funeral, Mr. Speaker. As the funeral procession passed through the streets of Channelview, estimates were that over 8,000 people were there from the schools, the local refineries, the fire department and the neighborhoods. They stood on the side of the road for miles waving American flags for this Marine. 
   Anthony Aguirre was buried today in Highland, Texas. The high school flag was flown at half mast in his honor, and later the flag was given to his sister, Christine Castillo, and his brother, Earnesto Salinas. Tony had numerous other siblings and cousins. 
   Now I want to tell you how he died, Mr. Speaker. On February 26, 2007, at the age of 20, in an act of fearless courage, LCpl Aguirre put his life on the line for his brothers in arms. And while fighting the forces of evil in Al Anbar Province in Iraq, Anthony stepped on an improvised explosive device. IEDs, as they are called, are a coward's way of killing U.S. soldiers, women, children and the elderly. 
   But he didn't immediately jump, as would be a reflection or a reaction for most of us. He kept his foot on the IED and he told the other 20 Marines standing around him to clear the area and take cover. When he saw that they were out of harm's way, he took his foot off the device. He gave his life so that other Marines could live. 
   When this group of Marines reported back to their commander, they told him that Tony had just saved their lives. The commander immediately knew they were referring to LCpl Anthony Aguirre. 
   Amazing men, these young guns of the Marine Corps of today. 
   On a road called Crosby-Lynchburg in my district, there are flags mounted along this rural road in honor of the brave life of Lance Corporal Aguirre. And as the community laid another one of America's sons to rest today, the catalog of history is etched with another name of an extraordinary Texas hero and Marine. 
   Lance Corporal Aguirre died as he lived, for the Marines, for his brothers in arms. 
   Shakespeare put it best in Henry V when he echoes Aguirre's commitment to fellow warriors. He says, From this day to the ending of the world, we in it shall be remembered. We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother. 
   We shall remember Lance Corporal Aguirre. Semper Fi, Lance Corporal Aguirre. Semper Fi.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government is helping and encouraging illegals in this country to send money south of the border. Here is how it works. 
   The Federal Reserve, in a program called Directo a Mexico, allows illegals that have no Social Security numbers and no American IDs to send billions of dollars through U.S. banks to Mexico. 
   The Federal Reserve, also at taxpayer expense, provides banks with promotional marketing propaganda in Spanish so as to appeal to the ever-growing illegal population. This untaxed money to Mexico is about $23 billion a year and a drain on the United States economy. 
   The banks make a profit off the illegals and their transfers. It is all about banking greed. These transactions should be taxed, and the banks should be required to collect the taxes. 
   Keep some of that money in the United States to pay for all the social services that illegals obtain and don't pay for. Banks should not be in the business of helping illegals in the United States send money anywhere,  and neither should our Federal Government, for that matter. But banking greed seems to rule the day.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE SECOND AMENDMENT -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court is considering Washington, DC's total handgun ban. It is illegal to buy, sell or own a handgun in this Nation's Capital of ours. Of course, DC has one of the highest homicide rates in the entire country. 
   The center of this debate is a question that has never really been clearly answered. What exactly does the second amendment to our Constitution mean? Did the Framers intend to protect an individual right or provide for State militias? 
   The second amendment states, ``A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' 
   Our Founding Fathers risked their lives in the American revolution to create our Nation. They distrusted government, especially a government that wouldn't trust its own citizens. 
   Our Founding Fathers knew the importance of an armed citizenry from their experiences in the American War of Independence. They trusted an armed citizenry and a citizen militia as the best safeguard against the tyranny of government. 
   To truly understand the meaning and purpose of the second amendment, we need to understand the men that wrote the Constitution and what they said when it was ratified. The Founding Fathers were very concerned that a strong Federal Government would trample on individual freedom and individual rights because that's what happened to the colonists, and that's what governments historically do to their people, trample on individual rights. 
   So after the ratification of the Constitution, the Framers knew that a declaration of rights had to be added to protect basic individual rights, rights that are inalienable, created by our creator and not created by government. 
   So the Founders looked at the English common law, at the English declaration of rights of 1689, which specified the guaranteed right of the people to bear arms. 
   Those who claim there is no individual in the second amendment ignore the most basic feature of American rights: Rights in this nation belong to individuals. 
   The second amendment was included in the Bill of Rights to prevent the Federal Government from disarming the public like the British Army did to American citizens. The right of the free people to defend freedom and protect themselves was so important that it was placed second in the Bill of Rights. 
   Thomas Jefferson knew the importance of an armed citizenry. He said, ``No free man shall ever be debarred from the use of arms.'' 
   Samuel Adams wrote that ``The Constitution shall never be construed to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their arms.'' 
   And of course James Madison, who helped write the Bill of Rights, once wrote that the Americans had ``the advantage of being armed,'' and that other nations governments were ``afraid to trust the people with such arms.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, the second amendment is a personal right for individuals in this country, and the DC ban is a violation of the United States Constitution, specifically, the second amendment to that Constitution. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Madam Speaker, this eternal statement from the Declaration of Independence clearly states the United States' right to self-determination. We used this natural right to break away from Great Britain. 
   Last week Kosovo unilaterally declared itself an independent and sovereign state, and the announcement has ushered violence in the region and opposition from the country it broke from, Serbia. Following Kosovo's declaration of independence, the United States was one of the first world powers to grant official recognition to the self-declared independent Kosovo. Since then, several other countries have followed. Of course, not everyone agrees that Kosovo may unilaterally declare its independence from Serbia. Certainly Serbia objects. 
   At the same time, Russia, China and Spain have shared their strong opposition to the declaration. Each of these countries is struggling with its own separatist communities. They are afraid that Kosovo's unilateral declaration will encourage secessionist groups in their own country to rebel and declare themselves independent and sovereign states. 
   When we start meddling in the internal affairs of international nations like Serbia, consequences are sure to follow. Let me be clear, I am not talking about a people rising up and overthrowing a civil government, but a people separating themselves from a civil government and forming a new nation. 
   The question is, do all peoples have this right of separation, and does the United States support that? What position will the United States take as other peoples may decide self-determination, separation and independence? By recognizing Kosovo, the United States is setting a precedent, and it needs to take that position very seriously, because there are consequences. 
   Is the United States willing to offer recognition to the Basque and Catalan people of Spain if they declare independence or to Chechnya if they break away from Russia? Or how about Tibet if they decide to leave China? Separatist communities across the world are interpreting the actions of the United States in Kosovo to suggest that America supports movements of self-determination. 
   A columnist for an African newspaper recently wrote a newspaper article titled ``Kosovo--the precedent that will enflame Africa.'' This journalist predicts that the Kosovo recognition will ignite a revival of secessionist groups across the African continent. Will the United States be prepared to deal with that if it happens? And what will we do? Will we send troops? Will we send aid to these movements? 
   We've even got folks from the State of Montana here in the United States saying they are going to secede from the Union if the Supreme Court rules a certain way on gun ownership. Is self-determination allowed in Montana? 
   Looking at our country's history, it is pretty clear that the right of self-determination of a people is expensive,  and it has costs. If it weren't for the courage and self-determination of our country's founders, we would still be a colony of Great Britain. 
   But the United States has been inconsistent on the right of self-determination. For example, in the 1860s, the United States rejected this self-determination here at home. More than 650,000 Americans were killed during the War Between the States when the South claimed the right of self-determination and the North went to war to prevent it and to prevent southern independence. 
   Independence is a serious and volatile matter. Thomas Jefferson said, ``What country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time that the people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take up arms.'' These are strong words from the author of the Declaration of Independence. 
   Is this statement U.S. policy? It may very well be the case that the United States' position in Kosovo will encourage more turmoil throughout the world. What will the United States do then? Is the United States going to choose to either fully support or fully oppose the right to self-determination for other peoples? Or is the United States going to continue down its path of inconsistent foreign policy on self-determination? 
   People with aspirations of independence all over the world are watching the United States and trying to interpret what our foreign policy is. They need to know what our position is on independence, and the American public needs to know where we stand on independence for other peoples. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, born in South Carolina in 1810, Sam McCulloch, Jr.  arrived in Texas with his father and three sisters just prior to the Texas War for Independence from Mexico. 
   McCulloch was a free black, and with his freedom he volunteered as a private in the Texas Army to fight for independence. On October 9, 1835, McCulloch took part in the Battle of Goliad. While storming the Mexican line, McCulloch was severely wounded when a musket ball shattered his right shoulder. Thus, Samuel McCulloch, Jr. became the first Texas casualty of the war. 
   After Texas won its independence and became a free Republic, Samuel McCulloch, Jr. went on to fight against the Comanches along with the Texas Rangers at the famous Battle of Plum Creek, and he served as a spy for the Texas Army when Mexico reinvaded Texas in 1842. Later, McCulloch lived as a farmer and a rancher with his family on the land that the Texas government gave him for his service to the Republic. 
   He died in November of 1893. He triumphed over all obstacles and voluntarily risked life and limb to establish freedom for Texas, the land he loved. During Black History Month, we honor this freedom fighter and this first to shed blood for Texas independence.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, aircraft repair stations located in foreign countries are allowed to become certified by the Federal Aviation Administration to work on United States aircraft without meeting the same standards or being subject to the same oversight imposed on domestic stations in regard to drug and alcohol testing of workers. 
   This amendment would close this loophole because it makes no sense to require U.S. mechanics to undergo various levels of drug and alcohol testing if workers doing the same work on the same type of aircraft for the part of the same airlines are exempt from this requirement simply because the station is located overseas in another country. According to a report by the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation, the number of certified foreign repair stations has increased from 344 in 1994 to almost 700 in 2007, more than double the number of stations over the last 13 years. U.S. air carriers now outsource overseas 35 percent of their maintenance work to foreign repair stations, and that is up 21 percent from 2003. This growing trend necessitates the additional safety standards. 
   The FAA itself has moved to extend drug and alcohol testing domestically and noted, ``It has the statutory authority and, in the interest of aviation safety, the responsibility to require that individuals who actually perform safety-sensitive duties are subject to drug and alcohol testing.'' 
   Also, the Department of Transportation's recent pilot program to allow Mexican-domiciled motor carriers to enter and travel throughout the United States, DOT stipulated that operating authority will not be granted to these Mexican companies unless this company has in place, and DOT can verify, a controlled substance and alcohol testing program consistent with U.S. domestic requirements. So if DOT can impose the requirements on Mexican drivers as a condition of entering the U.S. in the name of safety, there is no reason why the FAA cannot follow suit with similar requirements for foreign mechanics working on aircraft that will operate in the United States. 
   This is a safety issue. Mechanics that work on American aircraft overseas should meet the same drug testing requirements as mechanics that work on these aircraft in the borders of the United States. 
   I urge support of this amendment to close this loophole so that all maintenance workers who work on planes that fly in the United States equally are treated the same and undergo drug and alcohol testing. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (PROSECUTION OF BORDER PATROL AGENTS -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, this afternoon I want to discuss criminal cases, three criminal cases that have occurred in these United States. All three of these criminal cases have to do with law enforcement officers that were prosecuted by the Federal Government for alleged crimes that they committed on the southern border with Mexico. And I want to discuss the facts of each of these cases so that we have a clear understanding on what has occurred on the border and the border war with Mexico, and how our Federal Government is so relentless in prosecuting the border protectors and not prosecuting those who come across the border illegally. 
   The first case has to do with the Border Patrol by the name of David Sipe. David Sipe patrolled the Texas/Mexico border down in what is called the McAllen area. Pinedas, Texas, is exactly where it occurred. That is on the tip of Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico that borders Mexico. 
   In April of 2000, he was on patrol, as he did for many years, as a Border Patrol agent. And a sensor goes off on the border. What that means is that people are coming across the border without permission, illegals, if we can use that phrase. 
   David Sipe goes to the area where the sensor goes off and he sees 12 to 15 illegals coming across the border. Agent Sipe orders them to stop. 
   Now, first of all, Madam Speaker, we have one patrolman and 15 illegals. It takes quite a law enforcement officer to have the courage to stop that many people coming into the United States. But he did so because that was his responsibility. 
   Three of those illegals, however, ignored Agent Sipe and ran into a brushy area there on the Texas/Mexico border. He caught those three individuals. And one of those individuals who was illegally in the country, a Jose Guevara, attacked Border Agent Sipe. And according to Border Agent Sipe, Guevara was going for the agent's weapon while he was being attacked by this illegal. 
   So Agent Sipe pulled out a flashlight. It is not just a little flashlight that we  normally get over at Wal-Mart. It is one of those long flashlights, and he hit Guevara in the head defending himself. And the wound on Guevara's head required about five stitches later.     
   Now, instead of prosecuting Guevara for assaulting the border agent, instead of prosecuting Guevara for being in the country illegally, our U.S. Federal Government swoops on the scene and charges Agent Sipe with using excessive force in the arrest of this illegal. 
   The government then gave Guevara, the illegal, and two other illegals what I call ``get out of jail free'' cards. In other words, their crime, illegally coming to the United States, their crime in my opinion of assaulting a border agent, was forgiven with some kind of backroom deal with the promise of those individuals to testify against Agent Sipe in Federal Court for using excessive force against these individuals. 
   But that is not all your Federal Government did for these illegals. Giving them get out of jail free cards also gave them Social Security cards, witness fees, and permits allowing them travel back and forth across the border to Mexico without any type of intervention, and further gave them living expenses or money, and, finally, gave them free government phones to use while they were waiting to testify against Sipe. So this is the deal they got to testify against the border agent. 
   Now, it has been my experience as a judge in Texas for over 22 years, trying only criminal cases, only serious felony cases, that when the prosecution starts making deals with witnesses or law violators and giving them some benefit for testimony, they usually get the testimony that the government wants. 
   And so what happened in this case? The agent was tried, he was convicted, and the three illegals who got immunity testified against him. He was convicted in the year 2006. During the trial, the Mexican Government was involved in this case, pursuing and demanding prosecution of Agent Sipe. 
   Now, let's talk about the rest of the story. He is convicted and his case is on appeal. But it turns out, while his case is on appeal, he files a motion for a new trial with the trial judge, telling the trial judge that at his own trial the jury should have heard about the deal made to the illegals. You see, the jury was never told about this backroom deal made with these witnesses. The Federal judge agreed and ordered a new trial. 
   During these hearings, the U.S. Attorney's Office of course never told the defense that they had given the illegals money or U.S. documents or immunity or green cards or Social Security or cell phones. See, the government never told the defense that during the trial, and they didn't know this deal was made with these illegals, and it is found out after the trial. And once this is found out, brought to the attention of the Federal judge, the defense saying the jury should have known about this so they could hear and judge the credibility of these illegals, a new trial was ordered. And sure enough, he was tried again, the second jury hearing all the truth, the second jury hearing the evidence that the prosecution suppressed in the first trial, and the second jury found Agent Sipe not guilty of any wrongdoing in January of this year. 
   So the facts of this case: Federal Government prosecutes the border agent for using force; the Federal Government hides evidence in the trial; they are caught hiding evidence; a new trial is ordered; the new trial occurs. The jury hears about the deals made with the illegals, and the second jury finds the agent not guilty, and properly so. Agent Sipe is trying to get his job back as a border agent, but of course our Federal Government is fighting that situation as well. 
   It makes you wonder, Madam Speaker, why our Federal Government is so relentless in prosecuting border agents, especially in a case like this where the person was found not guilty. And why must our Federal Government withhold and hide evidence that is favorable to the defense in a criminal case? Is it just so they can have convictions of border agents? It makes one wonder, does it not, Madam Speaker? 
   The second case involves one that most Americans have heard about, two border agents once again on the Texas/Mexico border. Their names are Ramos and Compean. Both of these individuals I have met. I have met their families. They are wonderful people. And both of them, all they ever wanted to be was a law officer protecting the U.S. border from people illegally coming into the United States. 
   So while these two individuals are on patrol as border agents on the southern border with Mexico, Agent Ramos responded to a call for backup from Agent Compean along the Texas/Mexico border. He had noticed a suspicious van coming into the United States, Texas, if we will, and it looked funny. And based upon his experience as a border agent, a van coming across the river at this desolate area only means one thing to most people: that means it is a drug dealer bringing in drugs. 
   In the van was an individual by the name of Aldrete-Davila. He was a drug smuggler. And when he comes across the river, he notices the border agents see him. He tries to turn the van around and head back to Mexico. He abandons the van, takes off running. He gets in a scuffle with one of the border agents right there in the Rio Grande riverbed. He runs on back across the Rio Grande river. Shots are fired by both border agents. And Davila, as he is going into Mexico, is shot in I believe the left cheek and the bullet coming out the right cheek. Of course, no one at the scene neither, Ramos or Compean, the border agents, knew that they had hit this individual because he disappears. He already had somebody waiting for him on the Mexican side to pick him up and take him back into Mexico someplace. 
   They go to the van, and in the van, sure enough, 800 pounds of marijuana. Now, that doesn't mean much to most of us; but if we give you a money figure, it will be relevant. The marijuana in the van was worth approximately $1 million. And it is recovered. And then the border agents, after other border agents appear on the scene, are eventually charged with using excessive force against the drug dealer. 
   How did this all occur, since no one even knew the drug dealer was hurt? Well, it turns out, once again, our Federal Government gets involved in this case, goes to Mexico, finds the drug smuggler Aldrete, brings him back to the United States, takes him to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, and pays for his recovery and his surgery. Paid for it, that means American taxpayers paid for his surgery and paid for his treatment. And while there, he decided he is going to sue the Federal Government, that means us, the taxpayers, for $5 million for being shot by two border agents. 
   Now, it is true, Ramos and Compean probably did not follow appropriate policy in the way they handled the reporting of this incident, and so they were suspended. They are tried, but they are not tried for violating Border Patrol policy. They are tried for using excessive force in firing their weapon at this drug dealer as he is fleeing back to Mexico. Part of the reason that they were prosecuted was because, like in the first case with Sipe, the Mexican Government in its self-righteous arrogance demanded prosecution of these two border agents, and that is exactly what happened. 
   They were prosecuted. They were tried in Federal Government court. It took forever for us in Congress to receive the trial transcript of that trial. And they were sentenced to 11 and 12 years in the Federal penitentiary for alleged civil rights violations 
   Now, the Federal Government, the prosecutors, in this case made another deal, a backroom deal with the drug smuggler. They forgave him of his sins of bringing in $1 million worth of drugs if he would testify against the border agents in this trial. And he did what was expected of him: he testified just exactly the way the Federal Government wanted him to testify in this case. 
   But now there is more to the story. It turns out that the drug dealer, while waiting to testify after picking up the first case, getting immunity from being prosecuted, and before the trial it seems as though that our little friendly drug dealer from Mexico brings in another 750 pounds of marijuana. And the Federal Government knew about this case, the DEA investigated the case, they made a report. I have that report; I have seen the report. That case is simple to be made. In  other words, it could be a simple prosecution. A third-year law student could prosecute that case. 
   But the Federal Government doesn't prosecute the drug dealer on the second case. They just ignore the second case. He is never charged; he is never arrested. Nothing ever happens in the second case. And more importantly, the jury never heard about the second case and the second deal that our Federal Government implicitly made for the drug dealer. 
   Now, why is that important? First of all, it is withholding evidence from the jury. And as we discussed, it is basic American law that the prosecution may not withhold evidence favorable to the defense. They may not withhold it on purpose, they may not withhold it because of their negligence, and they may not withhold it because of their incompetence. If you withhold evidence from the jury that is beneficial to the defense, normally the defense is entitled to a new trial. 
   Also in the trial the drug dealer was made out to be, by the prosecution, as he testified, just a mule and that he was bringing drugs in the United States to get a little money to help his poor sick mama down there in Mexico. Well, we understand of course that wasn't the truth. He was more than a mule. He brought over at least two different times drugs into the United States. It kind of puts him up on the ladder a little bit, each time the drugs, around $1 million of drugs, going into our streets and our highways and byways. And the prosecution ignored the second case, and the jury should have heard about the second case to judge the credibility of the witness. And what do I mean by judge the credibility of the witness? 
   You see, when the witness comes in and testifies, the jury needs to know what deal the prosecution made with the witness to get him to testify because, as I mentioned earlier, you usually get the testimony you want when you make a deal with some criminal. And in this case, the prosecution obviously got the testimony they wanted because Ramos and Compean were convicted. 
   And so the question is, why did our Federal Government in this case choose not to prosecute the drug dealer? 
   Assume, if you will, that the border agents violated some policy. They probably should have been suspended, given some days off for not filling out the forms correctly or reporting it correctly. But here, on the other hand, you have got a drug smuggler bringing in $1 million worth of drugs. 
   Now, why did our Federal Government choose to prosecute border agents and not prosecute drug smugglers? We don't know the answer to that question. We may never know the answer to that question. But we do know the Mexican Government in this case as well was involved in relentlessly wanting these two border agents prosecuted. They are both now in Federal penitentiary serving their 11- and 12-year sentences. One of them, shortly after he went into custody, was beat up by people in the local prison because of the fact that he was a Border Patrol agent and arrested many drug dealers in the past. 
   And let me give you a little more information on this particular case. When this all came to public light about these two border agents, myself and other Members of Congress wanted to know the facts because the trial transcript had not been produced yet. 
   So we met with members of the Office of Inspector General to try to get a briefing, if you will, on what happened down there on the border; and during that briefing we were told certain things that did not occur. We were told that Ramos and Compean had decided that day they were going to shoot a Mexican national. At the trial, there is no evidence that that ever occurred or any statement was ever made. Is that misleading Members of Congress, misleading the American public? 
   We were also told that Ramos and Compean did not think the drug dealer had a gun. Not so. During the trial, both agents testified they had thought the drug dealer had a gun, thus the way the angle of the bullet went through one buttocks and came out the other side as if somebody is pointing a weapon at you. That was a falsehood as well. 
   It makes us wonder as elected officials why our Federal Government is not candid with Members of Congress about the truth of this particular case. So in this particular matter, the jury didn't hear about the second case. And now they are both in prison while their case is on appeal. And, hopefully, the appellate courts will review the entire matter, reverse the case, order a new trial, and let the jury hear all the truth in the second trial, like the jury did in the David Sipe case. 
   Now the third criminal case, which is even more recent than Agents Ramos and Compean. It also occurs in Texas, it also occurs near the Texas/Mexico border. It occurs in a place called Edwards County, Texas. Probably most Americans haven't been there. Edwards County is about the size of Delaware, and on any given day there are three deputy sheriffs on patrol. That is all.     
   And one of those deputy sheriffs is a person by the name of Gilmer Hernandez. Gilmer Hernandez was on routine patrol by himself. Of course, they don't have enough manpower to put two people in a patrol car. And in the middle of the night, he is in the small town of Rock Springs, Texas, and he notices a truck, a Suburban, runs a red light. Deputy Hernandez pulls over the vehicle. He approaches the vehicle, and he notices a bunch of people are laying down on the floorboard of this vehicle. As he approaches the vehicle, according to Deputy Hernandez, the driver takes off, swerves around, and tries to hit and run over Deputy Hernandez. So what does he do? Well, he pulls out his pistol and he starts shooting. And what is he shooting at? The tires. Just like in the movies, I guess. Deputy Hernandez not only shot at the tires, he hit them, and he blew out at least one, maybe two tires. The vehicle stops. Seven or eight illegals jump out and take off running. 
   Deputy Hernandez calls the sheriff, tells him exactly what happened, what he did. The sheriff arrives on the scene. The sheriff calls for an independent review or investigation of this entire thing since a shooting was involved, and in come the Texas Rangers. 
   Many people aren't too familiar with the Texas Rangers, but they are, in my opinion, as fine a law enforcement agency as there is anywhere in the world. They work independently of everybody. The Texas Rangers investigate this case, and they find that Deputy Hernandez acted properly throughout the entire matter. 
   Now, one thing I must mention is that while he was firing his weapon at the vehicle, one of the bullets ricocheted and hit a passenger in the lip, causing minor injuries, and that passenger stayed in the vehicle when the others fled. 
   But then here comes the Mexican Consulate with another demand letter to our Federal Government demanding prosecution of Gilmer Hernandez for firing his weapon, even to protect himself. 
   And then the Federal Government, our Federal Government, even though an investigation had already been done by local law enforcement, like the cavalry they show up to save the day, and Gilmer Hernandez is prosecuted for unlawfully discharging his firearm even though, in my opinion and the opinion of the other law enforcement agencies, he did exactly what he was supposed to do. 
   Now, Gilmer Hernandez was tried and he was convicted. And on Monday he is going to be sentenced by a Federal court for firing his weapon. 
   Let me tell you a little bit about Gilmer Hernandez. He is a deputy sheriff. He is 25. He is married and has a child. And patrolling the West Texas sands between Mexico and Texas earns him $21,000 a year. He has always wanted to be a lawman. He is proud of his service. And now he is in jail for enforcing the law. 
   So what do we know about the illegals in this case? Remember they are illegally in the country just like the drug dealer was illegally in the country, just like the other three individuals in the Sipe case were illegally in the country. Well, our Federal Government doesn't deport them back to Mexico. Our Federal Government makes a deal with these illegals and gives those seven or eight illegals green cards so they can stay in the United States and testify against Deputy Hernandez.  
   So it is interesting that these three cases are so similar. It is interesting how our Federal Government has such zeal to prosecute border protectors. And why does our Federal Government immediately take the side of the person that is illegally in the country whether they are an illegal or whether they are a drug dealer or whether somebody assaulted one of our Border Patrol agents? I don't know the answer to that question, but they do. And what has the effect of that been on our border protectors? What effect do you think it is on our border protectors? Border Patrol agents and deputy sheriffs that patrol the southern border with Mexico, when in doubt, they back off. Why? Because if they do their job and protect the border as we expect them to do, the Federal Government doesn't back them up. The Federal Government backs up the illegals that come into this country. All the while we have got the Mexican government back here demanding prosecution of our border protectors. 
   It is very disturbing to see this trend. And, Madam Speaker, as I mentioned before, I was a judge in Texas for 22 years. I heard about 25,000 felony cases, everything from stealing to killing. And I heard every kind of defense, every kind of story, and every kind of accusation against individuals. And before that I was a prosecutor in Houston, Texas, for 8 years. And I don't have any sympathy for criminals. I don't care if they are what we consider regular criminals or peace officers that violate the law. I even prosecuted five Houston police officers one time for beating up an individual of Hispanic descent and throwing him in one of our bayous where he later drowned. I have no sympathy for criminals whether they wear the badge or don't wear the badge. But looking at these three cases makes me wonder why our government is making the choices that it is making. I guess as long as we will continue to pursue these three matters, we may find the answer. 
   Now, many Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have asked the President to pardon Ramos and Compean. That is the President's decision. He hasn't said one way or the other what he is going to do. He has the authority under the Constitution to pardon people. That is his authority, and whatever choice he makes, I respect that choice. 
   But we are also asking for there to be congressional investigations into this entire matter of the prosecution of these cases, especially in light of the fact that we now find out that the Office of Inspector General misled several Members of Congress, like myself, of what the facts were on the border between Mexico and Texas and in the Ramos and Compean case, because we just want to get to the bottom of it and find the truth in these matters and especially why our government makes the choices that it does. 
   You know, Madam Speaker, last year and this year we are hearing a word tossed around. The word is ``amnesty.' 
   I am personally opposed to granting amnesty to people who are illegally in the country, rewarding them for illegal conduct. But we hear about that amnesty all the time. But before we start talking about giving amnesty to 15 to 20 million people that are illegally in the country, why don't we just give amnesty to about three people, two border agents and a deputy sheriff that are behind bars that happen to be American citizens? Give them amnesty because, in my opinion, what they have done deserves either a pardon or some form of amnesty. And it appears to me that besides really telling our law enforcement officers to back off on protecting the borders, this sends a message to other people, and those are people who want to come into the United States illegally. 
   Now, we hear all of that about people coming over here and looking for a better life and that sort of thing. That may be true with some people. But not everybody coming over here is looking for a better life. People like Aldrete are coming over here to make a little money selling dope, over a million dollars worth of it in two cases. And failure to protect the border encourages those people to come across the border illegally as well. 
   And then there is that other group we haven't even talked about, those people that we still use the phrase of terrorists. But since the border is unprotected, it is much easier to just come right into the United States that way instead of fly into Reagan International Airport right down the street. So when we have lawlessness on the border that breeds more lawlessness. And failure to protect the borders increases illegal activity. Failure to support law enforcement agents that are doing their legal job encourages illegal activity into the United States. 
   I think all of this is telling us that, it appears to me, the Federal Government doesn't have the moral will to protect the borders. Why do I say that? Because this is the most powerful country that has ever existed but yet we cannot protect our borders. Why not? Because we don't have the moral will to do so. The United States defends the borders of other nations. We send our troops all over the world to defend the borders of other nations: Korea. We have got troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, all over the world. But yet we don't protect our own borders. Why not? Because maybe we don't have the moral will to do so. If we did, we could close the borders to any illegals coming into the United States. 
   So our Federal Government needs to get on the right side of the border conflict, and that is the American side and what is best for the United States. Not what is best for illegals, not what is best for some foreign country, not what is best for drug dealers coming into the United States, but what is best for the United States. And our Federal Government needs to get on the right side of the border conflict. 
   Madam Speaker, when I was a judge, I always wanted to make sure that in that particular case that justice occurred. To quote Willie Nelson, not that he was a great legal mind, but he made the comment that justice is the one thing we should always find. And that is true. Justice is the one thing we should always find. And, hopefully, if we bring more light to these law enforcement cases where law enforcement officers are prosecuted for doing their job, bring light to the American public that justice will prevail because I do believe in our system. I believe in our system of the trial court and the jury and the appellate courts, but I also believe in openness and that the prosecution cannot and should not ever hide evidence that is favorable to the defense. And down the road, hopefully, we will see justice occur, that these wrongs will be righted, that the innocent will be set free, and that the guilty will be prosecuted for their crimes against the United States and against law enforcement officers that protect our border day in and day out. 
   Now, I have been down to the Texas-Mexico border seven or eight times. I have been to the California-Mexico border. I hope all Members of Congress, especially those that live in other parts of the country, go to the border to see what it is like. It is a volatile area of our country, and all you need to do is go down there and see it. 
   When I was down at the Nuevo Laredo sector, where there is a high volume of crossings into the United States, both legal and illegal, I asked a former Texas Ranger, I said, What is it like down here? Give me your opinion. 
   And he said, Well, Congressman Poe, after dark on the Texas-Mexico border, it gets western. It gets western. 
   What he meant by that is it gets violent. It gets violent. Sheriff Rick Flores of Webb County, Texas, and Webb County is also on the Texas-Mexico border, stated not too long ago that it is not unusual to be down on the Texas border on the American side and get gunfire from the Mexican side coming across shooting at his deputies. Whom is that from? Drug cartels fighting over turf. It gets western. 
   And the people we have asked that have sworn an oath to protect our border are the peace officers. They wear the badge. They are all that stands between us and the lawless. And we have the duty to make sure they have the equipment to do that job and fulfill that mission, and we have the duty to make sure that when they are in conflict and they have not committed any violation of the law that we totally support them and that we don't give in to the political pressures of other nations. 
   Madam Speaker, I just want to say that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THEFT FROM CRIME VICTIMS -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, crime victims are once again being victimized, not by the hands of offenders but by the robber baron bureaucrats who are putting their hands in the pockets of American crime victims. 
   Let me explain. Under a law called VOCA, Victims of Crime Act, crime victims receive money from a fund that criminals pay into as a part of their sentence. This wonderful idea makes criminals literally pay for their crimes and give compensation to injured and brutalized victims. Make criminals pay rent on the courthouse. Make them pay for the system they created. This fund is now over $1.2 billion. 
   But now the insensitive Federal budget boys want to pick-pocket victims and take this money and put it into the abyss of the Federal Treasury. This is not taxpayer money. It doesn't belong to the Federal Government. The Feds should keep their sticky fingers off this victim money and Congress needs to protect victims from this bureaucratic theft.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, freedom of expression is under attack in our neighbors to the north, Canada. Yesterday, a 16-year-old girl was strangled to death by her father in Toronto, Canada. The reason for the homicide? The girl refused to wear the traditional Muslim head scarf, the hijab. 
   Her school friends said that she wanted to be more ``western,'' but her devout Muslim father wouldn't have it. But she would remove her scarf at school and change into western clothes. School officials said that she was an energetic and popular student, but she lived in fear of her father. Her father has been charged now with murder, and her older brother has been charged with accessory to the crime. 
   This is yet another example of religion gone wrong. In a society that values freedom and tolerance, this kind of behavior in the name of religion is unacceptable. Her father needs to be prosecuted and sent to prison. His actions are not acceptable in our culture. No one has the natural right to murder their children in the name of religion.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE HOSTAGE OF BAGHDAD -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, in the deserts of Iraq a war is going on against the enemies of America. In the heat and dust of the summer of 2005, a young American went to fight, not against al Qaeda, but for her own survival. She became the ``Hostage of Baghdad,'' held against her will by villains of the desert, thousands of miles away from home in Texas. This is her story. 
   Madam Speaker, Jamie Leigh Jones was a 20-year-old woman who worked for Halliburton KBR. She was sent to Iraq as part of her employment. She was sent to Baghdad to a place, ironically, called Camp Hope, in the supposed Green Zone that was supposed to be safe. 
   After being in Iraq only a few days, she said she was held against her will, drugged, gang-raped by Halliburton KBR firefighters, and the people in charge of her held her hostage in a ship cargo container for 24 hours without any food or water. She became an American hostage, held hostage by fellow Americans. 
   She convinced one of the people guarding her to let her borrow his cell phone. After obtaining the cell phone, Jamie called her dad in Texas and pleaded for help and begged to be rescued. She was scared, she was hurt, she was half a world away from home, and she was alone. 
   Jamie's dad called me because I represent him in Congress. Her father relayed the tragic assault and crime, and of course needed immediate assistance. My staff and I were able to contact the right people in the United States State Department, and within 48 hours two agents from the embassy in Baghdad found and rescued Jamie, made sure she received appropriate medical attention, and brought her home. 
   Jamie had been seen by Army doctors in Baghdad and had been given, apparently, good medical care while being treated in Baghdad. A forensic sexual assault examination was performed on her. This examination is commonly called a rape kit. Doctors take forensic samples from a sexual assault victim and then they are preserved as evidence for trial in this rape kit. 
   But, Madam Speaker, for some unknown reason, the Army doctors turned this rape kit over to Jamie's employer, Halliburton KBR. KBR then lost the rape kit. The rape kit was later found, but it had been tampered with. The photographs are now missing, and the Army doctor's cover sheet with the medical findings are not there. These are critical for prosecution of the rapists. 
   Madam Speaker, Jamie's brutal injuries were severe. She has had to have reconstructive surgery because of the extent of these injuries by these rapists in Iraq. Once she was home, we pressured the State Department to find out who these villains of Baghdad were; where are they, and why haven't they been prosecuted. After so much time, there is little progress on the investigation. We need to know also if KBR had knowledge of the crime and if they are involved to any extent. 
   Jamie has decided to go public with her case. This case, like all such cases, remains confidential in our congressional office. Congressional offices do  not divulge the content of personal case files like this because they are considered privileged communication and they are private. 
   My tremendous case worker, Patti Chapman, worked with Jamie since her rescue and has helped her in this most tragic way, and helped her in a compassionate way. Patti Chapman, like many congressional caseworkers, are angels to the people in our communities. Jamie has had the courage to publicly tell about this most personal crime against her. So my office and now Chairman Conyers of the House Judiciary Committee have contacted the Attorney General and the State Department and we want answers about this case and the investigation. 
   Specifically, what is going on over there in Iraq? American citizens have civil rights overseas as well. Crimes committed against them must be investigated. Criminals must be held accountable. Our government has the legal and moral duty to capture these villains of Baghdad. Also, hundreds of American civilians like Jamie are in Iraq working in support of America's military mission. When these American civilians become victims of crimes by other Americans, it is unclear who's enforcing the law. Our government must clear up this confusion, because currently there seems to be an environment of lawlessness. These criminals must be held accountable. 
   Madam Speaker, let me tell you about sexual assault. I was a former judge and saw these victims and their perpetrators in court, and these demons that do these dastardly acts against victims don't commit these crimes for sexual pleasure, but, Madam Speaker, they do it to destroy the inner soul of these victims. Jamie Leigh Jones survived and has been rescued, but the outlaws still roam the deserts of Iraq like the outlaws in the days of the Old West. We need justice. We need the law to intervene and round up these outlaws for their day in court. Let justice be swift, let it be severe, let it be serious, because justice is what we do in America. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (NEWS FROM THE SECOND FRONT -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, I bring you news from the second front. The second front, of course, is the border we have, the southern border, where there is a war going on. It's a border war between the United States and those people who wish to enter the United States illegally. 
   During my travels to the Texas/Mexico border and, really, the southern border with Mexico, I've traveled all the way from San Diego to Brownsville, Texas meeting with the various law enforcement officers. Of course I've met with the Border Patrol, but more recently I've met with the sheriffs along the Texas/Mexico border. 
   Let me make it clear. The Border Patrol does as good a job as we will let them do. They patrol the first 25 miles inland into the United States. But that's all they patrol. And if an illegal individual, no matter who they are, comes into the United States and gets past that 25-mile marker, it's up to somebody else to patrol that area. And much of that time it's left up to the sheriffs throughout the States of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. 
   The sheriffs patrol the entire county. And let me give you an example. When a crime is committed in a county, a person calls 911, and 911 transfers them to the Sheriff's Department, not to the Border Patrol, because it's not important at the time where that crime or where that criminal came from. 
   And many times those criminals are cross-border criminals. They come into the United States from all over the world to commit crimes and then flee back across the southern border. And it's up to the sheriffs to protect the citizens of those counties. 
   Just to give you an example of a couple of counties, I've visited with Sheriff Arvin West of Hudspeth County. That's way over here in West Texas. That's a county that's the size of Delaware. And Sheriff West, like most of the 16 border sheriffs along the Texas/Mexico border, they look like sheriffs from Texas, they act like sheriffs from Texas. But, to a person, they are relentless in protecting their communities from criminal conduct. 
   And much of that conduct is the result of the failure of the United States of America to protect the border from people coming into the United States without permission. It is the duty, the first duty of government, to protect us from invasion by any source and by any means, and that includes anyone that comes into this country without permission. 
   Most recently, I've gone all the way to the other end of Texas, down to Cameron County, Texas where Brownsville is. It's a unique county because most of that county borders water, either the Rio Grande River or the Gulf of Mexico. And I've watched, and I went down with Sheriff Omar Lucio and some of his deputies who also are a relentless bunch of Texas deputy sheriffs trying to protect the border. 
   He, like Arvin West on the other side don't have a big budget for vehicles. So the way they get vehicles, Madam Speaker, is they have to confiscate the drug dealers' vehicles, those SUVs. And then once those are confiscated, they use those because they don't have enough money to fund their own transportation on the border. 
   As Sheriff Lucio said, the drug dealers, the drug cartels outman them, they outspend them, and they outgun them. That's because they have more money than we have on this side of the border. 
   And to give you an example of how the drug cartels work, and how it is very difficult for the sheriffs and the Border Patrol to stop the invasion of the drugs, down here on the Texas/Mexico border, the Rio Grande River is about as wide as this House of Representatives. And planes fly in from Mexico. They fly out into the Gulf of Mexico, come straight in across the Gulf of Mexico and the border of the United States, and they drop their cocaine, marijuana, and then other drug mules pick that up and move that throughout the United States on these interstates that are depicted on this map. 
   So it's important that we give the border sheriffs the resources that they need. And part of that can come from the Merida Initiative. The administration has offered and is promoting the idea of sending $1.4 billion in equipment and training to the other side of the border, to the Mexican side to fight the drug cartels. 
   Good intentioned, but in all due fairness, the history of Mexico along the border is not good. There is corruption, and many of the military and the police have started working with the drug cartels, some of whom have been trained in the United States have gone over to the other side. Maybe that money would be better spent if we left it on our side of the border and gave that money to the sheriffs to patrol this entire area. 
   We should give the sheriffs surplus military vehicles that have come back from Iraq and let them patrol all this area, because you cannot patrol this part of Texas with a Prius. We have to use some type of SUV or pickup truck. And it's important that we do this. The number one duty of government is public safety. 
   Madam Speaker, June 6, 1944, the anniversary is tomorrow. We sent thousands of Americans over the lands and over the seas to protect the borders of countries that had been invaded. France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and other nations, and it's the duty of our country to protect us from the invasion coming south of the border. 
   We should send the military to the southern portion of our border and have the moral will to stop the invasion into the United States. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, there are alarming events that keep occurring regarding crude oil spills that seem to go unnoticed by the environmentalists and the media. Off the gulf coast, and even off the sacred west coast of California, crude oil spills have become so noticeable that scientists can see the sources from satellites. Can you believe it? The culprit should be sued and brought to court because that is what the environmentalists do to save us from the nasty crude oil. The offender is Mother Nature. 
   You see, Mr. Speaker, thousands of metric tons a year of crude oil naturally seep to the surface in the Gulf of Mexico and off the west coast. Mother Nature is the cause of most offshore crude oil spills, and this must be stopped. Why don't we just remove all that crude oil that is seeping from beneath the ocean? That will eliminate oil from coming to the surface. The way to do that is to drill offshore, take out all that oil from underneath the ocean, and stop Mother Nature from polluting. 
   Congress needs to remove the silly offshore drilling restrictions to give us more supply. That will help bring down the price of gasoline, stop pollution, and we can teach Mother Nature a lesson or two.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, ABC Nightly News named Bert Brady Citizen of the Week. Here is why. Bert Brady is a 69-year-old veteran. He gets up nearly every day for the last year and heads over to the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. He is there to do something that was not done for him. He is there to welcome soldiers coming home. 
   Bert organizes folks to go down with him to the airport and greet the soldiers coming home from the war. Sometimes these greeters number in the hundreds. Most of the citizens are veterans of Korea or Vietnam, but they also include Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, all to say ``thank you'' to the troops. 
   As Bert pointed out, there was no one there when our soldiers came home from Korea or from Vietnam. These dedicated individuals are making sure no soldier feels they are forgotten when they are returning from this war. 
   People line up along the paths. They cheer the soldiers as they come through the path, shaking their hands, giving them hugs, telling them thank you, and waving American flags. For our troops that moment is powerful. 
   When asked why he is so driven, Bert spoke of one soldier who shook his hand and said, ``Mister, I will never forget you. It's the greatest thing that ever happened to me, this homecoming reception.'' 
   So we Americans thank you, Bert Brady.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I want to thank the gentleman from New York for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, the narrow issue is: More troops to the front, or not? Many here say ``no more troops,'' but what are the consequences for the troops on the ground without more aid? What will happen in and around Baghdad where those troops are supposed to be sent? Their mission there will be more difficult without more troops. 
   Does this Congress want to tell our troops on the ground, do your job with less, even though we have it in our power to send you aid? 
   Mr. Speaker, 171 years ago this month, a somewhat similar call for aid was made; and it, too, was refused. 
   In an old, beat-up Spanish mission in central Texas, Bexar, Texas, to be exact, 187 men from every State in the United States, 13 foreign countries, including Mexico, found themselves in a precarious situation. They were behind the walls facing an enemy. They needed help. 
   Texas politicians, even so-called military experts, had it within their power to send more troops. And for all the similar reasons that are mentioned here, including the troops shouldn't even be in the mission and the plan was a bad idea from its inception, this plan is not working, your troops there should even leave, similar reasons we hear today, no help was sent. 
   The place, Mr. Speaker, was the Alamo, and the time was February 24, 1836. And behind the cold, damp walls of the Alamo, by candlelight, a 27-year-old lawyer, commander by the name of William Barrett Travis, wrote this letter. I read it today: 
   ``To the people of Texas and all Americans in the world, fellow citizens and compatriots, I am besieged by a thousand or more of the enemy under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannon fire for over 24 hours, but I have not lost a man. 
   ``The flag still waves proudly over the north wall. The enemy has demanded surrender at its discretion. Otherwise, this fort will be put to the sword. I have answered that demand with a cannon shot. I shall never surrender or retreat. 
   ``I call upon you, in the name of liberty and patriotism and everything dear to the American character, to come to my aid with all dispatch. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself for as long as possible, die like a soldier who never forgets what is due his honor and that of his country. Victory or death.'' 
   William Barrett Travis, Commander of the Alamo. 
   Mr. Speaker, we know what happened at the Alamo. Those 187 men died because no help was sent. Later, Texans did provide troops and rallied and won independence from Mexico. But the answer then, as it has been in many wars in the past, is the answer now: More troops are necessary. We need to finish what we started. We need to do what it takes. 
   Now, Baghdad will be no Alamo. We cannot lose in Baghdad. But this body has it in its power to prevent a victory in Baghdad and Iraq. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, heed the warnings of the past, heed the history, and send aid with all dispatch. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues today in support of Senate Joint Resolution 13. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut have negotiated an International Management Emergency Assistance Memorandum of Understanding with the Canadian provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. 
   This MOU creates a framework for cooperation among the participating jurisdictions when they face natural disasters or other emergencies that they have in common. Article I, section 10 of our Constitution requires that any agreement between States and foreign powers obtain the consent of Congress. That is what this legislation will grant. 
   All of us know too well the significant resources needed to overcome a disaster, whether natural or man-made. 
   I applaud the initiative taken by these States and their Canadian neighbors to proactively plan for the resource management and mutual assistance that may become necessary in unexpected times of crisis. 
   As confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office, this resolution will not result in any cost to the Federal Government or impose any costs on State or local governments. I support this measure and urge adoption thereof.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the tragic events of September 11, 2001 was truly one of America's darkest days. Terrorists using airplanes as weapons brought unimaginable horror to our homeland. Yet in the face of such tragedy, heroes emerged. Police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel and countless other American patriots helped their fellow countrymen survive that day and continue to make sure we never forget those lost that day. These American heroes brought out the best in human nature in response to an attack that brought out the worst in human nature. 
   Since coming to Congress, I've had the great pleasure to work closely with two of these American heroes. Peter Gadiel and Joan Molinaro, united by the loss of their children who fell victim on that fateful day and the great anger over why this Nation couldn't stop it from happening, joined together and helped create an organization called 9/11 Families for a Secure America to help right the wrong that allowed terrorists to kill over 3,000 Americans 6 years ago. 
   Peter and Joan carry with them the voice of their children everyday, in everything they do, to ensure another tragedy of this magnitude never happens again to another son, daughter, father, mother, husband, or wife. 
   It is the purpose of 9/11 Families for a Secure America to inform and educate the American public, elected officials and legislators of the obvious and not so obvious shortcomings in our Nation's security. To focus their attention on the dangers of unsecured borders and lax immigration enforcement. They make sure the public understands that illegal immigration and terrorism are inseparable issues. The ultimate goal of 9/11 Families for a Secure America is to prevent future terrorist attacks and to secure our Nation for generations to come because terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks in the United States if they are unable to enter the country. 
   As we recognize and give remembrance to all those that lost their life on September 11, 2001, lets not forget the loved ones of these victims and the pain and sacrifice they've had to endure from their loss. Lets honor heroes like Peter Gadiel and Joan Molinaro who work tirelessly to ensure that another terrorist attack never happens again to another of America's children. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, 6 years ago today, most Americans were going about their business, and then we woke up to the next day, September 11, 2001. I was not yet in Congress at that time, but I was a judge in Texas. And I was driving to the courthouse when I was listening to country western music, and it was interrupted about an airplane that crashed into the World Trade Center. And a few minutes later, a second airplane crashed into the World Trade Center. 
   And about that time, as I was driving my jeep, I noticed that other folks on the road had pulled off to the side of the road, all doing the same thing, listening to the radio, hearing the news from New York. And then we heard more news. We heard about a third airplane, where some good folks in Pennsylvania took matters into their own hands. And later we learned why that plane crashed in Pennsylvania; it did not crash in Washington, D.C. at the White House or even this Capitol. And finally, we heard about a fourth airplane, a plane that crashed not far from here into the Pentagon. 
   And at the end of that day, like many Americans, I was watching television and noticed all of the news reports about the World Trade Center and about the Pentagon, and followed that day, as most Americans, intensely observing and being concerned about our country. 
   As I was watching television that afternoon, over the skies of Houston, Texas, where I'm from, the 147th Air National Guard were flying those F-16s on patrol over our skies and over our refineries, over our ports. But as I was watching television, I noticed that when those planes hit the World Trade Center, that there were thousands and thousands of people, good people, people of all races, all nationalities, both sexes and all ages, when those planes hit the World Trade Center, they were trying to get away from that terror in the sky as fast as they could. They were running as hard as they could. Nothing wrong with that, but that's what they were doing, fleeing that enemy that attacked us on our soil. 
   But I also noticed that there was another group of people, not very many, but as soon as those planes hit the World Trade Center, they were running as hard as they could to get to that terror that had crashed into our buildings in New York City. Who were they? Emergency medical technicians, firefighters and police officers, because that's what they do; they respond first to terror, domestic or international. 
   And while today, Mr. Speaker, it is very important that we remember the thousands of people who died on September 11, 2001, it's equally important that we remember the people who lived, that were allowed to live because our police officers, our firefighters and our emergency technical folks were on the job, saving those lives of those people who were in the World Trade Center. Amazing Americans, those individuals, many of whom lost friends that were trying to get into the World Trade Center, people that they had known all their lives, but they did it because it is their duty and because it was the right thing to do. 
   Of course we have to remember and need to remember the plane that crashed into the Pentagon as well. And across the street from the Pentagon is Arlington National Cemetery, where we bury America's warriors from all wars since the war between the States. And on duty that day, when that plane came low across this land and crashed into the Pentagon, at Arlington National Cemetery, at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, those soldiers were on duty. They did not leave their post. They stayed there throughout the entire episode. Amazing people, our military. 
   So it's incumbent upon us not only to remember those that died, those that lived because of our first responders, but we need to remember that we did not ask for this war, and we must deal with it wherever it takes us throughout this world. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   These Islamic radicals don't believe in building a better world, but believe in blowing it up. The war on terror is a global war whether we like it or not, and a fight between civilization and the uncivilized. It is a fight over life versus death. It is a fight over peace versus anarchy. It is a fight over the right to be left alone versus chaos. The international terrorists who wish to kill Americans must be tracked down wherever they are and dealt with as law and justice demands.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the price of gasoline goes up every day, and Congress is partially to blame. The price of crude oil is increasing because demand is increasing. Our domestic energy supply cannot meet that demand. The global demand for oil is also rising with the industrialization of China. And increased demand for oil leads to increased prices for many products, including products made out of plastic. 
   The problem is that Congress has made it difficult for our supply to meet that demand. There is a solution to the problem. The solution is to increase our supply by exploring domestic energy sources and drilling in ANWR. 
   Like it or not, crude oil is still the energy base of our Nation. Unlike every other country on the planet, the United States does not take advantage of its own natural resources. When Congress abolished tax credits for domestic exploration and production, Congress effectively abolished reasonable oil prices and then raised taxes on oil companies to $18 billion, taxes that are eventually passed on to us, the consumer. Thus, higher prices at the pump. 
   And this Congress decided to even award Venezuelan Dictator Chavez and his nationalized oil company with a large tax break, a tax break they did not give to American oil companies. 
   It's common knowledge that, if you tax something, you're going to get less of it. If you tax oil, you get less of it. Less of what? Less production and less crude oil. Less oil on the market equals higher prices at the pump. And if we look at the world crude oil reserves, 80 percent of the world crude oil is controlled by foreign nationalized oil companies. We call them OPEC. Six percent is controlled by Russian companies, and only six percent of the world oil reserves is controlled by American-owned oil companies. You know, those American-owned oil companies that are capitalistic, that have stockholders, we call them Americans. And those companies are making about 8 percent, 8 1/2 profit. 
   So the world is controlled by OPEC, not American oil companies. We may be the world power, but the United States does not control the world oil market. 
   The only control we have is over our domestic energy supply, which we don't take advantage of because of the U.S. restrictions on offshore drilling and exploration. We have succumbed to the environmental fear myth that we cannot drill safely offshore. Other nations, including Britain, Norway, Holland, and Denmark, take full advantage of their natural resources and even permit offshore drilling in the North Sea, that area of the world where offshore drilling is the most difficult, and they do it without environmental damage.     
   We can increase our energy supply and reduce the price of gasoline at the pump by also allowing drilling in ANWR. 
   On top of the heightened demand for crude oil, there is a heightened demand for new refineries. Madam Speaker, I represent 21 percent of the Nation's refineries in southeast Texas, but we don't have any new ones. The last oil refinery was built 32 years ago. Our oil refineries have been punished by bureaucracy and unnecessary Federal regulations. Too many unnecessary Federal regulations, too many government controls, too many high taxes, the second highest corporate income tax in the world, and what happens? They leave town, they go somewhere else. We must lift these burdens and encourage refinery development. Our gasoline prices will eventually drop as soon as we build new refineries and we drill offshore and we drill in ANWR. 
   The high prices of gasoline have thrown the airline industry into chaos. Twenty-two percent of the Nation's jet fuel is made in my district. But one example, Madam Speaker, it costs an airline company $44 a minute to allow a plane to idle on the runway. Thus, every plane that takes off that's been sitting there about 30 minutes costs $1,500 in additional oil prices. 
   The high gas prices even affect the 170,000 independently owned gas stations in the country. They no longer make a profit on selling fuel. They hope to make one cent on every gallon, so they are thrilled if they make that penny. They make money by selling lottery tickets, donuts and beer, that's how they make their profit. 
   It's time for us in Congress to encourage more domestic oil production, lift the restrictions to offshore drilling, and take care of ourselves. We must stop relying on unstable, volatile regions in the world and pompous dictators who hold Americans hostage with their crude oil. 
   We have a problem, but we can solve it. Otherwise, we'll be parking our vehicles on the side of the road, riding bicycles to work, then blissfully wondering where all the crude oil went. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (SUPPORTING THE MISSION AND GOALS OF NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, victims of crime are real people. They are our friends, our relatives and our neighbors, and unfortunately, because of our culture, they have been for many years overlooked in the criminal justice system. Well, I think those days are over because they are as important as defendants, because the same Constitution that protects the rights of defendants in the courtroom, that same Constitution protects the rights of victims of crime. 
   Since 1981, this country celebrates National Crime Victims' Rights Week in April. Local communities hold rallies and candlelight vigils and a number of other activities to honor the millions of crime victims and survivors in the United States and also to recognize those many individuals that work with crime victims. 
   This week is National Crime Victims' Rights Week, and this year's theme is ``Justice for Victims, Justice for All.'' It is a very appropriate theme because we cannot achieve justice for all until there is some justice, total justice, for victims of crime.  
   The victims' right movement has come a long way. The days when a victim was just a mere witness in the courthouse are not far gone. 
   While we are always sure to safeguard the rights of defendants, our justice system must also safeguard the rights of victims of crime. 
   The victims' rights movement dates all the way back to 1965 when the first crime victim compensation program was started in the State of California. Five States enacted similar legislation by 1970, and then we saw that organization, what we call the MADD mothers, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, come into being to advocate on behalf of victims of crime who had been hurt by those people who drink and drive. 
   In 1975, activists across the country united and formed the National Organization for Victim Assistance to expand victim services and promote the rights of victims. 
   In 1978, three more important organizations started: the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and a group of somber individuals called Parents of Murdered Children, all of them advocating on behalf of crime victims. 
   President Reagan in 1981 proclaimed the first National Victims' Rights Week in April, and that was also the year that 6-year-old Adam Walsh was abducted from a department store and later murdered, prompting a national campaign to educate the public on missing children and to pass better legislation--Federal legislation, to protect our greatest natural resource, the young that live among us. 
   In 1982, the Federal Government created the Office for Victims of Crime, or OVC, within the Department of Justice, a tremendous organization that sees after the victims of crime in our country. 
   Then, in 1984, the Congress passed the Victims of Crime Act, what we call VOCA, one of the most novel concepts that Congress has ever adopted. What it does is require that people convicted in Federal courts, those defendants, once they are convicted, they pay moneys into a fund, and that fund is used to help crime victims throughout the United States. It is a tremendous idea, making defendants pay for the system they have created, pay the rent on a courthouse as I like to call it. And today, Madam Speaker, that fund is over $1.7 billion, contributed not by taxpayers but by offenders, that goes for the specific purpose of helping victims, helping victims' organizations like rape centers, domestic violence shelters, and victim advocates that help victims throughout the turmoil of being a crime victim. 
   In 2005, my first year in Congress, I was honored to form the Victims' Rights Caucus with the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa), who was a long-time victims' advocate in the State of California before he ever came to Congress. And this bipartisan, but yet nonpartisan, caucus now has 44 members, and we do everything we can to raise the awareness of crime victims here in the Federal Government. 
   In 2006, 25 years after Adam Walsh's murder that I just mentioned earlier, President Bush signed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which requires sex offenders and child molesters, once they leave the Federal penitentiary or State penitentiaries, to register on the national database so that we keep up with those people who wish to prey on our communities. 
   Madam Speaker, crime victims don't have a lobbyist up here in Washington. They don't have some high-dollar lobbyist to work for them and advocate on their behalf. But we are their lobbyists. We advocate on behalf of all crime victims because that's what we do here in Congress, to take and protect the best that we have among us, and that's crime victims. 
   I urge community leaders and organizations to celebrate how far the victims' rights movement has come but also to continue to recognize the importance of crime victims that live among us because, Madam Speaker, justice is the one thing we should always find, and hopefully crime victims can find justice at the courthouse in our day and time. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (ETHANOL HAS NOT SAVED US YET -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It has been said by folks that Washington, DC., is the only place in America that is surrounded by reality because people here, especially in Congress, those people say, are in a Disney World atmosphere and don't know how the world really is. 
   Probably the best example is what has taken place throughout our country in the area of gasoline prices. They are going up every day. Every day we come back to Congress, gasoline prices continue to rise. And there's a constant problem here. Retail operators who run those mom-and-pop independent gasoline stations are saying they're not even making a profit off of gasoline. They hope maybe they can make one cent a gallon. The way they make profit is selling lottery tickets and donuts, and the country continues to see higher and higher gasoline prices. 
   It's a tremendous problem that we have to deal with. We have to come out of this Disney World atmosphere and solve the problem. Some say what is going to save us all is ethanol. Let's take all of the farmland in America, let's till it up, let's grow some corn, and let's make some of that unproven, unpredictable ethanol to burn in our vehicles. 
   Of course, what we have done as a Nation by encouraging and subsidizing the special interest group of ethanol, we've raised the corn prices worldwide. In fact, they have tripled in the last 2 years. And because corn prices are going up, wheat prices are going up. And in the last 17 years, food prices in  the world are higher than they ever have been, all because the United States has seen this vision that ethanol is going to save us all. 
   Several years ago, those who talked about ethanol that weren't for the concept of ethanol said ethanol is not going to be profitable unless gasoline gets to $4 a gallon. Four years ago, people in this House said, oh, that's never going to happen. The problem with ethanol is it takes a gallon and a third of fuel, diesel, to produce a gallon of ethanol. And only when gasoline gets to be $4 a gallon will ethanol be profitable for this country. 
   In fact, it's driving up pollution. Science Magazine has stated, ``After taking into account worldwide land-use changes, corn-based ethanol will increase greenhouse gases 93 percent compared to gasoline over a 30-year period.'' 
   In other words, the House was trying to be environmentally correct. We want to make sure we don't have pollution. Nobody wants pollution. Nobody wants greenhouse gases; but unproven, subsidized ethanol is going to raise worldwide greenhouse gases all because we're tilling up our farmland. 
   I have here a map of the United States. Now we're also finding out where the Mississippi River dumps into the Gulf of Mexico, there is a dead zone, and there is a dead zone there for various reasons. But because we're plowing up all in the Midwest this farmland and making corn, which takes a lot of fertilizer, that fertilizer is going down the Mississippi River, and the dead zone at the mouth of the Mississippi River is getting bigger. ``Dead zone'' means exactly what it says: Nothing grows there and fish don't live there, all because of this concept of ethanol. 
   So what are we doing about it? Well, first thing Congress did, we're going to punish those oil companies, those American oil companies, and we are going to tax them, raise the taxes on these oil companies, and that's what Congress did. Now it's a simple economic fact. You tax something, you get less of it. What does that mean? That means if you tax something, you're going to get less production. You're going to get less production of crude oil. 
   Now, we don't drill off our own shores. We're the only Nation in the world that doesn't take care of ourselves with the natural resources that we have been given. The only place we drill offshore, Mr. Speaker, is right here in this blue zone off the State of Texas where I'm from, off the State of Louisiana and parts of Mississippi and Alabama. But you see in all of these areas that are red on this map, there is crude oil out there in the ocean, but we don't drill out there even though crude oil is there. 
   In fact, we're going to see some new platforms out in the Gulf of Mexico, but they're not from America. Right here off the coast of Florida, right there at the tip, there is an oil site, but we're not drilling there because we don't drill offshore. So the next oil rig you will see out in the Gulf of Mexico will be built by the Cubans and the Chinese. They're drilling in areas that we ought to be drilling in because it has been said in this House we can't drill offshore safely. That is wrong. 
   I live in the area that was hit by Katrina and Hurricane Rita, and when those two hurricanes came through that area, 700 offshore rigs were damaged or destroyed. But yet, we didn't hear one word about crude oil seepage from the Gulf of Mexico because it did not happen. 
   We have the greatest technology in the world for drilling, and we can drill safely, we've proven that. We've drilled safely, and we will continue to drill safely. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the Washington elites are trying to rule the land like a monarchy, claiming they know  best for what they consider the peasants in the vast rural areas. 
   Those elitists grew up in privilege and look down on the rest of the country. The elitists in the imperial kingdom of Washington, DC feel it's their privileged right and obligation to make the peasants happier because those rural Americans don't know how to take care of themselves. 
   Well, let me tell you the truth about those peasants. These great Americans don't look to Washington or the elites or the monarchy for their happiness. They find their happiness in their individuality. The folks that I represent in southeast Texas are patriotic citizens, many from small-town rural America. 
   They love their families and are proud of America. They are honest, hard-working independent citizens who, when duty calls, go off to war to defend this Nation. They attend church on Sunday, and if they don't attend, they still feel strongly about their religion. 
   They believe they have the personal right to bear arms. They are not bitter about life, but they are generally happy. They are not in need of big government coming in in the name of hope and change to control more of their lives. 
   Those in Washington would do well to remember that the salt of the Earth lives in small-town America. Government should keep out of their way, instead of interfering with their lives, their faith, and their right to bear arms.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, recently six foreign-born extremists, inspired by al Qaeda and its preachers of hate, planned to murder U.S. troops with semiautomatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. The place, not in Iraq, but the United States Army base at Fort Dix in New Jersey. 
   They were knowledgeable and cunning, using one member who delivered pizzas on the base to gain intimate knowledge of the fort. They were also planning to attack a U.S. Naval installation in Philadelphia. 
   Before the attack could be unleashed on U.S. troops, the FBI was tipped off to their plans, and they were arrested. Not surprisingly, three of these terrorists were in the country illegally. Two others had green cards. 
   We are no longer a safe nation. The dangers of our security are real. We discuss in Congress the war against extreme radicals, but it starts with securing the borders. Because crossing unsecured U.S. borders is very easy. It brings the good, the bad, and the ugly. Because all three groups know that, for political reasons, the Federal Government refuses to protect American citizens by securing our sovereignty.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (CORPORAL DONALD E. VALENTINE III--U.S. ARMY -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, ``The soldier is the Army, and wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. While we mourn those men who die, we should thank God such men ever lived.'' These are the words of General George Patton in World War II. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of those soldiers was Corporal Donald E. Valentine III of the United States Army. He was born in Houston, Texas, on March 5, 1986. Donald Valentine joined the United States Army because of the 9/11 attack on this country. 
   His mother Anna said, ``My husband and I were behind Donald 100 percent. I was so proud of him no matter what he ever did. He made me very proud to be his mother.'' Words from another of America's Gold Star Mothers. 
   I met Anna Valentine and many members of the Valentine family recently at Veterans National Cemetery in Houston, where mothers like Anna who had children killed in Iraq and Afghanistan were being honored. We call those noble women Gold Star Mothers. Anna Valentine's son is buried on that hallowed ground of the fallen in Houston, Texas. 
   Corporal Valentine was killed along with two other soldiers on September 18 in Muqdadiyah, Iraq, when an IED, an improvised explosive device, detonated near him. 
   Mr. Speaker, you understand the use of an IED by America's enemy is a coward's way of fighting the war. These enemies rant and rave and preach hate in the name of religion, but they cover their faces with masks and hide in caves and dark, dusty ditches. They are afraid to come out in the open and face the American soldier, so our enemy detonates remote-controlled bombs. 
   Corporal Donald Valentine III comes from a military family. His father, Donald II, is a Navy veteran. His brother Daniel wanted to enlist to be with his brother Donald in Iraq, and Daniel, 19, still intends to join the military. Mr. Speaker, America owes much to families like the Valentines. 
   Donald was married 1 year to Lucia, who said Donald had all the qualities any girl would want. She had talked to Donald on their first anniversary, 3 days before his death in Iraq. Corporal Valentine told his family that, if he did not survive the war, they should stay strong. He is the 91st fallen servicemember with ties to the Houston area to have been killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   Corporal Donald Valentine was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division of the Stryker Brigade Combat Team from Fort Lewis, Washington. 
   Being from a military family, he moved around a lot as a child. He lived in Florida most of his life and in Idaho, but wanted to be buried in ``Big H,'' as he called Houston, Texas, because of many reasons. One of those reasons was because he spent so much time growing up with his grandparents who live in Houston. Mr. Speaker, Donald's grandparents, Thomas and Lupe Cortez, and his other grandmother Geneva Fernandez, survive their grandson. 
   As a grandfather of five with two more grandkids on the way, I think it would be a most difficult task to bury a grandson in the vigor of their youth. 
   In the official statement on Donald's death, the family said, ``Donald touched the lives of so many with his big heart. We will cherish the beautiful memories we shared with you. You made us so very proud. Now heaven has another hero. And, continue to watch over us as an angel in heaven.'' 
   On September 28, 2007, taps played for the last time as 21 guns saluted this American soldier. This is a photograph of Donald Valentine III. 
   A statement has been credited to one of Rome's centurions when he told his  troops, ``How you yet live will echo throughout eternity.'' Corporal Valentine lived a short but faithful life to the things that were important to him: family and country. He was 21 when he was killed. 
   Mr. Speaker, General George Patton was right about such warriors. We should thank God that such men as Corporal Donald Valentine III died and lived. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, good news. That which has been removed has been returned. That which has been censored is censored no more. Let me explain. 
   The Architect of the Capitol took it upon himself to remove references of God from the official certificates that accompany flags that are flown over the Capitol. These flags and certificates are given to schools, citizens, and the military. Some Members of Congress, for example, request the words ``God'' and ``Country'' to be incorporated into the certificate. However, the word ``God'' was unilaterally stricken and censored from the document by the Architect. But those days are over. The Architect will now allow the word ``God'' on such certificates. 
   The national motto is ``In God We Trust.'' We pledge allegiance saying ``one Nation under God.'' Our history is based upon a belief in the Supreme Being. And much of this Capitol has references to the Almighty. 
   Mr. Speaker, many Americans are tired of paranoia government censorship of God, and consider attempts to remove God from America a violation of their constitutional rights. Thank God.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, on Monday, five black-robed judges down the street decided that we weren't doing enough for illegal trespassers. 
   The Supreme Court just made it easier for illegals to extend their stay in the United States, even after they have been ordered to leave. People like Nigerian Samson Dada, who has been in our country illegally since 1998, can now manipulate and game the system in order to get more time. He has refused to go home, and the Supreme Court basically has said, ``It's okay. You can stay in spite of being lawfully deported.'' 
   The Supreme Court's ruling overturned other court decisions upholding his deportation. In other words, the High Court ruled in favor of people who have laughingly ignored and disregarded our laws. 
   Once again, the Supreme Court has made law rather than interpret law. The five liberal judges on the Supreme Court who wish to write our laws should take off their black robes and run for Congress. After all, the Constitution I read says Congress should make law, not the Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, I want to talk about the energy policy this Congress has passed recently. This Congress has decided to spend a lot of taxpayer money and subsidize this concept of corn-based ethanol in the United States. 
   We are sending a lot of money to farmers to grow corn so that it can be burned in our vehicles. Now, I don't blame the farmers for what they do. After all, we have encouraged them to produce corn-based ethanol. 
   But the problem with corn-based ethanol is it is a pollutant. Now we are finding out from Science Magazine that it's a pollutant more so than was first thought from the beginning. Because of the subsidies, we are encouraging corn-based ethanol. 
   It also has raised corn prices throughout the world because no longer are we eating corn, we are burning it in our vehicles. It has increased the amount of land that we are tilling up, grasslands, for example, forest, for example, and turning it into agricultural land where we produce corn-based ethanol to burn in our vehicles. 
   It's also expensive. Everything that has to do with corn products has raised in prices over the last 2 years because we are not using corn in our foodstuffs, we are burning it in our vehicles. But probably the greatest problem with corn-based ethanol is how it's produced. Corn is one of those commodities that takes a lot of fertilizer. In fact, it takes more fertilizer to produce corn than any other product that we eat, such as rice or wheat or even the grasslands. 
   Because that fertilizer is being dumped in the Midwest, it drains off in the rivers down the Mississippi River and comes into the Gulf of Mexico. One would argue, so what? Well, the problem with that is, fertilizer has nitrogen in it and phosphorus. That nitrogen and phosphorus, when it goes into the Gulf of Mexico, has created what is called now a dead zone. 
   It's called a dead zone because nothing lives there except algae. The fish, the ones that are there, have died unless they have moved way offshore, you know, out there off the continental coast where we don't drill for crude oil any more. 
   This map here shows, this is a NASA map, satellite photo, shows that it's about 470 miles along our gulf coast, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi. It even goes all the way to Florida, but it also extends out in the gulf about 178 miles.     
   It's a dead zone. Nothing grows there. Nothing lives there but algae, and it's all because Congress with unintended consequences is encouraging the production of corn-based ethanol, and the fertilizer goes down the Mississippi River and kills everything in this area. Madam Speaker, it stays for years. It gets bigger every year, this dead zone. It kills off the fish, and all of the fishermen along the gulf coast are having to go way out in the Gulf of Mexico out there where we don't drill for crude oil anymore, and they have to fish to get fish for Americans to eat. 
   Congress needs to reevaluate its policy of depending on some product that now not only is a pollutant but is an expensive pollutant, and it also creates havoc in the Gulf of Mexico by causing a dead zone. We need to be aware of such unintended consequences when Congress passes legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, we need an energy policy. We need an energy policy now--Americans demand it--but we also need some common sense in what we do, and maybe we should rethink the whole concept of corn-based ethanol because, after all, Madam Speaker, it's not going to save us all. 
   And that's just the way it is.

He shot out the two tires in self-defense. It turned out the vehicle was smuggling nine illegals. One illegal was injured by a ricochet bullet. The Sheriff's Department and the Texas Rangers investigated the shooting and cleared Hernandez. But the Mexican Government demanded prosecution by the U.S. Justice Department, and over a year later the U.S. Attorney's office prosecuted Hernandez for alleged civil rights violations. The nine illegals and the human smuggler were allowed to stay in the United States. Hernandez was convicted and sent to prison. But yesterday he was released from prison and returned home to Rocksprings, Texas as a hero. The community sided with Deputy Hernandez and resents the U.S. Government freeing the human smuggler and the illegals and prosecuting Hernandez for just doing his job.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Liberty, Texas, is one of the oldest towns in Texas. It was founded in 1831 and named Liberty before Texas was an independent nation in 1836. This town has sent many young men off to war. 
   Today the town of Liberty laid to rest one of its favorite sons. The streets of this small town were lined with American flags. People came outside their homes and businesses to pay honor and tribute to a hometown hero. Some people stood erect with their hands over their hearts or saluting as the funeral procession went by. As the process passed Liberty High School and the middle school, students from both schools lined the streets with flags, tears and signs that said ``Thank You.'' 
   Hundreds of citizens in this community turned out to honor 22-year-old Lance Corporal Jeremy Burris of the United States Marine Corps. Mr. Speaker, this is what people in southeast Texas do when one of their own is killed in combat. 
   Jeremy was killed on October 8, 2007, while conducting combat operations in al-Anbar Province in Iraq. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 4th Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Marine Expeditionary Force from Camp Pendleton, California. 
   I've talked to Jeremy's proud father, Brent Burris. He said his son was driving a military vehicle when it was accompanied by two other Marines when the vehicle hit an IED, that's an improvised explosive device, hidden in the road. 
   Lance Corporal Burris survived the initial blast and helped the other two wounded Marines from the vehicle. Then Jeremy returned to the vehicle to retrieve sensitive equipment when a second bomb detonated and Lance Corporal Burris was killed. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's not uncommon that our enemy sets a second delayed bomb explosion because they know Marines will always return for their wounded or dead or sensitive equipment from their damaged vehicles. This is how these cowards of the desert conduct war against our troops. They do so remotely. They won't come out in the open and fight because they fear the Marines and the Marine reputation. 
   General Black Jack Pershing, United States Army, and Commander of the United States forces in World War I, said of the Marines, ``The deadliest weapon in the world is a Marine with a rifle.'' He was correct. Marines are a rare breed with dogged determination and put fear in the souls of our enemy. 
   Burris was a proud Marine. He was an unapologetic person of faith, and he attended the nondenominational church, Cornerstone Church, where he led worship and praise sessions for youth groups. 
   He loved Texas. His church pastor said today at the funeral, ``No one had better say anything negative about his home State of Texas.'' And on Jeremy's Myspace page he wrote, ``Born and raised in Texas and proud of it.'' 
   Lance Corporal Burris believed totally in his mission in Iraq. He said he was not afraid to die, and he joined the Marines a year and a half ago knowing he would go off to war. He told his youth minister ``he would rather die young while he was able to give 100 percent than grow old and not be able to give that 100 percent.'' Amazing man, this young gun of the United States Marine Corps. 
   In a letter to Jeremy's father, Sergeant Drabicki, Jeremy's section leader in the Marines in Iraq said this about him: ``Your son is a hero to all of us, especially me. He touched my heart and my soul in ways that I could never forget. Your son was the most loyal, hard-working, dedicated and selfless Marine that I had in my section, and his loss is felt by all of us. He never complained. He never faltered. He never quit, and it was my honor to lead your son in combat.''  
   Mr. Speaker, I want to say this about the United States Marine Corps. They are the very best at what they do. They always have been. Army Major General Frank Lowe said in the Korean war, ``The safest place in Korea was right behind a platoon of Marines. Lord, how they can fight.'' 
   Marine Lance Corporal Burris was one of those types of fighting men. They go where others fear to tread. They fight where the timid are nowhere to be found. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a photograph of Lance Corporal Burris right before he was killed. And so the bugler has played taps for the final time for this lance corporal of the United States Marine Corps. And as his flag-draped coffin was laid to rest today in the small town of Liberty, Texas, red, white and blue balloons filled the air, a 21-gun salute was fired, and white doves flew into the heavens. 
   Ronald Reagan said this about the United States Marines: ``Some people live an entire lifetime and wonder if they have ever made a difference in the world, but the Marines, they don't have that problem.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Jeremy Burris was one of those Marines. So semper fi, Lance Corporal Jeremy Burris. Semper fi. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, The Free Flow of Information Act helps ensure that our press remains free. Our Constitution provides for a free press in the first amendment. The first amendment is first for a reason. It is the most important. Without the first amendment freedom of press, speech, religion and assembly, all the rest of the amendments are meaningless. A free press provides for a free flow of information. 
   I agree with the doctrine: a free press will ensure a fair press. The president and publisher of the Houston Chronicle, Jack Sweeney, said today: ``Journalists should be the last resort, not the first stop for civil litigants and prosecutors attempting to obtain the identity of confidential sources. This bill would protect the public's right to know, while at the same time honoring the public interest in having reporters testify in certain circumstances.'' 
   This bill really does not create a new special protection. It gives journalists the protection that is already afforded to them in 49 States which protect the confidentiality of reporters' sources. Federal protection is long overdue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I gladly cosponsor this bill, and that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, they say it's going to be Y2K all over again. Remember all the media hype about the date January 1, 2000--that the worldwide computer systems would fail, that financial records and transactions would be lost and go haywire and that the world would be gloom and doom and despair? 
   This is the same politics of fear we are hearing from the fat cat financial bullies from Wall Street.  
   They say Congress must save them from their financial sins before the stock markets open tomorrow or the country will fall into the abyss. So Congress is working on a plan in the back rooms of this Capitol. There are no public congressional hearings, no witnesses before committees. This Sunday, the plan for financial salvation to save us all is being discussed by only a few in the shadows of this great hall. 
   Doesn't sound like a good way to run the business of Congress. 
   Backroom deals have always troubled me because they usually turn out to be bad deals for Americans. The irresponsible elites in New York City who caused this financial mess should bear the blame and the cost or there should be no deal. However I suspect that Americans will be held financially hostage until they pay the ransom for Wall Street's salvation. 
   By the way, the Y2K scare was just a mythical hoax. And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Since 1969, over 3,200 people have died as a result of political violence in Northern Ireland. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement lessened the violence in Northern Ireland considerably, making it a safer place to live and allowing its beleaguered economy to prosper. 
   While these developments are positive steps forward, political differences between the opposing sides of this conflict led to a stalemate, which in 2002 persuaded the Blair government to suspend the Belfast Northern Ireland Assembly and shift power to direct rule from London. Events have now presented an opportunity to move forward. 
   Last week, a new Northern Ireland Assembly was elected, and at the end of this month, if an administration is formed, rule from Westminster will cease, with Northern Ireland assuming the reins of power for its own self-government. 
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, in expressing his fondest hopes for the success of the Good Friday accords, has stated, ``Enemies would become not just partners in progress but sit together in government, and paramilitaries who used to murder each other as a matter of routine would talk to each other and learn to live with each other.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, these are noble and lofty goals. While no one thought that they would be easy to achieve and many challenges have arisen, combat is now taking place in the political sphere rather than through violent means. Inch by inch, day by day, with focused determination, success is finally emerging. 
   Mr. Speaker, ours is a significant voice in the global community that must be raised in support of the progress that has already been achieved, and in calling for further efforts to achieve the goals of the Good Friday Agreement. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to encourage all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 228, recognizing the 186th anniversary of the independence of Greece, celebrating Greek and American democracy and recognizing Greece as a very staunch ally and friend of our United States. 
   Greece was the birthplace of the principles of democracy on which our Nation was founded. Our Founders studied Greek culture and Greek politics, and their influence is still with us today. Over the centuries, Greece has demonstrated its commitment to what it and our Nation prize among our highest ideals, and that word is ``liberty,'' ``eleftheria'' to the Greek people. 
   Indeed, many of our Nation's respective ideas are shared and, therefore, our relationship holds a special significance. Both the United States and Greece share much in common. Both are outward-looking trading nations that have enriched the world through commercial and cultural exchanges. 
   Over the decades the U.S.-Greek relationship has developed quite dynamically, bolstered by common ideas and cooperation. Moreover, the Greek people have strived to protect freedom and democracy, allying itself with the United States in every major conflict of the 20th century, notably sacrificing for and contributing to the victory of the Allied forces over the Axis powers during World War II. 
   Today, our common destinies are threatened by other enemies who scorn our commitment to freedom, eleftheria, and aggression from Islamic extremism looms large and threatens western civilization that was born in that country of Greece. We are grateful that the Greek people have stood against this aggression throughout the years. 
   Indeed, Greece should be praised for its contributions in the global war on terror. In the war in Iraq, Greece has been responsive to U.S. requests for access to its air space and in fueling U.S. ships that supply cargo ships headed to Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to further cooperation between our two nations and expanding the friendship that exists between Greek and American people. I therefore ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the nation of Greece on the 186th anniversary of its independence and to express their  acknowledgment of the great friendship that exists between our two countries.

   Jessica was kidnapped in the middle of the night from her home by a professional child molester; his name is John Couey. The criminal abused Jessica for several days and then buried her alive in his backyard. When found, Jessica had poked her tiny fingers through the plastic bag seeking air. Last week, a jury convicted the child killer of capital murder and the punishment hearing begins today in Florida. The State is seeking the death penalty. 
   Mr. Speaker, evil doesn't get much worse than stealing, abusing and murdering little girls. Society cannot allow this type of conduct to occur. Society can only eliminate it. The punishment assessed on this criminal will set a price for this dastardly act. Hopefully the good people of Florida will, by their verdict, say to all child killers, leave our children alone or face an early meeting with your maker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   When Americans visit Europe today, it is hard to see how very damaged the  countries of that continent were when they emerged from the destruction of the Second World War. American assistance played a very important role in rebuilding Western Europe in the 1940s and the 1950s, and American arms played a crucial role in protecting the democracies of Europe from the advance of Soviet communism during the Cold War. 
   Ultimately, however, Europeans needed to do more on their own to build upon a foundation that the United States had first provided. The 1957 Treaty of Rome, signed by France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg was one of the first steps that Western Europe took to put the causes and the legacy of the Second World War behind them. 
   The treaty established a free-trade region known as the European Economic Community, the cornerstone of what we today know as the European Union.     
   A post-World War II economically ravaged Europe reasoned that if nations are linked economically, in this case by recalling the role that economic decline and hindered trade among nations had played in the years leading up to World War II, the creators of that free trade zone saw that the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and people might well prove to be a great deterrent to conflict between the states of Europe, large and small. 
   Over the subsequent decades through the entry of new members and expansions both geographically across Europe and functionally across issues, the European Community grew beyond the original core membership of the 1950s and assumed responsibilities going well beyond trade. Today, the European Union indeed counts among its member states countries that once were under Soviet domination. It has worked to transfer more powers from its individual member states to the overall organization centered on the road to creating a more unified European foreign and security policy and making the European Union an organization that the United States increasingly looks to for leadership on transatlantic issues, joining the NATO alliances that continue to bind us together in that common cause. 
   While the European Community continues to provide a framework within which to conduct international trade, such as multilateral trade negotiations with the United States, it has also advanced the cause of liberty, free markets, democratic institutions, and respect for human rights throughout the European continent. The Treaty of Rome was an important step in building on the foundation that the United States helped create after World War II for Europe. 
   Today, we look to a strong Europe as seen in the expanded NATO and expanded and strengthened European Union as a foundation on which we can work together to address new and ever growing challenges. Therefore, with enthusiasm, Mr. Speaker, it is that this House should commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of this Treaty of Rome.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, when a veteran is buried in one of our national cemeteries, the flag draped over the warrior's coffin is neatly folded and given to the warrior's family. As the flag is folded, a statement is made as to what each fold represents. Two of the folds refer to Jews and Christians in our military. But that ceremony has been sabotaged by the National Cemetery Administration. Some bureaucrat banned the recitation of the meaning of the folds in the flag at all national cemeteries because someone complained about the ceremony being religious. 
   To ban this time-honored tradition which recognizes life, gives tribute to our country and to our Armed Forces, honors women, recognizes fathers, and reminds us of our national motto ``In God We Trust'' is un-American and, frankly, it's stupid. 
   I've been to funerals at national cemeteries of fallen troops from my district. I've heard the recitation of the meaning of each fold. I've watched tearful mothers and fathers and spouses hold that flag next to their chest, grateful for every fold. 
   The Washington bureaucrat that issued this absurd ruling should withdraw the ban. It's unpatriotic, irreverent and disrespectful of our war dead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, freedom of speech is one of the most basic of all human rights. However, more and more European countries are arresting individuals for insult speech. Speech to be free must allow individuals to criticize religion and government. 
   The first amendment protecting speech and press is first because it's the most important. But in Europe, speech must be politically and religiously correct. Criticize or insult another person's religion and you're likely to be hauled off to prison thanks to  the speech police. After all, heaven forbid, offensive or insult speech may hurt somebody's feelings. 
   In Germany, an insult to a religion can be a crime worthy of imprisonment. Recently, a 61-year-old German businessman was convicted and sent to jail for offending Islam. The same thing happened in Britain where Nick Griffin was prosecuted for describing Islam as a ``vicious and wicked faith.'' 
   Free speech must be universal. If controversial issues like religion and politics cannot be debated in countries, the people are not free, even in Europe. 
   Teddy Roosevelt once said, ``Free speech, exercised both individually and through a free press, is a necessity in any country where people are themselves free.''

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (AN AMERICAN GI -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, standing on the beaches of Normandy, he found himself silent. Like a scene ripped from the movie Saving Private Ryan, this American GI was overwhelmed with memories. Memories so vivid, so real that in an instant he was a soldier again in the 7th Army, surviving the Battle of the Bulge, fighting through the Cities of Aachen, Stuttgart, Cologne, and Bonn. The graves before him transcended time, taking him back in history to a time when freedom was on the line. 
   He was born in the 1920s. He grew up in the Depression of the thirties, and he grew up poor like most rural American children. Fresh vegetables were grown in the family garden behind the small frame house. His mother made sandwiches for school out of homemade bread. Store-bought bread was for the rich. He grew up belonging to the Boy Scouts, playing the trumpet in the high school band and going to church almost every Sunday. 
   In 1944, this 18-year-old country boy that had never been more than 50 miles from home finally found himself going through basic training in the United States Army at Camp Walters in Texas. After that, he rode the train with hundreds of other young teenagers to New York City for the hazardous ocean trip on a cramped liberty ship to fight in the great World War II. 
   No amount of training could have prepared him for what he was about to experience. As a teenager, he and thousands like him put life on the line for freedom. He saw the concentration camps at Dachau and the victims of the Nazis. This horror gave him a clear understanding of why America was at war. He saw incredible numbers of other teenage Americans buried in graves throughout France, but like so many of his generation, he really never discussed the details, only saying that the real heroes were the ones that never came home from Europe. 
   Some 64 years after the war, my hero stood before the monument at Normandy with the thousands of white crosses and Stars of David and paid tribute to his heroes. The price of freedom was enormous, the memories of the sacrifices made were overwhelming. Amidst the whirlwind of imagery flashing before his eyes, my dad began to recall life before the war and what victory in Europe meant for Americans--and what freedom means today. 
   After Germany surrendered, he went back to Fort Hood, Texas, expecting to be re-equipped for the land invasion of Japan. It was there he met Mom at a Wednesday night prayer meeting church service, but before he could be shipped out to Japan, the Japanese surrendered and the war was over. Not too long after that, he opened a DX service station where he pumped gas, sold tires, fixed cars, and began a family. 
   Deciding that he needed to go to college, he moved to West Texas and enrolled in a small Christian college called Abilene Christian College. He and his wife and two small children lived in an old converted Army barracks with other such families. He supported us by working nights at KRBC radio and climbing telephone poles for ``Ma Bell.'' 
   He finished college, became an engineer, and worked 40-plus years for Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in Houston, Texas. He turned down a promotion and a transfer to New York City because it wasn't Texas, and as he said it was ``no place to raise a family.'' Mom and Dad still live in Houston not far from where I grew up. 
   After his recent trip to Normandy, he opened up a little more about the war, still humble about his contributions, but looking back on the significance of victory through the eyes of an 82-year-old man. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Speaker, he hasn't mellowed at all in these years. He still rants and raves about the east coast media, and he has a strong opinion on politics and today's fight for freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. He gives plenty of advice to everybody, including me. 
   He has two computers in his home office and e-mails with his buddies all around the world. He still flies the flag on holidays. He mows his own grass, and he can fix anything. He goes to church on Sunday, and he takes Mom out to eat almost every Friday night. 
   On Memorial Day, we honor those who fought and died in America's wars. We don't have to look far for courage or stories of inspiration. They are all around us from the men and women who proudly wear the uniform of a U.S. warrior. 
   Across the Potomac River in Arlington National Cemetery are the graves of the silent warriors who, in their youth, gave their lives for our future. Down the street from the Capitol are the World War I, the World War II, the Korean, and Vietnam Memorials. Standing in front of the World War II Memorial are the pillars from each of our States and Territories. On the back wall, there appears to be a large bronze plate. Mr. Speaker, it is not a bronze plate at all but it's 4,000 bronze stars. Each star represents 100 Americans, mostly teenagers, killed in the great World War II. Four hundred thousand Americans, many still buried in the fields of Europe where they gave their lives for the rest of us. 
   Without the sacrifices of the Greatest Generation, America would not be the amazing country of liberty it is today. My hero, my dad, is one of the charter members of the Greatest Generation. 
   This Memorial Day, he and his fellow veterans at the local American Legion hall will be marching in a parade somewhere in Texas. He's the best man I ever met. Virgil Poe: good man, good father, good soldier. That's plenty for one life.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the first amendment protects the fundamental natural rights of free speech and free press. 
   These pillars of principle are listed first because they are the most important. These two freedoms ensure the protection of all the other rights that follow in the Bill of Rights. 
   Many years have passed since these values were chiseled into the Constitution, but they are still under attack by the elites who advocate Federal control of both. Why? Because these censors disagree with the content or claim it's inaccurate or it's not fair. Even former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said last year that people should not harshly criticize the Supreme Court or its rulings. 
   The Constitution does not guarantee speech or press to be fair or even accurate. It guarantees it to be free. ``Fair'' is too subjective a term. 
   Our Framers were primarily concerned about protecting the political and religious discourse. Why? Because they are the most controversial and the most important. 
   Any action by the Federal Government to control speech or press should be met with loud, harsh words; fiery oratory; and a blazing pen.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, in the vastness of west Texas, the sky is a brilliant brazen blue and a place where sparse live oak trees fight to even exist. In the stillness of these arid plains is the remote south Texas town of Rocksprings. 
   The people of this community of only 1,250 had a homecoming Saturday for their favorite son, Deputy Gilmer Hernandez. I was honored to be there. The ceremony, ironically, took place on the courthouse square under the pecan trees and in front of the old limestone courthouse. Ironic because, you see, Mr. Speaker, the town was celebrating the release of Gilmer Hernandez from the Federal penitentiary. He had been sent to prison for, as local sheriff, Donnie Letsinger put it ``just doing his job for the rest of us.'' The sheriff spoke the sentiments of most of the townspeople that I got to talk to. 
   The town was decorated with signs and flags and banners in windows of houses and in front of stores. Anyway, the ceremony started off with a lengthy prayer by the local Baptist preacher, and then there was a rousing pledge to the flag. There were tears and speeches by politicians. The mayor, Rachel Gallegos, presented Deputy Hernandez a proclamation from the city as Rocksprings' Favorite Son. 
   Most of the community turned out, many carrying signs of ``Welcome Home, Gilmer.'' Gilmer's family was there, his wife, Ashley; and his wonderful young daughter. When Gilmer was shipped off to Federal prison, the people of this small town rallied around his family. The town paid the rent on his pickup truck, took his family into their homes, provided food, and took care of his mortgage on his house. They sent him letters while he was incarcerated; they prayed for him; and when he got home, he already had a job with the city and the local phone company. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting celebration considering Gilmer was a convicted felon. Gilmer Hernandez grew up in Rocksprings. His family is from there. He became a deputy sheriff for Edwards County. He always dreamed of being a lawman, even though he made a little bit over just $20,000 a year patrolling a county the size of Delaware. 
   Here's what happened sometime ago: while this young deputy was on routine patrol late at night, he came in contact with an SUV that ran the red light in Rocksprings, Texas. He pulled the vehicle over; and as he approached it, the truck sped off and swerved to run over the deputy. Gilmer pulled his weapon and shot out two tires in self-defense. The vehicle stopped, and numerous illegals, including the coyote smuggling the illegals into America, took off running. But one of Gilmer's bullets ricocheted in the SUV and hit a passenger as Gilmer fired at the fleeing vehicle. This was the first time Gilmer Hernandez had ever fired his pistol. 
   The sheriff and the Texas Rangers investigated the incident; and after investigating it thoroughly, they cleared Hernandez. 
   But upon the assistance of the arrogant Mexican Government one year after the incident, our almighty Federal Government prosecuted Gilmer for a civil rights violation, saying he should not have continued firing at the vehicle after it drove past him. So Gilmer Hernandez was sent off to prison at the behest of Mexico with the United States being the puppet. By the way, all of the illegals got to stay in the United States. 
   Many of the townspeople told me Saturday they thought Gilmer was right to defend himself. One old crusty Texas rancher called Gilmer a political prisoner.  
   I and others of this House have asked the President to pardon Gilmer Hernandez, and we hope eventually the President does pardon him. He has, after all, served his time. 
   But Saturday, as the magnificent sun began to set, the town of Rocksprings came out to cheer and honor and praise and totally support its favorite native son. After all the hoopla, the town went down the road to the fairgrounds for barbecue and homemade desserts. And, by the way, the sheriff gave Gilmer back his badge, hoping some day he will be able to wear it again. 
   Deputy Gilmer Hernandez is a remarkable person, and the town of Rocksprings is a uniquely remarkable place to be from. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Today Mom said she can't even afford gas to get to the post office. Mr. Speaker, maybe this ``Drill Nothing Congress'' should find more energy for Americans. Open up the Outer Continental Shelf to crude oil. Congress needs to get to work and solve the gasoline issue. We can name post office buildings at some other time. 
   There has been enough talk about energy. Now action is demanded. However, it seems when all is said and done, more is said than done about the energy problem. Maybe we should rename our Congress the Post Office Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO SPEECH -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Thomas Jefferson once stated, ``A democracy cannot be both ignorant and free.'' Our Founding Fathers shared that attitude. They knew that if American citizens failed to share information and were unable to speak freely, they would be worse off than they had been as subjects under Britain's King George III. 
   Our Founding Fathers were former colonists under a tyranny that controlled information and freedom of expression. King George III suppressed free speech, especially speech critical of the Crown or the government. 
   As the Founding Fathers debated what the new Nation of America should look like and stand for, they were determined free speech would be a basic right for all of us. 
   After the States ratified the Constitution, our Founding Fathers set out to enact a declaration of rights. They knew that this was essential for our country. That declaration of rights later became the Bill of Rights, which includes the first 10 amendments. 
   The Bill of Rights, Mr. Speaker, limits government control over us. The government does not have any rights. Government has power. It has the power we give it when we give up our rights that are listed in the Bill of Rights. This is an important concept that unfortunately many Americans fail to understand. 
   And the first amendment is first because it's the most important. The first amendment states in part: Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. 
   Without the first amendment of free speech, freedom of the press, religion and assembly, the rest of the amendments are meaningless. The purpose of the first amendment is to permit free and open discussion about important public affairs. This is exactly what was forbidden under King George, so it makes sense that this was most important to our Founders. 
   The Founding Fathers intended free speech to include criticism of the government and advocacy of unpopular ideas that are distasteful or even against public policy or even controversial issues. Freedom of speech allows individuals to express themselves without interference of the government. 
   For over 200 years, the first amendment has endured without substantial alterations or limitations. This is a testament to the first amendment's importance. There are a few instances, however, in our history where the first amendment has been set aside, including a few instances of government censorship, such as sedition acts and wartime censorship. 
   The most volatile and controversial types of speech are political speech and religious speech. That's why they should be protected the most, because they are so controversial. 
   Congress would do well to stay out of the speech control business, especially trying to control the open and free discussion of America's two controversial and passionate pastimes, which are politics and religion. And besides, the  Constitution forbids a speech police by Congress. 
   George Washington said it very well when he said, ``If the freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be, led like sheep to the slaughter.'' 
   And, finally, Voltaire, who lived right at the time that our revolution began, he said, ``I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.'' 
   It's important and incumbent upon Congress that we make sure that we have open, free and even volatile, if necessary, discussion of America's issues, which are politics and religion, because that is the type of country we are, and that is what our Constitution and the first amendment stand for. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, radio stations pay a set contract amount for recording label companies to play their songs. Part of that money goes to the writer of the songs for each time the song is aired. But the performers get a set fee from the record label company, no matter how many times their songs are played on the radio. 
   Now the performers want the Federal Government to charge radio stations a performance fee each time the song is played. That money would go to the performer. In other words, tax radio stations to subsidize the performers because, God bless them, they just don't make enough money. 
   The Federal Government has no business interfering in the free market and subsidizing performers at taxpayers' expense. The music artists and their agents should work out a better contract with their recording companies. 
   The proposal to subsidize recording artists would require the cost to be passed on to the consumers by higher advertising fees. Plus, the whole concept smacks in the face of freedom of the airwaves. 
   The Federal Government needs to stay out of the radio control business, even if performers are just ``Singing the Blues.''

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, there are those who now proclaim that our children be required to learn Spanish. Mr. Speaker, I thought English was the national language. Up until recently, almost all immigrants that came to America learned the language, English. That included the Germans, Dutch, French, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, South Asians and on and on. 
   So why the push to require Americans to learn Spanish? Why not Chinese? More people in the world speak Chinese than any other language, or German. According to the Census Bureau, more Americans, including my family, claim German ancestry over any other heritage. But when our Forefathers debated this language issue years ago, English won out over German. 
   It seems to me that it's logical that in the U.S. we ought to speak at least the same language, English. And if people want to speak an additional language, let them choose, not the government, which language to speak. 
   It doesn't seem too much to require people that come to America that they work, follow the law, and learn the common language. Otherwise, we will become a community of nations, rather than a Nation of communities.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (HALL MONITORS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Capitol Hill hall monitors have issued warning citations to Members of Congress. That's right; Republicans and Democrats all over the hill are getting busted. The dastardly offense was paying tribute to American warriors by placing a poster outside the office with photos of our troops killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. That's right. We're getting written up for honoring the memory of fallen soldiers from our home States and districts. 
   Here is my citation. I got busted for having a sign-in table and easel with a poster in the hallway. And this is the poster that I got written up for, Mr. Speaker. This letter says I have 30 days to comply with the new hallway policy or I will be in violation of this new edict. 
   You see, Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues and I choose to honor the men and women who have fought so bravely and given their lives in the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. So we display a poster like this one. 
   This poster represents the 26 men and women of the Second Congressional District area of Texas that have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. We post these displays outside our offices so that we, our staff, and visitors will be constantly reminded of the sacrifice of our troops. 
   Our type of government exists because real Americans go to war and some of them don't come back. And these photos are of some, 26, of those Americans. Now the hall monitors want us to take them down. They say they are an ``obstacle.'' 
   I will now read from the edict from the sign police that stealthily roam our hallways looking for violators of this hall monitoring proclamation. It says: 
   ``In an emergency evacuation, the many items placed in the hallways of House office buildings interfere with the safe exit of Members, staff, and visitors ..... This policy was developed in response to a complaint regarding the proliferation of items placed in the hallways and responsive recommendation by the Office of Compliance. Its adoption was further recommended by the Committee on House Administration and supported by the Office of the Architect of the Capitol; the Office of Emergency Planning, Preparedness, and Operations; the House Sergeant at Arms; the Inspector General; the Chief Administrative Officer; and the Office of Compliance.'' And, Mr. Speaker, I will introduce this edict and this warning letter into the Record. 
   Notice 
   July 3, 2008. Room No. 1605.  
   The attached letter, dated May 2, 2008, announced the issuance of a Hallway Policy intended to reduce hallway obstacles. The Hallway Policy can be viewed at http://housenet.house.gov (search on ``hallway policy'') or http://house.aoc.gov. We are now entering the final 30 days of the transition period established by the Committee on House Administration. In accordance with our responsibility to administer and enforce this Policy we note the following violations of the Policy:

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, to support National Crime Victims Week, the Washington Post printed an opinion piece submitted by a criminal defense lawyer that belittled victims of crime, implying that victims are what is wrong with the criminal justice system and our society. 
   It seems the op-ed writer does not believe the criminal justice system should pay any attention to victims. To him, crime victims should not be seen and not heard. However, the same Constitution that protects defendants also protects victims of crime. 
   Justice is viewed as a scale, a balance. As a former judge, I always balanced the rights of defendants with the rights of society to be safe and the rights of crime victims. A court of law is to seek justice, justice for defendants and justice for victims. 
   Sometimes defendants don't want justice, especially the guilty ones. They think it's Burger King, where they can have it their way. But justice is not having it your way. It's doing the right thing for the right reason. The right thing is for victims to be heard and present in our courts of law, and then let the courts weigh the rights of the defendants and victims to achieve justice so that we can have liberty and justice for all.  
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (BORDER AGENTS CAMPION AND RAMOS -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, at this time of the year, it is common for whatever President is in power to review requests for pardons and for commutations of sentence. And yesterday, the President exercised his constitutional authority and pardoned numerous individuals, at least 29 of them, and I have all of their names here. I count seven drug dealers that were pardoned, one individual for receiving kickbacks in defense procurements contracts, and he commuted one sentence of an individual that was aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine. 
   I want to make it clear; the President has the absolute power under the Constitution to pardon anybody he wishes or commute the sentence. And I want to read part of the Constitution, a pocketbook Constitution that many  of us here carry that says, ``The President shall have the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States.'' 
   You notice, Mr. Speaker, it doesn't give any conditions, except he can't pardon someone who has been impeached. It doesn't require that a committee decide who is to be pardoned. It doesn't require that the Justice Department do anything or be even involved in the process. It gives the power of pardon and commutation to the President; and he has that right to pardon anyone he wishes, and I uphold his right to do so. 
   But in jail today in the Federal penitentiary somewhere across our United States are two individuals who I think should be pardoned, or at least their sentences should be commuted. And numerous people on the House, on both sides, have asked the President to look at these cases and pardon these two individuals, especially in light of their appellate court hearing that took place just a few weeks ago in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana. Of course, those two people are Border Agents Ramos and Campion, who I feel like were unjustly convicted by an overzealous prosecution, a comment that was made by one of the Federal judges on appeal, ``overzealous prosecution.'' 
   But be that as it may, and it seems to me that they have been imprisoned a year now, most of that time they have been serving solitary confinement. For what crime? Well, because they supposedly violated the civil rights of a drug smuggler bringing drugs in from Mexico worth about $1 million. And the United States Government, rather than prosecute the drug dealer, prosecuted the Border Agents because they didn't follow policy, protocol, filling out appropriate forms after this shooting took place. But they go make a deal with the drug dealer. They make a deal with the devil, and they get testimony from the drug dealer in their trial. Talking about the Federal prosecution made a deal with him. 
   But, you see, that whole case kind of has some bad things that happened. We had learned, several of us, that while the drug dealer, granted immunity, that means they are not going to prosecute him, to testify, and before the trial took place, he brought in another load of drugs from Mexico to the United States worth about $700,000.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE NON-ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, this winter it's going to be cold in the Northeast. Home heating oil is needed for those who want to keep warm in the northern States. Gasoline prices continue to rise above $3 a gallon, and crude oil may go to $100 a barrel. So what does the House of Representatives do? Makes it more expensive for American oil companies to do business in America. How so? The non-energy bill that passed this House contains a $21 billion tax increase on the production of oil and natural gas in America. That tax will be passed on to the consumer in the higher prices of energy. 
   The bill doesn't open up new sources of exploration off our coast or in ANWR. Now, only Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama allow drilling off the coast. You see, States like California, Florida, and northeastern States don't want drilling off their coast but they don't have a problem with consuming the crude oil from States that allow offshore drilling. This bill punishes oil-producing States like my home State of Texas. The Wall  Street Journal stated, In this bill, the biggest winner is OPEC. So, Mr. Speaker, maybe to survive, Texas and the other oil-producing States should just join OPEC and get a better deal on our crude oil. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (TURN OUT THE LIGHTS--THE PARTY'S OVER -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, Congress passed an energy bill which should have been called the Anti-American non Energy Bill, because it punishes Americans for using energy, rather than finding new sources of affordable energy. But the bill does one thing, Madam Speaker, it controls the type of light bulbs that all Americans must use throughout our fruited plains. 
   Congress's energy bill bans incandescent light bulbs by 2014, and requires Americans to buy compact fluorescent bulbs. Those are called CFLs. Now we can say goodbye to Thomas Edison's incandescent bulb and his invention. 
   Madam Speaker, I have a Constitution here and, like most Members of Congress, I carry it with me. I've read it through and through, but I don't see anywhere in the U.S. Constitution that it gives the government the power to control the type of light bulbs used in Dime Box, Texas or any other place in the United States. Besides the lack of constitutional authority, let me discuss these light bulbs further. 
   Nothing in Congress seems to be easy, and that phrase is certainly true with these CFL light bulbs. These light bulbs contain mercury, so they have to be disposed of in a certain way. According to EPA rules, you're supposed to take them to a local recycling center. Thanks to Congress, nothing is easy. 
   If you throw them out at home, you're supposed to seal the bulb in two plastic bags and place them in the outside trash; otherwise, the bulb may break and pollute the landfill, of all things. 
   CFLs are made of glass, so they're fragile. If one breaks it or drops it, you have to follow simple rules, thanks to Congress. And according to the EPA, here's what do you if you break one of these light bulbs, and I quote. ``Have people and pets leave the room, and don't let anyone walk through the area.'' We must evacuate the room, Madam Speaker. 
   I continue. ``Open a window and leave the room for 15 minutes or more. Shut off the central heating and air conditioning system. Carefully scoop up glass fragments and powder using stiff paper or cardboard and place them in a glass jar with a metal lid.'' Obviously, that's readily available. 
   I continue. ``Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small grass fragments and powder.'' Of course we do have lots of duct tape in Texas, so that's no problem. But we're not through yet. 
   I continue to quote. ``Wipe the area clean with a damp paper towel or disposable wet wipes and place them in the glass jar or plastic bag. Do not use a vacuum or a broom.'' 
   And, Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to file this 3-page, single space requirements the EPA has made all Americans follow on disposing of one of these broken light bulbs.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (TURN OUT THE LIGHTS--THE PARTY'S OVER -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. If you break a light bulb in a high rise where the windows don't open, will the EPA light bulb police haul us off to jail because of improper disposal procedures? 
   If I dropped this light bulb, we would have to evacuate the House of Representatives, according to the EPA light bulb law. Have we gone a bit too far with this nonsense? 
   Thanks to Congress, we're making what is simple very difficult. And besides, these light bulbs, are expensive, and using them may fade photographs on the wall. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, I'm going to carefully remove one of these light bulbs from a box that contains all these warnings on the outside. And this is one of those CFL light bulbs that Congress is requiring all Americans to use by 2014. 
   There's more to the requirements of using these. It says here, and I quote, ``these light bulbs may cause interference to radios, televisions, wireless telephones and remote controls.'' Now we're in trouble for Monday night football because we're going to have to turn out the lights so there's no interference with our TV. 
   We can also thank Congress for giving more money to China. This light bulb, it says right here, with all the warnings on it, is made in China. And Madam Speaker, they are only made in China. They're not made in the United States. We import every one of these things. 
   You know, over the past year we've seen Chinese pet food kill our dogs and  cats; Chinese lead paint is poisoning our children, and now Chinese light bulbs that contain mercury can be harmful to our health. Doesn't this bother anybody? 
   Meanwhile, gasoline nears $4 a gallon, and Congress still has no energy plan except turn on these light bulbs.     
   Oh, I yearn for the day when America took care of Americans by developing our own abundant natural resources like coal and natural gas and crude oil to provide affordable energy to America. But those days have gone the way of Edison's incandescent light bulb. We might as well turn out the lights, the party's over. 
   And that's just the way it is. 
   What To Do if a Fluorescent Light Bulb Breaks 
   Compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) are lighting more homes than ever before, and EPA is encouraging Americans to use and recycle them safely. Carefully recycling CFLs prevents the release of mercury into the environment and allows for the reuse of glass, metals and other materials that make up fluorescent lights. 
   EPA is continually reviewing its clean-up and disposal recommendations for CFLs to ensure that the Agency presents the most up-to-date information for consumers and businesses. Maine's Department of Environmental Protection released a CFL breakage study report on February 25, 2008. EPA has conducted an initial review of this study and, as a result of this review, we have updated the CFL cleanup instructions below. 
   Pending the completion of a full review of the Maine study, EPA will determine whether additional changes to the cleanup recommendations are warranted. The agency plans to conduct its own study on CFLs after thorough review of the Maine study. 
   Fluorescent light bulbs contain a very small amount of mercury sealed within the glass tubing. EPA recommends the following clean-up and disposal guidelines: 
   Before clean-up: ventilate the room   
   1. Have people and pets leave the room, and don't let anyone walk through the breakage area on their way out. 
   2. Open a window and leave the room for 15 minutes or more. 
   3. Shut off the central forced-air heating/air conditioning system, if you have one. 
   Clean-up steps for hard surfaces   
   4. Carefully scoop up glass fragments and powder using stiff paper or cardboard and place them in a glass jar with metal lid (such as a canning jar) or in a sealed plastic bag. 
   5. Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass fragments and powder. 
   6. Wipe the area clean with damp paper towels or disposable wet wipes and place them in the glass jar or plastic bag. 
   7. Do not use a vacuum or broom to clean up the broken bulb on hard surfaces. 
   Clean-up steps for carpeting or rug   
   4. Carefully pick up glass fragments and place them in a glass jar with metal lid (such as a canning jar) or in a sealed plastic bag. 
   5. Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass fragments and powder. 
   6. If vacuuming is needed after all visible materials are removed, vacuum the area where the bulb was broken. 
   7. Remove the vacuum bag (or empty and wipe the canister), and put the bag or vacuum debris in a sealed plastic bag. 
   Disposal of clean-up materials   
   8. Immediately place all cleanup materials outside the building in a trash container or outdoor protected area for the next normal trash. 
   9. Wash your hands after disposing of the jars or plastic bags containing clean-up materials. 
   10. Check with your local or state government about disposal requirements in your specific area. Some states prohibit such trash disposal and require that broken and unbroken mercury-containing bulbs be taken to a local recycling center. 
   Future cleaning of carpeting or rug: ventilate the room during and after vacuuming   
   11. The next several times you vacuum, shut off the central forced-air heating/air conditioning system and open a window prior to vacuuming. 
   12. Keep the central heating/air conditioning system shut off and the window open for at least 15 minutes after vacuuming is completed.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (NATIONAL POLICE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I appreciate your service in the House but also in your other career as a sheriff. I'm sure, based upon the information we know about you, Sheriff, when you left the State of Washington and came to the House of Representatives, the criminals were probably cheering that you had left town and you were coming to Washington, DC. But I want to thank you and the other several individuals in the House of Representatives who served in law enforcement prior to coming to the House of Representatives. 
   This week is Police Week, May 11 through the 17th. I am proud to be the author of House Resolution 1132 to designate May 15 of this year as Peace Officers Memorial Day so that we can honor all Federal, State, and local peace officers killed in the line of duty or disabled in the line of duty. 
   As you have mentioned, Sheriff, thousands of local, State, and Federal law enforcement officers across the country are injured every year. Almost 60,000 a year are injured in the line of duty. Many others are also killed in the line of duty. 
   Peace officers selflessly protect our communities and our property regardless of the dangers they face. Every day when they get up, they pin that badge or star on, and they go on patrol throughout this country, they always put their life on the line for the rest of us. There are almost 1 million sworn peace officers in the United States today. 
   When I came to Congress, I was the author and founder of the Victims' Rights Caucus. This bipartisan group advocates not only on behalf of crime victims but peace officers as well, to give bipartisan support for the work that peace officers do because many of them also become victims of crime. 
   You mentioned that you spent 33 years in law enforcement. I saw it probably from the other position. You used to catch them and I used to prosecute them, so to speak. I spent 8 years prosecuting criminals in Houston, Texas, and left the District Attorney's office and became a judge in Houston for 22 more years, hearing only criminal cases, hearing some 25,000 cases during that period of time. And I saw firsthand how police officers became victims of crime. During my years as a prosecutor, I knew several peace officers that were injured or killed in the line of duty. And since the first recorded police death in 1792, there have been almost 20,000 officers killed in the line of duty in the United States. Of course, the deadliest day in law enforcement history was September 11, 2001, when 72 officers were killed responding to international criminal attacks against the United States. Last year 181 officers were killed. That's 30 more than in 2006. 
   Law enforcement officers are also frequently the victims of assault. They continue to be assaulted day in and day out. And it's not part of their duty and job to be victims of assault. But as you mentioned, many times they take it because that's what they do. 
   Here in Washington, DC., we have the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. This memorial lists the names of brave men and women who have died in the line of duty, and every year more names are added to that memorial, and every year more families suffer the rest of their lives for being a victim of crime and the loss of their loved one. 
   This year, in 2008, Texas has the highest number of law enforcement officers that have been killed, with Georgia being second. Ranking in the States, California has lost the most, Texas the second most, and New York the third most since we have been recording the number of officers killed. This week allows us an opportunity to pay tribute to these brave men and women who are no longer with us because they protected our communities. 
   Texas has a high number of officers who have been killed because of the unique problem we have with illegal trespassers and that epidemic that is occurring on our southern border. You can open a newspaper almost every week in Texas and read about some illegal trespasser committing a crime, and too often that crime is against a peace officer. Right now, as we are here tonight, down in Houston, Texas, an illegal trespasser by the name of Juan Leonardo Quintero-Perez, who had already been deported from this country once for child molesting, came back into the United States and was arrested by Houston Police Officer Rodney Johnson for a routine traffic stop. But Officer Johnson was the victim of a crime because this illegal criminal shot Officer Johnson four times in the back of the head. His wife was also a Houston police officer. Now they mourn his loss while the killer is on trial for capital murder, too often a  scenario that occurs here in the United States. 
   This week also there is another group that is meeting, and the name of this organization is Concerns of Police Survivors, or COPS, as it's called. They have their National Police Survivors' Conference this week, and it's an organization of 15,000 families of law enforcement officers that were killed in the line of duty, and they are meeting this week to honor the loss of their loved ones and peace officers throughout the United States. 
   It is important that we in Congress recognize the work that peace officers throughout the United States do on a daily basis. They don't get much recognition, and it's our responsibility to make sure that we are their advocate and we're their voice. 
   When I was growing up in Texas, before we moved to Houston, we lived in a small town called Heidenheimer. You've never heard of it, Sheriff. But occasionally we would go to the biggest town in our area, Temple, Texas. And once I was there with my dad watching a parade, and I noticed that there was an individual standing on the side at the curb not involved in the parade, just watching the parade. And, of course, that was a local Temple police officer. And back in those days, they didn't wear uniforms. They just wore a cowboy hat and a white shirt and a star, as some of them still do. And I was 5 or 6 years of age. And I remember my father told me, because he noticed I was watching this individual, he said, ``If you are ever in trouble, if you ever need help, go to the person who wears the badge because they are a cut above the rest of us.'' 
   Now, those words were true many, many years ago when I was a kid, but they are true today as well. People still, when they're in trouble, when they need someone to help them, they go to peace officers, those individuals who wear the badge, because they are the last strand of wire between the law and the lawless, and they protect us from those who wish to commit crimes against our community. They are all that separate us from the barbarians, if you will. And we honor them for wearing the badge of an American peace officer. 
   When September 11, 2001, occurred, all Americans remember what they were doing that morning. I was driving my jeep to the courthouse, and I was listening to the radio, and it was interrupted, and we heard about an airplane that crashed into the World Trade Center. And as I continued driving to the courthouse, we heard about a second plane that crashed into the World Trade Center, the second tower. And then another plane crashing in Pennsylvania because of some heroes on that plane, and the fourth plane crashing not far from here, into the Pentagon. 
   And later that evening, as most Americans were watching television, as I was, while peace officers like yourself, Sheriff, were out doing your duty on patrol, I noticed that there were thousands and thousands of people. When those planes hit the World Trade Center, thousands of people were running as hard as they could to get away from that crime in the skies. 
   But there was another group, not near as many, but they were there anyway, a small group, that when those planes hit the World Trade Center, they were running as hard as they could to get to that crime scene. Who were they? Emergency medical technicians, firefighters, and peace officers. And 72 of those peace officers gave their lives that day. 
   And while it's important that we remember the 3,000 that were killed on 9/11, it's equally important we remember those that lived because peace officers and other first responders gave their lives so they could live and are living today. 
   So it's important that we honor our peace officers because they are, as my dad said many, many years ago, ``a cut above the rest of us.'' 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the Eyes of Texas are shining tonight on the life and legacy of Houston news legend Ron Stone. Stone died today at the age of 72. 
   For 30 years, Ron Stone was a fixture on Houston television and the host of one of my favorite shows, the Eyes of Texas, featuring the real-life stories about unique people and places of our great State. 
   Though he had countless awards to mark his contributions in the media industry, it was his down to earth, folksy style that endeared him to audiences all across the Houston area. 
   He was born in Oklahoma, but Stone came to Houston in the 1960s, and his love for Texas took root then. He said he wasn't born in Texas, but he got there as fast as he could. After retiring from KPRC in 1992, he continued to leave his mark on the industry. He was a recognized filmmaker, author of several books on Texas history and continued his dedication to our community. 
   I met Ron many years ago while I was a judge in Houston. It was his personal approach to news that set him apart from others, and captivated audiences for more than 30 years. Ron Stone leaves a unique mark on Houston's history. May the Eyes of Texas forever shine on him and his family.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I too support the efforts of the men and women who work in Homeland Security. As a former judge in Texas for over 20 years, I appreciate all of those in our country who are in law enforcement. But I was disappointed and concerned to hear that this department who is tasked with protecting our Nation's borders, ports, and other critical infrastructure is ranked dead last in employee attitude and morale of all 36 Federal departments surveyed. 
   To me it reflects the poor and often ambiguous leadership and policies at the top of the department, and I hope Congress can work together to correct this and correct it soon before someone does harm to our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me provide a couple of absurd examples of maybe the reason why those who are working at the Department of Homeland Security are so frustrated. Three years ago this Saturday, a couple of our border agents witnessed a drug smuggler illegally entering our country, bringing a million dollars worth of drugs. 
   They order the perpetrator to stop, he doesn't, the agents pursue the suspect, a scuffle ensues and shots are fired. Mr. Speaker, a different kind of environment exists on our Nation's border in the fight against drug smugglers, human traffickers, and terrorists. These two border agents, Ramos and Compean entered the Border Patrol and were trained with the sole duty of protecting Americans, you and me, and the sovereignty of this country. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, these agents were not commended for their actions in preventing what turned out to be 700 pounds of marijuana from reaching the streets of America. No, they were prosecuted for it, convicted, and now sit in Federal prison for a decade for doing what they felt like was the right thing to do. 
   Our Federal Government made a deal with the drug smuggler, a back-room deal and let him loose to go after the border agents. No wonder there is low morale. You see, it is a violation of Border Patrol regulations to go after someone who is fleeing. The Border Patrol pursuit policy is unrealistic by prohibiting the pursuit of someone. This is ridiculous. 
   Also border agents cannot fire their weapon unless they are fired upon first. This is absurd. Now, some old Texas Ranger once said, No lawman should have to take a bullet before he can use his weapon. When border agents are approached by illegals carrying automatic weapons, they should not have to run away and retreat or be fired at before they stop the intrusion.     
   I guess this rule was conjured up by some bureaucrat up here in Washington, DC that has never been to the southern border, maybe conjured up for some political reasons. 
   Mr. Speaker, when we ask the border agents to protect the lawless and violent southern border, we need to give them clear rules of engagement to prevent the invasion into our Nation. We need to support them, and we need to let them know that Congress will support their actions.

   Mr. POE. ``This Is America. When Ordering, Please Speak English.'' This sign is located in the window of Geno's Restaurant, tourist landmark for the famous Philly cheese steak. 
   Philadelphia's Commission on Human Relations has been ordering its owner, Joe Vento, to take down the sign, however. They have even suggested that he hire Spanish-speaking employees to help communicate. But Joe is not giving in to the bureaucrats. Vento says that Geno's will serve and his staff will help out customers who don't speak English, but the sign is staying. 
   Joe Vento is of Italian descent. His grandparents came from Italy. They were proud of their American citizenship and quickly learned English. But  now the Commission on Human Relations is taking legal action against Vento, charging him with discrimination simply for asking his customers to speak English. 
   No business owner should be forced to hire a whole gauntlet of foreign-speaking translators because of individuals who feel they won't learn our language.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford was a bright, talented and energetic little girl. She lived with her father, Mark, who was a single parent, trying to raise three children. He also lived with her grandparents, Mark's parents, who loved her as much. Jessica was a great kid. Everybody thought the world of her, and she took care of the family just like they took care of her. 
   Mark even moved to Florida to protect his children, thinking they would be safer in south Florida than they were where they lived. That is when the tragedy began. Almost 2 years ago, on the evening of February 23, 2005, the Lunsfords lives were changed forever. 
   Among the shadows of a warm Florida night, there was a perpetrator running loose. He was stalking the Lunsford home, and he was watching 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford for several days. He waited till everyone in the house was asleep, and the outlaw in the middle of the night snuck into the Lunsford home, crept down a darkened hallway, and kidnapped Jessica Lunsford from the safety of her open home in the middle of the night. 
   The search for Jessica, 9-year-old happy girl, went on for several weeks. Hundreds of volunteers were involved. Finally, a neighbor, and repeat sex offender, John Couey, was arrested for her murder. 
   Couey was a registered sex offender, but, of course, he was on the lam. He had run. He had disappeared. Couey confirmed what the police had already suspected against him, and he had kidnapped Jessica. He sexually assaulted her numerous times, and he held her captive for several days. 
   Mr. Speaker, when he was not abusing this little girl, he stuffed her in a closet. Then when he was ready to abuse her again, he would pull her out and have his way with her. 
   When he realized that the sheriff's department was out to get him, knew that he was the culprit, he decided he had to remove the evidence, this little girl. So he tied Jessica Lunsford's hands and feet together with stereo wire. He went out into the yard, he dug a hole, he came back into the house, his own home, put two trash bags over Jessica Lunsford, picked her up and threw her in the hole. Yes, he buried that 9-year-old girl alive. 
   When she was found several days later, she had poked her fingers through the plastic bags seeking the air of freedom, freedom that never came. Couey admitted everything that I just told you to the police, in every detail. 
   But while he was confessing to these horrors he inflicted on Jessica, he asked for a lawyer. Unfortunately, the police ignored his request, and this would cause Couey's confession to be inadmissible as evidence against him. You see, when a defendant asks for a lawyer, he must be given one right away or the statements he makes will not be admissible in court. 
   However, even without this confession, there is a lot of evidence against Couey to prove his guilt. After 2 years and several delays, Couey is standing trial for his evil deeds. Today, John Couey is sitting in a Miami courthouse as jury selection begins. Twelve men and women are being asked to decide his guilt in his crime against this little girl. 
   Jessica has been needing justice for 2 years. Her family has been waiting for 2 years for this justice. As a father of three girls and three granddaughters, I know how important little girls are to a father like Mark Lunsford, and he has lost his little girl. 
   You know, as a society, as a culture, as a Nation, we are never going to be judged by the way we treat the rich, the famous, the powerful, the important folks. We will be judged by the way we treat the weak, the innocent, the elderly, and, yes, the children, the Jessicas of the world. 
   So the State of Florida and this jury need to give John Couey, sex offender, child killer, his day in court. When the evidence is in, hopefully the words of this country song will ring true when it says: ``A man had to answer for the wicked that he done,'' because ``justice is the one thing you should always find. You got to draw a hard line'' in the sand. ``We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds. We've got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets. It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground,'' because justice is the one thing you should always find. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE MODERN STATE OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Nation of Israel has fought for 60 years for the right to exist, and I'm proud to be a cosponsor of H. Con. Res. 322, a measure before the House today. It recognizes the 60th anniversary of Israel's statehood, and reaffirms United States support for Israel as Israel continues to pursue peace with its neighbors and defend itself against constant threats to its security and its existence. 
   Sixty years ago, on May 14, in the aftermath of World War II, the people of Israel declared independence and claimed sovereignty of about 8,000 square miles of land that was between the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, the area about the size of New Jersey. That day was just the beginning of another chapter in Israel's long history of defending its right to exist. 
   Almost immediately after Israel announced independence in 1948, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Saudi Arabia all declared war on Israel, launching Israel's long fight for the mere right to exist. In that war, the newly created State of Israel defeated the Arab armies that invaded it, and even expanded some of its territory. 
   Then again, in 1967, Israel acted once more to defend itself against hostile invasion by its neighbors during the Six Day War. Once again, in 1972, Israel was targeted by Arab armies during the Yom Kippur war. 
   And recently Israel has been attacked in the north by terrorist hate groups Hezbollah, and in the south by Hamas terrorist group. 
   Also, Israel has been forced to defend itself against Palestinian aggression. And since January 1 of this year, Palestinians have fired more than 450 mortar shells into Israel. This rocket fire has intentionally targeted civilian communities in Israel, and made life for these people a nightmare. But Israel is resilient and continues to fly the flag of freedom. 
   I proudly join my colleagues in commending the people of Israel for building this democratic state in the face of terrorism, hostility, hate and war from their neighbors. 
   Israel and the United States are like family. Sometimes we disagree on things, but when someone attacks part of the family, it's an attack on the whole family. Let there be no mistake about it. The United States stand side by side with its friend, Israel, and with the concept of freedom. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (COLOMBIAN DRUG CARTELS USING SUBMARINES TO BRING COCAINE INTO THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I want to bring to the House's attention a new innovative idea to import drugs into the United States. The drug cartels in South America, specifically in Colombia, continue to figure out ways to import cocaine at a profit into our country. Now they are doing it by sea, and they are using submarines that they make in the jungles where they make the cocaine that they bring into the United States. 
   I have here, Mr. Speaker, a photograph of a submarine. This photograph was taken by the United States Coast Guard as they were on patrol off the coast of Colombia with the United States Navy. This submarine is made out of fiberglass. It is about 100 feet long and it carries approximately $300 million worth of cocaine. It has a crew of five. 
   It is made in such a way that when intercepted by the United States Navy or the United States Coast Guard, they are able to pull certain levers and valves on this submarine and it is junked in the Gulf of Mexico or off the coast of Colombia. They scuttle these ships, because what happens is when they scuttle them, the five man crew jumps off the boat into a lifeboat, and then our United States Navy has to rescue them and save them, but they can't prosecute them for importation of drugs into the United States. 
   These submarines cost the drug cartels about $1 million apiece to manufacture. Intelligence sources tell us  that the drug cartels will bring in approximately 90 more loads of drugs into the United States from Colombia using these submarines the rest of this calendar year. 
   They are made in such a way that they are highly mobile. They go about 14 knots apiece, and they are able to go all the way from Colombia into the United States without refueling. It is a constant problem for our Navy and our United States Coast Guard to track these individuals and to catch them with the cocaine. 
   Only one situation where we, I say we, the United States Navy and the Coast Guard, were able to capture one of these vessels before it was scuttled and prosecute the crew was when they tried to sink it off the coast of Colombia after seeing the United States Navy. But what happened was after they scuttled the submarine, a load of cocaine, a bundle of cocaine, if you will, came to the surface. Once it came to the surface it was confiscated by our Navy. The five member crew was captured and they have been taken to Tampa, Florida, and they are on trial for importation of narcotics into the United States. 
   I bring this to the House's attention, Mr. Speaker, because of the fact that Congress needs to deal with this issue. These submarines carry no flag. They are not registered to any nation or foreign government. The crew members come from all over the world, mostly from Colombia. They claim no citizenship from any nation. And they don't claim, of course, possession of the vessel. 
   So Congress can deal with this issue by making it a Federal offense to use a submarine within international waters that carries no flag, carries no registration of another nation, and if a person is caught operating one of these vessels, they could be prosecuted as if they had drugs. The drug cartels are smart. They know if they can destroy the evidence they can't be prosecuted. We need to make a law that being in possession of this submarine is enough to prosecute them for crimes on the high seas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I might add that these vessels are so manufactured that they are not just able to carry cocaine into the United States worth $300 million, or 12 tons, that is how much cocaine, but that same vessel can go into any of our ports in the United States as a submarine carrying weapons, explosives, weapons of mass destruction, and used as some type of suicide submarine, similar to what was used against the USS Cole some years ago in the Middle East. 
   So the United States Coast Guard and Navy is to be complimented for tracking these vessels and doing everything they can to interdict the individuals that bring that cancer into the United States, and Congress needs to deal with the issue, to have these submarines that are basically at war with the United States bringing in these narcotics, have it be a crime to be in possession as a crew member of one of these vessels. It is things like this where we have to keep constant diligence in fighting the war on drugs. 
   Just to be clear, Mr. Speaker, intelligence tells us that these submarines are made by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. That is the military wing of the Colombian communist party. Of course, that is how they finance their revolution and the revolutionary ideas in South America. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (SAN JACINTO DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, April 21 is known as San Jacinto Day in Texas. In 1836, Texas was in a fight for independence from the dictator of Mexico, Santa Anna. On March 6, 1836, 186 volunteers from all races had fought and died at the Alamo trying to hold off the massive invading armies of Santa Anna. Meanwhile, General Sam Houston was forming an army of Texans and Tejanos--Tejanos were Texans of Mexican descent--to stand and fight the three invading armies of Mexico.  
   Finally, on the swampy, marshy plains of southeast Texas where the San Jacinto River meets Buffalo Bayou, General Sam and the boys took a stand. In broad daylight in midafternoon on April 21, 1836, the volunteers for Texas freedom charged a Mexican army over twice their number. This fierce bunch of frontiersmen from all the States overwhelmingly defeated the invaders. 
   In 18 minutes, Texas had won independence and the largest amount of land in North American history changed hands because of a single battle. 
   Texas remained a free and independent republic for 9 years, electing General Sam as its first president. Then Texas was admitted to the U.S. by just one vote. And the rest, as they say, is Texas history. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, as positive progress continues against America's enemies in Iraq, the vocal, timid and meek here at home promote a strategy of defeat and retreat. Victory to these retreatists is not an option because they plan for abandonment of the Iraqi people and failure for America's fight against those who murder in the name of religion. 
   These war alarmists wish to capitulate in this war. They want to redeploy the troops, which means withdraw our military while they are in the midst of success. This strategy of defeat will not bring peace to Iraq or America. It will not stop the extremists, but increase their determination for more violence against the innocents. It will not make us safe at home, but encourage those who hate us to kill again. And those vile zealots will rightfully claim America doesn't have the stomach to fight for the God-given principles of liberty. 
   President Kennedy told the world that America will pay any price, support any friend and oppose any foe to defend liberty. We do not fight for ourselves alone. This war is more than for our cause alone. We fight for the human cause of all peoples to be free. That is what this war is about.

   Madam Speaker, Tibet is being denied the basic human rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the freedom to seek grievances against its own government. 
   China, the bully of Asia, literally is beating up on the small religious Tibetan community. China puts down dissent by the use of the bloody club and the firearm. And China suppresses the world press that tries to report on what they are doing by issuing scripted propaganda papers about these peaceful Tibetan people, propaganda that we have not seen since Hitler's Nazi Germany. 
   China's ugly personality of brutality and oppression is now being seen by all of the world. And as China tries to carry the Olympic torch throughout the world, the flame of the torch is setting peoples in this world on fire in support of the people of Tibet.     
   So China must cease its oppression of its own people or face international rebuke and international condemnation, including condemnation by this body. 
   I support the people of Tibet, and I urge passage of this resolution. And I want to thank the chairman for bringing this resolution so quickly to the House floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (RAPE OF A LITTLE GIRL -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, in the early morning hours of March 2, 1998, 10 years ago, Patrick Kennedy of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, called 911 to report that his 8-year-old stepdaughter had been dragged from her garage to the side yard and raped by two neighborhood boys. Kennedy told the 911 operator that he saw one of the boys riding away from the house on a bicycle, so a sheriff's deputy that was immediately in the area responded to the complaint and started looking for the culprit, but he did not find the individual. 
   The deputy noticed that the crime scene in the backyard was somehow inconsistent with rape, and he noticed that the dog was still sleeping undisturbed in the grass. Be that as it may, Kennedy led the deputy to the victim, his stepdaughter's bedroom, where she was lying on the bed wearing a T-shirt and wrapped in a filthy, bloody cargo blanket. 
   Kennedy informed the deputy that he had carried his stepdaughter like an infant from the yard and placed her in a bathtub to clean her. But the deputy noticed there was no blood on Kennedy's clothes. 
   When the deputy tried to question the victim, Kennedy constantly interrupted and answered the questions for his stepdaughter. The victim said that she was trying to sell Girl Scout cookies when the two neighborhood boys dragged her from the garage and raped her on the grass nearby. 
   The victim was taken to Children's Hospital for emergency surgery to repair serious injuries to her body. At the hospital, the victim told hospital personnel and a psychologist that the two neighborhood boys had raped her, but she finally told a family member that Patrick Kennedy, her stepfather, had assaulted her. 
   The investigation began to focus on Kennedy because his story did not make any sense to the investigators. And then the police learned more about Patrick Kennedy and who he was. Before he called 911, Kennedy called his boss at a local moving company to say he wasn't going to work that morning and he asked a co-worker how to get blood out of a carpet. The co-worker later indicated at trial that Kennedy sounded nervous, and he said his stepdaughter had ``just become a young lady.'' 
   Kennedy also called B&B Carpet Cleaning at 7:30, 2 hours before the 911 call, and he asked how to clean and remove blood stains from a carpet. Police then found a 1-gallon jug of carpet cleaner and the bloody towels Kennedy used to clean up his crime and hide the evidence. 
   A forensic lab confirmed that the victim had no grass or soil stains on her clothes so she could not have been assaulted in the grass. The victim later told her mother that Kennedy had raped her. At the trial, she testified that when she woke up that morning, he was on top of her, covering her eyes with his hands, and that he raped her in her own bed. The victim said she fainted and later threw up. 
   A jury convicted Patrick Kennedy of aggravated rape of his own 8-year-old stepdaughter and sentenced him to death in Louisiana. Under Louisiana law, a person who commits sexual assault of a child under the age of 12 is subject to the death penalty. Kennedy has appealed to the Supreme Court, and next week in Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court will hear the case and decide if rape of a child is constitutional under the eighth amendment and whether it violates the cruel and unusual punishment provision of the eighth amendment. 
   No one has been executed in the United States for a crime other than murder since 1964. Of 3,000 inmates on death row, only two face the death penalty for nonhomicide, and one is Patrick Kennedy. 
   In addition to Louisiana, Georgia, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas have laws allowing death penalty for rape of a child. In 1977, the Supreme Court decided that the death sentence for rape of an adult woman was unconstitutional, but they never ruled on the issue of sexual assault and rape of a child. Thus, this case appears before the Supreme Court. 
   Louisiana has interpreted the Supreme Court's previous rulings not to apply in Louisiana because the sexual assault was of a child and that is why this case appears before the Supreme Court to make this decision. 
   Madam Speaker, this crime is senseless. We can sometimes understand why people commit the crime of theft, we can understand why sometimes people commit the crime of burglary, and even sometimes commit the crime of murder, but there can never be a time in our culture when we understand why a person rapes an 8-year-old girl. It is the ultimate crime of degradation. It is the ultimate type of torture, and it is the ultimate crime against little girls and their identity. It is worse than murder. And in this instance, the victim has a daily reminder of the crime that has ruined her life. It is an attempt to destroy not the life but the soul of this victim. So justice must be pronounced in this case. Society will be judged and the Supreme Court will be judged by the way it treats the innocent among us. Hopefully this case will be upheld by the Supreme Court. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   There was one problem with coming home, however. Her possessive ex-boyfriend Timothy Shepherd would not leave her alone. Tynesha knew that he would contact her, even though she had repeatedly told him she wanted to move on. He and his male ego refused to accept this. 
   On March 15, Tynesha made one final attempt to cut the ties with this harasser. She told him that she was seeing someone else and that it was over. Shepherd decided if he could not have her, no one would, and he strangled this young college student. 
   This was not the end of his barbaric acts. He needed to get rid of her body, so he dismembered Tynesha and then he barbecued her on his apartment patio grill. The burning of her body took 2 full days. Shepherd did all this to the person he claimed he loved. 
   Timothy Shepherd has been charged with murder for his grisly crimes. The people of Texas will properly decide what to do with this barbecue killer.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, a government spokesman has said people from poor countries are taking jobs and giving nothing back to the country. But the government spokesman was not from the United States, but Russia. 
   Under a new Russian crackdown on illegal immigration, illegals are being ordered out of the country and employers who hire them are being prosecuted. Russia is also securing its visa program against fraud. All of these actions are working. The illegals are leaving the country by the thousands. No massive deportation is needed, no amnesty or path to citizenship. 
   Similar to the United States, millions of illegals are crossing Russian borders. They take government resources from legal citizens. The Russian Government, however, unlike the U.S. Government, isn't giving in to those who want cheap plantation labor. The Russian Government doesn't care if illegals or businesses don't like the new rules. 
   Russia is enforcing border security by prosecuting illegals and those that hire them. The U.S. Government could learn something from Russia. Prosecute businesses that knowingly hire illegals, and illegals will leave. Russia has proven it. But does America have the moral will to do the same? We shall see.

   On January 5 of this year, Thurber had enough of being ignored by Jodi. He kidnapped her; he drove her to a remote, lonely, desolate area in the county. He raped her; he strangled her to death. He covered up his dastardly murder by hiding her body in the remoteness of the woods and he dumped her car in the lake. Jodi died, and the last person on Earth she saw was not her family, but the town stalker. 
   Mr. Speaker, nearly 1.4 million people are stalked each year, and most of them women. Intimidating a woman by following her around and showing up outside her home, work, and school is not romantic, it is a perverted crime. Hopefully the good people of Kansas will put this stalker in the ground.

   One of the vicious violent drug cartels, the Zetas, made up of former Mexican military officers, are targeting journalists who report on their drug activities. Now these dope dealing thugs claim they will just come to the United States, because of our porous borders, and kill these journalists.  
   The United States should heed the warnings reported by these courageous journalists, that these drug cartels are easily criss-crossing the Texas-Mexico border and bringing more drug violence to America and Mexico.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS OPERATE MARIJUANA PLANTATIONS IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, earlier today I addressed this House and discussed how the Zetas drug cartel in Mexico has made it known it will hunt down journalists that report on the violent drug cartels in Mexico. This group of former Mexican military officers reportedly will track these reporters down even when they flee to the United States for safety. All of this because these journalists publish reports on the violent cross-border drug trade. 
   Tonight, I wish to discuss how these same outlaw Mexican drug cartels are operating marijuana plantations on public lands, not public lands in Mexico, but on public lands in the United States.  
   According to news reports, these plant plantations are in California, Arizona, Hawaii, West Virginia, Oregon, Tennessee and Kentucky, and account for 80 to 90 percent of all marijuana plantation production in the United States. 
   Law enforcement officials say that the drug cartels employ heavily armed bandits to guard these fields and they have superior fire power and surveillance equipment over American law enforcement agents. 
   The drug thugs destroy native vegetation and kill off all of the wildlife on the land so they can plant their marijuana crops. The cartels also use dangerous pesticides and fertilizers on the land that destroy the environment. Insultingly, all of this is occurring on American Federal lands. 
   There is more. The Washington Times reports today that ``campers, fishermen, hikers and forest and park officials are being intimidated, threatened or assaulted when they come near Mexican-run marijuana'' plantations on American soil, and that ``all this plant growing produces a street value of $6.7 billion.'' 
   The Union newspaper from Nevada states, ``These American marijuana gardens are guarded by Mexican nationals, and the traffickers use the profits from pot sales to finance large methamphetamine labs in Mexico and the United States.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it seems that no public land is safe. Even California's Sequoia National Forest has been attacked by these drug cartels. The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, John Walters, said, ``Mexican drug cartels are turning our national parks into centers of international drug production and trafficking. Public lands are being held hostage by illegal drug traffickers.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, numerous law enforcement personnel, State, local and Federal, are attempting to retake our Federal and public lands from these drug cartel invaders. Some progress is reported, but the battle for our land goes forward. 
   We cannot allow these land grabbing, environmentally hazardous drug terrorists to seize America's national forests and national parks. These outlaws cannot be allowed to camp in our parks and swim in the profits from marijuana plantations. They should be tracked down, arrested, prosecuted, and put in jail. 
   We need to seize all their money from whatever financial institutions they try to hide it in and use the money to restore our national parks, the way they were before the drug invaders arrived. 
   We need to make it more difficult for them to operate here by actually securing the southern border, something that Homeland Security has yet to accomplish. Right now, security along our southern border is a glittering illusion. 
   Our national parks and forests are worth fighting for, and rather than journalists, campers, fishermen, hunters, and park rangers being afraid of these drug cartels like the Zetas, these outlaw drug gangs should be afraid of our relentless determination to take our land back. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentlelady from California for yielding, and I want to thank Ms. Matsui and her brave constituent, Laurie Dishman, for bringing this very important issue before Congress. 
   Every year 10 million American citizens board cruise ships and sail from American ports. These cruise ships are floating cities. But unlike cities, there are no peace officers or properly trained security personnel to protect passengers on board these ships. There is really no oversight or accountability for the cruise industry to properly or timely report secret crimes that occur on ships. 
   Our amendment just requires the Coast Guard to publicly maintain and regularly update a numerical accounting of crimes and number of missing persons on each ship. This is commonsense. We value information on college campuses, and this Congress under the Cleary Act requires reporting of crimes on college campuses. But when there is a crime on the high sea, it is a public relations cover-up because of the travel industry. 
   This amendment will create a better-informed passenger and, of course, safer cruise ships.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is a photograph regarding the amendment we will talk about this morning. These are mini-submarines. They are currently being made in the jungles of Colombia, alongside much of the drugs that they carry, probably from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia which is the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party. 
   These vessels are made out of fiberglass. They are about 100-feet long. They carry a crew of five and up to 13 tons of drugs with a street value of about $300 million. They travel about 14 miles per hour, and they are barely below the surface. They are constructed to remain below the surface of the water, making them difficult for the U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard to track. And they can travel all of the way from the north coast of South America to the southeastern United States without refueling. 
   These vessels that the Coast Guard are encountering are stateless vessels with no legitimate use. They are built for stealth and the capability to rapidly scuttle the illicit drugs they are carrying. 
   What happens is when the United States Coast Guard or the Navy comes upon one of these vessels, the crew scuttles the ship, it sinks, and all of the contraband sinks to the bottom of the ocean. The only one prosecution that has taken place, reflected here on the bottom, occurred when a bale of cocaine floated back to the surface. The five crewmen are now being prosecuted in Tampa, Florida. And let me mention that these vessels can not only be used for drugs, they can bring explosives into the United States. They come up our waterways. They can attack crude ships, ships that are bringing in oil tankers, our military ships like the U.S.S. Cole, or even cruise ships, as we mentioned earlier. 
   This amendment would simply state the findings of Congress that these stateless vehicles have no legitimate use on international waters, and the crew that is operating one of these is committing a Federal crime. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Canada is the largest crude oil supplier to the United States. About half of that crude is derived from what is called oil sands. Also, the military wants to buy Canadian ``unconventional fuels'' instead of buying fuel from rogue dictators. The Air Force wants to use Canadian ``coal to liquid fuel'' and turn it into jet fuel. 
   But the nonenergy bill passed by Congress prohibits such purchases because of absurd environmental restrictions. 
   Now, not only is it harder for Americans to obtain affordable gasoline, our military is at risk of having a fuel shortage to carry out its mission in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   This Nation is at war. Our troops need fuel. The latest congressional attempt to hurt the military as a way of appeasing environmental fear mongers could result in what happened to General George Patton in World War II. On August 31, 1944, General Patton was charging toward Germany and just outside of Metz, France, his tanks ran out of gas because bureaucrats here in the United States denied him fuel. 
   So unless Congress acts, our troops may be charging into battle riding cavalry horses, while our tanks and planes rust and gather dust because they are out of gas. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (TIME FOR A DIVORCE FROM CORN-BASED ETHANOL -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Congress has a love affair with corn-based ethanol, and that love affair, Mr. Speaker, is on the rocks. 
   Ethanol has led to increased food prices, food shortages, and more pollution and less energy. As we have increased our reliance on ethanol, food supplies and prices have soared and have led to a global food shortage as customers stock up before stores run out. Shortages have led to food riots in Egypt, Haiti and other nations. There is an international shortage of basic commodities such as rice and wheat, and this has resulted in protests and riots. 
   American consumers are reactionary. They read about the international shortage and the riots and they run to the store to buy more food, stocking up. Yesterday, Wal-Mart and Costco announced they were limiting purchases of rice. You can only buy four bags of rice on any one trip at Wal-Mart. 
   Mr. Speaker, who would have thought that in the United States we would start having food rationing? 
   Also, because of inflation of the prices of corn-based ethanol, other food products are going up. Prices on beer, bread, coffee, pizza and rice are dramatically increasing. Anything that has a corn-based product has also increased in price. 
   In Mexico, cornmeal prices are up 60 percent. In Pakistan, flour prices have doubled. And even China is having a food inflation problem. In America, the cost of all groceries is skyrocketing. The shortage of staple food has larger consequences for our country, and, of course, it adds to inflation. 
   Also, we are now finding out that corn-based ethanol contributes to global warming. In March, Science Magazine reported that ``Using good cropland to expand biofuels increases global warming.'' 
   Under Congress' ethanol mandates, farmers must plow more land to grow enough corn to use in our vehicles. This releases carbon stored in plants and in the soil. And Science Magazine continues to say that corn-based ethanol will increase greenhouse gasses by 93 percent in 30 years. 
   Ethanol also pollutes. Factories that convert corn into ethanol release carbon monoxide, methanol and some carcinogens at a very high level. The science that predicted less CO  
   2 from corn ethanol is now being questioned as junk science. 
   Ethanol pollution has also contributed to the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. What that is, Mr. Speaker, is the water that runs down into the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the Mississippi, because of the pollutants in that water, it causes a dead zone about the size of New Jersey where nothing lives and nothing grows. 
   As Congress continues to subsidize corn-based ethanol, farmers are using more and more fertilizer to plant corn, and thus more fertilizer runs into the Mississippi River, down the river to the Gulf of Mexico, and the dead zone continues to grow. 
   You see, we don't eat corn anymore. We burn it in our cars. Farmers planting more corn only increase the dead zone problem. So now we are having a problem with food production that comes from the sea, from the Gulf of Mexico, all because of corn-based ethanol. 
   And, of course, ethanol hurts other industries. While grain producers have benefited from ethanol mandates because of record profits, some other industries are hurting. The losers are livestock farmers and ranchers, who have lost about $30 more an animal since the fall.     
   In other words, corn prices going up cost more to feed their beef, and then beef prices continue to go up as well. And we pay. The consumer always pays. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to rethink its love affair with ethanol. We need to lift the offshore drilling prohibition against drilling for crude oil and for natural gas. We need to develop our own natural resources. We need to allow permits for clean coal production. We need to use safe nuclear energy. And, we need to get back to eating corn instead of burning it in our vehicles. It is time for us to get a divorce from corn-based ethanol. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Mexican illegals looking to breach entry into the United States are receiving encouraging help from their own government. In the past, the Mexican government has provided pamphlets to illegals on how to sneak into the United States. Now the Mexican government has announced it is going high tech. The government will provide illegals with GPS tracking devices, allowing them to call on the U.S. Cavalry, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, if they get lost among the treacherous rivers and deserts lining the U.S.-Mexico border. 
   By passing out GPS devices free of charge, Mexico wants the U.S. to rescue illegals that are in trouble on American soil and provide them free medical attention but supposedly let them still stay in the United States. Instead of discouraging Mexican citizens from illegally entering America,  Mexico is asking the U.S. to cooperate, ignore the invasion and then provide aid to stranded illegals. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is absurd. Our Federal Government's loyalties lie with the American people, not with illegals that are colonizing America. The U.S. must stand firm against the Mexican government's unlawful, illegal invasion into our homeland.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (TRIBUTE TO SPECIALIST DUSTIN R. DONICA, TEXAS WARRIOR -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, General Douglas MacArthur said: ``A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. He does not set out to be a leader, but becomes one by the quality of his actions and the integrity of his intent.'' 
   Tonight, I want to talk about that kind of leader, Army Specialist Dustin Ross Donica, 3rd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Airborne Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division of Fort Richardson, Alaska. 
   Dustin grew up in Spring, Texas, outside of Houston. His nickname was Double D. He enjoyed teasing his sister, Courtney. He loved to joke around with his family and his friends, and he was known by many for his unique sense of humor. He was very, very close to his family. 
   He was especially close to his only sister, with whom he shared an unbreakable bond. They were called the ``Irish Twins,'' born 1 year apart. The two often told others they were actually twins. 
   Dustin always described himself as a modest person, although looking at his life, this modest son of Texas accomplished extraordinary accomplishments. Even at a young age, he was known as the hero who grew up down the street. That was because of his attitude about service and about loyalty. 
   In 2003, the Klein High School graduate left the University of Texas and enlisted in the United States Army. 
   When Dustin was asked about joining the Army, he said, ``I've grown up in a very privileged area. When most people of my generation are asked to do something, their first thought is, how will this benefit me? I need to do this so that my first thought is, how does it benefit others.'' 
   No wonder people said Dustin had a sense of honor and duty, traits that are very rare in our culture. 
   When Dustin was deployed to Iraq, he sent his sister a teddy bear. The teddy bear was wearing an Airborne uniform complete with a Donica patch on the pocket. He wanted the bear to serve as a reminder that he was fighting to keep her safe and he was always constantly thinking of her. 
   Mr. Speaker, you know, there's something all-American about a teddy bear. Dustin was constantly concerned for the well-being of his family back home. Even though he was in the combat war zone, all of Dustin's phone conversations with his family ended, ``Remember, I love y'all. Take care. Be safe.'' 
   One of Dustin's last requests was that his parents visit his close friend, Logan. Logan had served also in Iraq, and he was being treated in the United States for his injuries. He was a very close friend of Dustin's, and Dustin asked that his parents provide Logan comfort by visiting him in the hospital in the United States. 
   But on December 28, 2006, at the dynamic age of 22, Double D., Dustin Donica was killed in Iraq, conducting combat operations against the anti-Iraqi forces in the city of Karmah in the Al Anbar Province. 
   As in many other times in his life, Dustin was standing guard, protecting his fellow soldiers in arms when he received his fatal injuries. 
   Now, the media has taken it upon themselves to assign a number to this patriot. Dustin's legacy is more than just a number. He was an American fighting man. He was the only son of the Donica family. He was totally committed to America. He was not a media number. And Dustin Donica's name was the example of bravery, courage and duty. 
   Dustin, like those who came before him, stopped at nothing to defend freedom. Our American duty, the duty for all of us that are left behind, is to honor America's sons, like Dustin Donica. In the words of President Calvin Coolidge, ``The Nation which forgets its defenders ..... it too will be forgotten.'' 
   Dustin was a man who loved life, family and country. His parents, David and Judy Donica said, ``We loved Dustin. He will be missed by us and those that knew him.'' 
   This is a photograph of Dustin Donica, Mr. Speaker. And yesterday Dustin was laid to rest with full military honors in Klein Memorial Park Cemetery in Texas. 
   These words from one of Dustin's favorite songs, ``American Soldier'' by Toby Keith, describe the commitment of courageous men like Dustin who we are proud of, men who are proud to wear the uniform of the United States soldier. It goes like this, Mr. Speaker: ``An American soldier, an American, beside my brothers and sisters, I will proudly take a stand. When liberty is in jeopardy, I will always do what's right. I am out here on the front line. So sleep well tonight. Sleep in peace, America, because I'm an American soldier.'' 
   These young Americans like Dustin are a rare breed, Mr. Speaker. They are the American breed, and we thank them and their families. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (SECOND VERSE SAME AS THE FIRST -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the new, reformed, inclusive, repackaged, politically motivated Senate immigration proposal is more of the same lip service we have heard for years about protecting our borders. 
   In the 1980s, the American public was promised, and Congress passed, legislation that was supposed to beef up the border, reform the troublesome immigration service, and grant amnesty to 3 million people. The result? Our borders are less secure now. The immigration service is overwhelmed with mismanagement and lack of resources. But that amnesty deal, it did happen. Now 20 years later, the amnesty gift has only increased illegal entry, not slowed it down. We now have 12- to 20 million people here without permission. 
   Why doesn't the Federal Government enforce the existing law and secure the border? Because the Federal Government doesn't have the moral will to enforce current law, and if Congress tries to pass a similar bill like the 1980s: we will get more of the same: lax border security and an immigration service that is in confusion. But we'll sure let those illegals stay in America. It's another case of second verse, same as the first. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Skelton for sponsoring this legislation, and I appreciate Mr. Wilson yielding me time to speak on this important individual. 
   It is true in this House of Representatives, what we call the People's House, there are only two portraits. There could be more, but there are only two. We honor George Washington and we honor Lafayette. And there are reasons for that; because both of these men were not only friends, but they were resilient in their quest for American liberty many, many years ago. 
   One evening in 1776, at the dinner table with King George III's relatives, the Marquis de Lafayette got wind of America's Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson and the trouble the colonists were making for the British--all in the name of liberty. 
   Facing disapproval from his Noble family and arrest by his own French people, young Lafayette sailed to America. He volunteered to serve at his own expense in the Continental Army with General George Washington. Lafayette was a superior military tactician, and he was fearless. Only in his late 20s, Major General Lafayette went to war with the American colonists. 
   He was wounded in the battle at Brandywine, he defeated the Hessians alongside General Greene at Gloucester Point, and he stayed faithful to Washington when even some American discontented generals thought they could do a better job than George Washington.  
   It was Lafayette who persuaded the French to help the Americans in their fight for freedom. And Lafayette never lost his place alongside Washington and his ragged Continental Army. That is one reason we have his portrait in this House. 
   Lafayette remained a passionate advocate for the cause of freedom until his death, and stood firm in the French Revolution. So much so that at one point he suffered imprisonment for 5 years in Austria and Prussia because of his quest for liberty in France. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor a man who paid both blood and money on two continents for the sake of liberty. As loyal as he remained to Washington and the United States throughout his life, so the people of our great Nation remain indebted to his sacrifice, his courage and his loyalty, and to the example of his unwavering commitment to freedom. 
   In troubled times, America could always count on Marquis de Lafayette.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Memorial Day will soon be upon us. Eighteen soldiers from southeast Texas and troops have given their lives in Iraq. These are their photographs over here to my left, all 18 of them. These are the names of those warriors, the roll call of the fallen: 
   Staff Sergeant Russell Slay, United States Marine Corps, age 34. He was killed on November 9, 2004. He is from Humble, Texas. When Russell told his mother he was joining the Marine Corps after high school, he told her that he knew she would not like it, but he joined anyway to serve his country. 
   Lance Corporal Wesley Canning, United States Marine Corps, age 21, killed November 10, 2004. He is from Friendswood, Texas. He always wanted to be a marine and had the ambition to serve for 20 years. He was a proud Texan, and when he was home on leave, he bought a new pickup truck so he could show his marine buddies his ``Don't Mess with Texas'' bumper sticker. 
   Lance Corporal Fred Lee Maciel, United States Marine Corps, age 20, killed January 26, 2005. He was from Spring, Texas. He was killed in a helicopter crash in al-Anbar province on his way to begin security preparations for the historic Iraqi elections. Four days later I was in Iraq to witness those successful elections. Lance Corporal Maciel made them possible. 
   Private First Class Wesley Riggs, United States Army, age 19, killed May 17, 2005, from Baytown/Beach City, Texas. He graduated in just 3 years from high school, and he loved agriculture. 
   Sergeant Bill Meeuwsen, United States Army, age 24, killed November 23, 2005, from Kingwood, Texas. He went to Texas A&M, but he dropped out of school and enlisted in the Army as a result of 9/11. 
   Lance Corporal Robert Martinez, United States Marine Corps, age 20, killed December 1, 2005, from Cleveland, Texas. He dreamed of getting a degree in education and becoming a baseball coach after his career in the Marines was over. Today, there is a post office in Cleveland, Texas, named in his honor. 
   Staff Sergeant Michael Durbin, United States Army, age 27, killed January 25, 2006, from Houston, Texas. He was a gifted artist. The day he was killed, he called his wife to tell her that he loved her. 
   Tech Sergeant Walter Moss, Jr., United States Air Force, age 37, killed on March 30, 2006, from Houston, Texas. He joined the Air Force after high school, and he served in Operation Desert Storm. He specialized in detecting and defusing makeshift bombs. He was killed while defusing an IED. 
   Private First Class Kristian Menchaca, United States Army, age 23, killed June 16, 2006, from Houston, Texas. When he joined the Army, Kristian wanted to become an infantryman. Kristian's wife stated that being in the military was what he always wanted to do. He was kidnapped and murdered by enemy forces. 
   Staff Sergeant Ben Williams, United States Marine Corps, age 30, killed June 20, 2006, from Orange, Texas. He joined right after high school, and he served his country for 12 years and was on his third duty in Iraq when he was killed. 
   Lance Corporal Ryan Miller, United States Marine Corps, age 19, killed September 14, 2006, from Pearland, Texas. He was a third-generation marine, and he graduated early so he could enlist and follow his father's and grandfather's footsteps. After his tour of duty was over, he wanted to become a Houston police officer, just like his mom and dad. 
   Staff Sergeant Edward Reynolds, Jr., United States Army, age 27, killed September 26, 2006, from Port Arthur, Texas. He was looking forward to his New Year's Eve wedding date with his new fiancee, and he was the man that pushed his friends to succeed. 
   Captain David Fraser, United States Army, age 25, killed November 26, 2006, from Spring, Texas. He attended West Point Military Academy, where he graduated as the top student in civil engineering. 
   Lieutenant Corporal Luke Yepsen, United States Marine Corps, age 20, killed September 14, 2006, from Kingwood, Texas. He attended Texas A&M after high school, but he dropped out to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. 
   Specialist Dustin Donica, United States Army, age 22, December 28, 2006, from Spring, Texas. When he was asked why he joined the United States Army, he said, ``Most people my generation want something for them, but I want to give something back.'' 
   Specialist Ryan Berg, United States Army, age 19, killed January 9, 2007, from Sabine Pass, Texas. He joined the Army on his 18th birthday, and he was the first soldier from Sabine Pass killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Staff Sergeant Terrance Dunn, United States Army, age 38, killed February 2, 2007, from Atascocita, Texas. He enlisted in the Army several years after high school, and to his fellow soldiers he was known as ``Dunnaman,'' because he could get anything done. 
   And lastly, Mr. Speaker, Lance Corporal Anthony Aguirre, United States Marine Corps, age 20, killed February 22, 2007, from Channelview, Texas. He entered the Marines because it was the toughest branch in the military. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are the few, the bold, the brave, the courageous, the Americans. These are the sons of southeast Texas who have fallen in battle for their country. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the next sound you hear will be the rumble of thousands of Mexican trucks streaming across our southern border. The U.S. Government has agreed to allow 100 Mexican trucking companies to send trucks on the highways and byways of America. Presently, Mexican trucks may only go 20 miles inside the U.S. border. The U.S. Government says they will inspect the trucks for safety and inspect the drivers as well. Yeah, right. There are already 6,000 trucks a day crossing in each direction just between Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico; and only a fraction of these are inspected. 
   This country has no way of inspecting each and every Mexican truck for safety, and there is no telling what could be in them, whether it is legitimate cargo, narcotics or contaminated food. Not to mention, Mexican trucks are not up to the standards of the U.S. trucking industry. Overweight, polluting Mexican trucks driven by low paid, unqualified drivers that may not even be able to read highway signs is a dangerous policy for the citizens of this country. 
   Once again, our government seems to be more concerned about Mexico than it is about our Nation, our highways or our people.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (BORDER WARS -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, I come to you today to discuss what is going on internationally with our country. You know, this country is at war in Iraq. We have been for a number of years. This country is at war in Afghanistan, and we have been for a number of years. 
   While the news from the front is encouraging, both of those wars are not over with yet. And it is interesting to me that even though we are sending our troops, our young men and women, the finest America has to offer, halfway around the globe to protect the dignity of other countries, it concerns me that we fail to protect the security of our own Nation on the southern border of the United States. 
   Because, Madam Speaker, there is a border war going on in the United States on our southern border. Unfortunately, too many people, especially here in Washington, DC are blissfully ignorant of what is taking place on the southern border. You see we have two international borders. We have one with Mexico and we have one with Canada. The number one duty of government is to protect the people, to protect America from all incursions, all invasions. 
   So we send our troops halfway around the world to protect the interest of the United States in Iraq, protect the interest of the United States in Afghanistan, and I agree with what we are doing in Afghanistan and Iraq. But we also need to be concerned about what is taking place closer to our homeland, and that is the border wars that are taking place. 
   Why I say that is I have been down, while I have been in Congress these 3 1/2 years, I have been down to the Texas-Mexico border now 13 times. I have also been to the border between California and Mexico. 
   Madam Speaker, each time I go to the border I see more evidence that we are not winning the border war, that it is more difficult, it is harder on our troops down there, the sheriffs, the border agents. It is harder on the people who live on the border between the United States and Mexico. Many ranchers and people who live along the Rio Grande River on the American side have bars on their windows because they are afraid of people who come across from the southern part of the United States committing crimes. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to make it clear I am not talking about everyone that comes to the United States is here to commit a crime. I am not saying that. I am saying when we fail to enforce the rule of law, that being you don't come to America without permission, that we get everybody. We get the good, we get the bad, and we get the ugly. Right now, Madam Speaker, we are getting a lot of bad and we are getting a lot of ugly. 
   Let me give one example of those people who come in and flaunt the law of the United States that you don't come here without permission. I have here a night shot taken, and I am not sure that it can be seen, but I will hold it up anyway. This top photograph is a night scene of the bottom photograph. This is a photograph on the bottom of the Rio Grande River near Laredo, Texas. Across the river is Mexico. This is the nighttime version of that. 
   What we see here is a raft with several individuals coming to America without permission. They are all dressed in black uniforms. You notice the guy in the front has an AK-47. That is an automatic weapon made in China. You also see, Madam Speaker, that behind each of these individuals coming in the raft are duffle bags. In those duffle bags are presumably drugs, narcotics, cocaine or heroin or both. 
   These individuals are foreign nationals. What happened was these individuals were Guatemalan soldiers trained in the United States. Once they went back home, they started working for the drug cartels that paid them a whole lot more money than being Guatemalan soldiers. They switched sides, and now they smuggle drugs into the United States on behalf of the drug cartels. The individuals, you know, are the bad, and they are the ugly. The reason is the border is not secure. If the border was secure, these outlaws wouldn't be coming over here without permission. 
   That is just one example of what is taking place on the southern border of the United States. 
   Madam Speaker, there are three, some argue four major drug cartels in Mexico that bring that cancer into the United States and sell it. Right now those drug cartels work with the coyotes. We call those people ``coyotes'' because they, for money, smuggle people into the United States. And the drug cartels and the coyotes now work together smuggling drugs and people sometimes in the same load. 
   In other words, when our Border Patrol stops a vehicle sneaking into the United States, they will find 
   not only  illegals, but they will find drugs as well because it is a highly lucrative business to do both of those things, smuggle in the name of that filthy lucre; we call it money. 
   I would like to talk this evening about some basic things that are taking place on the border, that silent forgotten border war that is taking place in America. 
   There are several places in the United States that border Mexico and border Canada that we call legal ports of entry. Those legal ports of entry are where people come to the United States the right way, the legal way, the way they are supposed to come into the United States. 
   Now if you are from Mexico or Canada or the Caribbean islands, you get a break in coming to the United States that other foreign nationals don't have. If you are from Brazil or Chile or Guatemala or Germany, the only way you come to the United States legally is with a passport. We have all seen passports. That is the universal, worldwide document of legal entry into another country. 
   But if you are from Mexico, Canada or the Caribbean island, you can come in using almost any type of document. There are now about 8,000 different documents that those people from those countries can use to get into the United States, including everything from a baptismal certificate to some type of other document like a passport. 
   So when these people come to the border, let's say Laredo, and they are lined up to come into the United States, the border agent that is standing on the international border letting people in sometimes doesn't even check the documents. How do you know that? Because I saw it when I was down there. They look into the car, they make sure that the people or they ask a few questions, and they let those people come into the United States. Sometimes they look at paperwork. Sometimes they don't. But they come into the United States presumably lawfully. 
   But the problem is, Madam Speaker, we do not record who comes into America. Assume everybody in this vehicle is coming into the United States the right way. They have legal documents. They have a visa to come in. The United States Government doesn't record who those people are. We just let them pass on through. We have been doing that for years. So the port of entry is an area where we first need to beef up security because if the person in that vehicle or a pedestrian walking across the border can convince a border agent that they can lawfully come into the country, they are waved on by in many cases; not in every case, but in many cases. 
   When I was in Laredo, Texas, at the lawful port of entry, the border agents there, the agents at the border, were very concerned about talking to me in private because, you see, their supervisor followed me around while I was there and they didn't want to talk to me with that person observing. 
   But one of those persons at the legal port of entry told me something very interesting. He told me that we have been told that we are a port of entry, not a port of denial; and when in doubt, we let them in because that is the policy we have been given. It looked to me like that was the policy. 
   So, Madam Speaker, the first thing we do is the basics: We secure the legal ports of entry, and not by allowing one of 8,000 documents to come into the United States, but we need to follow the 9/11 Commission that recommended that anybody entering America should have a passport. But yet here we are in 2008, almost 6 1/2 years since 9/11, and yet we still don't use that universal document of a passport to require entry into this country. 
   My question is: Why not? And the reason is because of political pressure, political agendas by people here in the United States and abroad to prevent that from happening. 
   So let's assume that people have to use a passport and that passport that we have now has all types of electronic coding barcodes in it. And when those people come across in that vehicle, rather than just look in the car or examine a few documents that may or may not be forgeries, everybody's passport could be taken, you scan it across the scanner, the border agent at the border automatically sees on the screen whether anybody has a criminal record, gets their real name, we record who comes into the United States, and therefore we have a permanent record of those individuals. And he then returns the passport. That is the simplest, the most secure way to ensure that people are not fraudulently walking through the ports of entry and trying to get into the United States. 
   Madam Speaker, if I send a package somewhere in the world, let's say I send it to Russia and I send it by Federal Express, like in the movie with Tom Hanks, and it goes to Russia, well, you can actually use on the Internet, I can since I am sending the package, whether it's UPS or Federal Express, I can track where my package is going. I can see where it is going because every time it makes a stop, it is recorded. It is tracked all the way to Russia, and I can find out when it gets there. 
   Now if we are smart enough to devise a system like that to track packages, why don't we track people who come into the United States when they have permission to come here? I don't know. We just don't do it. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I recommend that we follow the 9/11 Commission and require every person who enters the United States, or leaves the United States, to have a passport. When I say leave it, when those individuals come here lawfully, we now know that 50 percent, almost 60 percent of people legally coming to the United States, they never go home. They just stay. The reason they stay is because who would want to leave America? More importantly, they know that the odds of them being tracked down, so to speak, and told to go home are almost none. I will get to that in a minute. 
   So you have a passport. Let's say this person is a guest worker. We hear we need more guest workers and we don't have guest workers. Madam Speaker, we bring in 1.2 million guest workers a year to work in this country. So we have guest workers. Whether we need more or not is another issue, but we do have guest workers. But when a guest worker comes in, make them have the passport and then make them have a bona fide visa that we can also stand. Right now when an individual shows up for a job the way the employer checks the legality of an individual is calling on the telephone a 1-800 number to the Social Security Administration to make sure that this guy has a Social Security number. That is ridiculous. 
   Social Security numbers were never meant to be an identification system. Social Security was set up so some of us, hopefully some of us, will be able some day to get some type of retirement. It has nothing to do with security and identification of people coming into the country. So we shouldn't use that system. 
   The employer should have the bona fide visa hard copy and able to keep it until that 6 or 8 months is over for that guest worker, and then that person needs to go back home. They have it recorded who the legal immigrant is working for. That is the fairest way, the simplest way, but we don't do that. 
   Now the Federal Government is talking about using another type of identification for people coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico.     
   Why do we do that? Why don't we just require everybody to have a passport? It makes no sense to me. 
   Madam Speaker, the second problem we have is that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Administration, good folks, but there's not enough of them. They're understaffed and they're underfunded. They enforce the law once the immigrant, legal immigrant has come into the United States past the 25-mile rule. What I'm saying is this: On the border of Canada and the United States, Mexico and the United States, Border Patrol patrols the first 25 miles trying to capture people who are coming here illegally. After that 25 miles, ICE, as it's called, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, patrols the rest of America trying to capture people that came through the net, broke through the net. And they are enforcing the immigration laws. And there's not enough of them because there's way too many immigrants that have been here for years and have never been confronted about being in the United States illegally, or legally, for that matter, if they're an overstay. So the interior enforcement needs to be restructured. We need to have more enforcement officers enforcing the rule of  law, because that is important for this country. 
   Madam Speaker, of course the people on the other side of the border that make money off of importation of drugs and people, they know all the rules and they know what's going on over here. So what happens is when, let's say, a person contracts with a coyote to come into the United States, they pay several hundred, several thousand dollars to this coyote and the coyote brings them in 30 miles to the United States. The contract is to get them past the Border Patrol. Once you're by the Border Patrol, we'll let you out of the vehicle, you pay us money and you're home free; nobody'll ever catch you. So the other side understands the rules and understands what's happening. So ICE, good folks, I know a lot of them, they just need more help in interior enforcement of the United States. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to mention a little heresy now, because, you see, the reason people come to the United States, many of them, is to work. Some of them come legally, but a lot of them come illegally to work. And it is the law, and has been for years, that if a business knowingly hires a person illegally in the country, then that business can be prosecuted. Now, we don't read about, in the papers, too much about businesses being prosecuted for hiring illegals. Of the thousands and thousands and thousands of businesses in the United States, you know there are several that are hiring illegals, and they know it. But not very often does one of them make the newspaper. We read about everything else, but we don't hear about that. Why not? Because maybe they aren't being prosecuted. So, if the business owner knowingly hires an illegal, then that business owner needs to be prosecuted. And when illegals that are working here don't have the opportunity to work, they'll go back where they came from. They will, because many of them are working here on the cash economy, which means that they are being paid plantation wages, in some cases, not all cases. They're being paid in cash. The employer's dealing in cash because, you see, then nobody pays taxes. Nobody pays the Social Security. Nobody pays to health care, including the business owner. And they're able, that way, to drive the economy down. 
   You know, we hear this about, Oh, they help the economy. That is a farce, and I'll talk about that in a minute. 
   I'll give you an example of how that works, Madam Speaker. I represent southeast Texas. I border Louisiana and northern Houston, and I have a business owner in one of my towns that legally hires legal immigrants to work in his carpet business. And he verifies, he goes through all the procedure to make sure that the dozen or so folks working in his carpet business are legally in the country as guest workers. Good for him. 
   But there's a guy down the street that's also in the carpet business, carpet laying business, tough work, and that person hires illegals. And he pays his illegals less money. And because he pays them less money, he can do the same job cheaper. And so what he's doing is forcing the business owner who does the right thing, hiring foreigners on a legal basis who come to the United States, he's forced him out of business. And the same is true of businesses that hire Americans, because the cheap plantation labor that is being furnished by people who are unscrupulous businessmen is driving the economy down. But they're making money out of it, and so they need to be prosecuted. I know that's heresy, but we need to go after them and prosecute them because it's been the law for a long time. 
   Madam Speaker, we hear about, well, we need illegals in the country to help the economy. If our economy is based upon illegal workers, then there's something wrong with our economy. But be that as it may, we hear that, well, illegals help the economy. And then we hear on the other extreme, no, they don't. They're a tremendous drain on our economy. 
   What is the truth? Well, a study was done by the Heritage Foundation, and they discovered that a head of household that's illegally in the country and has a household contributes in taxes approximately, or to the system, about $10,000 a year. But they also found that that head of household with illegals takes from the system, the government, the Federal Government, State government, local government, about $30,000 a year in benefits, whether it's health care, education, welfare, it takes about 30,000. So yes, they do contribute some to the tax base, but they take far more than they contribute to our economy. And so we need to understand that truism. 
   Madam Speaker, we also have the problem of cities in the United States that flaunt the fact that they are sanctuary cities. What a sanctuary city is is a city, whether negligently or on purpose, allows illegals to live in the city and makes sure that they're never prosecuted. Cities that are sanctuary cities, that harbor illegals, regardless of who those illegals are, whether they're overstays or anybody else, are in violation of Federal law. Those sanctuary cities, in my opinion, should lose Federal aid because the Federal Government, the taxpayers of the United States should not be funding and sending money to cities that allow illegals to stay there without the fear of being prosecuted or deported or sent back home. And it's important that the rule of law be enforced. But we won't go after sanctuary cities as a body. We haven't done that yet. We need to have the will to be able to do that. If cities want to have those sanctuary policies in their homes or in their States, then they shouldn't receive taxpayer money. 
   Also, we should be able to use local law enforcement agents, not to do the job of ICE, but to help ICE. And there's a program Congress established. It's called the 287(g) program. What that means is this: that there is money available for training and for funding of local law enforcement agents, that when they encounter an illegal that has committed maybe a crime and that person is arrested for drunk driving, let's say, that they can do an immigration background check and see whether that person's legally in the United States or not and then hold them for ICE to be deported later. They can work in cooperation with ICE, not go out and arrest folks at work sites, but people that come into their possession because they've committed some other crime. Because, you see, sanctuary cities in many cases won't allow the police officers to even ask the person they arrested, Where are you from? Can't even get that basic identification. 
   So the 287(g) program is a good program. It would allow local law enforcement agencies to help in the cause of protecting the dignity of the United States, when necessary, after they're trained and trained by ICE to, when they arrest someone, if that person's illegally in the country, they can pass that information on to ICE as well. 
   Madam Speaker, I've talked a lot about those people who come here legally. I mentioned a little bit about people who've come here illegally, and I think we need to separate the two and make sure that we understand that there is a difference between those who come the right way and those who come the wrong way. 
   I've been to those immigration ceremonies where people wanted to not just come here to work but wanted to come here to be Americans, stood there, Federal judge, gave them the oath to be a citizen of the United States, how their families were there, how they're teary eyed and proud of the fact that they are now Americans. 
   Wonderful, wonderful events for those people who come here the right way, especially those who want to be citizens. 
   And we've got troops in Iraq and Afghanistan who legally came to the United States but they're not American citizens. And they've gone to Iraq and Afghanistan and are fighting those wars over there in the hope that that will help them become citizens later, and it will help them become citizens if they fight for the United States, and they're not even citizens. Wonderful, wonderful people, those citizens who have become naturalized. 
   But we have a problem with those folks who are not coming here the right way. And everyone that comes here illegally has always got a reason why they won't do it the right way. 
   But I'd like to move on, Madam Speaker, and mention a problem that we have currently with the Border Patrol. The Border Patrol, Madam Speaker, are those wonderful men and women that patrol the border, northern border, the southern border, great people. And I have met so many of them, and  they do the best that we will let them do in enforcing the border. But because Homeland Security, in my opinion, has drawn up the rules of engagement, they tie the hands of the Border Patrol on what they can do to enforce the rule of law. 
   Now, we've got to remember, that the bad guys that are coming into the United States, especially drug dealers, coyotes, they know what the Border Patrol policies are and they flaunt them to their benefit. And so what happens is, in many cases, our Federal Government, when the Border Patrol is down there fighting for the dignity of the United States trying to prevent, let's say, drug dealers from coming into the country, they get in a confrontation with a drug dealer, our government doesn't back them. 
   The best example, of course, is Ramos and Compean, two border agents who now have spent a year in Federal custody. They got 11- and 12-year sentences because they had a confrontation with a drug dealer down on the Texas-Mexico border at the town of Fabens, Texas, and had a confrontation with him. They shot him. They didn't know they'd shot him. He disappears into Mexico. They believe that he had a weapon. The United States Federal Government finds the drug dealer bringing in $750,000 worth of drugs into our country, finds him, says to him, Oh, we're going to give you immunity. We're not going to prosecute you for being a drug smuggler into the United States. All you've got to do is come back to America and testify against the two border agents on a civil rights violation because, you see, they shot at you. They actually hit you, and so we want to prosecute them, says our Federal Government. And our Federal Government spent thousands and thousands of dollars prosecuting those two border agents, and they were convicted. They were sent off to prison. 
   But what the jury in that trial didn't know was when this star witness, the backroom deal witness that the Federal Government made a deal with, you know, made a deal with the devil, to testify against these two border agents, while he's waiting to testify, he slips back into Mexico and brings another load of drugs into the United States, and the jury never heard about that second encounter. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, if you're a juror in a case, and I used to be a judge, and, you know, I never thought using these kind of witnesses helped to find the truth in a case. And this is a perfect example. If you were a juror in the case and the whole Federal Government's case is based upon the testimony of a drug dealer saying that he didn't have a weapon and that these two border agents shot at him anyway, wouldn't you want to know that while he's waiting around to testify he's bringing more drugs into the United States, flaunting the immunity agreement that our government gave him? Sure, you'd want to know and then judge his credibility. 
   Well, it turns out that was kept from the jury by the prosecutors. That case is on appeal. The fifth circuit heard it last year, and hopefully they'll reverse the case and order a new trial and let the next jury hear the whole truth. But you see, it's incidents like that which tells the Border Patrol agents don't get in a confrontation down there on the Texas-Mexico border, because if you do, our government won't back you; they're going to back the bad guy, the drug dealer. 
   Another example, David Sipe, another Border Patrol agent. Several years ago, I think it was the year 2000, almost the same situation. He gets in a fight with a coyote, human smuggler, bringing people into the United States in the Rio Grande riverbed. And he has a fight with this coyote and he wins the fight. You know, we'd think we'd want our border agents to win the fight, but yet he's prosecuted for violating the civil rights of the human smuggler, and he's tried and he's convicted. And what we learn in that case was the prosecution hid evidence in this case as well. The U.S. Attorney's Office hid evidence in that case as well about the fact of all the advantages and deals they gave to the coyote if he testified. See, the jury didn't know about all the things that he was given, about the $80,000 he was given. 
   Now, he bought a ranch down in Mexico with that $80,000 of U.S. money. About the cell phones, about the green cards coming back and forth. And so the Federal judge found out that the U.S. Attorney's Office hid that information from the jury, ordered a new trial. The second trial the jury heard all the truth. The jury found David Sipe not guilty. He's the second one.     
   More recently, Gilmer Hernandez, now get this one. It's almost as bizarre as the other two. Gilmer Hernandez is a deputy sheriff down in Rock Springs, Texas, not a very big place, and a vehicle is coming through at night, lights off, runs the stop sign. Gilmer Hernandez is on patrol by himself. You see, we don't have the money to have two deputies in a car. 
   He stops the vehicle. As he's approaching the vehicle, the driver turns the vehicle around, tries to run over Deputy Hernandez. Deputy Hernandez pulls out his pistol, perfect great shot. He starts shooting at the vehicle, the tires, just like in the movies. He's shooting at the tires, and he knocks out two of the tires as the vehicle goes by. 
   But what happened was, one of those bullets ricocheted on one of the people in the vehicle. There were nine illegals, plus the driver which I assume was the coyote, and they take off running. Deputy Hernandez was prosecuted for a civil rights violation because the U.S. Attorney's office said he shouldn't have fired his gun at the vehicle as it went by. He protected himself in self-defense, in my opinion. Deputy Hernandez just now got out of Federal penitentiary, and he's back home in Rock Springs, Texas. 
   It's cases like that which tell the border agents, be careful, don't get in a confrontation because if you do your government's not going to back you. 
   Now, I give you those three examples, Madam Speaker, because of the most recent example, the tragic example of Luis Aguilar. Luis Aguilar was a border patrol agent from El Paso, Texas, on duty in Tucson, Arizona, last week. Two vehicles speed across the United States border with Mexico, presumably drug dealers, come into the United States, border patrol sees them, tries to apprehend them by blocking their path, they turn around, they start heading back to Mexico. 
   Luis Aguilar, after getting permission with his supervisors, throws out what are called spikes, tire spikes, in front of one of the vehicles. The vehicle runs over this, tires blow out, and you're able to capture the bad guys. So he throws the spikes out in front of a Humvee, apparently stolen in the United States. You see, drug dealers are using real fancy vehicles stolen in the United States in many cases, and so he throws the spikes out but the Humvee doesn't stop. He heads for Border Patrol Agent Aguilar and, at a speed of 55 miles an hour, hits Border Agent Aguilar and killed him and then disappeared back into Mexico, that being the Humvee. He was 32, married, had two kids. 
   But you see if he would have done what Deputy Hernandez did and pulled out his gun and tried to shoot out the tires, you know, where would our Federal Government be? We don't know, but we do know that Border Agent Aguilar was killed in the line of duty protecting the dignity of the border, and I say that to say this, Madam Speaker. 
   Here's a chart. It's pretty simple. Assaults on border agents in 2005, there were 384. That's about one a day. 2006, doubled, 750, two a day. And last year in 2007, 987 assaults on border agents, three a day. That's what's happening to our border agents. 
   And have you read about any of this in our American press, about the assaults that are taking place against our border agents who are protecting the war zone down there on the Texas-Mexico border? You don't hear much about it, but you sure hear about it when some drug dealer gets shot by a border patrol agent. That ought not to be. 
   So, Madam Speaker, that's part of the problem is that we don't give the border patrol the right rules of engagement. We need to support them. We need to make the rules of engaging, especially drug dealers and coyotes different, so that they know our government supports them and act within the law to make sure they're able to stop those people who illegally come into the United States. 
   Madam Speaker, one of the many places I've been is Hudspeth County.  I'm sure most Americans never heard of that except folks down there in Hudspeth County. This is a drawing of it. El Paso County is to the West, and then there's Hudspeth County right here. It's a county about the size of Delaware. It has 12 deputy sheriffs patrolling this whole county the size of Delaware, and it's a great place for drug dealers to sneak into the United States and human coyotes because they're only 20 miles from Interstate 10. 
   There have been reports that the Mexican military has actually helped drug dealers smuggle drugs into the United States. You don't hear much about that in the national media. 
   But I want to tell you specifically about one incident I saw when the sheriff of Hudspeth County took me down to the Rio Grande River. We're driving down to the Rio Grande River on a dirt road. The river's to our south, and we come upon this. This is a bridge. It's a foot bridge. You don't drive back and forth across it, and it's out in the middle of no place, and there are three of these that connect Mexico to Hudspeth County, Texas, and of course, that bridge serves one purpose. It allows people to come into America without permission. 
   And I was just stunned to see this and the other bridges, and they've apparently been there for a long time. I don't know why we just don't tear it down, you know. Are we going to offend somebody if we tear this bridge down? At least go halfway. Half of it's ours, but it's things like this that make the work of our border patrol so difficult when we have these absurd bridges down in at least parts of Texas that border the United States and Mexico and allow people to come across. 
   Let me mention some other problems that we have. When Vicente Fox, and I call him Generalissimo Fox, was President of Mexico, he instigated a plan that would help illegals, not legals, come to the United States. What happened is the Mexican government produced comic book-types of pamphlets that were given to the migrants that were coming into the United States. Here are a few pages from the Guide for the Mexican Migrant. That's what it says on the outside of this pamphlet. 
   And here you see what to do, shows you where to cross, what to do when you're confronted by a border patrol, what to say and not to say. But anyway, it's all helping migrants come into the United States illegally, including giving them maps on where they can go and the best places to cross. So I doubt, in my opinion, if we're getting the right kind of cooperation from the Mexican government. 
   The Mexican economic policy seems to be go to America and send your money back to Mexico because that's what's happening. You know, people that are working in the United States from Mexico, send about $20 billion a year, that's billion with a B, back to Mexico. Other countries in Central America and South America, it's about $10 billion. It is about $30 billion a year of American economic stimulus is going to Mexico and to other countries in the Americas. So that is the apparently economic plan of Mexico. 
   I don't understand why Mexico, with all of its natural resources, doesn't develop those rather than expecting individuals to come to the United States and send their money back home. 
   You know, also speaking about Mexico, Mexico every once in a while kind of takes the position that we're being too hard on protecting our borders, but yet that's 
   the same government that protects its southern border from other Central American countries where those illegals who want to come into Mexico, either to stay and work or come into the United States. Somewhat hypocritical to me, in my opinion. 
   We have gone so far that in this country if you are illegally in the country you can get what is called a Mexican matricula card. What is that? That is a document that is produced by Mexico as identification for Mexican nationals that are illegally in the United States. Now, somebody sent me one of these. Here is one. It's obviously not authentic even though it looks like it was from the consulate's office in Indianapolis. That's my photograph. Somebody took it off the Internet and just put my photograph on it and just made a Mexican matricula card. 
   Now that's what Mexican nationals, especially illegals, use to do banking, credit cards, to set up any type of financial transaction. They use these matricula cards. So we give illegals in this country identification cards from their home country. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. 
   The next thing I'd like to mention is that in many cases when people are actually captured by the border patrol they're not immediately sent back where they came from, whether it's from Mexico or from China or wherever. Because of the overwhelming numbers, we don't have the facilities to detain individuals. So, if you are a Mexican national, you're usually sent back home. That doesn't prevent you from coming right back across the river the same way you got here. But they're sent back, and I'm talking about Mexican nationals that are illegally in the country. They have to come back and forth and be caught numerous times before our government finally says now we're going to prosecute you for criminally entering the United States. Most of the time they're just sent back home. 
   If you are not a Mexican national, what happens is because we don't have places to detain people that are captured by border patrol, sheriff's department, whoever, and then they are released on their word to come back to court for their deportation hearing. I probably need to repeat that again because I want to make sure that it is clear. So if you're not from Mexico but you're from some other place and you illegally come into the United States and you are captured, you're taken before an immigration judge, and on your oath and word you promise to appear in 6 months for your deportation hearing, and you are given a piece of paper, a get-out-of-jail-free card, which allows you to roam around for 6 months before you have to show back up because the courts are overwhelmed. 
   Did you know something, Madam Speaker? Most of those people never show back up for their deportation hearing. They just stay in the United States, and we hear from Homeland Security that that policy has ended. I'm not so sure that it is, because when I go down to the border, and I talk to the people, the boots on the ground, they say, no, we are still doing that in many places. We let them go because we don't have places to detain them. 
   When I was down on the Texas-Mexico border in one episode, we were driving down, middle of the night, 2 o'clock in the morning. Those Texas sheriffs are hard to keep up with. They stay up all the time, but anyway, we're driving down a road near the border and we see two people waiving at us. The sheriff stopped, found out these two people were from, I believe it was Costa Rica, and they wanted to be arrested so they could get their get-out-of-jail-free card so they could go on about their way. Interesting. They know the rules and what we don't do in this country to enforce our law in other countries. So it makes it very difficult to do what is necessary to enforce the rule of law. 
   Madam Speaker, we have this problem. We have individuals, legal and illegal, from foreign countries come into the United States and they commit felonies. I'm talking about serious crimes, in violation of the Federal law. They are caught. They are captured, they are tried, they are convicted, and they're sent to prison. 
   While they're in prison, our system works very well. ICE files deportation proceedings. They take place. An immigration judge orders the person deported as soon as they get out of the penitentiary. But what happens is when they finish their sentence, their home country won't take them back. They don't want them. They're criminals, and so because of our law, we can't indefinitely keep the person in custody. They've already served out their sentence for violating American law for a felony like robbery. So they're released within 6 months, as it should be. The Supreme Court has said that. I agree with that rule. We can't detain them, but their country won't take them back. 
   Now, there are nine main countries that do that, and it may not surprise us that the number one culprit is that country that makes, you know, toys with lead in it and sends it to the United States, China. China doesn't take them back. They use all kinds of diplomatic excuses why they don't take them, but the bottom line is they  don't take them back. Vietnam is another one that doesn't take them back. India. There's a total of eight countries that won't take them back.     
   Now, it would seem to me if a country won't take back their lawfully deported felons, that country shouldn't get legal visas for other citizens to legally come here. It seems like that ought to be the law: You won't take back your deported ones, your citizens can't come here legally. That's what the law ought to be. Well, Madam Speaker, that is the law. However, the State Department chooses not to do that, especially with China, and I have the letter that they sent me. They choose not to do that with China because of the ongoing trade negotiations with the Chinese Government. 
   Madam Speaker, if a person commits a felony in this country and they're ordered deported to go back home, they ought to go back home. If that country doesn't take them, they ought to lose the right to have legal visas in this country, and they ought to lose foreign aid if we give foreign aid to those countries; otherwise, we will have a continuing number of these felons running loose in America. How many are we talking about? My understanding is that right now it's 165,000 people lawfully deported for committing felonies and haven't been taken back home by their home country. It's amazing what we don't do in this country. 
   We also have the problem, of course, in the area of how much it costs. And I'm going to try to go through these as fast as I can, Madam Speaker. Before I get to the costs, I want to talk about this issue of birthright citizenship. Most Americans, if you ask them the question, if you're born in the United States, are you a citizen, 100 percent of them are going to say, sure, you're a citizen if you're born here. But is that the law? And I'll read where this comes from. And when in doubt, we probably ought to just look at the Constitution. And I know most Members of the House on both sides carry a pocket Constitution like this, as I do, in their pockets. I want to read to you the 14th amendment, just portions of it. 
   Section 1, 14th amendment of the United States: ``All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.'' That phrase that we don't ever talk about is ``all persons that are subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'' In other words, you've got to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States if you're born here. And people who sneak into the country with the whole premise of having a child are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. That would be my argument as a former prosecutor and as a judge, looking at it from a constitutional point of view. 
   Just because you're born here doesn't make you a citizen under the Constitution. But it's our policy in this country to allow you to be a citizen. We just accept that. But that's not what the Constitution says. So, maybe in the interest of America we ought to revisit that, especially those people and those cases that fraudulently enter the country on the premise to have a child born here. Once that child is born here, then the child, because we say that child is an American citizen, then we don't deport the child, but we let the mother stay and then we allow the whole extended family to come over here and stay into the country. And this is happening at an epidemic proportion in the United States. It seems to me that we need a case before the Supreme Court and let them decide down the street whether or not, just because you're born here, does that make you a citizen? I would argue it doesn't because they're not subject to the jurisdiction of the country when they fraudulently came in here. They're subject to the jurisdiction of the country that they came from. 
   Also, we have a tremendous cost in the area of education, Madam Speaker. Last year, Texas spent $4 billion educating people illegally in the United States. We talk about education costs. We've talked about it. We're going to talk about it some more. We don't hear too much talk about the people that are in the system that are here illegally in the country. Nationwide, it's about $30 billion a year. And it's unfortunate that we won't deal with the reality of it. We educate everybody in the country. All you've got to do is just show up and you're educated at somebody else's expense. 
   Now, I don't think other countries do that. Let's say, Madam Speaker, that I went to France, and I snuck into France and I take my four kids with me. And I get into France and I tell the Education Minister of France, Educate me. Educate my kids. Educate them in English because none of us speak French. What do you think would happen to me? Well, my kids and myself and my family, we would be sent back to Texas, and rightfully so. And most countries in the world do that, but not the United States. 
   Let's deal with the issue of the cost of people in the system that are illegally in the country and figure out the most humane, ethical and financially beneficial way to deal with it. But one way not to deal with it is what we're doing now is allowing people that are illegally in the country to go to our universities and pay in-state tuition. That makes no sense. And Texas, unfortunately, is one of these States. You see, if you are illegally in the country, you can go to the University of Texas and pay in-state tuition. But if you're from Oklahoma, God bless you, or you're from Germany and you want to go to the University of Texas, you pay out-of-state tuition because you ain't from around here. But if you're illegally in the country, we allow you to go to the University of Texas and pay in-state tuition. 
   So, we benefit people illegally in the country over American citizens and foreign nationals who are coming here the right way. It makes no sense to me. And with the high cost of education, and as a parent, and most parents who have to pay for this education, it doesn't seem fair to me that we penalize American citizens and legal foreign nationals who want to go to our universities. So, education is one of those. 
   Health care costs is another one. I've discussed that. I don't have time to talk about Parkland Hospital in Dallas where most of the babies that are born there every year are born to mothers that are illegally in the country. There is a whole network of individuals, pregnant mothers from south of the Texas border, and I don't just include Mexico, but there is a whole network, work your way up to Dallas, wait your turn, go to Parkland Hospital and have your baby, and your baby is now an American citizen. We have to deal with that. And of course the health care cost is being paid by somebody. 
   We've talked a lot about health care and expenses and how Americans can't afford it, and that's true. You know, middle-class America, people making up to $100,000, $80,000, they can't afford health care costs. They can't afford to pay for the insurance. But if you're illegally in the country, of course, all you've got to do is show up at the emergency room, the most expensive health care, and somebody else pays for it. And that's people that are paying taxes, legal immigrants and U.S. citizens. So, health care costs are being driven up by people who are here illegally. 
   The criminal justice system. I mentioned I was a judge down to Houston forever, 22 years. And on any given day they tell me over in the sheriff's department that about 20 percent of the people in jail waiting to be tried, waiting for their felony trials, that's what I tried was felonies, are people from other countries, most 
   of them illegally in the United States. 
   The prison system, State, Federal, local, is all being driven up in cost by criminals that are over here. Not everybody is a criminal of course, but some of them do come over here and commit crime. And it's important that we have to deal with that issue and the cost as well. 
   Madam Speaker, the GAO did a study on our borders, and here is what they did. They got some of their people to drive back and forth across the American border with Canada and Mexico, and they wanted to see if they could get into the United States illegally. And they did. They used fake documents that they had manufactured, just like other people do. And what they were bringing in was radioactive material that went undetected when they kept crossing back and forth the border between the United States and Canada and the border with Mexico. And I give you that example because, in the big scheme of things, open borders is an invitation for terrorists who  want to do us harm. The next terrorist attack that happens in this country is not going to be because somebody lands over here at Reagan National Airport, gets off the plane and says, I wonder what damage I can do to America. It's not going to happen that way. They're going to probably just come across the border because it's easier to do that. And we should be very concerned about that issue because, you see, open borders, you get the good, you get the bad, and you get the ugly. And those terrorists are certainly bad and ugly. 
   So, Madam Speaker, we need the moral will, as a country, to enforce the rule of law. All those different groups that have a political agenda, or some other agenda rather than national security, have an influence over our national security issue. And maybe we need to deal with what is best for America. And we start with the basics. We secure the border and you make sure that people who come here come here the right way. We streamline the Immigration Service so people don't have to wait so long before they come here, whether they want to be a citizen or whether they want to work or whether they want to be a student. That's a whole other issue, the Immigration Service. But streamline that. Make it efficient. Make sure that we use documents, such as a passport, to come into the United States. 
   We protect the borders of other nations, Madam Speaker. We protect the border of Korea. We're over there protecting the border in Iraq. We protect the borders of other nations better than we protect our own border. Third World countries protect their borders greater than the greatest power that has ever existed protects its borders. Why? It's because we don't have the will to do it. We do a lot of talking about it, but we don't do much about it. 
   As I mentioned, I've been down to the Texas-Mexico border 13 times. Every time I go down there, it gets worse. A sheriff in one of the counties told me, I said, What's it like down here? He said, After dark it gets western. I said, What do you mean by that? He said, It gets western. It's violent. And while we were down there, we heard gunshots coming from the other side of the border. It's a serious situation, and Americans need to realize it. And I invite every Member of Congress to go down to the border and see what it's like. Because if we're going to make rules about immigration reform and border security and national security, we need to see what the war zone is like to make those decisions. And I invite them all to go down there. Go with me, because I'm going back. 
   So, we need to prosecute businesses that knowingly hire illegals. They shouldn't get a pass because they own the business. We go after the worker that's over here and try to deport them. That's the wrong method. The method ought to be, go after the business, because if the business owner doesn't hire illegals, that person doesn't have a place to work and they'll go home. Oklahoma has already proven that with their State law. 
   We need to put America first. And Madam Speaker, we cannot continue to be blissfully ignorant of the truth on the border. This is a great country, a country, as we hear, that is made up of mostly immigrants, people who came here the right way at some point in time. And we want to continue to be a Nation of immigrants. But the rule of law needs to be followed. It has to be followed. And we need to enforce the security of our Nation rather than continue to talk about it. 
   It reminds me of what my grandfather used to say. He said, ``When all is said and done, more is said than done.'' And that's true. We need to do whatever is necessary within the law. I, for one, believe that we ought to put the National Guard on the border; that would stop it. When the military is on the border, our military is on the Korean border, you don't cross that Korean border without the permission of the United States. Protecting somebody else's border, again. 
   Madam Speaker, it seems to me that open borders invites everyone to come in and invade the United States, and it's time that our country deal with this reality while we're dealing with the war in Iraq, while we're dealing with the war in Afghanistan, while we protect the borders of other nations. Let's deal with the issues of the border security of our own country, the border security on the southern border and the border security on our northern border. We will be a better country for it and a safer country for it. 
   And Madam Speaker, that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, as the sponsor of the 2008 National Stalking Awareness Month resolution, I hope this resolution serves as a unifying force for community leaders, policymakers, victim service providers, and able to educate Americans on the serious dangers of stalking. It is a crime that annually affects more than 1 million women and over 400,000 men in our country. 
   As the cochairman and founder of the Congressional Victims Rights Caucus, and my experience as a prosecutor and a judge, I had met with countless victims and victim service providers about the dangers of stalking. 
   Unfortunately, stalking is not an isolated occurrence. Two-thirds of the stalkers pursue their victims at least once a week, sometimes daily. Victims often feel that there is no safe place for them to go, no safe place to hide, not even in their homes. Stalking forces victims to relocate, lose their jobs, and cycle into severe depression and anxiety. Some victims live in quiet, desperate lives of fear. 
   With today's advanced technology, protecting Americans from stalking is even more challenging. Stalkers have a wide range of technologies to pursue on their victims. They use cell phones. They use fax machines, computer spyware, and GPS systems all to track the victim. The Internet now serves cyberstalkers looking for a place to threaten and harass. Even pedophiles on the prowl use cyberstalking for their next victim. 
   Stalking rates are on the rise because of the new technologies in the Internet. Stalking has only been criminalized in our country for 28 years. California was the first State to make stalking a crime. Like domestic violence, stalking is about power, intimidation, and control over the victim. 
   While stalking is now a crime in every State and the District of Columbia and the Federal Government, stalking often leads to other crimes, including physical assault, sexual assault, and murder. Stalking laws are basic to the individual right to be left alone and the right of privacy. 
   The best way to attack the threat of stalking is through law enforcement and education. 
   I encourage victim service providers, law enforcement, prosecutors, and community leaders to promote awareness of stalking, and I thank them for their efforts in making life better for victims.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the Malaysian Government recently seized  Christian children's books written in English because they contained illustrations of Bible prophets Moses and Abraham, an alleged violation of Islamic Shariah law. 
   The Malaysian Government's publications and ``Religious Enforcement Police'' found that the images of Bible characters in the Christian books offended the sensitivities of Muslims and must be banished. 
   Malaysian Prime Minister Badawi indicated other religions must understand that Islam is the true religion for Malaysia. 
   The government's ``midnight raid'' on these books infringes on the basic human right of religious freedom, a right which ironically is protected in the Malaysian constitution, but nonexistent under Islamic Shariah law. This is yet another example of the problems with a State religion. 
   Ghandi once said, ``If we are to respect others' religions as we would have them respect ours, a study of the world's religions is a sacred duty.'' The Malaysian government expects all religions to be tolerant of the Islamic religion, but hypocritically is intolerant of the Christian faith.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, A Tree, A Tree, but don't call it a Christmas Tree. Let me explain. 
   Since forever, Christmas trees have been called Christmas trees. Everyone in the world knows what a Christmas tree is and the traditions that accompany them. 
   It is almost that time of year for most homes throughout the fruited plain to have some type of tree in them. Even Charlie Brown has a Christmas tree. But Lowe's Home Improvement stores that sell trees won't call them Christmas trees, but now they call them ``family trees'' so as not, I suspect, to offend non-Christians. Of course, it is okay in our culture to offend Christians because they are just supposed to turn the other cheek. However, calling them family trees may offend single individuals who don't have families. So should the trees be called family-individual trees? 
   Where is this nonsense of political correctness going to end? Lowe's should change its policy. This is the same silliness that caused some retailers last year to refuse to put up signs saying ``Merry Christmas,'' but instead said ``Happy Holidays.'' 
   It is tradition at the Poe house on Thanksgiving that we buy and decorate a Christmas tree. But we won't buy one at Lowe's because, you see, they don't sell Christmas trees.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE BOND OF BROTHERS--THE DOZEN RIPKOWSKIS -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, today I have the distinct honor of recognizing a family in the Second Congressional District in Texas where Veterans Day is a daily family event. If you looked up the word ``patriot'' in the dictionary, you would most likely find a photograph of the 12 Ripkowski brothers in Dayton, Texas. 
   The lives of all 12 brothers form a company of heroes that served in our military in various branches spanning from World War II to the Korean War. Most of them served in a time of war, and all 12 of them returned home. They truly were a band of brothers who fought for America. 
   Their family story began in the small town of Dayton, Texas, in the 1930s. Their parents, Stash and Mattie Ripkowski, had 12 sons and four daughters. That's right, 16 all-American children. Their names are Felix, August, Raymond, Bernie, Alex, Leon, Bill, Herman, Franklin, John, Mike, Stanley, Catherine, Virginia, Pearline, and Anna Lee. 
   The Ripkowski family grew corn and cotton on their 200-acre farm. As World War II began, the brothers answered their country's call of duty to serve in the military one after the other. 
   Raymond served in the Air Force and was stationed in New Guinea. He was a radio operator and gunner. During his military service, he survived and recovered from an airplane crash. Bernie served in the Army and was stationed in Alaska during World War II. Felix served in the Army in Europe. August served in the Navy and was stationed in the Pacific. And Bill was also stationed in the Pacific, but he served in the United States Army. Stanley served in the Army during peacetime and then during the Korean War. 
   Today only 6 of the 12 Ripkowski brothers are still alive. Alex, the oldest of the surviving brothers, is 91. He served in the Army and was deployed in Europe during World War II. Mike joined the Air Force and served as a chief clerk for 2 years on the island of Okinawa. Herman served in the Army as an infantryman for 3 years, and he was a member of the 78th Lightning Division, which was the first division to cross the Rhine River in Germany towards the end of World War II in Europe. After crossing the river, German airplanes blew up the bridge, separating Herman and his division from the rest of the American troops. American troops quickly built a pontoon bridge in the former location of the blown-up bridge. At this point, Herman's division met up with Russian forces outside of Berlin shortly before the Germans surrendered. It was during this battle that Herman earned the Bronze Star for laying communications wire during enemy fire. 
   Leon served in the Army during World War II, and his tour of duty took him to Africa, Italy, and France, where he served in the infantry. By miraculous chance, he ran into his brother Felix in Tunisia, Africa during the Battle of El Guettar. Leon received five campaign stars while in the United States Army. Franklin served as a Merchant Marine during World War II dodging German submarines in the Atlantic. He crossed the Atlantic three times during his military service. Several years later Franklin was drafted again into the Army, and he served his country one more time, but this time during the Korean War. 
   John ``Buster'' Ripkowski served as a squad leader in the infantry division in the Army during the Korean War. He helped take care of ammunition for his entire infantry platoon. 
   All the brothers, except one, have spent the rest of their lives after the military in Dayton, Texas. Herman was the only one to move away from his family, and he moved to Liberty, Texas, which is 6 miles away. 
   What makes the Ripkowski brothers' story so remarkable is how humble and modest they are in describing their family's enormous military contribution to our great Nation. Their humility is best understood in their own words: 
   Mike said, ``We did it to serve our country. We're just hard-working country folk.'' 
   ``Thank God we are here and that all of us made it home,'' said Herman, when asked to describe his brothers and their service in the military. 
   ``You had to serve your country,'' said John. ``I enjoyed going into the service and doing my job.'' 
   This band of brothers believed that their service in the military was their duty as an American citizen. To them it was not for performing heroics or to gain medals but to answer the honorable call of duty for our country. ``Medals didn't interest us,'' said Franklin. ``Our minds were on doing our jobs and doing it better every day. Nowadays a lot of people don't care or put much of their heart into it. But the military trained you to put your heart into it. I wish every person in America would go into the military for 1 year. It would make a better person out of all of them.'' 
   The Ripkowski brothers' patriotic legacy of military service is one of the best examples of our ``Greatest Generation'' doing their job for America during the great World War II. They are an eternal example of the service and sacrifice given to protect freedom for our Nation. They're a good example for all of us, especially our younger generation. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, southeast Texas is proud of the military men that it's produced, men such as United States Air Force Major Andrew Stone of Beaumont, Texas, who recently received the Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor for his heroics while fighting in Afghanistan. Thus far, there have only been a handful of recipients of this second highest military award from the Afghanistan and Iraqi wars. 
   On October 30, 2006, Major Stone answered a distress call from a Special Forces Unit that was on the ground and was trapped and taking heavy rocket and machine gun fire. Alone against this enemy, Major Stone attacked in his A-10 aircraft with a barrage of 30mm cannon fire. With no regard for his own safety, and while exposing himself to horrific enemy ground fire, Major Stone continued to perform cover over this trapped Special Forces Unit until they reached complete safety. He would not leave any of them behind. It was his selfless courage and bravery that enabled this U.S. troop patrol to escape. 
   And as we approach Veterans Day, we honor our relentless warriors like Major Stone. And it's with great pride that I recognize this son of Texas and congratulate him on receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, it appears that in spite of Federal law that requires close inspection of vehicles and identification of people entering the United States, in the City of El Paso, Texas, border and Customs officials have been ordered to ignore some inspections. This Get-to-America-Quick plan requires that if pedestrian lines get too long, only 30 percent of them are to be questioned. If vehicular traffic waiting time is too long, then inspectors are to ignore some basic inspections for drugs and radioactive material. 
   According to Sarah Carter of the Washington Times, in some cases only every fifth driver and his documents are verified, all this in the name of letting more foreign nationals into the United States faster. 
   Why? Well, it seems some businesses are complaining the delays hurt their profits. So Federal bureaucrats are making border inspection officers ignore security, all in the name of the almighty dollar, or shall I say peso.  
   This is yet another example of the incompetent attitude and lack of will on government bureaucrats to secure the American border. American border security should not be sacrificed on the altar of greed.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, last week I got to go down to the west Texas town of El Paso, that town that Marty Robbins sang that famous ballad about. It was one of my several trips to the Texas/Mexico border since I've been in Congress, now almost a dozen times down along the Rio Grande River. 
   The Texas border with Mexico, the river border, is 1,248 miles long. That doesn't mean much, but it's the same distance from New York City to Kansas City. And I spent last week in two of those counties, the furthest west county, El Paso County, and the second county to the east, Hudspeth County. 
   I met with the Sheriff's Department in El Paso County, and Sheriff Leo Samaniego and his chief deputy, Jimmy Apodaca and Public Information Officer Rick Clancy, all El Paso natives, took me around the area of El Paso city and the County of El Paso. I'd like to describe the scene that I saw there. 
   In El Paso, El Paso is a community of about 500,000 people. Across the Rio Grande River is Juarez, Mexico, a community of over 2 million individuals. Juarez, unlike some border towns, is a thriving area. The economy is booming. And across the city of El Paso, on the Rio Grande River, there is an 18-mile fence. And let me describe that fence between Mexico and the United States. The Rio Grande River is to the south. The next thing you see is green  space, it's primarily dirt, for about 200 yards. And then there is a fence, a fence that protects the canal that runs on the northern side of the Rio Grande River. You see, the canal has more water in it sometimes than the Rio Grande River does. And it's a manmade canal. It's full of water most of the time. So there's a fence on each side of the canal. 
   Then there is a road that the Border Patrol patrols, and then there is yet one more fence before the highway there in the city of El Paso. And this fence has been there for some time. And along that 18-mile stretch in the city of El Paso about every quarter of a mile on the road, the Border Patrol road, there is a Border Patrol vehicle. And we saw numerous of those vehicles while I was there those several days. And it seems to me that area is very well protected, and no one crosses into the United States because of those three fences, the canal, and the presence of the Border Patrol. 
   Before the fence was there, the border was basically wide open and people came right across into El Paso and dodged traffic there on the main streets. According to the sheriff's department, since the fence has been built in the city of El Paso, crime in El Paso has dropped 60 percent. So the Border Patrol, working with the local law enforcement, seems to do a good job of keeping people, especially criminals who want to come in and commit crime in El Paso city and flee back to Juarez, from coming into the town. The situation is somewhat different as you move on further down the river. 
   Before I mention that, I would like to mention a couple of things that I did observe. In the mornings we went out to the several crossings into the United States, the legal crossings, and observed people coming in from Mexico to the United States. At about 6:15 in the morning, very early, was when these photographs were taken. Now, these photographs were taken by the Rio Grande River, and turning around, these photographs are taken of students going into El Paso city. And you will notice they have on school uniforms. This individual is even carrying a set of golf clubs that he brought from home, I suspect, to go to school. Here are some kids down here earlier in the morning, and they also have their backpacks, their school uniforms, and they are headed into the United States. 
   How do we know they were school students? Well, many of them were wearing the T-shirts of the colors of the elementary school, purple and blue and green and red, or gray. And hundreds of these kids cross the border into the United States every day from Mexico to go to school in the United States. At the end of the day, all of these kids, some of them escorted by their parents, cross back over into Juarez, Mexico, to go home. And this is a daily occurrence when school is in session. 
   It seems to me that the United States is funding the education of foreign nationals that not only don't live here; they live somewhere else and come to our schools all at the expense of taxpayers in the United States. People who pay their taxes, live here legally, whether citizens or not, fund the education system for people in some other nation on a daily basis. 
   I went to some of the local high schools and noticed how some of the students would drive up in their vehicles and they would have Mexican license plates on their vehicles. Two apparently had crossed the border that morning, coming into the United States, going to American high schools, and turning around at the end of the day and going back home. It seems to me that this ought not to be. 
   The sheriff's department tells me that about 40 percent of the El Paso school system is made up of citizens from Mexico that come across each day into the United States. Statistics are hard to find. The El Paso school district seems to disagree with that. 
   And you will notice these aren't poor kids coming over. These are kids that are just basically middle-class kids coming to the United States. And we took numerous photographs of those kids. Here are some of those just for your benefit. 
   But as we moved out of the city of El Paso, which, like I said, seemed to be a secure place for basically illegal traffic coming in except for maybe situations like where the ports of entry are not screened or protected very well by the border protectors, there seems to be no presence of the Border Patrol outside the city of El Paso throughout the rest of the county. Let me try to explain that area. 
   This is a map of a partial area of the towns and locales that I went to last week as a guest of the sheriff's department. You will notice up here in the far western portion of Texas that borders Mexico is the city of El Paso, this yellow area here. The city of El Paso, like I said, has that 18-mile fence. As soon as you get out of the city of El Paso and go down to the county line of El Paso, things are a lot different and the presence of the Border Patrol was a lot different, in my opinion. 
   First of all, of course, there is no fence that was built like the one that I just described. As soon as you get out of the city of El Paso, there's no fence of any type. 
   So I traveled along with the sheriff's department of El Paso County to these different small little towns along the border, border towns. Fabens, Texas, we all heard about Fabens, Texas, where the Border Patrol officers got arrested and convicted for trying to apprehend a drug smuggler. That's a different story for another time. And these other small towns all along the border. 
   The way the situation is on the border and how I will describe it is to make it clear on how easy it is to cross into the United States. Of course, there's the Rio Grande River. Depending on where you go, there is sometimes not even water in the Rio Grande River. And as soon as you cross the Rio Grande into the United States, there is a Texas highway, Highway 20, that runs the length of El Paso County and part of the next county, Hudspeth County. That road is about 3 miles from the border. And then you go an additional 2 miles along the border, this entire area here, and there is Interstate 10 that travels all the way from Florida through Texas to California. So it is about 5 miles from the border to Interstate Highway 10. 
   The area is flat. The area has brush, and it's low brush and it's thick brush, very easy to hide in that area. And at night you can see above that brush for miles. You can see from the Rio Grande River all the way to the interstate where all of the vehicles are traveling up and down the interstate. 
   So we visited these little small villages in El Paso County and talked to some of the individuals that were there, that lived there, that have lived there, their families, for generations. And this was probably the most, shall I say, expressive bunch of people that I have ever met. These farmers and ranchers that live on the Rio Grande River on the Texas side, the American side, and what they are going through and their property has been tampered with because the Federal Government doesn't secure the border. These ranchers, these villagers, they all live right on the Rio Grande River. They live between the river and Interstate 10. Some of them live south of Highway 20, right on the river. And I met with one of those locals, and he said that he felt like our own government has deserted the ranchers and farmers in the rural areas of our country. He said he waits sometimes a long time for the Border Patrol to show up when they are called. 
   And here is the reason for that: it would seem to me the Border Patrol ought to patrol the border, which is the Rio Grande River. The Border Patrol, it seems to me, ought to be on the border to protect the border. But most of the time they are not on the border. They are on Interstate 10, which is 5 miles from the border, driving up and down that area. Well, if people get to Interstate 10, they are already in the United States. And if they can cross into the United States, it's very easy to get picked up on Interstate 10 or even Highway 20 here and dispersed into the United States. 
   So what happens is, because of this policy of keeping the Border Patrol on Interstate 10 for the most part, you leave these ranchers, these farmers, and these people who live in these small villages and towns in no-man's land. And I visited in many of these small villages and these very small homes on the American side, and I was shocked to see the bars on the windows and how the people have tried to protect their property from just the criminal element that crosses into the  United States because they are, in their opinion, without adequate protection. 
   We need to enforce the border on the border, not have a policy that puts the Border Patrol 5 miles from the border on Interstate 10. And, of course, that is what the farmers and the ranchers said as well. 
   It was interesting to hear from these farmers and ranchers, and they would talk to me. They all met together in one of their farmhouses and talked for several, several hours on this tremendous issue. And they said that they see everybody coming across, that the days and times have changed. It used to be that this border was basically fairly open. I mean by that there would be crossings on both sides, Americans into Mexico, Mexicans into the United States. There would be landowners on both sides who would do business with each other. But those days are over. The people coming over now, according to these farmers and ranchers, are criminals. Not all of them, but many of them are. And they destroy their property. They destroy the vehicles that they have. They steal their property. 
   And we have heard much about a virtual fence. A virtual fence. What is a virtual fence? It means there is no fence, but there are cameras that watch the border. And I will give you an example of how the virtual fence works along this area. There are cameras, and some of those are maintained and monitored. And on three different occasions, I saw through a vision in heat sensor cameras illegals coming into the United States across the border. The Border Patrol was notified to come to those areas and pick up these people bringing in whatever, drugs, or just coming into the United States. 
   In one instance the Border Patrol took 45 minutes to get to the location. They were being directed by the person watching the camera to where the illegals had crossed, and they were within 30 feet of them and still couldn't see them because, you see, that brush is so thick. And they were hiding 30 feet away, and finally the Border Patrol left that area. And those particular three individuals that were hiding in the brush had on baggy clothes, the kind that drug smugglers bring in when they pack their bodies with drugs to smuggle into the United States. 
   Let me mention this about the Border Patrol. I think the Border Patrol agents that work on our border do as good a job as our government will let them do. They are fine people. But they have to follow the policies of somebody else, I think probably people here in Washington, DC, maybe folks that have never even been to the border. So they do what they are told to do, and they patrol the area they are told to patrol. It would seem to me that we ought to have our Border Patrol working more hand in hand with the locals, the sheriff's department, and patrolling closer to the border. 
   But the virtual fence, it's virtual all right. People are still able to cross in through that virtual fence. 
   It is interesting that the sheriffs and the deputy sheriffs that work out there, they are a little different than the Border Patrol. Like I said, nothing against the Border Patrol. We need them. We need more of them. We need more boots on the ground, probably more boots on the ground than we do other things. But the sheriffs' deputies and the sheriffs, they all grew up there. They all are from there. They know the people who ought to be there and the people who are from some other place. So we certainly need to use them as well. 
   The farmers, what do they grow down there in southwest Texas anyway? They used to grow cotton. They don't do that anymore. But this whole area here has pecan orchards, and you will drive down by the Rio Grande River, once again south of Interstate 10, and you will see pecan orchards. Pecan orchards, that's what they grow. But they are orchards that have to be irrigated. And the problem the farmers have is that so many people are crossing across their orchards that they are tearing up their crops. They say on an average they have, each one of them, four to five groups of anywhere from 30 to 50 people a day crossing their farm orchards, in many cases tearing up the property. 
   But let me tell you some of the experiences that they have had. One farmer noticed that there were some illegal people coming across his land. He goes out and he apprehends them, holds them for the Border Patrol. It turned out that these two individuals apparently were from Honduras. They are called OTMs in the vernacular, ``other than Mexicans,'' because, you see, everybody is crossing in. We shouldn't just say things about Mexico. It's not just illegals from Mexico; it's from many other countries, including Honduras.     
   So he holds them for the Border Patrol. The Border Patrol comes and arrests these two individuals, takes them out of his custody, takes them over and turns them into the immigration services. One thing leads to another and they are released on their own recognizance to come back for an immigration hearing sometime later. You see, that's what happens to many OTMs. If you are ``other than Mexican,'' you're not held, detained and deported. You're held for a while, and because there are not enough detention facilities, they're released on their word to come back for their immigration hearing, deportation hearing, shall I say. It would not surprise us that most of those people never come back for that hearing. 
   But anyway, these two individuals are apprehended; they're released from custody. And guess what? Two days later, this farmer had his pecan orchard burned to the ground. I wonder who did that? You see, it's ironic and silly to arrest these people from other countries, no matter where they are, hold them and release them back into the community, especially when they commit crimes, and most of them never appear back at that court hearing. 
   There are farmers and ranchers down there that don't want to leave their land. But I will tell you this, they are mad, they are angry, and as many of them said, they are disappointed that, in their opinion, and I will quote one of them, that the American Government has written off the rural farmer along the border. Because of whatever reason, there is no security in their opinion. Rural America has been given away by outlawry by our government, and this ought not to be. 
   So after we went through with the sheriff's deputies in El Paso County, wonderful people, we went over to Hudspeth County, which is the adjoining county. Most Americans have never heard of Hudspeth County. Let me describe it for you. It's 5,000 square miles. It's the size of Delaware and Rhode Island put together, and it's just one county in Texas. It has 100 miles that borders the Rio Grand River, so it has 100 miles of border. 
   On patrol in Hudspeth County is Sheriff Arvin West, and what a right-thinking American he is. He has 12 deputies to patrol this whole area. In other words, on any given shift, any time of the day, there are three deputies that patrol the entire county that borders Mexico. Now, you notice, Mr. Speaker, part of Interstate 10 is very close to the border, 5 miles, along with Highway 20, which is 3 miles from the border. And then about halfway down at Sierra Blanca, the road changes and it goes on off through Houston to Florida. 
   But this area here, of course, is an area that we went through. The sheriff's deputies, Sheriff Arvin West and his individuals that work for him, took me through that area. And we traveled right on the border. There is a dirt road on the American side. 
   Let me mention this: you see this road over here, Highway 2, Mexican Highway 2. Of course you see it runs along the border as well on the other side. And so there's a dirt road right on the border. And we traveled down this dirt road, sandy road, the river is right next to us. And we traveled for 30 miles on this road, took about 3 hours, before we saw one Border Patrol agent. It surprises me that we weren't that quiet going down that area, and the first time we saw a Border Patrol agent was 30 miles down river where we had been traveling. 
   But let me tell you about Arvin West. Arvin West, sheriff of this county, makes $36,000 a year. His 12 deputies, who are all patriots, who most of them are Hispanic, make $26,000 a year. But to a person, they are determined to secure their border because of the crime problem in the United States for failure to secure the border.  
   You see, they have to patrol all these little towns here, Fort Hancock and McNary and Sierra Blanca. These are all their little small towns that are in their county. And these towns have crime problems because of that crime coming from Mexico. So they want the border secure. 
   And let me say this at this point: this is an issue about border security, this is not an issue of immigration. That's a totally different issue. Border security is the issue, and we must, as a Nation, secure our border. And these sheriffs that live along here, the border sheriffs, each one of them believes the border should be secure because of the crime that is being committed. 
   But we traveled down this area. And I'd like to show you or mention a couple of things that I observed. Going down the river, we stopped. This is at night, in the middle of no place. And we came across a trolley that was built across the river; now that's what I call it. It had a steel cable running from one side of the river to the other with a bucket in it, or a trolley. And apparently people can go back and forth across that trolley into one country or the other. And that disturbed me to some extent. But we then traveled down and saw something else that I think was a little more disturbing. 
   This photograph here, Mr. Speaker, is a foot bridge taken on the American side, obviously, over into Mexico. You notice it's a steel foot bridge. It has rails on it. It probably would meet OSHA standards. And the only thing that goes across there are people. But you notice, of course, Mr. Speaker, how the land is trampled down on the Mexican side, how there is trash over here, and on this side there is land trampled down as well. There is in Hudspeth County. And there are 10 of these in the area. Who built them? They're still trying to find that out. Is it guarded? It is patrolled? Are people there watching to see if people come into the United States? No. These foot bridges exist for the sole purpose of letting people, apparently, cross into the United States. If they serve some other purpose, I don't know what that is. 
   But that disturbs me to some extent. Here we have in El Paso basically three fences and a canal trying to protect the United States from people coming in illegally. And we just moved to the county next to it and we see these things that are built to allow foot traffic to come into the United States. This ought not to be. 
   And of course once they come into the United States, they can see the interstate, which is just 5 miles away, and make their way up to the interstate, get picked up by someone flashing their lights at them, and move on down wherever they wish to go into the far most areas of the United States. This is a bridge that is a convenience for people who wish to cross into the United States illegally. 
   On down the river and up the river there are many places where the river is low and there are washouts, where water has come from either Mexico or the United States to go into the Rio Grande River. And these are perfect places that are used by drug smugglers to smuggle drugs into the United States from Mexico. Once again, once they cross into the United States, they make their way, under routes that they have planned, to the interstate and move those drugs east, west and north. 
   But it was interesting to see that there were places where the roadbed, or shall I say the riverbed looked like it had been filled in, where some vehicle had come in, Caterpillar tractor, and had smoothed down the river so that vehicles crossing into the United States wouldn't get stuck in the mud. 
   Now, I asked the sheriff's department about that, and they said, well, sure, every once in a while there would be a Caterpillar tractor parked on the Mexican side just sitting there. And they're sitting near these areas where drug smugglers come in, and the next day that Caterpillar bulldozer has come down there to the river bank, made a road for drug smugglers to bring drugs into the United States. And I asked Sheriff West, well, what do you do about that? He said, as soon as we see those, of course we're not down there 24 hours a day, neither is the Border Patrol, we tear up the river way so that those vehicles can't come into the United States. But a few days later, once again some bulldozer has come in and laid the river smoother and drier so that vehicles can come into the United States, sitting there waiting to move the illegal narcotics into our country. 
   You know, drug trafficking is a major reason we ought to secure the border. Those people who come here to do us harm is another reason to secure the border, whether those are just basic outlaws or whether those are people who wish to set up cells at the right time to do this nation damage. And in little area here that I'm talking about, well, it's a big area that I'm talking about, makes it easy for them to come into the United States. 
   Now, Sheriff West doesn't have much of a budget. In fact, he has such a small budget that he really doesn't have any vehicles. It's hard for me to understand how a sheriff's department can operate without vehicles, but here's what he does and many of the other sheriffs along the Texas-Mexico border. When they capture a drug dealer, they confiscate his vehicle, and by law they're allowed to keep that vehicle after they go through the proper channels to seize it. So most of his vehicles have come to the sheriff's department with the behest of the drug dealers. And so they're driving drug dealer vehicles, SUVs, very nice vehicles that they have confiscated from drug dealers. And those are the vehicles, the patrol vehicles, most of them trucks, pick-up trucks or SUVs so they can patrol up and down this entire county. They've even seized an 18-wheeler and put the sheriff's logo on it. 
   You know, I admire people like Sheriff West, the sheriffs along the border who will do what they need to do to secure the dignity of the United States. 
   The sheriff's department also mentioned to me about something we've heard about here in Congress, I've never seen it myself, but we hear reports about the Mexican military coming into the United States for different reasons, all those reasons are probably no good, and whether that's true or not. 
   On this road, on Interstate 10, there is basically nothing on Interstate 10 except vehicles, mostly trucks, but there is a massive truck stop on Interstate 10. And it is not uncommon, according to the sheriff's department here in Hudspeth County, to see the Mexican military wearing their uniforms going into this truck stop for whatever purpose they have. It's interesting that they say, of course, that it's not unusual for drugs to be accompanied by the Mexican military into portions of the United States. 
   So if we have the military from another country coming across our borders without our permission, I would hope that that would disturb Homeland Security to some extent, that they would prevent that from happening, or at least quit denying that it occurs. 
   So apparently to me it seems we have moved the U.S. border from the Rio Grande River to Interstate 10, 5 miles inward. We have left all this area as no-man's land. You live there at your own risk of drug dealers and criminals coming across, and this ought not to be. 
   It's unfortunate that this situation occurs, but it is the duty of our country, of course, to make sure it doesn't occur any longer. The failure of the Federal Government to secure the border allows everybody to come in here. We get the good, we get the bad, and we get the ugly, and we're getting a lot of bad and ugly because this border is not secure. So we secure our border. We do what we need to do. We have to have the moral will to secure the border. If we did, the border would be secure. We secure the borders of other nations. We secure the Korean border. Why don't we secure the American border? We secure the borders of other nations throughout the world. Why don't we secure the American border? 
   Third World countries protect their borders better than we do. Why? Because of all of those political reasons and all of those people that have political agendas keep our government from doing what it ought to do, and the first duty of government is to secure the nation. And I would hope Homeland Security would go down to the border and see it the way it really is. 
   Mr. Speaker, we hear about violence on the border. I heard a lot about it down there. We don't get too many news reports about the violence on the Texas-Mexico border or anywhere else along the southern border with Mexico, but I would like to read a dispatch  from the Hudspeth County Sheriff's Office on September 5, which was 2 days ago. This dispatch reads: At approximately 9:56 a.m., the U.S. Border Patrol at Fort Hancock Station, there's Fort Hancock, that's a little bitty place with just a handful of people living there, the U.S. Border Patrol at Fort Hancock Station called the Hudspeth County Sheriff's Office requesting assistance from the sheriff's office and highway patrol with a vehicle that was being pursued on Interstate 10. It was westbound at the 68 mile marker. So the vehicle was going this direction, headed west. The vehicle had crossed into the United States from Mexico and was loaded with approximately 800 pounds of marijuana. The vehicle was a 2005 GMC Yukon, light gold in color. The pursuit went into El Paso County, the next county over, and then turned back eastbound toward Tornillo, Texas. Hudspeth County Deputy Keith Hughes, stationed in Fort Hancock, Texas, joined in the pursuit. Deputy Hughes was able to negotiate his way to the front of the pursuing law enforcement vehicles. 
   The driver of the Yukon exited Interstate 10 and drove south on Acala Road toward the United States and Mexican border. Right in here, this little road. The United States Border Patrol set up road spikes on Acala Road. The driver of the Yukon hit the spikes, but continued traveling through Acala Road and Texas 20 in Hudspeth County. 
   Upon crossing Texas 20, the driver of the Yukon exited the vehicle and ran south to the United States and Mexican border. Deputy Hughes and the U.S. Border Patrol began a foot pursuit. The driver was captured by pursuing officers. During the foot pursuit, automatic gunfire was heard from the direction of the United States and Mexican border. Sheriff Arvin West ordered the area south of the capture site to be cleared of any persons in danger, and to seek out and find the person or persons responsible for the gunfire. 
   Once there were sufficient sheriff deputies on the scene, Chief Deputy Mike Doyle organized and led the deputies to the border area for the search.     
   After a thorough search of the border area south of the capture site, it was determined that the automatic gunfire came from the Mexican side of the United States-Mexico border. The Hudspeth County Sheriff's Office conducted a search of the border area alone because the agents of the United States Border Patrol were ordered not to engage at the border. And that is a dispatch that I didn't see printed in any newspaper in the United States about the violence, the drug dealers and the drug cartels along our southern border. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is a serious situation on the Rio Grande River. Like I said earlier, this is not an immigration issue at all. This is an issue about whether this country will secure its borders. I wonder whether a Nation that won't secure its borders deserves to exist as a Nation. It is the duty of our government to enforce the existing law. We have pontificated in this House ever since I have been in Congress about more laws on immigration, border security, comprehensive immigration reform. Why don't we just enforce the laws we already have? It is still against the law to come into the United States without permission, regardless of the reason. People from other countries don't believe we will enforce the rule of law in this country. 
   Otherwise, they wouldn't keep coming in the United States. And many times when they are captured, nothing happens. Our government has the duty to protect the people in this country from violence of criminals coming from other nations. Our country has the duty to protect citizens throughout the country from criminals coming from other places who we call terrorists. The next terrorist who is going to come to the United States probably is not going to fly over here and get off the airplane here at Reagan, and look around and see what damage they are going to do. They don't have to do that. They don't have to go through TSA screening. All they have to do is come across either our northern or southern border. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Federal Government has the duty to keep the Mexican military out of our Nation. It has no business being here for any purpose. 
   Mr. Speaker, many years ago, Marty Robbins wrote a song, a ballad about the west Texas town of El Paso and about how a cowboy lost his life because he was seeking the love of a Mexican lady by the name of Feleena. That ballad basically talks about the Wild West along the border and how it was violent at a time. Some things have changed along the Texas-Mexico border. There is some security. There are prosperous cities on both sides of the border. But there are other communities. These are small communities. These are small villages where real people live, too. Many live in fear of their life because our border is open. Times have changed because the type of people coming into the United States have changed. They are not all coming over here looking for work. Some of them are coming over here looking for mischief. They find that mischief. Much of that mischief is down there on the border where Americans live and legal immigrants live that are persecuted by criminals who come in to the United States. 
   So violence does continue on our border. It is imperative that we understand that and admit it so we can do something about it. Denying the truth is not a solution, but being openminded and realizing that, Mr. Speaker, I have only talked about two counties along the Texas-Mexico border, El Paso County and Hudspeth County. This border, like I said, is 1,250 miles long from El Paso all the way down to Brownsville. I have traveled almost the entire length of it as a guest of the sheriffs along the border. The situation is bad along that entire area. As you travel west through Arizona and through California, you find the same problems along the border, according to those sheriffs who live there and who grew up there. 
   So the obligation of our government is to do something to protect the dignity and the sovereignty of the United States and make folks understand that our government will protect them, their families and their property and keep them safe from intruders who come into the United States no matter what the reason, because, you see, it is still against the law to enter the United States without the permission of the United States. 
   We need to mean it. We need to do something about it. We need to put more Border Patrol agents on the border. We need to use the National Guard, and if necessary, a fence in appropriate areas. It won't work everywhere. But it will work in some places. Where it is erected, it has worked. 
   We need to do whatever it takes to make sure that the United States is a sovereign Nation and we do not lose this country to other folks who come over here and are trying to take it away from Americans and legal immigrants. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, that is just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (NON ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, as gasoline prices soar, as our truckers are about to sit on the side of the road because they can't get enough money to buy fuel for those diesel trucks that they're driving up and down our highways to deliver goods, people are wondering, how did we get here? 
   Well, there are several reasons how we got in this mess, and Congress is partly to blame. First of all, we had this theory that ethanol is going to save us all, so we subsidized the production of ethanol. What that has done is drive food prices up around the world, because in the United States, instead of eating corn or letting it go to feed our beef, we're burning it in our vehicles, and that's caused world food prices to go up, not just in the United States but all over the world. 
   Costco and Sam's Club are now rationing rice. Who would have thought in this year, 2008, in America we can't buy rice because we're tilling up our soil and burning crops. We're also finding out that ethanol can't save us all because, promised to be a nonpollutant, that's wrong. Science Magazine has now reported that ethanol causes more pollution than that nasty old crude oil that we produce. There are a lot of reasons for that. One of those reasons is because it takes a lot of fertilizer to produce corn, and that fertilizer runs down the Mississippi River. And when it gets down in the Gulf of Mexico that nitrogen in the fertilizer kills everything, except algae, and that is called a dead zone. Dead, because nothing is there except algae. 
   So what we ought to do is quit the subsidies to ethanol. Let the world market handle whether we should use ethanol or not and stop those subsidies. 
   The second thing that's a problem but we don't talk much about is the value of the American dollar gets less and less on the world market. It's less this week than it was last week. Why? Because the Federal Reserve doesn't regulate the dollar. It regulates interest rates. Well, maybe that isn't just what the Constitution says. When in doubt, sometimes we ought to just read the Constitution. It says Congress has the responsibility ``to coin money and regulate the value thereof.'' We have the responsibility to set the price on the dollar and we should do so. Stabilize the dollar so it doesn't cost us more to buy gasoline every week. That is our responsibility and we can't pass it off to someone else. 
   Third. The crude oil supply in the United States, which we still drive our cars based upon crude oil production, is getting less. It's an economic fact that third graders learn--the less supply you have, the higher rate of cost. And, of course, those oil companies that everybody wants to punish, the American oil companies only control 10 percent of the world market. Foreign countries, foreign dictators like Chavez down there in Venezuela and OPEC, they set the price on crude oil in the world, not American oil companies. So we need to take care of ourselves. 
   Now here's a map, Mr. Speaker. We drill off the coast of Texas, where I'm from, we drill off Louisiana and part of Mississippi and Alabama. But you see all these red zones here? Even off the sacred coast of California, there's crude oil out there and we can drill for crude oil but this Congress won't let us take care of ourselves. Why? Because the environmental lobby is so strong in this Congress that they have had fear tactics that prevent us from drilling here, off the east coast, and way up here in ANWR in Alaska. Open up the Outer Continental Shelf and start drilling. 
   You might be interested to know right here off of Florida, 47.5 miles, there's a new rig going out there and it's built by the Chinese and the Cubans because there's an oil field out there. But we won't drill there. 
   So we need to drill offshore. And we need to let our refineries produce more. They're producing all they can and because they can only produce so much, we're importing gasoline into this country for the first time, or one of the first times in our history. 
   We haven't built a new refinery in 30 years. Why? Silly environmental restrictions. Nobody wants pollution, but we need to get back to common sense and let our refineries refine. 
   Right here where I represent in southeast Texas, most of the refineries for this country are right there. Produces 22 percent of the Nation's jet fuel. 
   Now let's talk about jet fuel. This Congress passed a bill recently that says we cannot explore or take crude oil out of the tar sands in Canada. Canada is one of our biggest importers of crude oil. 
   Now what does that mean? That means because the crude oil is in the sand, we can't take it into the United States. Well, who uses that? The United States Air Force turns that into jet fuel. Doesn't anybody understand we're at war? Our airplanes need to be flying. But because of this Congress, they cannot import that. And now where are we going to get our jet fuel to fuel the Air Force? Silly restriction passed by this Congress. So let's remove that restriction as well. 
   Some people say, Well, let's tax those mean old oil companies. We'll show them. Also, we'll tax people to drive. Let me tell you something. That idea is to punish people who drive. Now where I live, down here in southeast Texas, we don't have any subways. Nobody rides a choo-choo train to work. The closest subway is in Dallas, 250 miles away. They drive pickup trucks because they work the land, they farm the land, and they can't buy the diesel fuel to run their trucks. 
   So here are some ideas, Mr. Speaker, that we ought to do and change the policy that this Congress has implemented. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, Houston Police Officer Rodney Johnson was the best of the best, but he was killed by the worst of the worst. 
   An illegal outlaw from Mexico, Juan Leonardo Quintero-Perez, shot Officer Johnson four times in the back of the head after a routine traffic stop. Officer Johnson would still be alive today, enjoying time with his five children and his wife, Joslyn, a fellow Houston police officer, if our border was protected. 
   This lawless trespasser had already been deported for indecency with a child in 1998, but he sneaked across the border again to continue his crime spree. After coming to Houston, Quintero finally confessed to murdering one of Houston's finest. 
   Today, Quintero is on trial for capital murder in Houston, but the Mexican government, rather than pay restitution to the Johnson family, is paying for the battery of defense lawyers representing this cold-blooded cop killer. 
   Mexico is meddling in the U.S. court system, but Juan Quintero cannot miss his judgment day and his day with his Maker, because justice is what we do in America, even if the Mexican government doesn't like it. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the purpose of government is to protect the people. It is a very simple but yet fundamental principle of the United States Constitution. 
   Our Federal Government has to protect us from enemies from abroad, and our government does a good job of doing that. Our government also has the secondary responsibility to protect citizens in our country, and our government does a fairly good job of that. 
   But there is a unique problem where our government seems to be lacking, and that's protecting citizens that are working overseas for American contractors against other American citizens who commit crimes against them. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, in the Judiciary Committee, a brave young lady came and testified about what happened to her, an individual by the name of Jamie Leigh Jones from my congressional district down in Texas. 
   As a young 20-year-old she went to work for KBR Construction Company overseas in Iraq. She was there just a few days when she was sexually assaulted by several individuals. After she was assaulted, Army doctors intervened and treated her initially for her medical injuries, which were devastating. The medical doctors took and prepared a rape kit, as is supposed to be done in cases like a criminal investigation, and for some reason, they never turned that rape kit over to the Federal Government, to the Justice Department, to the FBI. They turned it over to the company, and it has subsequently been damaged and destroyed. 
   After Jamie Leigh Jones was sexually assaulted, she was imprisoned as a hostage in a trailer, as she says, where she was not allowed to leave, was not allowed to eat or drink water. She frantically was able to find a cell phone that one of her guards let her borrow. She called her father in Texas, and he called me. 
   And within 48 hours the State Department had dispatched two agents from Baghdad Embassy, found Jamie Leigh Jones, rescued her, and brought her back to the United States. 
   We would hope, then, that our government would continue this investigation to find the rapist who committed this crime against Jamie Leigh Jones. 
   This occurred in the year of 2005, and for these 2 years we have heard blissful silence from the United States Justice Department on what they are doing, if anything, to find these criminals who committed this crime. 
   After Jamie Leigh Jones has now come public with this, my office has received numerous phone calls from other workers who were contract workers, civilians, all females who were assaulted while working in Iraq who are now coming forward to tell their stories. And in their case, like Jamie Leigh Jones, nobody has been prosecuted and held accountable for the crimes committed against these women, these American citizens, these American patriots who are working overseas with our military, but yet crimes are being committed against them. And there is silence from the Justice Department about what is being done, if anything. 
   It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that Iraq and what has taken place against civilian workers is reminiscent of the days of the Old West, the Wild West, where crime was committed and no one was held accountable for their conduct. 
   There are hundreds of Department of Justice officials in Baghdad doing all kinds of things. Why aren't they investigating crimes against civilian workers that are being committed by other Americans? We don't know the answer. It's important that our government fulfill its first duty to its people, which is to protect them, and when crimes are committed against American civilians by other Americans in foreign lands, where we have jurisdiction in the green zone of Baghdad, that our government be relentless in bringing those people, those criminals, to the bar of justice and put them in jail rather than remain silent and not responding at all to these crimes. 
   So I would hope, Mr. Speaker, as this year ends and the next year begins that our Federal Government, our Justice Department, has a renewed interest in the Americans that are overseas. More Americans are serving in Iraq that are civilians than are serving in the military. And we know that crimes are being committed against them. It's important that those criminals be brought to the bar of justice and held accountable in a public trial because, Mr. Speaker, justice is what we do in America. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, ``I will do my duty to God and my country.'' This is part of the Boy Scout oath. When a Boy Scout becomes an Eagle Scout, some Members of Congress have an official flag flown over the Capitol and these words are requested to be in the official certificate which is given to the Scout, along with the flag. 
   But the Architect of the Capitol, who is in charge of such matters, censors the word ``God'' in these certificates and only puts the word ``country'' in them. 
   The word ``God,'' according to the Architect, violates his rules against religious references. The Architect is the caretaker of the Capitol. We have numerous references to God in these hallowed Halls. Our history is based upon a belief in God, whether the Architect likes it or not. 
   Maybe the Architect hasn't even seen the phrase ``In God We Trust'' above the flag here in the House of Representatives. 
   What's next? Is he going to sneak over here in the darkness of the night and chisel off the word ``God'' because he doesn't want that word ``God'' in the Capitol? 
   The first amendment right to express religious freedoms is being violated by the censor of the Capitol.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, a new inductee in the Judges Hall of Shame is Judge Roy Pearson of Washington, DC. 
   It seems that Judge Pearson suffers from the arrogant ailment known as ``black robe disease.'' But instead of issuing a bad ruling, Pearson filed an absurd lawsuit.  
   Claiming his dry cleaners did not live up to their claim of ``satisfaction guaranteed'' when a pair of his pants were lost, Pearson decided to sue them for $54 million. The part of the story that makes Pearson even more despicable is that the dry cleaners did find his pants two days later and gave him $150 for his trouble. Pearson took the money all right, but he didn't want his pants back. 
   At the trial, the judge admonished Pearson, who represented himself, for being completely unprepared in his own case. On Monday, Judge Pearson got a taste of his own medicine when the trial judge not only dismissed the case against the cleaners, but is also making Pearson pay the court costs and $100,000 attorney fees to the immigrant owners. 
   The cleaners lost his pants, but now he is losing his shirt, as it ought to be. Shame on Judge Roy Pearson for his abuse of our legal system. Courts work to right actual wrongs, not award money to people who are just too big for their britches.

Not only France but Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom will be making 170 or more of the new Air Force supertankers built by that European subsidized company, Airbus.

   The Air Force is trying to do damage control by saying the Airbus is better than the Boeing plane. 
   Madam Speaker, that dog just won't hunt. U.S.-built planes have been successfully defending our skies and our homeland since before World War II. We are not talking about outsourcing some cheap Wal-Mart product that's made in China. We are talking about outsourcing sensitive military equipment.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding, the ranking member, and I also want to thank the chairman of this committee for bringing this legislation before the House, and, of course, my friend from California, the former Attorney General, Mr. Lungren, for his passion about this issue. 
   As a former judge and prosecutor down in Texas, I don't like drug dealers, and we see the effect of them throughout the United States. 
   This submersible vessel, this submarine we are talking about, Mr. Speaker, here is a photograph of it right here. It is 100 feet long. It is made out of fiberglass. It has stealth technology, so it is hard to be detected. It is built so it goes barely below the surface. It travels at a very low rate of speed so it cannot be detected by its wake. And they are made in the jungles of Colombia. 
   What they do, they float these down the rivers in flood season to the Pacific Ocean, and then this vessel is on its way. Mr. Speaker, it can go all the way to the United States without refueling. It takes several tons of cocaine with it, coming to the United States, bringing that cancer for the profit of the Colombian drug dealers. 
   What happens is our Navy and other navies, even the Mexican Navy, the Colombian Navy, they have seen these things on the high seas. They carry no flag. They claim no nation. What happens when they are encountered by the Navy or the Coast Guard, the five or six crew members, they jump out the hatch over here and scuttle the submarine so all the dope goes to the bottom of the ocean. 
   There have been two circumstances when the drug dealers that were on these submarines weren't quick enough. The Navy, the Coast Guard, got there quick enough to take some of the cocaine off, and they are being prosecuted in Florida as we speak. But most of the time they scuttle it, we capture, but really end up rescuing the crew, and then rather than put them in jail, we have got to take them home where they came from and let them go, because it is no crime to possess one of these subs on the high seas. 
   This legislation makes it a Federal offense to have one of these subs with no flag and sailing on the high seas. When the crew is captured, they could be prosecuted in our Federal courts and go to the penitentiary where they belong.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Conyers for pushing this legislation and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) for sponsoring this legislation. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a legal presumption in most countries, even Third World countries, that if you accuse somebody of something, you have to prove it, whether civil or criminal. The burden of proof is on the accuser. But that is not so in all countries when it comes to libel and slander. 
   Take Great Britain, for example. It goes back to when the King ruled the day. If you criticized the King, even if you were right, off with your head. One of the reasons that we formed our own country was the idea of freedom of speech and freedom of press and that is why we put those two fundamental principles first in our Constitution. I have a pocket Constitution that most Members of Congress carry with them, and the first amendment protects the right of a free press and freedom of speech. 
   What has occurred, though, throughout the courts in Great Britain in a libel case, in other words somebody writes something about somebody else, if the person that is the subject matter doesn't like it, they file a lawsuit in Great Britain, and the burden is on the person who wrote the document to prove it is true. The burden is not on the accuser like it would be in the United States. That applies not only in libel cases but slander cases. And it has taken place especially in books about Islamic terrorism throughout the world. 
   Writers critical of Islamic terrorists are being sued by wealthy sheiks and Saudi billionaires, specifically Khalid bin Manfouz, who was accused in ``Alms for Jihad'' of financing Islamic terrorists through Muslim charities. What he did, he got mad about the Cambridge University Press, and he threatened to sue Cambridge University Press. What happened in England, which I hope never happens with our press, they got so nervous about it that they started taking all of the books off the shelves, and they started destroying the books. In fact, they sent word throughout the world, if you have this book, ``Alms For Jihad,'' destroy the book. Kind of like the burning of books during World War II under the Nazis. So the Cambridge University Press gave in because the libel laws are different than they are in the United States. 
   It has also occurred here in the United States with a similar book called, ``Funding Evil,'' written by Rachel Ehrenfeld. What she did was write a book in the United States, published in the United States. But some books, 23, worked their way to England. Here we go again. This author was sued in the courts of England and had the burden of proof to prove that her statements were true. Well, she filed suit against the people who sued her, once again bin Manfouz, and that lawsuit is now pending in our courts.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (PROHIBITING RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN DEFAMATION JUDGMENTS -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. So our courts are hearing this matter and it is all about the freedom of speech and the freedom of press.  That is a human right. That is a universal right in this world, whether the courts in Great Britain recognize it or not. And it is important that people be free to write the truth and not suffer the consequences from it and certainly not have to prove what they say is true just because somebody objects. 
   This legislation is good to protect the publishers and writers in the United States that if they are sued in foreign courts, that those judgments will not be upheld unless that law, that judgment would be upheld in courts in the United States. 
   This is important legislation. I would like to put into the Record an article from the San Francisco Chronicle talking about this entire concept of libel tourism.  
   Libel Tourism: Where Terrorism and Censorship Meet  
   It has become popular for those with competing political agendas to allege threats to free speech, whether real or imagined. Yet, there is a very real threat to free speech that has received little attention in the public sphere. It's called libel tourism and it has become a major component in the ideological arm of the war on terrorism. 
   At question is the publication of books and other writings that seek to shed light on the financing of Islamic terrorism. Increasingly, American authors who dare enter this territory are finding themselves at risk of being sued for libel in the much more plaintiff-friendly British court system in what amounts to an attempt to censor their work on an international level. 
   The latest case of libel tourism to rear its ugly head involves the book ``Alms for Jihad,'', which was published by Cambridge University Press in 2006. Co-written by former State Department analyst and USAID relief coordinator for Sudan J. Millard Burr and UC Santa Barbara professor emeritus of history Robert O. Collins, ``Alms for Jihad'' delves into the tangled web of international terrorist financing and, chiefly, the misuse of Muslim charities for such purposes. 
   Among those the book fingers for involvement is Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz, the former chairman of Saudi Arabia's largest bank, National Commercial Bank. Bin Mahfouz has come under similar scrutiny on previous occasions, including being named a defendant in a lawsuit filed by family members of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He even has a section of his Web site devoted to trying to refute such charges. 
   With this in mind, Cambridge University Press lawyers looked over the manuscript for ``Alms for Jihad'' carefully before giving it the go-ahead. According to Collins, the passages involving bin Mahfouz are, in fact, quite ``trivial'' compared to the wealth of information contained in the book on how such funds are used to finance conflicts around the globe. 
   Yet, it is bin Mahfouz's inclusion in ``Alms for Jihad'' that has proven to be the most problematic, for he soon threatened Cambridge University Press with a libel lawsuit. Before the suit could commence, Cambridge University Press capitulated and announced in July that not only was it taking the unprecedented step of pulping all unsold copies of ``Alms for Jihad,'' but it was asking libraries all over the world to remove the book from their shelves. Cambridge University Press issued a formal apology to bin Mahfouz and posted a public apology at its Web site. It also agreed to pay his legal costs and unspecified damages, which, according to bin Mahfouz, are to be donated to UNICEF. 
   Authors Burr and Collins, however, did not take part in the apology, nor were they a party to the settlement, and they continue to stand by their scholarship. As Collins put it, ``I'm not going to recant on something just from the threat of a billionaire Saudi sheik ..... I think I'm a damn good historian.'' The authors were aware that Cambridge University Press's decision was based not so much on a lack of confidence in the book as on a fear of incurring costly legal expenses and getting involved in a lengthy trial. The British court system is known as a welcoming environment for ``libel tourists'' such as bin Mahfouz. The Weekly Standard elaborates: ``Bin Mahfouz has a habit of using the English tort regime to squelch any unwanted discussion of his record. In America, the burden of proof in a libel suit lies with the plaintiff. In Britain, it lies with the defendant, which can make it terribly difficult and expensive to ward off a defamation charge, even if the balance of evidence supports the defendant.'' 
   Bin Mahfouz has indeed availed himself of the British court system on many occasions, having either sued or threatened suit against Americans and others at least 36 times since 2002, according to Rachel Ehrenfeld, author and director of the American Center for Democracy. 
   Ehrenfeld should know, as her own book, ``Funding Evil: How Terrorism is Financed--And How to Stop It,'' was also targeted by bin Mahfouz through the British court system. Bin Mahfouz sued Ehrenfeld for libel in 2004, soon after her book's publication in the United States, even though only 23 copies ever made it to the United Kingdom. 
   Ehrenfeld would not, as she put it in the New York Post, ``acknowledge a British court's jurisdiction over a book published here'' and a trial was never held, but the court ruled in favor of bin Mahfouz by default. It also awarded bin Mahfouz $225,913 in damages and ordered Ehrenfeld to apologize publicly and to destroy all unsold copies of the book. 
   Instead, Ehrenfeld chose to fight back. No doubt aware of the larger implications at work, she took her case to the United States and, giving bin Mahfouz a taste of his own medicine, sued him in a New York federal court on the basis that ``his English default judgment is unenforceable in the United States and repugnant to the First Amendment.'' 
   Civil-liberties lawyer Harvey Silverglate has described her case as ``one of the most important First Amendment cases in the past 25 years'' and sure enough, in June of this year, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that it deserved a hearing. The court will begin hearing arguments this fall in what could turn out to be a pivotal case involving the clash between First Amendment rights and foreign libel rulings. 
   Ehrenfeld may indeed have a strong case. She maintains that bin Mahfouz has a long history of involvement in terrorist financing. The bulk of it, she wrote in 2005, revolves around the now-defunct Muwafaq (Blessed Relief) Foundation, which was founded by bin Mahfouz and ``identified by the U.S. Treasury Department as providing logistical and financial support to al Qaeda, HAMAS, and the Abu Sayyaf organizations.'' Ehrenfeld recapped her concerns more recently: ``The data in both Alms for Jihad and Funding Evil is all well-documented by the media and the U.S. Congress, courts, Treasury Department and other official statements. Further corroboration comes from French intelligence officials at the General Directorate of External Security (DGSE), as reported in the French daily, Le Monde. For example, the DGSE reported that, in 1998, it knew bin Mahfouz to be an architect of the banking scheme built to benefit Osama bin Laden, and that both U.S. and British intelligence services knew it, too.'' 
   For this reason, and also to create a precedent, Ehrenfeld has been the only defendant so far not to settle with bin Mahfouz. And she refuses to ``acknowledge the British Court and its ruling'' to this day. 
   Ehrenfeld's success thus far countering bin Mahfouz mirrors other indications that libel tourism may be backfiring. The largely Internet-based furor over the attempt to squelch ``Alms for Jihad'' and what is widely seen as Cambridge University Press' cave-in has caused the book's price to skyrocket. A copy of the book sold on eBay this month for $538. As noted at the blog Hot Air, ``By suing publisher Cambridge University Press into submission, Khalid bin Mahfouz has turned an obscure scholarly book on the financial workings of terrorism into a prized, rare book.'' 
   In addition, the American Library Association is rising to the occasion. Rather than going along with the Cambridge University Press settlement stipulation that American libraries remove ``Alms for Jihad'' from their shelves, the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom issued the following statement earlier this month: ``Unless there is an order from a U.S. court, the British settlement is unenforceable in the United States, and libraries are under no legal obligation to return or destroy the book. Libraries are considered to hold title to the individual copy or copies, and it is the library's property to do with as it pleases. Given the intense interest in the book, and the desire of readers to learn about the controversy first hand, we recommend that U.S. libraries keep the book available for their users.'' 
   Reportedly, Collins and Burr got the publishing rights to the book back from Cambridge University Press and, according to the Library Journal, have had ``several offers from U.S. publishers.'' It appears the ``Alms for Jihad'' saga is far from over and free speech may yet win the day. 
   In another victory for free speech, as well as an instructive example of what such libel suits look like when attempted in the United States, a recent case involving Yale University Press proves useful. It involved a book written by Matthew Levitt, the director of the Stein Program on Terrorism, Intelligence and Policy at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, titled ``Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad.'' 
   In his book, Levitt disputes the notion, popular among Hamas apologists, that the group's terrorist and social service pursuits can be seen as separate. In the process, he implicates the Dallas charity KinderUSA, which allegedly raises funds for Palestinian children, in terrorist financing. The group has personnel connections to the now-closed Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, which has been under investigation by federal authorities for funding Hamas. KinderUSA has also come under investigation and as a result, in 2005 suspended operations temporarily. 
   All of this information is available to the public and the book was thoroughly fact-checked prior to publication. Levitt, who is a witness in the ongoing trial of the Holy Land Foundation, explained further that he ``conducted three years of careful research for Hamas, and the book was the subject of academic peer review.''  
   But this didn't stop KinderUSA and the chair of its board, Dr. Laila AI-Marayati, from filing a libel suit in California in April against Levitt, Yale University Press, and the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. They disputed a particular passage from the book, as well as alleging that Yale University Press did not subject it to fact-checking. But, in filing the suit in California, they were faced with a formidable challenge: the state's anti-SLAPP statute. According to Inside Higher Education: ``KinderUSA asked the court for an injunction on its request that distribution of the book be halted, and also sought $500,000 in damages. But in July, Yale raised the stakes by filing what is known as an ``anti-SLAPP suit'' motion, seeking to quash the libel suit and to receive legal fees. SLAPP is an acronym for ``strategic lawsuit against public participation,'' a category of lawsuit viewed as an attempt not to win in court, but to harass a nonprofit group or publication that is raising issues of public concern. The fear of those sued is that groups with more money can tie them up in court in ways that would discourage them from exercising their rights to free speech. Anti-SLAPP statutes, such as the one in California with which Yale responded, are tools created in some states to counter such suits.'' 
   Not only did Yale University Press stand by its author, but, in the end, its aggressive response to KinderUSA paid off. It was announced this month that the libel suit has been dropped and no changes to the book or payments to the plaintiffs will be forthcoming. KinderUSA claims that it dropped the suit because of the costs involved, but it's more likely it felt that it could not win. If the case had been brought in the United Kingdom, the outcome could have been far different. 
   This is why Americans must be vigilant about protecting their free speech rights, even when the threats at hand do not fit into the politically correct playbook. Certainly not all Muslim charities and Saudi businessmen are involved in financing terrorism, but the overwhelming amount of evidence pointing to existing links deserves attention, as do the fervent attempts by interested parties to silence those trying to bring the truth to light. It is crucial that they not succeed.

   Mr. POE. I want to thank the ranking member for yielding and thank the chairman for bringing this legislation to the floor, and also my good friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lungren) who has been helping relentlessly to get some legislation passed to stop this criminal endeavor into the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, the drug dealers find new ways to bring this cancer, cocaine, into the United States. And now what they're doing in the hills and jungles of Colombia is they build these fiberglass boats, submarines, that are about 100-foot long that can bring in several hundred million dollars worth of cocaine into the United States. They float them down the river into the Pacific Ocean. Here is one of these vessels here. It is about 100 feet long. It's fiberglass. 
   These vessels can go all the way from Colombia to the United States without refueling. They are built with stealth technology so they're very difficult to find by our Navy and our Coast Guard. They go very slowly so they can't create a wake. And they bring this stuff into the United States. 
   The problem is that when our Navy and our Coast Guard find one of these ships on the high seas, these ships have no flag, they're not under any flag of any nation, the crew members on the ship, usually five to six members, will scuttle the submarine. It will sink to the bottom of the ocean, taking with it the cocaine. Then the five or six crew members that are on this submarine have to be rescued by our Navy and then taken back where they came from, usually Colombia or Guatemala or whatever nation they came from. And they can't be prosecuted because there is no crime of the high seas to have one of these in your possession. 
   And what this legislation does is basically says ``no more.'' You cannot be a crew member of one of these submersible subs and if you are captured, whether the boat is captured or not, you have committed a criminal offense, and now a civil penalty can be imposed on you as well. The Coast Guard tells us that at any given time, Mr. Speaker, there are 100 of these on the high seas working their way to the United States. And it doesn't take much common sense to realize that these same vessels that use and bring in cocaine can bring in other material into this country, things that will do us harm, like explosive devices. And they're so shallow they can go up our ports and our seaways and cause damage. So this legislation is important for two reasons. It is a national security issue. And second, it's a way of keeping that cancer, cocaine, out of the United States. I applaud this legislation to make it a criminal offense and a civil offense to be in possession of one of these subs on the high seas.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (THE LAST DOUGHBOY--THE LONE SURVIVOR -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, it was 90 years ago this November that World War I was over; the 11th month, 11th day, 11th hour, it ended. 
   Frank Buckles was in that war and is the last of his generation. Of the 4.7 million Americans that were mobilized during the First World War, Frank Buckles is the very last doughboy. 
   His remarkable life began in Bethany, Missouri, where he was born in 1901, during the administration of President McKinley. At the tender age of 16, Buckles lied his way into the United States Army when he enlisted to fight in the First World War. He was rejected by several recruiters, but he was not deterred until he finally found a recruiter that would take him. He joined the United States Army, and he drove an ambulance in Europe during World War I. 
   Mr. Buckles served in the First World War, and was held then as a prisoner of war by the Japanese for 3 years during World War II. 
   At the incredible age of 107, Frank Buckles has lived through 46 percent of our Nation's history. Today, he resides on the family farm he purchased near Charlestown, West Virginia, purchased after the first war. 
   Mr. Buckles is one of the forgotten veterans of a forgotten war. He is the lone survivor of World War I. 
   During World War I, nearly 116,000 United States warriors gave their lives for this country. 4.7 million served, and they changed the tide of that stalemate war and ensured victory for the Allies. When the doughboys landed in France, our allies were impressed with their fighting spirit, and their tenacity stunned our enemies. When they returned to the United States, there were no parades or major memorials established in honor of them. They returned to the Roaring '20s, and America didn't want to talk about the war because America had decided to move on. Then the depressions of the 1930's hit, and the service of the veterans became a distant memory. Then World War II came, and America never got around to honoring the World War I vets. 
   Today, we have three memorials to our major wars on modern history on the National Mall. They were built in order: Vietnam Memorial, then the Korean Memorial, and then the World War II Memorial. They were built in reverse order. But there is no national memorial, Mr. Speaker, for the World War I veterans. This was the war that was supposed to be the war to end all world wars. 
   World War I marked the beginning of the history of modern war. It was the war that brought America into the forefront as a world power. It was the first war to be fought on three continents. And World War I was the first industrialized war with the introduction of major technology in weaponry like machine guns, tanks, artillery guns, and airplanes. 
   In the 3-week long Meuse-Argonne Offensive, the largest U.S. engagement, 18,000 Americans were killed. Approximately 1,000 doughboys a day were killed. Some are still buried in Europe in graves known only by God. 
   Many of the servicemembers who survived the tolls of war and came back home to the United States had already contracted a deadly flu virus while they were in France, and many of them died in the United States after the war from that flu. 
   World War I should not be forgotten. In World War I there were no photographs taken, and after the war no blockbuster movies were made to tell the story.  
   So today, I was honored to be with Frank Buckles at a press conference at the D.C. World War I Memorial on the National Mall. 
   Since 1918, the men and women who served in World War I have gone without a national memorial to recognize their service to our country, and it is time that this changed. That is why I have introduced the Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act. This bill would restore the District of Columbia's World War I Memorial and expand it so it serves a location on our mall for all those that served in World War I. 
   After 90 years of no national recognition, it is time these doughboys were given the thanks that they are due. After all, Mr. Speaker, they were the ``fathers of the greatest generation.'' 
   When they went off to war in World War I, they sang the song of George M. Cohen, ``Over There,'' and it went something like this: 
   ``Over there. Over there. Tell the world that the Yanks are coming. The Yanks are coming, and we won't be back until it is over, over there.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time to honor the lone survivor of World War I and the other doughboys that went to war over there in the forgotten war, World War I, and build them that national monument on the mall. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Whether it be in Iraq or Afghanistan or aboard a ship in the Indian Ocean, the Red Cross messaging system can communicate between members of military families where other civilian means of communication cannot. American Red Cross officials are able to verify emergencies and relay information that is critical to a commander's decision whether to release a servicemember to allow him or her to return home during a time of family hardship. In addition to providing notification, the Red Cross often provides families in crisis with support until a servicemember can return home. 
   I want to thank the author of this resolution, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), for giving us this opportunity to commend the American Red Cross for its outstanding service to our country's troops and their families. The people of the United States are grateful for the dependable support that the American Red Cross has provide us in times of crisis for the past 127 years. 
   I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 937.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, there has been another tragic misapplication of the word ``honor.'' In Pakistan a 17-year-old girl was killed by her parents last week because she wanted an annulment from an arranged marriage, a marriage that she was forced into when she was 9 years old. That's right, 9 years of age, the age when most girls still play on the playground, enjoy cartoons, stickers, and still play with dolls, the age when little girls are still just little girls. Instead, at 9, Saira Bibi was robbed of her childhood and compelled to become the bride of a 45-year-old male. 
   After turning 17, Saira wanted out of her shotgun wedding and marriage; so she filed a legal suit, and eventually a judge granted an annulment. Unfortunately, Saira was only able to enjoy her newfound freedom for moments because the very same parents who stripped her of her youth stripped her of her life. These parents hired killers who gunned down their daughter Saira as she was walking out of the courthouse in Pakistan. 
   This is only one example of many so-called ``honor killings'' in Pakistan recently. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no honor in killing your children or murdering women in the name of religion. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I strongly support House Resolution 1069, which addresses and condemns the spread of encouragement to violence against America and Americans by Middle East-based media outlets. This is not a problem in theory, Mr. Speaker. When TV channels broadcast attacks by insurgents on U.S. soldiers in Iraq or newspapers publish repeated calls for the destruction of the United States, they further endanger the security of American civilians and military personnel in the Middle East. These channels are then broadcast on satellite providers that transmit not only to the region, but as far away as Europe, Asia, Africa and even North America.     
   We must do everything we can to prevent our enemies from recruiting potential insurgents and homicidal bombers. They must be prevented, from Beirut to London to New York, who seek to shed American blood wherever and whenever they wish. 
   Media outlets that provide financial, material, or technological support to violent Islamic groups should be held accountable for their hate speech that incites murder of American civilians and military. Given that recipients of U.S. aid, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, control many of the satellite providers that transmit such incitement, we should use our leverage to urge these nations to act responsibly and stop putting these calls for murder on the air of their television stations. 
   I again rise in very strong support of H. Res. 1069, and I urge my fellow members to do as well.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'm pleased to rise in support of House Resolution 1254 and join my colleagues in supporting the views and goals of the Joint Action Plan signed between the United States and Brazil to eliminate racial and ethnic discrimination and promote equality. I would like to thank the gentleman from New York, Congressman Engel, for introducing this important measure and appreciate the efforts by his office to ensure that it was a bipartisan effort. 
   On March 13, 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Brazilian Minister of Racial Integration Edson Santos signed the ``Joint Action Plan Between the Government of the Federated Republic of Brazil and the Government of the United States of America to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Discrimination and Promote Equality.'' This plan recognizes the commitments of our governments to promote equality and opportunity. It underscores the importance of cooperating in the promotion of human rights in order to maintain an environment of peace, democracy, and prosperity. And it also strengthens the ongoing and vital partnership we share with the country of Brazil. 
   Furthermore, the Joint Action Plan provides for the creation of a Steering Group to advance the understanding and exchange of information between the United States and Brazil and places a special emphasis on the role that education plays in both of our countries. 
   House Resolution 1254 recognizes the importance of the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan and highlights the commitment of our two nations to strengthen cooperation in the pursuit of these noble goals. It also serves to underscore and further advance our commitments to democracy in that region of the world. 
   This increased partnership will work to further enhance our longstanding relationship with Brazil, a key partner in the Western Hemisphere, and deepen the types of friendship between our two peoples. 
   I applaud the proactive efforts taken by both countries in confronting the ongoing challenges of inequity, and I'm confident that the U.S.-Brazilian Joint Action Plan will only work to further strengthen the historic bonds between our two nations. 
   I support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 1159, which recognizes the USS Constellation as a surviving witness to the horrors of the Transatlantic slave trade and a significant figure in United States efforts to end that practice. 
   In this bicentennial year of the abolition of the Transatlantic slave trade, this body has considered a number of resolutions condemning the horrors of slavery and recognizing the efforts of those who sought to combat it. Each of these resolutions has been important, not only for the purpose of preserving our history, but also for calling attention to the fact that today, 200 years after the formal abolition of the Transatlantic slave trade, slavery still continues. It endures in those areas where traffickers are enabled to engage in their inhumane and cruel trade. It thrives where human rights are abused and tyrants rule the day. 
   I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) for introducing this later effort to renew the charge of the United States to confront slavery in its various forms around the world while, at the same time, showing the historical significance of the USS Constellation. 
   On January 1, 1808, the act to ``prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or territory within the jurisdiction of the United States'' took effect. Eleven years later, the United States Congress authorized the Navy to cruise the coast of the African continent and take effective measures to suppress the slave trade. The USS Constellation served as the flagship in this effort from 1859 through 1861, leading the United States African Squadron, as it was called, as it captured 14 slave ships and liberated an estimated 4,000 Africans destined to be enslaved. Today the USS Constellation continues to serve as a museum and a tribute to the efforts of those who sought to end the horrors of the slave trade. 
   As such, this resolution specifically recognizes the historical and educational significance of the Constellation, and recommends it as an appropriate site for this Nation to commemorate the bicentennial of the abolition of the Transatlantic slave trade. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this important resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 344, which recognizes the impact that the global food crisis will have on vulnerable children in the developing world. This resolution reminds us all that the children of impoverished families are suffering even more today as a result of the rapid worldwide increase in prices of basic foods in recent months, such as wheat. 
   All of us are facing rising food and energy costs in our own homes and families, but for many around the world those changes are a matter of life and death. When we see newspaper photos of dying children, we see the urgency of this crisis for countless families throughout our world. 
   I am pleased that the President and the Congress have taken concrete steps to help poor people facing this dire reality by increasing America's food aid. Notwithstanding the challenges we face in our own communities, it is a testament to the enduring generosity of the American people that we remain the largest donor of food assistance in the world. Americans give of their wealth throughout the world, especially to people in need. 
   Many of the poorest people in developing countries work extremely hard to earn just a dollar or two every day, and then have to survive off that meager sum, managing somehow to find affordable food. It may be hard for some of us to imagine how difficult that is in other countries. 
   This resolution describes the food crisis and the many complications that children suffer as a result of lack of proper nutrition. It notes that 5 1/2 million children under the age of 5 die each year due to malnutrition caused by chronic hunger. It reminds us that even if malnourished children don't starve to death, they face a heightened risk of dying of numerous infections, as well as lifelong impacts on their physical growth and intellectual potential. 
   With that in mind, this resolution states the nutritional needs of children must be a humanitarian priority in our response to the current global food crisis. I commend the gentlelady from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) for introducing this measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work that the chairman and the ranking member have done on this initiative. However, I rise in opposition to this legislation before the House. As a former prosecutor and longtime judge in Texas, I am concerned about drugs and violence on the border, but I am also concerned about corruption. 
   According to the DEA, 500 people were murdered in Nuevo Laredo in 2005. None of those cases was solved. Many of those murdered were police officers. There have been 400 kidnappings in Nuevo Laredo. Forty-one of them were American citizens. None of them have been solved. 
   I doubt if anyone would be surprised to find out that the drug cartels are to blame for most of the violence on the border. What you might be surprised to learn is that U.S.-trained Mexican forces are behind some of the attacks. The Department of Homeland Security has reported that in the last 10 years, there have been over 250 incursions by suspected Mexican military units into the United States. 
   In order to gain control of access corridors in the United States, drug cartels are hiring hit men from an elite force in Mexico's military. This group is known as the ``Zetas.'' It has been reported that some of the Zetas are military deserters that may have been trained in the United States at the former School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Georgia. Reports claim that these forces were sent by the Mexican Government to the United States-Mexico border to combat drug trafficking. Instead, some of them deserted and became assassins for the Mexican drug cartels. Officials suspect that there are more than 200 Zetas. Between January and September of last year, nearly 5,000 Mexican soldiers deserted. Many of them went to work for the drug cartels because they pay more money. 
   The bill before the House today would authorize $1.5 billion in money, training and equipment over the next 5 years to Mexico. Most of that amount, more than $1 billion, would go, as I said, to Mexico. And Mexico in its arrogance objects to any conditions we want to put on this money. The administration can offer us no assurance that our equipment and training won't be used against us and neither can Mexico. 
   These forces are violent. They kill people and are a danger to the enforcement of our border, especially to our sheriffs. We've tried to work with Mexico in the past to stop drug trafficking. Every new president talks about how they are going to stop the drug trade, but it never has worked. Why should we send $1 billion to Mexico when we have no idea whether the goods we send will end up in the hands of corrupt Mexican officials and be used against us? Rather than sending all this money and equipment to Mexico and the lawless Mexican officials at the border, we ought to be equipping United States border sheriffs who can use this equipment to protect our homeland. We need to keep our money on this side of the border where we need it and where we can keep up with it. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (MAGINOT LINE OF INDIFFERENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the United States has gone to war numerous times to protect the sovereignty of nations. Sixty-four years ago on June 6, thousands of GIs went ashore in France because its borders were invaded by the Nazis. In fact, most of the European countries and north Africa had their sovereign borders overrun by the Nazis. 
   In the Pacific, the United States fought the Japanese because they had invaded the borders of our territories and the borders of China and Indochina. Americans died. Over 400,000 died protecting all of those borders during World War II. 
   After World War II, the United States defended the borders of Western Europe nations against that ``evil empire'' of the Soviet Union and Soviet Communism. In fact, we still have troops in Western Europe. Sixty years later, we still defend those borders. And that is a long time. Then there was the Korean War. In its aftermath with 50,000 Americans killed, we fulfilled our commitment to defend South Korea, and we still have 30,000 troops on that border with North Korea, 50 years plus defending someone else's border. We defend the borders of Iraq and part of the Balkans even to this day. 
   But Madam Speaker, I wonder why we don't have the same commitment to America's borders? Doesn't that bother anyone? Having been to the southern border of the United States numerous times and seeing the ``Maginot Line of Indifference,'' I am puzzled why we seem to ignore the thousands of trespassers, or invaders, if I can use that term, that come from all nations and cross our border without permission. 
   When Mexico invaded the United States at Brownsville, Texas, in 1846, we went to war to defend the southern border. When the outlaw, now folk hero, General Pancho Villa and his bandits came into the United States from Mexico to commit crimes in New Mexico, the United States sent General Blackjack Pershing to go after him, even if it meant going to Mexico. 
   That was during a time when our sovereignty was important to the Nation and to the Federal Government. But the invasion now is much worse. Some estimates put the number of illegals in the United States between 15 and 35 million people. Why don't we have the same moral resolve we had in World War II and Korea to defend our borders from this stealth invasion? It is the duty of government to protect the citizens of this Nation and the States. 
   I will read from the Constitution, something we probably ought to do more of in this Congress. Article IV section 4 of the United States Constitution says, ``The United States shall guarantee to every State in this union a Republican Form of Government and shall protect each of them against invasion.'' Invasion means intrusion or encroachment. Why doesn't the Government just simply follow the Constitution and prevent invasion into the United States? 
   Now some Chamberlain appeasers want to just tell the illegals they can stay. After all, we can use the cheap plantation labor, the appeasers say. Never mind the crimes some of them commit, never mind how they take some social services without paying for them, never mind how some live off Americans and lawful immigrants. Never mind it is illegal to be in the United States without permission. 
   So why, Madam Speaker, do we defend the borders of other nations but not our own? The Feds say they are trying. But the proof, or the lack of it, is in the results. The border with Mexico is violent. The border is porous, and the border is being invaded. The most powerful nation in the history of the world can stop the secret invasion if it first had the moral resolve to do so, and second, the courage to do whatever is necessary to stop the onslaught of invaders. 
   Maybe we should even use the National Guard or returning troops from Iraq on our southern border. But doing so would take leadership that is committed in word and deed to protecting the sovereignty of this Nation. 
   The United States is worth it, Madam Speaker, even if the amnesty crowd and Mexican President Calderon doesn't like it. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Saudi Arabian religious police will arrest its citizens for a multitude of ``sins.'' Last week, the religious police arrested 57 Arabian men in front of a mall in Mecca for, get this, the crime of flirting. The 57 men were dancing to pop music and not wearing traditional clothing. The religious police arrested them and refused to release the men unless they can prove they did not flirt with women. So much for innocent till proven guilty. 
   This is yet another example of when civil governments use their state religion of Islam to put their own citizens in jail for religious activity. 
   The powerful religious police make sure that women are covered up, that they don't wear makeup, that the sexes don't mingle, and that the stores close five times a day for Muslim prayers, and that men worship at the mosque. 
   Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia banned the sale of red roses and other symbols that marked Valentine's Day because they are connected with a Christian holiday. Saudi Arabia certainly cannot allow any religious dissension in their country. Saudi Arabia expects other countries to be tolerant of Islam but is intolerant of all religions except its own. I wonder if hypocrisy is a violation of the Islam religion?

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, as a former prosecutor and long-time judge in Texas, I'm concerned about, of course, drugs and corruption, especially on the international border between the United States and Mexico. I have great sympathy and compassion for the Mexicans living just south of the border, especially those that have had the problem of dealing with the drug cartels. It's an epidemic that occurs on our southern border with Mexico. 
   According to the DEA, 500 people were murdered in Nuevo Laredo recently. Most of those cases were never solved, and many of those individuals were peace officers. There have been 400 kidnappings in Nuevo Laredo; 41 of them were Americans, and none of them, not one of those cases, have ever been solved. And we understand now that behind most of those crimes of violence of murder and kidnappings are the drug cartels. What you might be surprised, Mr. Speaker, to find out is that many of those people involved in the drug cartels are former individuals in the Mexican military that were trained in the United States. 
   The Department of Homeland Security has reported that in the last 10 years also, there have been 250 documented cases of incursions by suspected Mexican military units into the United States. Most of them in Texas, California, and Arizona. Recently, I have been in a place called Neely Pass in Hudspeth County where the Mexican military was photographed coming into the United States. 
   In order to gain control of access corridors into the United States, drug cartels are hiring hit men from the elite Mexican military force, and this group is known as the Zetas. The Zetas are military deserters that are trained in the United States at the School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Georgia, as an elite force of anti-drug commandos. But unfortunately, after they were trained by Americans, they went over to the dark side. They were sent by the Mexican government to the U.S.-Mexico border to combat drug trafficking, but they switched sides, deserted the Mexican military, and worked for the drug cartels. Officials suspect that there are more than 200 Zetas, including former Mexican police officers. 
   And the problem isn't just at the border, either. The Zetas operate in the United States. Authorities have believed that the drug cartels and the Zetas are responsible for murders in the United States. 
   And there's a second group. The second group is called the Kaibiles. The Kaibiles were a special operations force in the Guatemalan military. Like the Zetas, many of them received training in the United States in counter-insurgency operations. And like the Zetas, many of them deserted the special forces and began to help the drug cartels. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have here a photograph taken by sheriff's deputies on the Texas-Mexico border, and this is a group of the Kaibiles. You notice they are all in uniform; they all have hoods on them. You notice the first person in the front is carrying an AK-47, and they're bringing cocaine into the United States in backpacks, and this is what has happened to these individuals that were trained in the United States and switched sides. 
   Now, the reason I bring all of this up, Mr. Speaker, is there is an initiative called the Meridia Initiative where the United States government is proposing to send $1.5 billion in training and equipment south of the American border into Mexico to help combat drug trafficking. While this may sound well and good, unfortunately, the truth of the matter is that we cannot trust the local officials on the Mexican side of the border because of the high rate of corruption because of these individuals that continue to switch sides. And it would be very unfortunate indeed if we sent equipment to the northern portion of Mexico, south of the American border, turned over this military equipment to the Mexican military to have it used against us as shown in this photograph.  
   It would be better money spent in training to send this $1.5 billion to the southern border to the second front where there is a war going on but keep it on the American side. Let the local officials, the State officials, let the sheriffs along the border use this equipment. Many of them don't even have enough equipment. As one of them has told me, they're outmanned and they're outgunned by the drug cartels. 
   So keep that equipment, keep that training on the American side of the border. Support the American cause before we turn this equipment and turn this training capability to the other side. And it's a sad fact of life that we can't trust sending money, equipment, and training south of the United States border because of the corruption that occurs in northern Mexico. 
   So I would hope that Congress, when this initiative comes up, that we have lively debate about this $1.5 billion; and before we send it all south of the border, that we rethink that and maybe spend part of that money, half of that money or most of that money, on the American side and let the border sheriffs of Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego use that equipment to fight the drug cartels, fight the crime on the American side of the border. I think that would be better money spent, American taxpayer money spent. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the youth of our Nation have always been willing to  volunteer and take care of the rest of us in times of war. Sometimes those young men and women give their lives for the rest of us. United States Army Corporal Scott A. McIntosh, of Humble, Texas, was one of those noble few. He was killed in Iraq on March 10, 2008 by a suicide bomber, and he was awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star. 
   Not only was he a loyal and courageous soldier, but he was a beloved son, a caring brother and a friend to many. 
   His life was special not just because of how he died, but also because of how he lived. He was both the kid next door and a proud soldier defending this Nation. 
   He was born on February 4, 1982 in Humble, Texas, and he graduated from Cypress High School in 2001. After trying college for a little while he decided it wasn't ready for him, and he joined the United States Army. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 64th Armor Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, in Fort Stewart, Georgia. He re-enlisted for three more years when his first tour of duty was over. 
   His parents, Alex and Gwenn McIntosh, did an excellent job raising such a fine son. His family described Scott as someone who loved people. His mission in life was to meet and make friends with every person he came in contact with. He shared his hearty laugh and always had a smile to give. Scott always had a positive outlook on life. He loved to hunt and fish in his spare time, but most of all he loved his family, the Army, the country he lived in and his life. 
   His smile matched his fun-loving personality, which carried over into everyday tasks, like work, with humorous results. 
   Eric McIntosh described his brother's comical attempt at being a golf caddy. When Scott went to work, he said, ``it was like a scene right out of the movie Caddy Shack. Scott barely showed up on time, still tucking his shirt in his pants and tying his shoes, and he would grab the golf bag and march down the fairway with all the clubs and balls falling out all over the place.'' 
   Scott would have fun with everything that he did and his joyful, worry-free personality was contagious to those that knew him and everybody around him. Not only did he love to laugh, but he truly cared about others, especially his family in Texas. 
   Scott was always looking out for other people, and that's why he joined the United States Army. He wanted to protect and serve those he loved. And as the Good Book says in John 15:13, ``Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.'' Scott's life was a shining example of this greater love which he demonstrated for family, friends and country. 
   Scott went off to war because he was a faithful son of America. Over Easter weekend this past weekend I had the opportunity to be in Iraq with our troops. And Mr. Speaker, there is no finer military in the long history of warfare than our troops that are in Iraq that proudly wear the uniform of the American fighting man. Scott McIntosh was among those elite fighting forces. 
   Scott's wonderful life is a huge loss to those that were close to him. His father said, ``My family is devastated by this loss, and it is something that we will have to carry with us for the rest of our lives. At the same time, however, we are bursting with pride for our son's service to this country. We understand the sacrifices required to keep this country free. And Scott was the best son anyone could ever have asked for. I will love and cherish him for the rest of my days.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a photograph of Scott McIntosh. He was a real person and he was proud to wear the uniform of the United States soldier. 
   In a moving speech at his brother's funeral, Eric told hundreds of friends and family that he loved his big brother. He thanked Scott for being such a good friend, a good son, a great person and the best brother anybody could ever have. 
   In a final act of sacrifice for others, his family has established the Scott McIntosh Memorial Fund. In the attack that took Scott's life, four other soldiers were also killed. Three of them were married and had small children. And the purpose of the fund will be to raise money for those kids who lost their fathers that were soldiers in Iraq. Even in death, the eternal spirit of Scott's love and care for others will continue. 
   We do not forget, as a Nation, Corporal Scott A. McIntosh and all those who sacrificed their lives on the altar of freedom. Scott's memory will live on in the hearts and minds of friends and family, while his life will always be an inspiration to Americans. 
   We can honor his sacrifice by following his example, to live life to the fullest and to take care of those people around us. 
   In 1940, a reporter, right before the great World War II, made this comment, he said, ``This nation will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave.'' 
   Our country, Mr. Speaker, will long survive and live free because of the likes of Scott McIntosh and his band of brothers. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Bill of Rights confers liberties on individuals to protect us from government power. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the second amendment. It states, ``A well-regulated militia, being necessary to a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'' 
   The second amendment confers two rights; it allows individuals to bear arms, and it allows for a state militia, or the National Guard. 
   There are several reasons for the second amendment. But notice the phrase, ``the right to bear arms.'' This is a military term. The colonists, who all owned firearms, were somewhat fearful of a strong Federal Government that would be oppressive and totalitarian. So it seems they wanted the right to protect themselves, individually and also collectively, through militias from not only outlaws but an outlaw Federal Government. 
   As the Supreme Court decides if the government can ban gun ownership, it would do well to adopt a lower court opinion which said, ``The right to bear arms was premised on the private use of arms for activities such as hunting and self-defense; the latter being understood as a resistance to either private lawlessness or the depredation of a tyrannical government.'' 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, today, the Supreme Court declared that lethal injection is a constitutional form of execution under the eighth amendment. The unofficial moratorium on the death penalty across this Nation is now over. 
   Two death row killers argued that lethal injection was cruel and unusual punishment. I was present at the Supreme Court today when in a 7-2 opinion the Court rejected the challenges of these two outlaws. They are both from Kentucky. One is Ralph Baze. He murdered a sheriff and a deputy sheriff 16 years ago when they were trying to serve him a warrant. Sixteen years later, Baze is still living while the two officers' families wait for justice. 
   The other killer, Thomas Bowling, murdered Tina and Edward Early outside their dry cleaning business 17 years ago. Bowling also shot the Early's 2-year-old son, but he survived, although he is an orphan today. 
   Baze and Bowling argued that there were risks of pain from lethal injection. Of course neither one considered the pain that they inflicted on their victims or their victims' families. 
   The Supreme Court rightfully decided that lethal injection is constitutional. Baze and Bowling earned the punishment that the juries imposed. Justice can be delayed no longer. It's time for both of these killers to have their judgment day. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, in Chicago, a 22-year-old woman is suing a Spanish language radio station. It seems she won a Corvette in the station's raffle, but the station won't give it to her. Why? Because she would not produce any identification. You see, a valid Social Security number or taxpayer identification number is required by law of the winner to get this type of prize because the winner must pay Federal taxes on the Corvette. The radio station strictly adheres to FCC contest rules. This person did not have either document. Why? Because she is illegally in the United States and because she won't pay the taxes, so the Corvette was withheld. 
   Never mind the station followed the law and the illegal is breaking the law by being in our country. She is now suing the radio station because she wants the Vette. She is also suing because of emotional distress. What arrogance this illegal has. The lawsuit should be thrown out of court, and when she gets to the courthouse they should put her in the jailhouse and deport her.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (CHIEF ERNIE MENDOZA -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, peace officers are a noble breed, daily risking their lives to protect and serve the rest of us. They are what separate the evil of the lawless from us. 
   Two weeks ago on a dark, cool misty Texas night, Needville, Texas, Independent School District Chief of Police Ernie Mendoza, was coming home from his job. He had been supervising a basketball game at one of the local schools. As chief of police of Needville Independent School District, it was his job to protect students during school and during events. 
   However, on the same road was 29-year-old construction worker Guillermo Paniagua. Guillermo was drunk and driving his pickup truck. He was headed toward the chief's car. And within moments Gulliermo's truck crossed the center stripe of the road, slammed head first into the chief of police's vehicle. The crash instantly killed this dedicated police chief. 
   The chief had devoted 25 years of his life as one of Texas's lawmen. It was something that meant a lot to him. He was proud to serve his country as a peace officer. He was a 1983 graduate of the Waco Police Department where he worked in this small central Texas town. 
   Then he moved on to the big city of Houston, Texas, where he worked with the Houston Independent School District Police Department, one of the Nation's largest school districts. And then in 1996 he accepted the position with the Needville ISD Police Department where he became chief of police. 
   ISD police officers have the responsibility to protect children and teachers while they are in school. They maintain law and order and discipline. They keep the kids safe from day to day. And Chief Mendoza was one of the best. He strived to be a positive role model for the kids he protected, and he made peace officers look good. 
   He took the time to talk to kids and was well liked throughout the school. But it all ended a mile from his own home and the indifference of a drunk driver. Like most drunk drivers, Guillermo had only minor cuts and bruises. He was not injured. But those bruises did not keep him, the coward, the killer, from running from the scene in the darkness of the night. 
   He was quickly captured by the Wharton County, Texas Sheriff's Department, and now he faces first-degree felony murder charges, and failure to stop and render aid. 
   You see, when you drink and drive and kill somebody, that is a felony, as it ought to be. Chief Mendoza's wife and four children are now deprived of  their husband, and father for the rest of their lives. The kids of the Needville school system have lost a good protector. 
   But, Madam Speaker, this was not Guillermo's first rodeo. You see, he has a total of four intoxication convictions in the United States, two in Texas and two in Georgia. In Texas he was given probation for a DWI, but that was revoked when he was rearrested. And then when he got that second DWI, he only spent 3 days in jail and got 18 months probation and his license was suspended. 
   This drunk should never have been given his driver's license back at all. His four DWI convictions proved that the system is not holding him accountable for being a drunk driver. 
   But the most disturbing thing about Guillermo Paniagua is he is illegally in this country. So why is he still here? How did he get a driver's license in the first place? Why was his immigration status not checked by the police officers each and every time he was picked up for drunk driving? He should have been deported the first time he was arrested. 
   Police Chief Ernie Mendoza was killed at the hands of an illegal, a drunk driver. And this could have all been prevented. He and his family have become more victims of the U.S.'s inability to secure the border and protect its citizens. 
   Madam Speaker, Chief Mendoza was a real person. This is a photograph of him taken shortly before he was killed. The Needville ISD and the great State of Texas have lost a fine lawman. And the casualty list continues to mount in the U.S. by those lawless insurgents who are illegally occupying our land. 
   This government should be as concerned about the homeland casualties as it is about those casualties killed in lands far, far away, or there will be more Chief Mendozas killed. 
   And that is just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Drill Nothing Congress is still determined to drive the price of gasoline up by not allowing offshore drilling for crude oil and natural gas. 
   Americans think we are held hostage by OPEC and dictator Chavez for our crude oil, but the real culprit is Congress. Congress holds the keys to freedom from OPEC and the little dictator, but will not unlock the big door to independence. 
   Congress should lift the offshore drilling ban in the Gulf coast, the east coast and even the sacred west coast. Then let each State and its people decide whether or not to drill off their shores. 
   Congress should let States receive a portion of the oil lease revenues oil companies pay Uncle Sam for the privilege to drill and States to use this additional revenue to fund education or whatever they wish. 
   The Drill Nothing Congress seems to want gasoline prices to continue to rise to punish Americans for driving gasoline-powered vehicles. Congress is the problem. In the court of American public opinion, Congress is wrong for its hardheaded, absurd policy of don't drill in America. Meanwhile, gasoline continues to rise in price.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD END COMMERCIAL WHALING -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, last November a fleet of Japanese whalers set sail to kill more than a thousand whales, including endangered humpback whales for the first time in the last 40 years. 
   After international outcry, Japan agreed not to hunt the humpback whales this year, but that has not stopped them from continuing to hunt and kill more than a thousand minke and fin whales. 
   You see, although an international moratorium against commercial whaling has been in effect since 1986, Japan and a handful of other countries have used a loophole in the international treaty, and in the name of pseudoscientific research, they have gone ahead and killed more than 11,000 whales. 
   After killing them for ``scientific research,'' as they say, they sold the whale meat and blubber on the commercial market. 
   Anyway, scientists in the field say that these hunts, conducted in the name of science, are really unnecessary because nonlethal research alternatives do exist. 
   Mr. Speaker, Moby Dick is in trouble, and it is time to close the loophole and make sure that endangered whales in our oceans are protected once and for all. In Herman Melville's book ``Moby Dick,'' Captain Ahab, who I think was from Massachusetts, died trying to kill off the whale population. Hopefully Japan's desire to eliminate the whale population, like in Moby Dick, will fail as well, and Japan and a handful of other countries will cease the whale hunts that are taking place.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (DAD--AMERICAN GI -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, born in the 1920s, he grew up in the Depression of the 1930s, and like most rural American children, he grew up poor. Fresh vegetables were grown in the family garden behind the small frame house. His mother made sandwiches for school out of homemade bread. Store-bought bread, as he called it, was for the rich. He grew up belonging to the Boy Scouts, playing the trumpet in the high school band, and he went to church almost every Sunday. 
   In 1944, this 18-year-old country boy who had never been more than 50 miles from home finally found himself going through basic training for the United States Army at Camp Walters in Camp Walters, Texas. After that he rode the train with hundreds of other young teenage American males to New York City for the ocean trip on a cramped Liberty ship to fight in the great World War II. 
   As a soldier in the 7th Army, he went from France on to survive the Battle of the Bulge and through the cities of Aachen, Stuttgart, Cologne, Bonn and others. He thought General Patton was the greatest soldier that ever lived, and as a teenager, this young soldier saw the concentration camps and the victims of the Nazis. He saw incredible numbers of other teenage Americans buried in graves throughout France. One monument to those soldiers is on the cliffs at a place called Normandy. 
   After Germany surrendered, he went back to Ft. Hood, Texas, expecting to be reequipped for the land invasion of Japan. It was there he met his wife at a Wednesday-night prayer meeting service at church. 
   Until a few years ago, this GI would never talk about World War II, and he still will not say much except he does say that heroes are the ones that are buried in Europe today. 
   After the war, he opened a DX service station where he pumped gas, sold tires, fixed cars and began a family. Deciding he needed to go to college, he moved to west Texas and enrolled in a small Christian college called Abilene Christian College. He and his wife and his two small children lived in an old converted Army barracks with other such families. He supported his family by working nights at KRBC radio and climbing telephone poles for Ma Bell, later called Southwestern Bell. 
   He finished college, became an engineer and worked 40-plus years for Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in Houston, Texas. He turned down a promotion and a transfer to New York City because it was not Texas, and he said it was no place to raise a family. 
   This GI, my dad, instilled in my sister and me the values of being a neighbor to all, loving our country, loving our heritage and always just doing the right thing by all people. 
   He still gets mad at the Northeastern media. He flies the flag on holidays. He goes to church on Sunday, and he takes Mom out to eat every Friday night. He stands in the front yard, and he talks  to his neighbors. He can fix anything. He knows more about world events than most politicians. He still mows his own grass, even though he's over 80 years of age, and he has a strong opinion on politics and world issues. He gives plenty of advice to all people, including me. He has two computers in his home office. He sends e-mails to hundreds of his buddies throughout the world. 
   Dad and Mom still live in Houston not far from where I grew up. My dad is a charter member of the Greatest Generation. He was proud to be in the United States Army, but he, like many Americans of that generation, get emotional about the ones who died for this Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, not far from this Capitol is the World War II memorial that honors those who never returned from Europe, Africa, the South Pacific in the great World War II. This memorial lists the battles, the names, and the States and the territories where those warriors called home. In the back of this memorial is a massive bronze-looking plate, but on closer inspection, Mr. Speaker, it's not a bronze plate at all. It's actually 1,000 bronze stars. Each star represents 400 Americans killed for our country in World War II, 400,000 Americans, mostly kids in their teens and in their early twenties who gave their youth for our future. Further down the Mall are the memorials for Vietnam and Korea, and in the brush is the World War I memorial that is hidden among the trees. 
   So today, Mr. Speaker, as we approach Memorial Day to honor those who have fought in the great World War II, and all American wars, we honor not only my dad and those who returned in victory, but also, we honor all those American heroes who never returned and for whom the bugles have played Taps for the last time. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, this Memorial Day, we honor the warriors of America whose lives were taken in their youth for their country's future. In Southeast Texas, 18 of these men have been killed in Iraq in sacrifice and service for the rest of us. One of those was 20 year old Lance Corporal Anthony Aguirre of Channelview, Texas. 
   While on patrol with 20 other Marines in the desert sands of Al Anbar Province, Lance Corporal Aguirre stepped on an improvised explosive device. Since America's enemies hide in caves and won't face off with our troops, these cowards of the desert use these explosives to kill Americans. Rather than immediately jump off the IED, however, Aguirre stood firm and told his fellow Marines to clear the area. When his buddies were safe, he took his foot off the bomb. He died so others could live. Amazing men, these young Marines of the United States Marine Corps. 
   Later, as the funeral procession passed through the streets of Channelview, the crowds, estimated at 8,000, waved flags and stood in silence along the rural roads for this Son of Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, Lance Corporal Aguirre and his fallen comrades are why we have Memorial Day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the number one polluter of oil off our coast is Mother Nature. Crude oil seeps to the surface, and Mother Nature causes 62 percent of the crude oil pollution off our coast. 
   So the way we resolve this problem and get even with Mother Nature is we ought to drill where Mother Nature has that oil, take it out from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, and use it to take care of America. 
   But there is a problem with that. We don't drill anywhere except off my native Texas coast, off Louisiana, Mississippi, and part of Alabama. The rest of this, where it is red on this chart, is prohibited. 
   It is time for Congress to take the handcuffs off of this inaction and allow leasing off these shores. 
   Now they say that the oil companies have enough leases; why don't they drill there. The problem is when they drill there, they get a dry hole. And common sense says when they get a dry hole, they quit drilling even though they must continue to pay for those leases. 
   So it is time to let America take care of America. It is time to let our oil go and take care of ourselves, otherwise this red area that we see here will remain off-limits, and it should be drilled for the crude oil to take care of our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, they say it's not safe to drill offshore because, they say, oil rigs are polluters of crude oil. So the lesson for today is: Where does the oil pollution from off our coasts come from? 
   Let's keep it simple. This is a chart. This is a chart that shows oil pollution from off our coasts. It comes from the National Academy of Sciences. It gives four sources. 
   As shown by the blue line, the number 1 polluter of crude oil off our coasts comes from Mother Nature. Sixty-three percent of the crude that has polluted our coasts and our gulfs comes from Mother Nature. It seeps from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico to the surface, 63 percent. 
   The number 2 polluter, as shown by the green line, is recreational boating. Thirty-two percent of the pollution of crude oil comes from boating. 
   The number 3 source, shown by the yellow line, appropriately so, is from tankers from overseas, 3 percent. It's those tankers, for example, that come from Saudi Arabia that are polluting our oceans by leaking crude oil, but it's only 3 percent. 
   As shown by the red line, the little bitty red line, 2 percent of offshore drilling rigs cause 2 percent of that oil pollution. 
   Let's do it again, Madam Speaker, to make sure it takes. 
   As shown by the blue line, the number 1 polluter of our oceans and off our coasts is Mother Nature. Sixty-three percent of that pollution seeps from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico to our shores. Mother Nature is the number 1 villain. 
   The number 2 culprit, as shown by the green line, is recreational boating. It causes 32 percent of that oil pollution off our shores. 
   The number 3 culprit, as shown by the appropriate yellow line, are rigs or, rather, tankers from other nations such as Saudi Arabia, causing 3 percent of the pollution. 
   Lastly, the number 4 culprit of 2 percent, as shown by the little bitty red line, are those nasty offshore drilling rigs. 
   So, Madam Speaker, maybe it's time we look at the facts and realize that  the lesson for today is we should not be punishing America by refusing to drill offshore. Maybe we should drill offshore because we can do so safely and because it has been proven in the past that we can drill safely. There is only a small portion off the U.S. coasts where leasing is allowed, but we know there is crude oil off the east coast, off the sacred west coast and even in other areas of the Gulf of Mexico, so maybe we should drill there as one solution to the problem of high gasoline prices. We need more supply, and this is one way to do it. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to congratulate President Nicolas Sarkozy on his election to the presidency of France, and also welcome him to Washington, DC, as he addresses a joint meeting of this Congress on Wednesday of this week. I look forward to hearing his remarks in this Chamber. 
   This past May, Mr. Speaker, Nicolas Sarkozy became the 23rd President of France. His election has ushered in a new and welcomed era in positive relations between France and the United States. 
   The history of friendship between these two countries, the United States and France, runs deep and it runs wide. Since the American Revolution, we have shared a deep commitment to freedom and independence; both of our countries have. Perhaps one of the best early demonstrations of France's commitment to our shared heritage of freedom is the example of General Marquis de Lafayette--General Lafayette, a young Frenchman who believed so passionately in the cause of freedom and liberty for all individuals that he left his homeland of France and came to join the American colonies in their fight for independence against Great Britain. 
   It was General Lafayette who persuaded the French to help Americans in their fight for freedom and independence from Great Britain. He served courageously under the command of General George Washington. George Washington's and Lafayette's portraits both hang in this hall tonight. 
   General Lafayette is the only non-American portrait in the entire Capitol building, and is the only other portrait besides General Washington in this House Chamber. There is a reason for that; both of them, General Washington and his friend Lafayette, were committed to liberty for all. 
   The American people will always be grateful to the commitment of General Lafayette and the people of France throughout our pursuit for freedom and democracy through the American Revolution. And the American Revolution was successful because of their help.  
   In the same way, Mr. Speaker, we are hopeful that the election of President Sarkozy will renew the ties of friendship that bind our two countries and our long heritage together. 
   On the eve of the election, President Sarkozy said that ``American friends can rely on France's friendship. France will always be next to them when they need us.'' We are hopeful, Mr. Speaker, that in the midst of many international crises, most notably, the threat of nuclear Iran and the global war on terrorism, that France will remain an ally committed to world peace and democracy for all and continue to pursue freedom for all peoples throughout the world. 
   I am pleased to be the sponsor of legislation H. Res. 379, which honors President Sarkozy and his appearance before Congress. I look forward to his continued friendship and an alliance between not only him and the United States, but the people of France and the United States.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, there is a new immigration law in effect, and even Federal judges refused to stop it. 
   On November 1 it became a felony to knowingly harbor and hide illegals. It is against the law to give illegals driver's licenses or give them public benefits. Local police may now hold illegals  they arrest for felonies and detain them for Federal deportation. And employers must use the new Federal verification system to determine legal status of workers. 
   This, unfortunately, is not a new Federal law, but one passed recently by the Sooner State: Oklahoma. Apparently, Okies are frustrated with too few results from Federal enforcement folk so they passed their own State law on immigration. 
   And good for them. Hopefully, other States will follow. 
   Of course, noncitizen groups and the ``give America away'' crowd sued Oklahoma in Federal court. And they lost. Early results of the law indicate illegals are leaving Oklahoma, some even going back to their own country, as it ought to be. They are getting the message: come to America the legal way or don't come at all.

   The doom-and-gloom economic nay-sayers have predicted for years that the economy is in trouble, but the last years of economic growth have proved them wrong. Now this year, they say we are headed for a fearful recession. Well, we shall see.  
   In any event, some of these pseudoeconomic forecasters say we need to increase taxes to stimulate the economy. Well, that makes no sense. In fact, we ought to do just the opposite. We need to make the tax cuts permanent because tax cuts historically prove they work. They work to stimulate the economy. They did so under Presidents Kennedy, Reagan, and Bush. Americans need to keep more of their own money, and the economy will prosper. And who benefits from tax cuts? Anybody that pays taxes benefits from tax cuts. Americans who don't pay taxes are not affected.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, today it is cold in Washington. It is snowing. They say it may snow some more. But there are two places in the United States that are colder than in this city, and they are in separate places. They are two prison cells, Federal penitentiaries, where two border agents, now, today have spent one calendar year in confinement for doing their job on the Texas-Mexico border. 
   Madam Speaker, it seems as though border agents Ramos and Compean have been punished for doing what we hired them to do. Because, you see, when they were patrolling the Texas-Mexico border, a drug smuggler came into the United States bringing almost a million dollars worth of drugs into this country. They had a confrontation with this drug dealer. They both believed him to have a weapon. Shots were fired, and he disappeared in Mexico, leaving his load of drugs in this country. 
   Unbeknownst to them, they shot the drug smuggler. A few months later, our Federal Government relentlessly went and found this drug dealer, brought him back to the United States and gave him immunity from his crimes to testify against the border agents for, get this, a civil rights violation against him, the drug smuggler. They were tried and they were convicted and sent to the Federal penitentiary for 11 and 12 years. 
   But what the jury in that trial did not know was that the U.S. Justice Department, the Attorney General's Office, hid evidence in that case from the jury, because Madam Speaker, they not only made a deal with this drug smuggler not to prosecute him for bringing in a million dollars worth of drugs; while he is waiting to testify at the trial, he brings in another load of drugs. And then our U.S. Attorney's Office had the audacity for months to deny that ever occurred. 
   But now the truth has come out. Now we know. Now the whole world knows that that evidence was hidden from the jury. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has heard this case on appeal. We are waiting to see if they reverse the case because the U.S. Attorney's Office hid evidence that the jury should have heard because, you see, the star witness, the witness that the U.S. Attorney's Office made a backroom deal with, brought in other drugs. The jury should have known that to judge the credibility of the witness. And this is not the first time the U.S. Attorney's Office has done this. 
   In the year 2000, another border agent by the name of David Sipes came in contact with a human smuggler. He had a fight with him in the Rio Grande River as the human smuggler was bringing in people. And then David Sipes was prosecuted for, yes, a civil rights violation for assaulting the human smuggler. 
   In that particular case, the U.S. Attorney's Office did the same thing. They hid evidence from the jury. They hid from the jury that this human smuggler was given $80,000 as a settlement, that he was allowed to cross back and forth between the United States and Mexico, that he was given a Texas driver's license, a U.S. Social Security card. And also in that case, yes, that human smuggler, while waiting to testify, brought in another load of illegals into this country. 
   But in that case, the U.S. Attorney's Office was caught. A new trial was ordered because they hid evidence, and that jury in that case found David Sipes, border agent, not guilty because the U.S. Attorney's Office was not seeking justice but convictions. 
   It makes us wonder what our U.S. Attorney's Office is doing and what side of they border war they are on. They are supposed to be protecting Americans. They are supposed to be protecting the border agents. But yet they seem to prefer protecting human smugglers and drug dealers. That makes us wonder whether the Justice Department needs to be investigated as to their priorities, because this ought not to be. 
   Yet two border agents are still in prison 1 year today. They have served time, and they should be released. The President should pardon them, and hopefully the Fifth Circuit will do the right thing and order a new trial in this case. 
   Our government needs to be on the right side of the border war and support our border agents and make people understand that you can't bring drugs and illegals into the country without being prosecuted. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (SUPPORTING NATIONAL NIGHT OUT -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, National Night Out is a crime prevention event that brings awareness to neighborhood crime. The idea is that people will come out of their homes, meet with their neighbors, and become more aware of issues in their community, especially crime concerns. 
   When people know each other that live around them, they are more apt to work together to prevent crime in their communities. Unfortunately, Americans today don't know their neighbors like they used to. My grandmother used to say that ``we quit knowing our neighbors when they quit building front porches on houses.'' Maybe there's some truth to that statement, Mr. Speaker, because not many people go and visit their neighbors, sit on the porch, and discuss important events like what's taking place in their community. 
   National Night Out allows neighbors to get together with their kids. Back home in Texas, some communities block off streets, eat barbecue and hot dogs, and invite the local police over to meet with the kids and the neighbors that they protect. 
   A neighborhood that has visible neighbors is a safer neighborhood. On National Night Out in August, there will be less burglaries, car thefts and vandalism because neighbors will be with other neighbors on watch, protecting the neighborhoods they call home.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (DRUG TRAFFICKING VESSEL INTERDICTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California for yielding and for cosponsoring and offering this legislation to capture the individuals who sail these vessels. 
   Mr. Speaker, here's a photograph that was taken of one of these submersible vessels that we have been talking about this evening. As you can see, it's blue like the water, but it also, as the gentleman from California pointed out, has stealth capability. And these vessels are able to go from the coast of Columbia all the way to the United States without refueling. They are made by the drug cartels in the jungles of Columbia. They're floated down river, and they set sail for the United States. 
   The United States Coast Guard has brought this to the attention of Congress. What happens is they come upon one of these vessels that are stateless, they have no flag, and as soon as they come upon one of these vessels carrying 9, 10, 11 tons of cocaine, the crew scuttles the vessel. It sinks to the bottom of the ocean, and then the Coast Guard or the United States Navy has to rescue the crew and take care of them and send them back home even though they're criminals smuggling drugs into the United States. 
   So to prevent that from happening anymore, these stateless vessels will be a crime to be in possession of one of these on the high seas. Thus when our Navy or the Mexican navy, as Mr. Lungren pointed out, last week came across one of these vessels, it would be a crime to be in the possession of one of these vessels, and the crew members can be prosecuted for being on board one of these vessels. 
   The Coast Guard has reported that at any one time, there are over 100 of these vessels on the high seas all headed to the United States, all bringing cargo, drugs or even people. And, Mr. Speaker, this is a photograph of it. And this other chart shows where the United States Coast Guard came across one of these vessels. The crew tried to scuttle it, but it didn't sink fast enough. So the Coast Guard got on board, recovered some of the drugs, captured the outlaws, and they're being prosecuted in Florida as we speak. 
   So this bill, which I hope all Members of Congress support, will help us fight the sea trafficking of these drug cartels who are relentless in bringing that cancer into the United States. 
   And, lastly, as pointed out previously, these things are so shallow, even though they are 100 feet long, they are so shallow they can go up our rivers and tributaries into the inner-most parts of the United States, and some of them might not even be discovered, and they could bring in weapons of mass destruction, and all types of weapons into the United States. 
   So it's time to make it a crime to set sail in one of these vessels, these submarines on the high seas, and prosecute these criminals who bring drugs into our country.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I bring you news from Iraq and the war profiteers that make money off this war. 
   According to the Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction and as reported by the Washington Post, a California contractor ``was paid $142 million to build prisons, fire and police stations that were never built or finished.'' 
   The Inspector General states, ``Millions of dollars in waste are associated with incomplete, terminated and abandoned projects.'' 
   The biggest fiasco was an incomplete prison that was so poorly constructed that the floors are collapsing. This facility is totally useless to the United States and Iraqi governments. 
   Mr. Speaker, it seems to me this is yet another example of incompetence, waste, and possible fraud against America. 
   If crimes have been committed, the Justice Department needs to prosecute anyone that steals money from America during this time of war, because the long arm of American law even reaches crooked contractors in Iraq. 
   And where shall we send these people? To the well-built Guantanamo Bay Prison where we house war criminals.

   War, no one wants war. But war will not end just because we quit, nor because we are weary of war, nor because we desire peace. The enemy will continue this war against us, whether we are in the fight or not. They do not want peace. There can be no peace until we stop them.

That's where we keep prisoners of war, those terrorists that have been captured on the battlefield that have tried to kill Americans. The uninformed have compared the place to a gulag and a dungeon. I have been there and the place is neither. 
   Be that as it may, some POWs are treated better there than our Border Agents Ramos and Compean, who were sent to Federal prison for shooting a  border drug smuggler. This is the case where our government let a drug dealer go free and put border protectors in prison for 11 and 12 years. 
   Most POWs at GITMO are not in solitary confinement. But the border agents have been in solitary confinement for most of their sentences. The POWs get 9 hours a day of exercise, including soccer. The border agents spend 23 hours a day in their cells. The POWs watch Arabic TV. The border agents watch no TV. The POWs receive the same medical treatment as the United States military, but one border agent was assaulted in prison and didn't see a doctor for 5 days. 
   Madam Speaker, only in America do we treat terrorists and POWs better in GITMO than we do border agents who went to prison for protecting the border.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (HONORING STAFF SERGEANT ERIC DUCKWORTH, UNITED STATES ARMY -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, in America's first war, fighting for freedom it was said by Patrick Henry, the great orator, ``The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active and to the brave.'' We are fortunate that those words still ring true today and that American soldiers overseas carry those values into battle. 
   One such warrior was Staff Sergeant Eric Duckworth. Army Staff Sergeant Eric Duckworth was killed in the line of duty in Iraq just a few days ago, on October 10, when he was leading a convoy and his vehicle was hit by an IED, an improvised explosive device, on the side of the road. 
   Madam Speaker, Sergeant Duckworth was 26 years of age and on his second tour in Iraq. He graduated from Clear Lake High School in Houston, Texas, in 1999, and while in high school, he wanted to participate in the military, so he joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps, the ROTC. Of course, as soon as he graduated from high school, he joined the United States Army. 
   His parents, Michael and Barbara Duckworth, of The Woodlands, Texas, say that for as long as they can remember, their son Eric wanted to serve his country in public service both in law enforcement and in the military. His father, Michael, described him as an outgoing and good-humored son. He further said, ``Eric was full of love and laughter and a Godly spirit, but, above all, he was a true soldier and a proud warrior.'' 
   When I talked to Michael about his son Eric, he told me that Eric's only two wishes were that he serve in the military and that he also serve in law enforcement. Those wishes were granted when he was a military police officer and also a member of the United States Army. 
   Sergeant Duckworth was also a husband and a father. He is survived by his wife of 5 years, Sonya, and they have three children: Kaylynn, age 10; Madison, age 4; and young Michael, age 1. Eric's mom, Barbara, would send what I call ``care packages'' overseas to her son Eric, and what she included in those packages tells us a lot about Eric  and his personality. He received beef jerky, bubble gum, NASCAR magazines, and Dallas Cowboy T-shirts. 
   Eric said that the Iraqi people were grateful to Americans for their sacrifice in Iraq. Sergeant Duckworth also said it was his destiny and his belief that he should be an American soldier. He shared that belief with his mother in their last conversation they had together before he was killed in Iraq. 
   Madam Speaker, Eric's father spoke of his pride in his son's firm belief and dedication to the mission in Iraq. Eric's father, Michael, said Eric believed in his purpose, and his children, his nieces, his nephews will all grow up in a better world because of Eric's dedication to America. 
   So not only Eric, but the whole Duckworth family felt it was important that Staff Sergeant Eric Duckworth serve in the United States Army overseas. Sergeant Duckworth's service to his family and the Army and this country will always be remembered. Of course he is one of those few proud American heroes. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a photograph of Staff Sergeant Eric Duckworth. He was a real person that lived and died for the rest of us. His service reminds me of the lyrics to a song written by Toby Keith that is titled, ``The American Soldier.'' Part of those lyrics say, ``I will always do my duty, no matter what the price. I have counted up the cost, but I know the sacrifice. I don't want to die, but if dying is asked of me, I will bare that cross with honor, because freedom doesn't come free. I'm an American soldier, an American soldier.'' 
   Staff Sergeant Duckworth, America appreciates your sacrifice on the alter of freedom for the rest of us, and we also appreciate the sacrifice of the entire Duckworth family down in Houston, Texas. We are sympathetic and grieve with this family, but are proud of their son who served in the United States Army. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the U.N. Human Rights Council was formed to have open, lively debate on the basic human rights of all peoples. However, some Muslim nations have put a strong arm on the council and prevented free discussions of practices that are advocated in the name of religion by a few Muslims. Those practices include female genital mutilation and so-called ``honor killings,'' or murder, of women. 
   One would think that the mutilation and killing of women would be a front-burner topic with the Human Rights Council. But some Muslims have said this subject is taboo and the discussion of this religious practice and the religious practices of other faiths is off-limits. 
   So much for the basic human right of free speech. 
   Those that advocate the mutilation and honor killings of women in the name of religion should be proud of this doctrine of faith and be able to justify it before the U.N. Human Rights Council. But I guess not. 
   By the way, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that in the history of humanity, more murders, tortures, and wars have been justified and done in the name of the world's numerous religions than any other reason or cause.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the New York Times called it the ``nightmare'' killings of Haditha, Iraq, and the ``defining atrocity'' of the Iraq War. Maureen Dowd of the New York Times referred to the incident as the ``My Lai Acid Flashback.'' Another New York Times reporter filed 36 stories on what he called the ``cold blooded killing,'' saying, ``This is the nightmare everyone worried about when the Iraq invasion took place.'' Self-proclaimed expert and ``worst person ever,'' Keith Olbermann of MSNBC, called it ``willful targeted brutality.'' Nation Magazine said of the event in Iraq that ``members of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment perpetrated a massacre.'' And even a Member of this House of Representatives said, ``Our troops overreacted ..... and killed innocent civilians in cold blood.'' 
   It has become the largest investigation in the history of Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which has 65 government agents assigned to this one case. Mr. Speaker, as a former judge and prosecutor, I have never heard of 65 criminal investigators assigned to one case except the 9/11 attack. 
   What is the terrible atrocity these news sources are talking about? 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, the Haditha, Iraq, incident took place in November of 2005 when our Marines were attacked by the use of a roadside bomb that exploded, killing one Marine and wounding two others. The Marines were then engaged in a firefight. Twenty-four Iraqis were killed, including some civilians. 
   After the gun battle was over and the smoke cleared, our government charged four Marines with murder and four others with not properly investigating the case. In a rabid rainstorm of criticism by U.S. journalists who were looking for the scalps of these eight Marines, the eight Marines were tried by a hysterical jury of journalists in the press and apparently found guilty on all charges. 
   But normally, Mr. Speaker, in America we try folks in our justice system and give them a trial before we send them off to the hangman and the gallows. Be that as it may, now, 2 1/2 years after expensive, intense, and thorough investigation, the facts as portrayed by the sensational National Enquirer-type journalists are not as they were portrayed to be. 
   According to columnist Michelle Malkin, who covered these cases in depth, seven of the eight Marines have had their cases dropped or dismissed. The eighth is awaiting trial in a real court, rather than the court of yellow journalism. 
   These journalists, ironically, are the same ones wanting to close down Guantanamo Bay prison and are worried about the treatment of those alleged terrorists there who may get cold blueberry muffins for their breakfast. But these writers could care less about the presumption of innocence for these eight U.S. Marines, seven of which have had their cases dismissed already. Only in America does the press get teary eyed about the Gitmo detainees but is blissfully ignorant about the justice in the prosecution of our Marines. 
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Marines are still in the midst of battle in Iraq and Afghanistan and standing vigilant in other places of the world protecting American interests and values. Those values include the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press to say anything it wants, even when the press is totally inaccurate and unfair in the expression of those fundamental rights. And for the U.S. Marines, we say Semper Fi. Semper Fi. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, in west Texas, where the rattlesnake rules the hard, rugged land is Edwards County. It is a sparsely populated place because not much grows on that dusty soil. Local landmarks include Devil's Sinkhole, a massive bat cave and a place called Bullhead. This land used to be the home of the fierce Lipan Apache Indians, dating all the way back to the 1600s. 
   This county, near the Texas-Mexico border, is the size of Delaware. On patrol of this massive place of over 2,000 square miles are only three deputy sheriffs. One of them is Gilmer Hernandez. 
   Recently, Deputy Hernandez was on patrol about midnight, alone. He came across a truck that had run a red light in the small quiet town of Rocksprings, Texas. He pulled the vehicle over and approached it. He noticed numerous people lying on the floor of the truck. 
   One thing led to another, and the vehicle sped off. Hernandez says the driver turned around and tried to run him down, so he fired numerous times at the vehicle. He shot out the tires. So the vehicle stopped and the occupants, they fled into the darkness. All except one, who was lying down on the floor, hiding in the back, wounded by a ricochet. 
   Deputy Hernandez immediately called the sheriff, Donald Letsinger. He immediately showed up, along with the Texas Rangers, to do routine follow-up work. 
   But then the Federal Government shows up and takes over the investigation. The Mexican Government is notified that an illegal from Mexico has been wounded in the United States. 
   Using poor law enforcement investigation techniques, the illegals are all interviewed together, but still give conflicting stories at a later trial. 
   After the dust settled, the Feds filed charges on Deputy Hernandez for firing a gun at the van. After being tried by a zealous prosecutor, Hernandez was convicted in Federal court. He is in jail waiting to be sentenced. And, yes, Madam Speaker, by the same Prosecutor's Office that prosecuted Compean. 
   Everyone in his hometown of Rocksprings, Texas has sided with Deputy Hernandez. They are taking care of his family. 
   But once again, our Federal Government has taken the other side, the wrong side of the border war. Our government is more concerned about illegals in the van than they are about the safety of Deputy Hernandez. 
   And get this: Our Federal Government even gave these illegals green cards and allowed them to stay in the United States. 
   Madam Speaker, this ought not to be. Deputy Hernandez did everything a normal person would have done in these circumstances, including immediately reporting the event. 
   Why is our government so relentless and zealous in prosecuting border protectors and not protecting the border? 
   Why does our government work backroom deals with illegals to convict our law officers?  
   Why does it seem the Federal Government is so quick to cooperate with Mexico to thwart border security? 
   And why does it allow these illegals more consideration than it does American peace officers? 
   Gilmer Hernandez is 25 years of age. He is married and has a young child. He makes $21,000 a year being a lawman in rough west Texas. 
   It is disturbing. This trend is disturbing. Our government is saying to peace officers on the border, don't protect yourself on this border because if you do, you will not get protection from the government. And to the illegals that come in and are caught, the Federal Government is saying to them, fear not. We are from the Federal Government and we are here to help you. 
   Looks like another case of the Federal Government continuing to swoop in and save the day for the illegals who cross into American land. 
   The American government needs to gets on the right side, the American side of the border war. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   The Texas parole board has been releasing violent offenders years before they are finished serving out their sentences, and then these violent criminals continue their lawless ways. 
   Keith Hines was supposed to be in the jailhouse for 30 more years for violent crimes against the citizens of the State, but the good old parole board gave him a get-out-of-jail-free card, and this was a fatal error. 
   On December 5, Hines robbed a gas station at gunpoint in Humble, Texas. The robber then ran to his vehicle to make his getaway. Witness, volunteer firefighter and good Samaritan, Steve Jackson, jumped into his car and followed Hines while relaying to 911 the locations of the hijacker. 
   Down the road, with Jackson in pursuit, Hines jumped out of his getaway car, ran up to Jackson's vehicle, shot Jackson twice and murdered him on the side of the road. 
   Hines is now charged with capital murder. All this because the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles let this habitual offender go every which way, including loose.

This ill-advised political decision will leave U.S. soldiers abandoned and at the mercy of an enemy that will exploit this weakness. 
   But this action by Congress is not new. A previous Congress did not like the way a war was going and tried to change the policy and tried to change the plan. That Congress even complained about funds for the war and wanted a new leader. 
   Good thing that commander pressed on and won the war. He said to those skeptics and cynics in Congress, ``We should never despair. Our situation before has been unpromising, and has changed for the better. So it will again.'' The war was the War for Independence, and the Commander in Chief was George Washington.

   In an effort not to offend wealthy Saudi banker Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the timid publisher cowered in fear and is pulping and destroying all known copies of its book ``Alms for Jihad'' that alleges the Saudi banker's ties to charities that fund terrorist organizations. The writers of the book stand by their work, however. 
   Mr. Speaker, here is the real problem. In the United Kingdom more and more frivolous libel suits are brought against writers and publishers by people with connections to terrorist groups because the United Kingdom court system is weighed in favor of suppression of controversial free speech in the marketplace of ideas. So many publishers like Cambridge are intimidated and are afraid to publish controversial topics. After all, the British court system is just too sophisticated to allow books to be printed that might offend someone. 
   The writers of ``Alms for Jihad'' should publish their book in the United States because we thrive on controversial speech, whether alleged terrorist sympathizers like it or not.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (ASSAULT ON THE CONSTITUTION -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court Justices decide cases based upon the cold written record of proceedings at the trial court. Eight of our nine Justices have never tried a case before a jury. Only one has in some very limited way. For the most part, they have been isolated from the real world all of their lives. They have dwelt in legal theory and constitutional construction, reconstruction and constitutional destruction during their entire judicial careers. They've not heard a witness testify or a defendant plead his case or have had to empanel a jury or have had to listen to little girls testify about graphic, brutal sexual assault. 
   The Constitution, especially the Bill of Rights, is not that complicated to most Americans, though we keep seeing the Star Chamber court of five Justices on the Supreme Court rule the opposite of the obvious meaning of the Constitution. The Supreme Court, especially recently, makes the Constitution, which is simple, complicated. They do so to twist and turn the Constitution to mean what they want it to mean. 
   At least five Justices follow the doctrine of former Chief Justice Charles Evans when he said arrogantly in 1935, ``We are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what [we] the judges say it is.'' 
   This is especially true in the case of Patrick Kennedy versus Louisiana. Here are the facts of that case: Patrick Kennedy sexually assaulted his 8-year-old daughter. So brutal was the attack that she nearly bled to death. She has had to have reconstructive surgery, and her life was only saved by the medical personnel who rescued her. Louisiana and a handful of other States have said that the death penalty is warranted when a person like Patrick Kennedy rapes little kids, especially little girls. 
   The Supreme Court, with Justice Kennedy writing the opinion, says that that just isn't fair to the criminal in this case. He overruled the will of the people of Louisiana, the legislature of Louisiana and the unanimous jury, who all found that Patrick Kennedy should be executed for his crime. Justice Kennedy reasoned that, since the victim lived, the defendant should not get the death penalty. However, there is no logic in that argument. 
   The victim, certainly, could have died. If medical people hadn't saved her life, she would have bled to death. She required reconstructive surgery that she will live with for the rest of her life. So the defendant gets a break: the right to live because the hand of God and the hand of the medical personnel saved the life of the victim. 
   What Justice Kennedy misses is that Louisiana punishes the act of the assault--raping little girls. That's why Louisiana has executed or has written the death penalty into its law. Whether the victim lives or dies should not be a requirement to face the death penalty in Louisiana. The act of child rape alone is dastardly enough to deserve the ultimate punishment. 
   But, in Justice Kennedy's mind, death must result or it is cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment in our Bill of Rights. Kennedy says the trend is away from the death penalty for anything but murder cases. He is wrong. For these six States that have the death penalty for child rape, these statutes are relatively new, and even our Code of Military Justice now allows the death penalty for child rape if anyone in our military rapes someone on a post or on a base. 
   Justice Kennedy also says it's not civilized to execute Patrick Kennedy. It's a violation of the eighth amendment. It's just not moral. But what is civilized or moral about now sending Patrick Kennedy to prison? How is that justice to Kennedy or to the victim to let him live? 
   Now he will be in prison at taxpayer expense at $40,000 a year. He will receive free medical, free Internet. He will have no responsibility. He will receive free legal services. He will receive three hot meals a day and a place to stay as long as he shall live. Is that justice? I think not. 
   We don't promise that to anyone. We certainly don't promise that to crime victims, because they're basically on their own after a crime is committed. Only the worst people among us get that benefit of our society, and those are child rapists. 
   Justice Kennedy's opinion is his own moral judgment. His opinion is not any more valuable than my opinion or my next-door neighbor's opinion for that matter. The difference is his opinion is the only one that counts under our Constitution. His opinion, as Justice Evans says, is the Constitution whether we like it or not. 
   Justice Kennedy is wrong. As my friend Alton Richards, a ranch foreman, has said, ``Patrick Kennedy is wasting good air breathing.'' 
   Victims are denied equal protection under the Constitution because Justices like Kennedy prefer to pander to child rapists rather than to give equal protection to little girls. The same Constitution that protects people like Kennedy should protect the rights of child victims.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, disturbing news: the U.S. military is smaller in size than any time in the last 50 years and continues to shrink, according to USA Today. But those who apply are larger than ever. 
   Only 1.4 million people wear the military uniform; 95 percent of those are Reservists and National Guard troops. So the number of full-time military troops is small considering 300 million people live in the U.S. So why the shrinking military? One reason, more Americans do not qualify. To be in the best military in the world one must be  in good medical shape, but two-thirds of the 17- to 24-year-olds that volunteer are disqualified. The number one reason? They are overweight. We have too many young people who are too big to join up. 
   This Nation as a whole cannot continue to travel the ever-widening path of obesity because large people don't fit into the military. As the size of the military unfortunately trims down, the waistline of those who apply continues to grow. 
   Mr. Speaker, overweight kids have become a national security issue. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity and the time to make some brief comments on this legislation. 
   The debate has been, as said previously, lively and very good. And it is good that we are actually having a bill presented to this Congress where the issue is whether it is constitutional or not. Too often this House seems to run through legislation. A lot is mentioned, a lot is said on this House floor, but the issue of whether it stands muster with our Constitution is not said. 
   For the last 30 years, I have been in the legal profession, 8 years as a trial lawyer and 22 years as a trial judge in the State of Texas. And the issue always in court, especially in criminal cases, is: Is it constitutional what occurs in that courtroom? That is always the question of the day. And I think that is the question of today as well. 
   I respect the remarks of the majority leader on his comments about how important it is for the folks in Washington, D.C. to have the right to vote for a Member of Congress. I couldn't agree with him more. It is the moral decision as well as an appropriate decision for us to make, at some time. 
   But under this current piece of legislation, it is not constitutional, unless we want to take the word ``state'' in the U.S. Constitution and change it to something else. Now, that does happen with the Supreme Court from time to time; they give a new definition to the word. I don't know if they will give a new definition to the word ``state'' and apply it to the State of D.C. or not. We shall see, probably, if this legislation passes. 
   But I think the better avenue would be to file a constitutional amendment. No question about it. A constitutional amendment cannot be ruled unconstitutional even by our Supreme Court. And I think that is the better way to proceed. I think this piece of legislation for the reasons stated by many people is unconstitutional and it should not pass. 
   Let's do it the right way, the proper way, and of course the moral way: file a constitutional amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker: ``Just a truck driver and a daddy'' is how Mark Lunsford described himself before February 24, 2005. However, that night forever altered the course of his own life. A convicted sex offender snuck into the Lunsford home and kidnapped Mark's 9-year-old daughter, Jessica. For 3 weeks, Mark pled to the American public for Jessica's safe return, to no avail. 
   A sex offender was captured, confessed to the kidnapping, sexually assaulting, and killing Jessica by burying her alive. Mark's mission to protect our Nation's children from these predators became his life's ambition. 
   Using the local and national media, Mark has raised the awareness and the need to strengthen the laws to keep sex offenders from harming our kids. He has traveled from State to State campaigning for Jessica's Law, which includes harsher punishments for sex offenders. He was also instrumental in helping Congress pass the Adam Walsh Child Safety Act, which tracks child molesters. 
   Last night, Congressman Jim Costa and myself, on behalf of the Victims' Rights Caucus, were pleased to honor Mark Lunsford, this daddy, this truck driver, for his commitment to our Nation's children. After all, children are our greatest natural resource.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the Iranian Government still lives in the Stone Age. Two Iranian sisters will be stoned to death after a court convicted them of adultery. One sister's husband was upset that he and his wife didn't get along, so he planted a video camera in their home while he was away. A videotape showed the two sisters in the company of other men, but did not show either woman engaged in a sexual act. 
   The husband turned the videotape over to the adultery police to prosecute the women. These two sisters were tried twice for this so-called crime. The first trial resulted in a conviction, and the women were convicted of illegal relations. Each sister received 99 lashes. But it gets worse: a second trial convicted the two sisters of adultery and they were sentenced to death. 
   Last year, Jafar Kiani was stoned to death for alleged adultery. Now these two sisters are next in line for the savage rock throwing. Doesn't anyone think lashing and stoning is a bit severe for adultery? I guess the Iranian Government has never heard of cruel and unusual punishment. And where is the outcry from the world of women's rights groups when they are needed to protest these acts from the Stone Age? 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (OH WHERE, OH WHERE CAN THE PHANTOM AIR BASE BE? -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Oh where, oh where has the American air base gone? Oh where or where can it be? With its 6,000 phantom troops and 32 million missing dollars, oh where, oh where can it be? 
   Madam Speaker, let me explain. Corruption has struck again, and just like times in the past, it's at the taxpayers' expense. 
   Government investigators recently uncovered the newest scam in contracting. This time it's a phantom air base in Iraq, purchased by the U.S. taxpayers at the tune of $32 million. 
   Madam Speaker, here it is, or here it's supposed to be. This is a photograph of the location in Iraq where the air base is, or where it was supposed to be built. But you can see that there is nothing to see because it was never built. 
   Last month the Inspector General at the Defense Department released a report about money spent to help train and equip Iraqi military and police forces. The contracting project in question was awarded to Ellis Environmental Group, a U.S. company based out of Florida, in 2006. The U.S. Air Force paid the company $32 million for this project, this air base in Iraq. The construction contract would have involved the creation of barracks and offices for 6,000 Iraqi troops in Ramadi, the capital of the Anbar province. 
   But the project had to be abandoned before anything was ever built when the Iraqi Defense Ministry failed to obtain this desert land for the base. 
   So what happened to the $32 million the Air Force doled out to Ellis Environmental? The alarming answer is no one knows. And the company won't say. 
   An Air Force spokesman says the contractor set up a camp for construction workers and began design work for the headquarters before the project was halted. But nothing was ever built. All we know now is that none of the $32 million the U.S. paid out to these contractors was returned to U.S. taxpayers. The Air Force is set to begin an audit of the project, but no one knows how long that's going to take. 
   The Inspector General report documents more abuses. And USA Today Matt Keller, reporter, said the findings show ``the military didn't keep adequate records of equipment for the Iraqis ranging from generators and garage trucks to thousands of guns and grenade launchers. Separately, the United States has launched a criminal investigation into allegations that weapons it bought for the Iraqi soldiers ended up in the hands of insurgent and terrorist groups.'' 
   Madam Speaker, this ought not to be. 
   In the meantime, Ellis Environmental Group has changed its name. 
   If a crime has been committed, these outlaws responsible need to be held accountable. Madam Speaker, war profiteers that make money off of war by building ``phantom'' military bases like this one should be prosecuted. This type of conduct fits the definition of war crimes. Maybe we should build a real prison for war criminals out in this desert in the sands of Iraq to house thieves that steal American money. 
   So, Madam Speaker, oh where, oh where has the American base gone? Oh where, oh where can it be? With its 6,000 phantom troops and 32 million missing dollars, it's where, oh where no one can see. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (RECOGNIZING AND WELCOMING THE LEADERS OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from American Samoa for sponsorship of this resolution and Mr. Lantos, the chairman, and the ranking member from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). 
   Today I rise to offer my endorsement of a resolution that recognizes the enduring ties of the United States and  the Pacific Island nations. Our Nation's links with the Pacific Islands extend back to the earliest days of the American Republic, when New England whalers, symbolized by Captain Ahab, sailed in the South Pacific. In those early days, clipper ships also set sail from American ports across the Pacific in pursuit of the China trade. American missionaries soon followed, journeying to the Pacific Islands to deepen the cultural and religious ties between our two peoples. 
   Our bonds to our Pacific neighbors have been further enhanced by their ethnic and historic links to our 50th State, Hawaii, America's gateway to the Pacific. 
   When war came to the Pacific at Pearl Harbor on that day of infamy, December 7, 1941, the peoples of the Pacific joined the United States in turning back the threat of the invader. It was two Solomon Islanders who bravely carried a coconut hidden in a canoe through enemy lines with the immortal words: ``Commander ..... native knows position ..... he can pilot ..... 11 alive ..... need small boat ..... Kennedy.'' 
   The rescue of the crew of PT-109, including a future President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, is remembered as one of the great epic stories of the war in the Pacific. 
   In the six decades since the end of that war, our diplomatic, commercial and cultural ties have grown steadily with our Pacific neighbors. One legacy of the American President rescued by the Pacific Islanders has been the Peace Corps, which has sent volunteers to work together with the peoples of the Pacific for the past 40 years. 
   The East-West Center in Hawaii, established by the United States Congress in 1960, has been a vital source for cultural and academic exchange and for a dialogue on critical issues of mutual concern. The center has played a pivotal role in cementing the ties between the peoples of the United States and the peoples of the Pacific Islands. I commend the center for hosting the Pacific Island Conference of Leaders here in Washington, D.C. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to offer my strong and enthusiastic support for House Resolution 355, welcoming America's good friends, the leaders of the Pacific Islands, to Washington, D.C. 
   I offer them and the people of the Pacific a warm welcome of ``aloha.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I want to once again commend the gentleman from American Samoa for not only bringing forth this resolution, but his work in educating the American public on the Pacific Islands and the need for cooperation with the United States and the Pacific Islands. 
   He mentioned the Solomon Islands during World War II. The Solomon Islands, among many other island nations in the Pacific, helped the United States combat imperialism. And when the American troops left those islands, many of those nations had to suffer continuously for the destruction that occurred on their islands. And of course there are still Americans who are volunteering from American Samoa and Guam fighting in our American forces overseas. And some Americans sometimes forget that these two areas of our country help in the great war on terror. So I want to commend him for bringing this resolution, and I support the adoption of House Resolution 355. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, the troops will be out of funds to carry the fight to the enemy by the end of June. So where's the money? 
   Spending money is what Congress does. Why hasn't this body provided the funds for our troops and equipment and for more personnel? 
   This is an emergency. Delaying will put our troops at risk. We should authorize the funds now; send equipment now and, if needed, send more troops. 
   The American people expect our military to do their duty. Well, the American people expect us to do ours as well. 
   Congress needs to quit talking about supporting the troops and put money where our mouths seem to be. 
   Nathan Bedford Forrest, successful Confederate general, said it best about winning and victory and the means to do so. He said: ``Get there firstest with the mostest.'' 
   Congress needs to send the generals the mostest, Mr. Speaker, needs to send equipment and personnel that is needed. Doing this will help our mission in spite of the Congressional Surrender Group's desire to retreat and quit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, France has a new President, Nicolas Sarkozy. While the world waits to see if he will give vigor and energy and leadership to his complex and sometimes difficult French people, his position on illegal immigration is quite clear. 
   Europe has its influx of illegals, not unlike the United States. Northern Africans are fleeing their native lands for Europe. They go mostly to Spain, where French President-elect Sarkozy accuses Spain of promoting amnesty in that Nation. Of course, once in Spain, it seems these illegals can roam Europe with ease. 
   Mr. Sarkozy claims Spain wants to give amnesty to now 600,000 illegals in its Nation. Mr. Sarkozy wants to ban European Nations from offering amnesty. He wants to bolster the EU border agency, the group that parols the African coast, with more police forces and use of the military to prevent the illegal landings in Europe. 
   It is interesting to note, Mr. Speaker, that Morocco, one of the Nations where people illegally flee to Europe from, wants the illegal flight to stop from its Nation. Almost 40 percent of the Africans that go to Europe by sea die in the process. This is a world crisis. Morocco wants to develop its native lands with European aid to keep people home, change the despair to hope by economic development, quit sending its problem to Europe but solve its problem. African Nations see the answer to solving their economic problems is not sending their populations to the north to Europe. 
   Mr. Sarkozy wants the European Union to have an EU-wide policy on illegal immigration and deal with this issue head-on instead of ignore the obvious. We shall see if this cooperation with the EU and France and the African countries works to stop the illegal entry, and we wish Mr. Sarkozy well in his presidency of France. 
   Meanwhile, back at home, here in the United States, our borders seem to be as open as ever because our government does not have the moral will to enforce the rule of law.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (FRANCIS SCOTT KEY AND SAM HOUSTON -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, Francis Scott Key is best known for being the author of our National Anthem, ``The Star Spangled Banner.'' During the second American revolution, the War of 1812, the British reinvaded the United States, captured Washington, DC, burned this building, the White House and most of this city. 
   The English then set sail for nearby Baltimore and were determined to take the city, but Fort McHenry was blocking and protecting Baltimore Harbor. Key, a lawyer, had boldly gone on board a British ship to seek release of a captured United States citizen. The Royal Navy held both Key and his client and refused to release either until after the British naval attack on the fort was completed. During the night, the British bombarded the fort with hundreds of shells and rockets, but at ``dawn's early light,'' the American defenders still held the fort, refusing to surrender, and a massive 30 foot by 40 foot American flag still flew defiantly over Fort McHenry. The unsuccessful British sailed away. Francis Scott Key, upon seeing the flag, wrote our national anthem that was sung this past 4th of July throughout the prairies and plains of America. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, Key also has a Texas connection. Before Sam Houston made his way to Texas, he served with Andrew Jackson in the Indian wars and was elected United States Congressman for Tennessee for two terms and served as Governor of Tennessee. 
   After his governorship, Houston spent time in Washington, DC, during the 1830s advocating on behalf of the Cherokee Indians and denouncing the corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
   In 1832, Congressman William Stanbery from Ohio made slanderous accusations about Houston and the Cherokees on the floor of Congress. One morning, Houston was leaving a boarding house on Pennsylvania Avenue and saw Stanbery walking down the street. A confrontation occurred between the two men over Stanbery's statement. A street brawl resulted. Sam Houston thrashed and viciously beat Congressman Stanbery with his hickory walking cane for Stanbery's derogatory remarks on this House floor. Stanbery then pulled a pistol and put it to the chest of Houston, but the pistol misfired. Mr. Speaker, fate saved Sam Houston's life. 
   The United States Congress ordered the arrest of Sam Houston, charging him with assault and demeaning a Member of Congress. Houston was tried before Congress in a joint session with the Supreme Court acting as judges. The trial lasted a month. Houston spent one full day on this House floor in boisterous oratory stating his positions, that he was defending his honor; Stanbery was the aggressor; and anyway, Stanbery deserved the severe caning. 
   So what does Francis Scott Key have to do with any of this? Francis Scott Key was Sam Houston's defense lawyer. He did an admirable job in the defense of this later Texas hero, but after the trial was over, Houston was found guilty, publically reprimanded and ordered to pay a $500 fine. Houston refused to pay the fine and, rather than face more problems with Congress, left Washington that same year and began a new life and political career in Texas. And the rest, they say, is Texas history. 
   General Sam Houston was the successful commander of the Texas Army during the Texas War of Independence from Mexico in 1836. After defeating Dictator Santa Anna on the marshy plains of San Jacinto, Houston became the first president of the Republic of Texas. After Texas was admitted to the United States in 1845, he was a United States Senator and then Governor of the State. Houston is the only person to serve as Governor and Member of Congress from two different States. 
   Sam Houston's troubles with the legislative bodies continued, however. When Texas voted to leave the Union in 1861, the Governor, Houston, refused to take the oath to support the Confederacy. So the Texas legislature removed General Sam from the office of Governor. Too bad. Maybe if Francis Scott Key had been Sam Houston's lawyer before the Texas legislature, the outcome might have been different. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, news from the lawless southern border: Homeland Security is claiming illegal entry is decreasing. According to their reports, the number of illegals arrested on the Mexico-U.S. border has decreased almost 25 percent. 
   Armed with these statistics, these bureaucrats are thus claiming fewer illegals are trying to sneak into the United States. Interesting enough, just last month the Homeland Security Secretary said, while he was lobbying for the now defeated Senate amnesty plan, that he cannot secure the U.S. borders. Now he claims illegal crossings are down because apprehensions on the border are down. That is like saying there are fewer cars on the road because the police are issuing fewer traffic tickets. 
   The American people are not fooled by this statistical game. Rather than claiming these glowing statistics mean that all is well on the southern front, Homeland Security should stop issuing propaganda statements and give the border protectors the support, equipment, and manpower to protect the border from infiltration. Homeland Security must quit being delightfully ignorant of the truth and not claim border victory because it issues fewer traffic tickets.

   Now the Big Three Automakers say they need Uncle ``Santa'' Sam to save them from themselves even though they have been bad all year. And they expect ``Joe Sixpack'' from Dime Box, Texas, to pay for their naughty deeds. 
   We can't call it a bailout because that might be too honest a statement to our citizens; so we call it a ``bridge loan.'' Actually it's a bridge loan to nowhere. 
   And Congress wants to create a Car Czar to oversee the control of how the Big Three make new cars. They tell us it's not the nationalization of the car business, but it sounds close enough for government work to me. 
   Anyway, does anybody really think the Federal Government knows anything about the car business? 
   If you like the way the Federal Government fouled up the mortgage industry by over-regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that has cost the taxpayers billions, or you like the way the Federal Government controls passenger rail service with Amtrak that loses billions of dollars every year, you'll love the way the Federal bureaucrats make new cars.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, for Houston police officer Timothy Abernethy, fighting crime was more than an occupation; it was his personal calling. Officer Abernethy was part of a special effort through the Houston Police Department to place more peace officers in high crime areas, which is why he was in an area of town that others tend to shy away from when he was shot and killed this past Sunday, December 7. 
   Working overtime and in a one-man patrol unit, Abernethy had pulled over a 28-year-old male for a traffic violation. As the man and the officer talked, the individual made a run for it and Officer Abernethy pursued him on foot through a nearby northwest Houston apartment complex. Tragically, the coward of a man, who happened to be out on parole, hid and ambushed Abernethy shooting him four times and killing him. The criminal has been apprehended and is charged with capital murder of a peace officer. 
   Officer Abernethy graduated May 27, 1997, from the Houston Police Academy, Class 170. During his 11-year HPD career, he was assigned to patrol at the North Command station and served with the HPD Search and Recovery Dive Team. Recently, Abernethy was part of an HPD bomb squad and was due to be transferred full-time to this squad. 
   Officer Abernethy is remembered as a giving person. His Captain, Ceaser Moore, recalls a time during Hurricane Ike this past fall when his power was out for weeks, and even though Abernethy already had his in-laws staying with him, he invited Captain Moore to stay with him until electricity was restored. 
   Officer Abernethy was the type of person who worked hard not only to improve his community but also himself. He worked successfully to obtain a degree while he was a member of the Houston Police Department. 
   Prior to joining the Houston Police Department, Officer Abernethy served in the United States Navy in the Submarine Corps. 
   Officer Abernethy is survived by his wife Stephanie, his son Timothy Scott Abernethy, Junior, and his daughter Olivia Ann Abernethy. 
   His only son, Tim, Jr., followed in his father's footsteps and joined the United States Navy so that he, too, could serve his country. Abernethy's daughter Olivia is a 2008 graduate of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. 
   Officer Abernethy was a man of honor who was dedicated to making our world a safer place for the rest of us. He will be greatly missed by citizens and peace officers alike. He was one of Houston's finest. Mr. Speaker, he was a cut above the rest of us.  
   His funeral will be this Friday in Houston, Texas, and his fellow officers will wear their black cloth of sacrifice across their badges. Peace officers are the last strand of wire in the fence between the law and those that violate the law. 
   Officer Timothy Abernethy lived and died serving the people of Texas and the City of Houston.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, well, here we go again, rushing into another bailout without appropriate congressional hearings. And what have the Big Three auto boys done to restructure their businesses after they first flew up here on their big private jets? Absolutely nothing. They just showed up here again demanding American money. 
   They say they are too big to fail. Madam Speaker, they have already failed, but they want the American citizen to pay for their mess. 
   So with the option before us today, we are going to let the Federal Government take over the auto industry and even decide what kind of car we should build. Not only that, we are going to appoint a ``Car Czar'' to manage how it is done. 
   The underlying bill gives the ``Car Czar'' complete control over the auto industry. Can you imagine what a Federal Government-made car will look  like? Most likely it will have a sail, solar panels, or even a windmill on top. It will be the typical Federal project. It will be too expensive, won't work, and we will never get rid of it. 
   With this bill, we are subsidizing failing companies. It is not the American way to subsidize failure. This is just like what we continue to do with Amtrak. Taxpayers pay millions of dollars every year to subsidize the failing passenger rail industry. So if we like Amtrak, we are going to love the new Federal car industry. 
   As President-elect Obama said on ``Meet the Press'' Sunday: ``We don't want government to run companies. Generally, government historically hasn't done that very well.'' I agree completely. 
   What the Big Three need to do is reorganize under the bankruptcy laws to prevent failure and job loss, just like the airlines did. The Big Three saying bankruptcy will cause 100 percent job loss is nonsense. It is just the politics of fear. 
   People say this isn't a bailout, but that is exactly what it is. It is not a bridge loan. And if it is a bridge loan, then it is a bridge loan to nowhere. 
   Folks, this is nothing more than a down payment on a future bigger taxpayer-funded corporate welfare bailout.

We now refer to it as Veterans Day to honor those that went to war and those of them that returned from war to the vast American landscape. 
   When the American doughboys landed in Europe in World War I to a deadlocked bloody trench war where millions had already died, their relentless spirit not only stunned our enemy but it revived and surprised our allies, France and England. The American soldier landed 90 years ago this year, singing George M. Cohan's ``Over There,'' and, as the lyrics say, ``They didn't come back till it was over, over there.'' 
   America has gone to war many times since World War I, and America's youth has always answered the call to duty, honor, country. 
   This Sunday, on the 11th day of the 11th month, America should fly the flag, be proud of our glorious heritage and give praise to veterans who went to places they had never seen and fought for peoples they didn't know to spread the doctrine of liberty and freedom.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, it is the first duty of government, especially our government, to protect the people. That is why governments are formed throughout the world. That is why the United States was formed, to protect the people who live in this great country of ours. 
   This weekend, we honor the veterans that have served in our military throughout all of its wars. It started on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, which was called Armistice Day, to end the war to end all wars, World War I. We now call it Veterans Day, where we honor those who went to war and came home. 
   Now America is engaged in wars in lands far, far away. We are engaged in the war in Iraq, we are engaged in the war in Afghanistan, and Mr. Speaker, it is my opinion that the finest military that has ever existed in the history of the world is fighting for American values in Iraq and Afghanistan, the American warriors. 
   You know, they are fighting in the deserts of Iraq, the mountains of Afghanistan. But we are also engaged in a war closer to home, that for some reason many have missed it, and it's the border war that we have on our southern border. 
   You see, our people who live in the southern part of the United States, and I happen to be one of them, I'm from the State of Texas, they are concerned about a constant invasion into our homeland by people that come here without permission. These people are coming into this country and they are colonizing our Nation. I have been to the southern border of Texas and Mexico over a dozen times. I've been to the border in Arizona, the border in California with Mexico, and every time I go to the border, the situation is worse. It is, by any definition, a war zone. 
   In the American town of Laredo, across the river, in Nuevo Laredo, it is a hostile and violent place. In the year 2005, there were 147 murders in Nuevo Laredo, many of them peace officers, and not one case has been solved. There have been 400 kidnappings; 41 of those have been American citizens kidnapped in Mexico, and not one case, not one has been solved by law enforcement. 
   It is a violent place. We have the three drug cartels coming in from Mexico, bringing that cancer into our country, and they are violent because it's all about money. And now they're working with the human coyotes, and they smuggle drugs and people into our country, all because of the almighty dollar. 
   We have reports of the Mexican military that have come across our border in arrogance and defiance, coming here to apparently help the drug smugglers bring in the drugs. But be that as it may, Homeland Security seems to be blissfully silent about the problem on the southern border with Mexico. And I ask the question, why? Is it because of political reasons? What do we owe the nation of Mexico? Our government, Homeland Security, owes the American public public defense. 
   It is the first duty of government to protect the homeland, and that includes the invasion by people without permission from our southern border. Thousands of people a day come in here without our permission, and I'm here to say that it's our obligation as a Nation to protect the southern border. 
   There has been legislation, bipartisan, that has been introduced this week to move that direction; 8,000 more border agents, using the military surveillance; also, requiring that American departments such as Social Security, Homeland Security and the IRS work together to prevent people from fraudulently trying to become American citizens, and of course, requiring more immigration judges. And I think we personally should use the National Guard and put them on the southern border as well. Whatever it takes, by lawful means, to secure the Nation's homeland, we owe that to the Nation, we owe that to the veterans who fought all over the world, and we owe it to the veterans who are on the southern border with Mexico to make sure that we protect our country, the dignity and sovereignty of this Nation. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the Drill Nothing Congress has let another week go into the history books, but no progress has been made on solving rising gasoline prices. Most Americans are for offshore drilling, but the don't-drill-in-America gang says no. 
   Why does the anti-American drilling crowd think it is wrong for us to drill at home, but it is right for OPEC and the Saudis to drill and sell us crude that costs Americans $425 million a day? 
   The Drill Nothing Congress says those American oil companies, which they seem to despise more than OPEC and dictator Chavez, have enough leases on Federal land. The problem with that lack of logic is there is no oil on those leases. The land is full of dry holes. It is like trying to lease Death Valley to the farmers to grow corn. It won't work. 
   The don't-drill group thinks American oil companies make too much money. Little do they know oil companies are owned by millions of middle-class Americans who are called stockholders. 
   Open up the Outer Continental Shelf. American oil companies will pay millions in lease revenues to taxpayers. Thousands of jobs will be created. America needs to take care of America. Drill offshore.

   After this coward killed the Ortizes, he fled from his pick-up and ran, but he was finally captured and held for the police by a bystander. 
   Gomez-Gutierrez had already been convicted three times for drunk driving, and he was an illegal from Mexico. But he had been never been deported after any of his convictions. If he had, Maria, Vanessa, and the baby would still be here.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (TEACH YOUR CHILD--GO TO JAIL -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, homeschooling is an ever growing choice for parents in America. Parents teach their children at home for various reasons: They are concerned about the quality of education, or the lack of it, in government schools; they don't approve of the public school curriculum; they want their kids to have a religious-based education, which is of course strictly forbidden in public schools; parents are concerned about school safety, especially in big urban schools; or, parents have special needs children that are not adequately served in public schools. Whatever the reason, many parents choose to homeschool. 
   Homeschooling is successful. Recent statistics show that homeschooled kids get higher test scores on ACT tests than non-homeschoolers. In the last 10 years, homeschooled children have scored higher every year on the ACT test than non-homeschoolers. I just recently appointed a homeschooler to the United States Air Force Academy, and his homeschooled education was superb. 
   But now, an appellate State court in California has ruled that, ``Parents not only don't have a constitutional right to homeschool; parents that homeschool their children can face fines and go to jail,'' sayeth the all-powerful Judge Walter Croskey. 
   Where does the California court get such nonsense? Education has been the responsibility of parents since the beginning of time. Public education really is a relatively new concept. And now we have judges saying that parents are criminals unless their children are taught in government schools. This reminds me of my visit to the school system in the Soviet Union, which mandated all students should be indoctrinated with propaganda in the communist school system. This is Big Brother and government control at its worst. Can you imagine? A crime to teach your own children. 
   I have nothing against public schools or teachers. My mother was a public school teacher. All my daughters are teachers. I even taught in the State university. But no government has the right to tell parents how to educate their children, not even the government in California. 
   Parents and students need all education options. They need private school options, public school, religious school, or even home school. The real issue is not quality of education, but education freedom of choice by parents. 
   The judge says it is unconstitutional to homeschool your children. Well, Justice Croskey must not have ever read the U.S. Constitution. There is nothing written in the United States Constitution about giving government or judges the authority to control education. In fact, the word ``education'' is not even mentioned in the Constitution as a responsibility of government. The California court's ruling, in my opinion, is unconstitutional. 
   Education has generally been deemed a matter for local communities and parents. We have always believed that in this country. In fact, the Constitution in the Tenth Amendment states,  ``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectfully or to the people.'' 
   And, I submit, ``the people'' in that phrase are parents that have the power, under our Constitution, to decide how to educate their children. It is their responsibility, their right, and their authority. After all, our children do not belong to the government and are not government possessions to be molded as the government or government judges deem fit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, as gasoline prices rise higher at the pump, the American driver is mad and the Congress blames the oil companies. But the real culprit is Congress. Gasoline prices are rising because Congress fails to have an energy policy that encourages the development of our own resources. Instead of making it easier to obtain crude oil, Congress has decided to subsidize the special interest groups to produce unproven, unreliable, and expensive alternative fuels, like corn-based ethanol, which now may pollute the environment more than first realized. Not to mention this idea is bad for land management and increases the cost of agricultural products. So now we have high gasoline prices and higher prices for corn products worldwide, thanks to Congress. 
   We are the only industrial power in the world that refuses to take advantage of its own energy resources. Congress should lift the absurd restrictions on offshore drilling, allow drilling in ANWR and stop the expensive, unnecessary regulations. This will increase production, supply, and lower costs. Otherwise, we will continue to be held hostage by third world dictators, like Chavez, and the cost of crude oil will continue to grow.

   Lydia Cacho refused to remain silent, and for that she fears for her life, has been arrested, verbally abused, imprisoned, and sued. 
   Lydia Cacho, founder and director of a shelter for sexual assault victims in Cancun, wrote a book, ``The Demons of Eden.'' In it, she exposed and named the rich and powerful who lured poor young girls to millionaire Cancun businessman Jean Succar Kuri's home so he and his friends could have sex with them. 
   Powerful politicians and businessmen had Cacho jailed for her work. Without explanation, state police whisked her away in the darkness of the night to a prison 900 miles away. So much for freedom of the press in Mexico. 
   Lydia Cacho is one of several journalists that have been persecuted for articles about corruption in high places in Mexico.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, out on the arid, dusty high plains of west Texas, where the land was once the home of thousands of oil derricks, the landscape is now dotted with windmills--the new turbine clean energy. Texas is the wind energy capital of North America, supplying power to over 1 million homes. 
   But now the environmental fear lobby wants to stop these turbines because they may pose a threat to bats and birds. They are the same radicals who have successfully prevented America from drilling for more crude oil at home, like in west Texas. These are the same batty people who have demanded we go to wind energy in the first place. 
   Now they are worried about the bats and the birds that fly at night may be running into the windmills. Of course, there is no evidence to support this bat mania claim. Anyway, we all learned in third grade bats have a radar-like ability to navigate at night in caves and open terrain. The National Academy of Sciences stated: Birds have more to fear from high buildings, power lines, and cats than they do from the blades of windmills. 
   We cannot allow the rich elites of the environmental fear lobby to destroy America's energy production. Otherwise, we will all end up going back living in the dark caves, with the bats.

Since it got nowhere in the Senate last week, Senators have returned to the back room and behind closed doors to come up with a ``Greater Grand Bargain'' than before. In other words, throw in something for the left, more family reunification for illegals, and something for the right, more border security promises, and this all done in an effort to get a deal, any deal, passed quickly. Of course, the underlying principle of this deal is if you are here illegally, you're going to get to stay. 
   Now, smart people on the left and the right say this is not amnesty. Of course they say it's not amnesty because these smart people know Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to amnesty. So they call it a reform. 
   Mr. Speaker, if 12 to 20 million people are on our land illegally, and shall I speak politically incorrect and call it trespassing, and if they pay some kickback fees to Uncle Sam but get to stay on our land, it's still amnesty.

Mr. Speaker, the tiny principality of Liechtenstein has survived and thrived as an independent and sovereign nation for over 200 years, ever since Napoleon dissolved the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. And I rise today in support of a resolution commemorating their independence and their friendship toward the United States. 
   Like my home state of Texas, Liechtenstein has worked hard to diversify its economy, keeping its important agricultural markets in-tact while embracing the industrial and financial services sectors, clearly for its immeasurable good. 
   Small in territory, Liechtenstein boasts an unemployment rate of only 1.3 percent and some of the lowest tax rates in Europe. Every day, the country's population swells to double its normal size, as citizens from the surrounding countries of Austria, Switzerland and Germany join the hardworking natives at work. And those that live and work in Liechtenstein enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world. 
   Liechtenstein is also, of course, a great friend to the United States and to democracy. I have invited the Ambassador of Liechtenstein, Ms. Fristche, to visit my district and observe for herself the pride Texans have in their own country and of course, the unique balance of our own economy--the rice fields planted right up against the oil refineries.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, when Ms. USA recently appeared in Mexico City, she was repeatedly booed every time she was onstage. Apparently, the host and hostess and the ``Politically Correct Police'' missed it or just ignored it. 
   The pro-amnesty crowd is moving right along in its efforts to convince the American public that illegal immigration exists because people would do anything to be an American; interesting logic considering recent events. But I've never understood the logic in rewarding 12 to 20 million law breakers with amnesty for any reason. 
   In America, we seem to do things a little bit different. We cheer for our country. We wave our flag. We invest in our country, and we respect our neighbors. And by respecting neighbors, I don't mean we invade somebody else's country, demand benefits and protest brazenly in the streets waving foreign flags. And where I come from, we never boo a lady. 
   The booing incident of Americans doesn't come as a big shock to most of us. It has happened before in U.S.-Mexico sporting events. The Mexican team and the Mexican fans booed the U.S. players. It is the disappointment in the lack of reaction from some of our leaders to realize that they are not welcoming future Americans into our country with their amnesty giveaway; they are just giving away the country. 
   A pathway to citizenship, or earned citizenship, or any other giveaway program they want to call it only works if people really want to become Americans. If you want to be an American, then there are some responsibilities to that. You just don't get to take all you can and leave when you are done. 
   I don't agree that this amnesty nonsense is what's best for America, and I know, without a doubt, that the uncontrolled border is a natural disaster. Sure, it's great for Mexico. Their struggling economy depends on our citizens; or rather, their citizens' loyalty to their country, not loyalty to our country. 
   But the argument is that we have to allow those living in our country illegally the opportunity to come out of the shadows and be a part of our country and our culture. That simply is not going to happen, because their loyalty lies with their former nation. And an amnesty giveaway is going to legalize their loyalty to their home country, not make them Americans. 
   Mexico and other countries promote illegal immigration to the United States with one understanding: You send your money back home to Mexico. And America is not home. Billions headed south last year to Mexico alone. Remittances from the United States were the second highest revenue for Mexico, right behind the sale of crude oil, beating out tourism. 
   So when the United States gets booed, people that don't understand this are a bit taken aback. Is it irony or arrogance? Most people don't bite the hands that feed them, especially when you have them eating out of your hand. 
   The administration recently said, ``Those determined to find fault with this bill will always be able to look at a narrow slice of it and find something they don't like. If you want to kill this bill, if you don't want to do what's right for America, you can pick out one little aspect of it.'' 
   Although I respect the President greatly, I respectfully suggest he is in error. We cannot accept the narrow slice or the whole amnesty pie. We are not that much of a glutton for this pie in the sky. 
   Americans deserve better. They deserve real immigration reform that secures the borders with the utmost of urgency and an end to political preference policy for illegals, a policy that discriminates against American citizens and legal immigrants. 
   We need to end employment opportunities and social benefits intended and entitled to Americans and have legislation that puts the needs and benefits of Americans first. 
   Kowtowing to Mexico, the country that takes and takes from America but booed Ms. USA off the stage, is exactly what's wrong with this new Senate amnesty bill and this administration's position. 
   And that's just the way it is.

He attacked her, stabbing her over 30 times, slit her throat, and killed the baby she was pregnant with. The last words Katherine heard her 3-year-old son, Anthony, scream in horror were, ``Don't kill me. I don't want to die. Don't kill me.'' Carlos stabbed Anthony in the heart. Katherine lay helplessly in a pool of her own blood for over a day until she was rescued, but she survived.

   You see, these are the same Mexican nationals that later will illegally sneak into America when the Border Patrol isn't watching. After the most recent tear gas episode, the Mexican Government sent a self-righteous statement to the United States that said, even though ``these incidents are a response to hostile acts against Border Patrol agents by Mexican citizens, the actions by U.S. authorities are unacceptable.'' 
   The Mexican Government seems to arrogantly support its rock-throwing nationals but doesn't want Americans to defend themselves. 
   Mexico needs to get its lawless house in order and control the disorderly mobs that lurk on the border. The United States should use every tool available to protect our borders from invaders, rock throwers, and drug smugglers. And if Mexico cries tears about it, too bad.

   Mr. POE. I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding time on this important issue. 
   Redeployment. Withdrawal. These words mean the same thing, ``we quit.'' ``Quitting'' Iraq is not a plan. It's not even a strategy; it is a total handoff of responsibility to an unstable government with an ill-prepared military. 
   I don't dispute that we must do more to ready Iraqis to handle their own security. I do insist, however, that we cannot suddenly leave the Iraqis scrambling to defend their new brand of democracy amidst chaos. That is what this ``leave at any cost'' plan would do: leave our enemies and those of the Iraqi people unfettered and free to pursue their diabolical agenda in Iraq and throughout the world. 
   So I would like to ask those who want to quit exactly what they plan to do to fight the terrorist operatives in Iraq when our troops turn around and leave. What is the plan? 
   I would also like to know, who, besides the ``New York Times'', is saying that the fight is lost in Iraq? Reports indicate that our troops are making progress. Sectarian murders in Baghdad have declined in the last 6 months. More Iraqis are coming to American troops with information about the terrorists. And Iraqi citizens are organizing against al Qaeda at the local level. Good for them. 
   Mr. Speaker, General Patton sailed with his soldiers from Algiers to Italy in World War II, and he said to them, ``No man is beaten until he thinks he is.'' This war is not over unless we quit. And when we quit, we are certainly defeated. 
   Here is what the defeatists say about the battle. They say that our troops were ill-prepared to go into battle, and there weren't enough of them; that they had inferior equipment; that they had improper uniforms for the extreme weather; U.S. intelligence was flawed; that we underestimated the resolve of the enemy; that Americans and our allies were killed by friendly fire. No, Mr. Speaker, this is not the war in Iraq, but this is the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, a battle that my father fought in. Those Americans, led by General Patton and others, did not run or quit because war is hard. You do not win wars by evacuating. And Americans won the Battle of the Bulge and broke the will of the enemy. 
   I ask this question: How does this plan to force the United States to withdraw from Iraq differ from al Qaeda's plan to force us to withdraw from Iraq? Why wouldn't al Qaeda celebrate if this bill is passed?  
   Mr. Speaker, General Patton went on to say to his troops, ``The glory of American arms, the honor of our country, the future of the whole world rests in our individual hands. See to it that you are worthy of this great trust.'' 
   I do believe, Mr. Speaker, that the honor of our country is at stake again today, but that's not all. Our security, the security of Iraqis, and the future of democracy and liberty in the Middle East, all of these are in our hands. 
   Let us be worthy of this trust. And that's the way it is.

Al Quds University also got millions of dollars for scholarships for 2,000 students.

   This resolution, this policy of ``No More Troops for the Troops'' leaves our volunteers in Iraq in a precarious, vulnerable situation.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3432, an act to establish a commission on the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. 
   The House passed this bill on October 2nd of last year, and today we take it up again as amended by the Senate, which removed three lines of authorizing language. 
   For over 200 years, countless Africans died appalling deaths during the so-called ``Middle Passage,'' the inhumane overseas voyage of their lives to slavery. Many Africans never made it to the Americas because they died on the way. 
   In that era, as throughout history, man's inhumanity to man had a lot to do with money. The Middle Passage referred to a middle portion of a triangular trade in cargo and people that began and ended in Europe. 
   Portuguese, English, Spanish, French, Dutch and other traders, including Americans, arrived on the West Coast of Africa where they sold or traded European cargo of textiles, firearms and other goods for Africans, who had been enslaved or kidnapped in many cases by other Africans. From there, they began the inhumane ``Middle'' journey to the Caribbean Islands and the Americas, during which many of them died. In the New World, which included North and South America and the Caribbean Islands, the slaves were sold for profit and traded for colonial goods that traveled mainly back to Europe, such as rum, sugar, rice and molasses. 
   Most of the victims of the Atlantic slave trade ended up in the Caribbean Islands and South America. Approximately 5 percent ended up in North America. These humans served as cheap forced labor for profiteers. 
   As recognized in this bill, the Transatlantic Slave Act went into effect 200 years ago this month, prohibiting the importation of slaves into the United States. President Thomas Jefferson authorized this act in 1808. Sadly, in spite of the formal prohibition and the act of Congress, this shameful institution of slavery persisted in this country for nearly 6 decades afterwards. 
   This bill will establish a commission to ensure that this important anniversary is appropriately commemorated within the United States and abroad. It will help afford all Americans the opportunity to learn more about the institution of slavery and its vestiges so that we may understand this tragic aspect of history. 
   In addition to promoting greater tolerance and understanding within the United States, this commission can also help shed light on the fact that slavery still exists in the modern world 200 years after the transatlantic slave trade was abolished. It exists today as it did in the past because of greed. It exists in the form of human trafficking. It exists wherever any group is systematically robbed of their fundamental human rights. These problems are undeniably real for the hundreds and thousands of women and children who are trafficked internationally every year. 
   Madam Speaker, it is appropriate, on the day after we honor the late Dr. Martin Luther King, a humanitarian  and advocate of basic human rights, that we pass this legislation. 
   I want to thank the author of the bill, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for his efforts. 
   I urge all colleagues to support this measure. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, in the desert sand dunes near the western town of Yuma, Arizona, Mexican border raiders have struck again. These outlaws snuck into America driving high dollar SUVs. They were smuggling dope into America. But American lawmen were waiting for these bandits. Upon seeing the good guys, however, the drug dealers sped back toward the safe haven of complacent Mexico. 
   Border Agent Louis Aguilar of El Paso, Texas, cut them off and threw tire spikes into their path. But the illegal driving a fancy Humvee at a speed of 55 miles an hour ran over and killed Agent Aguilar. One witness said ``the driver swerved and hit the agent on purpose.'' The Humvee, bandits and drugs disappeared in the dust across the border to a protected hideout in the badlands of Mexico. 
   Aguilar was 32, married and had two little kids. The Mexican government said it will find the killers. Yeah, right. 
   There is a border war going on, Madam Speaker. Agents should have the authority to prevent the infiltration of criminal bandits into our homeland by any legal means necessary. Otherwise, our Nation will continue to be at risk by these invaders.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (COMMUNIST CHINA'S TOXIC EXPORTS -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, what do toys, pet food, jewelry, toothpaste, lipstick, and glazed pottery have in common? Well, if these products are from China, it's toxic chemical poisoning. 
   In 2007, millions of toys were imported to the United States from the People's Republic of China, and then they were recalled after it was discovered that they contained high amounts of lead paint. Mr. Speaker, one of those was Thomas the Tank Engine, and here is a photograph of it. It was one of many of the millions of toys recalled; 1.5 million of these toys were recalled because they were made in China and had lead in them, in the paint that covered these toys. 
   Of course, everyone knows that lead poisoning can cause serious problems for children, including learning disabilities, kidney failure, irreversible brain damage, and anemia. Here in the United States, the leading cause of lead poisoning in children used to be old paint, but U.S. manufacturers stopped using this toxic ingredient over 30 years ago. But despite this ban on U.S. manufacturers, China consistently failed to maintain the same level of concern over the health and safety of consumers in the United States that it sells products to. 
   In 2006, the United States imported billions of dollars worth of toys, dolls, and games from China. That was approximately 85 percent of the United States' total imports of these products worldwide. And yet, between January and December of last year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled 17 million Chinese toys, all due to excessive amounts of lead. Another 10 million Chinese toys were recalled last year due to other dangerous manufacturing defects like loose magnets, toxic chemicals on beads, and items that are burn hazards. 
   Also, Mr. Speaker, during that same period, the FDA recalled 150 pet brand foods from China which were believed to cause the deaths of hundreds of pets in the United States; it seems they contained fertilizer. So, Chinese products contain lead in their exported toys for tots to Americans and contain fertilizer in pet foods that kill our dogs. But that's not all, however. The FDA has also recalled tires, lunch boxes, toothpaste that had antifreeze in it, and fake drugs due to consumer safety and health concerns. This is all from products from China. And in all, Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of the recalls issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission last year involved Chinese products. This kind of disregard for the well-being of America's consumers is not acceptable and should not be tolerated by our government. 
   American companies buy these products because they're cheap. You see, a  person in China gets paid about 67 cents an hour. Even illegals in this country won't work for that. And since the 1980s, China has been privileged to receive most-favored-nation treatment from the United States. 
   China is the second largest U.S. trading partner, but most of the billion dollars in trade goes to China. It's a one-way street. It's a free-trade street for China, and it's all for cheap, dangerous products made with cheap, sweatshop labor in China. 
   As the second largest U.S. trading partner, China must conform to the standards of safety that are required of American companies for the well-being of Americans. Even better, why don't American companies buy goods that are manufactured in the United States? 
   And lastly, Mr. Speaker, Chinese manufacturing companies are notorious polluters of their own environment. 
   It's time for a day of reckoning with cheap, dangerous communist Chinese products. We hear talk of free trade, but what we need is fair trade with China, something that's fair to American consumers. Americans should look to see if the products they buy are made in China. If so, they should ignore those products and look for an item made in the United States. What a novel idea. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, crude oil prices went to a record high of $93 a barrel today. No doubt Americans will feel it at the gas pump. There are numerous reasons for the increase: mainly, oil producing countries are unstable. Mexico has cut oil production 20 percent because of bad weather in the Gulf of Mexico. Africa's largest exporter of oil to the United States, Nigeria, has had incidents where pirates have kidnapped workers from offshore drilling rigs. 
   The Middle East is still a tinder box of uncertainty with Iran's nuclear development, Turkey fighting the Kurdish rebels, and, of course, the problems that persist in Iraq and Syria. All of this affects the disruption of oil exports. This, plus a weak dollar, means that crude oil prices will grow even higher. 
   Until the United States develops a safe energy policy that allows complete offshore drilling for crude oil and drilling in ANWAR, we will be held hostage by Third World countries, rogue dictators, and political enemies. We have the ability to explore and drill safely our own abundant natural resources. We must take care of ourselves or the days of higher oil prices have just begun.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF OCTOBER 2007 AS ``COUNTRY MUSIC MONTH'' -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding me this time, and I am delighted the member from Tennessee, the country music capital, is a cosponsor of this bill. 
   I also thank the majority and Mr. Hinojosa for quickly getting this House resolution to the floor. I know there was some difficulty in doing it because of the timetable, but I appreciate it. 
   Mr. Speaker, country music is definitely a sound that is uniquely American because it speaks to the heart and soul of everyday Americans. It is about the ups and downs of everyday life, as well as the struggles individuals have in this country, and the struggles our Nation confronts as a country. They are exemplified gloriously through the gifted songwriting of our country music artists. 
   At no time is this more true than when songs are written during trying times for our country and for the unwavering support of our men and women who wear the uniform who are willing to fight and even die, if necessary, for this Nation. 
   Toby Keith sang in ``America Soldier'' about our troops. He said, ``Up and at 'em bright and early, I'm all business in my suit. I'm dressed for success from my head down to my boots. I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway, providing our future's my responsibility. I will always do my duty. No matter what the price. If  dying's asked of me, I'll bear that cross with an honor, 'cause freedom don't come free.'' 
   Through songs like Darrel Worley's ``Have You Forgotten,'' and Lee Greenwood's ``God Bless the U.S.A.,'' Alan Jackson's ``Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning),'' Aaron Tippin's ``Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly,'' Brooks and Dunn's ``Only in America,'' and Charlie Daniels' ``This Ain't No Rag, It's a Flag,'' and Chely Wright's ``Bumper of my SUV,'' the thoughts and emotions of everyday Americans rings out all across America through country music.     
   These musicians and their patriotic radio stations that air their songs of support for the military are to be commended for being on the front lines of encouragement to our remarkable, relentless troops. 
   Like many in this House, I've been to Iraq; but also many of our country music singers have gone overseas to Iraq and every other place where American troops are, at their own expense to show appreciation to our American military for their loyalty to the U.S.A. 
   It's fitting that we as a Congress take note of this and honor country music during the month of October. I urge adoption of the bill.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, I bring you an update from the City by the Bay. San Francisco recently spent $50 million proudly advertising that it was a sanctuary city. I now give you the results of this very successful PR campaign, because it has worked. 
   This week's example is illegal Edwin Ramos. He loves San Francisco because even though he has been arrested twice for felonies, the compassionate folks of San Francisco never wanted him deported back to El Salvador. So he stuck around, got arrested for a gun charge this spring, and still wasn't sent home. 
   So last week he got a bit of road rage and gunned down Anthony Bologna and his two sons, Matthew and Michael, while they were returning from a family picnic. Mrs. Bologna blames the city for the murders because it ``caters to illegals''. I hope the mayor of San Francisco is proud of his sanctuary policy for illegals because it's cost three lives. 
   Mrs. Bologna should have a wrongful death cause of action against the City of San Francisco, especially the mayor, for its sanctuary policy. And Congress should prohibit all Federal funds from going to cities like San Francisco that proudly ignore American immigration laws and welcome foreign outlaws like Ramos. 
   And that's just the way it is.

His mother, Kara, my daughter, and his father Shane, are right-thinking, God-fearing people. Payton's little 2-year-old sister Elizabeth, shall we say, is inquisitive. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all get excited when kids are born, because we see in those innocent eyes the hope of the world, the chance that this new child might make a difference for the rest of us.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, on Sunday morning Chaudhry Rashad brutally murdered his daughter for bringing, as he said, ``disgrace to the family.'' 
   Rashad's 25-year-old daughter, Sandeela, wanted a divorce from her arranged marriage, but Rashad believed that it was more honorable for him to take a course of action to strangle her to death. 
   When Atlanta police arrived on the scene, Rashad was in his driveway, calmly smoking a cigarette behind a car as if it was a normal Sunday. After being arrested, then he arrogantly demanded to be served Islamic food while he was in custody. 
   Rashad said he has ``done nothing wrong'' by murdering his daughter. Yet another example of murder in the name of religion. Yet that's the problem, that people still use the word ``honor'' and ``killing'' in the same breath. The United Nations estimates that there are approximately 5,000 supposed religious honor killings each year of women and girls. Murder is not honorable. 
   When the police found young Sandeela's body, they said it was cold to the touch. However, the cold, dead body of his daughter was nothing compared to the coldness of a father's heart who willingly steals the life of his child in the name of religion.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (ROAD TO ARMAGEDDON -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, it's official. Iran now is capable of firing long-range missiles into southern Europe, Israel, and at U.S. troops in the Middle East. 
   This story broke yesterday morning when news agencies all over the world reported that Iran successfully test-fired nine medium- to long-range missiles with ranges of 1,200 miles or more that could carry nuclear weapons. 
   Madam Speaker, here's a map of the area. Here's Iran in the green. Next door is Iraq. Here's Syria. And, of course, this small area here is Israel. Weapons that they have fired are now capable of reaching Israel if Iran so desires. 
   Iranian leaders say these supposed to send a message to the United States and to Israel. The message: Iran has no problem attacking if they so desire. 
   The world is threatened by North Korea, Syria, and Iran, all developing nuclear capabilities while denying they have mischief in mind. The most dangerous, of course, is Iran. 
   The administration claims that the U.S. is determined to prevent Iran from threatening U.S. interests. But what does that mean? We have heard that line before. We've heard it the last time the U.N. imposed sanctions and told Iran to straighten up or else. And Iran just ignored the U.N. and the United States. 
   It's pretty clear that Iran's aggressive weapons development is part of a calculated plan to destroy their enemies. Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, the U.S. and Israel are at the top of Iran's hate list. 
   The LA Times recently reported that the little fellow from Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said, ``The Zionist regime of Israel is about to die and will soon be erased from the scene.'' And, ``The time for the fall of the satanic power of the United States has come, and the countdown to annihilation has started.'' 
   The devil of the desert, Ahmadinejad, is preaching hate and murder, which puts the rest of the world in danger as well. For those folks who might be willing to give Iran the benefit of the doubt, let's take a walk down memory lane and consider some of the recent facts. 
   In August of 2002, allegations were made that Iran was building a uranium enrichment facility, a component necessary for nuclear weapon technology. In December of 2002, satellite images confirmed the site. Then, after being caught in 2003, Iran agreed to allow U.N. inspectors in the country to inspect their facilities. But shortly after the inspections, Iran removed the inspectors' cameras and began nuclear development again. 
   In September of 2003, more enriched uranium was found. Caught again. In October, Iran pledged that if they could develop peaceful, civilian nuclear technology, they would suspend uranium enrichment activities. However, less than a month later, we learned that Iran didn't hold up to their end of the bargain. Big surprise, Madam Speaker. They lied and were caught again. 
   In 2004, we learned from the United Nations inspectors that Iran violated obligations under the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, and had been doing so for 18 years. Then Iran refused to allow U.N. inspectors back into their country. In 2005, Iran finally permitted U.N. inspectors to conducted limited inspections and, only after Iran had enough time to sanitize the facilities, were the inspectors allowed in the country. 
   Then, at the end of 2005, an agreement to suspend uranium enrichment was broken when Ahmadinejad became President. Iran started its nuclear program once again. In 2006, the U.N. ordered Iran to suspend enrichment. Iran did not comply. Later that year, the U.N. issued another order demanding that Iran stop enrichment, and Iran refused, and rejected even an incentive package.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, because Wall Street has made bad judgment calls, the American taxpayer has been forced to bail them out at $700 billion. Seven hundred billion, what does that mean? That means every man, woman, child and illegal in the United States will have to fork over $2,000 apiece to bail out the money grabber barons on Wall Street. And that's just wrong. 
   Why is it, Mr. Speaker, the bigger the business, the more the Federal Government thinks it should swoop in save these incompetent business people? Small businesses, mom and pop stores, don't get this break. When they make bad financial decisions, they go out of business. But the rich and famous Wall Street New York City fat cats expect ``Joe Six-Pack'' to buck it up and pay for all this nonsense. 
   Reward people for being irresponsible and expect responsible people to pay for the sins of the financial industry? I don't think so.

   Most of my Congressional district was affected, and the area affected most was the areas that refine gasoline for the United States. Twenty percent of the Nation's gasoline that is refined east of the Rockies is refined in my congressional district. All of those refineries shut down. They had damage because of the surge that came into that area; not to mention the people as well that are still suffering today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, they tell us that we're going to have financial Armageddon and the answer is to bail it out. You know, the phrase ``bailout'' is an interesting term. Having spent most of my life as a judge and a prosecutor in the criminal justice system, we used that term to bail somebody out of jail. Bail them out of a mess that they have created and somebody else pays the price. Appropriate term I think for the situation we're in now. 
   We want to bail somebody out of making mistakes, the rest of us are going to have to pay for. And the bailout now we're talking about is bailing out the financial institutions, financial institutions that are incompetent, that made bad judgment calls, mismanagement, bad risk, and maybe a little corruption to boot. But yet those people, those fat cats on Wall Street, New York City, expect America to pick up the pieces, and they pay for the mistakes that these people made. That is not, Mr. Speaker, the American way. 
   In this country and where I come from, we are all responsible for the decisions we make, and we're held accountable. We cannot expect somebody else to be held accountable for the mistakes we made, and Mr. Speaker, the same ought to apply to Wall Street and New York City. 
   Now, bailout's been a term we've been using in Congress the whole year. I have this poster over here. Mr. Speaker, it's entitled, ``It's a sad time to be an American taxpayer,'' and here's the reason. This Congress and the government has authorized bailouts already this year for troubled financial institutions and expected somebody else to pay. 
   First, it was Bear Stearns' bailout. Oh, that was just $28 billion. Right after Bear Stearns came the old Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailout, another situation of financial mismanagement, incompetence, maybe corruption. That was only $200 billion. Taxpayers paid. The responsible people did not pay. And then the AIG bailout just a couple of weeks ago. That was $85 billion to bail out that financial giant from making bad decisions, mismanagement, maybe corruption. And today, today, lo and behold we bailed out the automobile industry in the United States to the tune of $25 billion. 
   But we're not through, Mr. Speaker. Now they tell us, because of a financial crisis on Wall Street, we need to pay $700 billion to fix the system. Now, what does all that mean? That means it's $1 trillion of money belonging to people in the United States to have to pay for all of this mismanagement. What does that mean? Well, if you take every man, woman, child and even illegal in the United States, that means they've got to pay $3,000 apiece for this mess somebody else created. 
   Mr. Speaker, that ought not to be. That certainly is not the American way. But yet we're expected to do it, and why, Mr. Speaker, I'm not sure. It seems to me that maybe these folks have a little more political clout than the average American citizen. 
   The district I represent down in southeast Texas, it's about 60, 70 percent blue collar. City councilman from Bay Town, Texas, is a friend of mine. He's named Sammy Mahon. His real job, he runs a wrecker service in southeast Texas. Yes, city councilmen in southeast Texas are wrecker drivers. And he has a hard time making ends meet because of the cost of diesel fuel, which is another issue. But he looks at it kind of the way I think most Americans. He says, Congressman, if I go out of business for whatever reason, I shouldn't expect my neighbor to pay for my business. And he's right, because he's just a little guy. 
   But these big guys, they expect us to pay for mismanagement. Hold us ransom. Pay this $700 billion in ransom, and it's all because of incompetence and mismanagement. 
   Responsible Americans have to pay for irresponsible conduct by the others. That ought not to be. 
   And this didn't happen universally to all banks. Some banks, small banks, community banks, they didn't make these mistakes. They didn't take those risky loans, give loans and money to people who had no business borrowing money in the first place. Why should we bail out those people that took those loans knowing they couldn't pay them back? Why should we bail out the banks who didn't take that risk but passed it on to the rest of us? 
   They tell us, Mr. Speaker, that we must act now or the sky will fall or we'll have financial Armageddon. I think not. The politics of fear is certainly not the answer. 
   You know, we have spent more time as a Congress studying steroids in baseball than we have been studying the financial crisis this week. And why is that? Political clout. This ought not to be. 
   We have a problem. We have a cause. We have to figure out the solution. We don't know the answer to those three, and Mr. Speaker, it's time we get busy and solve this problem but not expect somebody else to pay for the conduct and misconduct of others. 
   And that's just the way it is.

   Mr. POE. Madam Speaker, the Lonestar Voice this week comes from Geoffrey Brown of Baytown, Texas. Here is what he has to say: 
   ``We need to show more sympathy for these people. They travel miles in the heat, they risk their lives crossing a border. They don't get paid enough wages. They do jobs that others won't do or are afraid to do. They live in crowded conditions among a people who speak a different language. They rarely see their families, and they face adversity all day every day. No, I'm not talking about illegals; I'm talking about our troops. Doesn't it seem strange that the (politicians) are willing to lavish all kinds of social benefits on illegals, but don't support our troops and have threatened to defund them?'' 
   Geoffrey Brown echoes the sentiments of many other Americans who wonder why so many people in Washington show more concern for illegals  who pledge allegiance to other countries than they do our U.S. troops fighting in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan. 
   Supporting the American military and our veterans is more important than expensive giveaway programs to illegals.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado for offering this amendment with me. I'll be brief because I don't think many Members here need to be convinced that we need our Government agencies to enforce the laws we give them and that they aren't arbitrary. 
   Section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the State Department to discontinue the issuance of visas to nations who fail to take back their nationals who have been ordered removed by our Government. 
   Unfortunately, this step by our Government has never been taken. Why? The gentleman from Colorado and I joined on a letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to ask this very question. The chart I have here indicates the response we received and I quote:   
   Department of Homeland Security Response: ``While visa sanctions under Section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act may be an effective tool in obtaining repatriation cooperation, the severity that makes them potentially effective also has the potential to negatively impact other U.S. foreign relations objectives if not used judiciously. When considering the use of 243(d) sanctions, DHS must consider the potential repercussions to U.S. foreign policy. Because the United States is pursuing a number of initiatives with China on foreign policy issues, implementing Section 243(d) sanctions could have counterproductive effects.''--Donald H. Kent, Assistant Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, January 10, 2007.   
   Mr. Chairman, how this reads to me is that our trade with nations like China is more important than providing for the safety of the American people. Many of the people who we are trying to remove are hardened criminals, violent felons that we want off our streets. Because of two recent Supreme Court decisions, our government is limited in the length of time we can hold them in our jails while working to remove them. If we can't remove them in 6 months, they are to be set free. Now how many are we talking about here? As this chart shows, here are the top offending countries and the number roaming America: 
 TABLE 14.--BREAKDOWN IN THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM COUNTRIES THAT BLOCK OR INHIBIT REPATRIATION[As of June 29, 2004]Eight countries  Detained criminal non-criminal  Non-detained criminal/non-criminal  Total   Vietnam   352   5,807   6,159     Jamaica   715   11,568   12,283     Iran   105   7,039   7,144     India   253   28,540   28,793     Ethiopia   108   4,454   4,562     Eritrea   21   637   658     China   885   72,315   73,200     Laos   140   3,302   3,442     Total   2,579   133,662   136,241   
   According to a Department of Homeland Security Inspector General audit in April 2006, ``The difficulty that ICE is experiencing removing illegal aliens with final orders has, in effect, created a mini-amnesty program for tens of thousands of illegal aliens that are subject to removal from the U.S. It also encourages individuals from non-cooperating countries such as China, India, and Iran to make attempts to enter the U.S. illegally. 
   So let me close by again saying this amendment that I and the gentleman from Colorado are offering just says to enforce existing law. Unless these nations believe that they will not obtain a visa in the future, nothing is ever going to change.

<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, as a former prosecutor and felony court judge in Texas, I tried a lot of cases where the victims of homicide were peace officers. Like any victim, these officers came from all ages and all races. The murder of a peace officer is one of the most serious crimes that can occur in any community. 
   Unlike other victims, Mr. Chairman, peace officers carry the daily burden of protecting their communities from crime, everything from petty theft to the most violent and vicious of crimes. Every day these defenders of our cities put their lives on the line. They have asked to be in harm's way, and then when one is killed in the line of duty, their loss is deeply felt by the entire community. 
   There are cases, however, when peace officers are killed and their killers happen to be immigrants from foreign countries, some legal immigrants, some illegal. And there are many cases where the home countries of these immigrants refuse to send them back to the United States to face their charges  once they are requested to be extradited to the United States from their home country. 
   In 2002, a Los Angeles County sheriff was murdered by a Mexican citizen who was illegally in the country. However, the Mexican government refused for 5 years to extradite him to the United States to stand trial, and it only occurred this January when the charge was reduced. 
   The same occurred in Denver in 2005 when a police officer by the name of Donnie Young was murdered, and only after the charges were reduced was the killer extradited back to this country. 
   Killing police officers seems to also be a popular pastime for a few immigrants in Texas. In my hometown, a Houston police officer by the name of Rodney Johnson was shot four times and killed by an illegal immigrant in September of 2006. In fact, the last three law enforcement officers shot in Harris County, Texas, were shot by people who were illegally here in the United States. 
   Fortunately, each of these killers were captured before they fled to their home country, and they will have their day in court. But what about the ones that don't get caught and flee to some other country? This problem is only increasing in States that border Mexico, where travel across the border is easy; and now violent drug cartels rule the area and certainly have no qualms about shooting at American peace officer. 
   So this country should not be spending money toward admitting immigrants to the United States from any country that refuses to allow the United States to try police killers by harboring those killers in their country. 
   I ask my fellow Members of Congress to join me, along with the Fraternal Order of Police that has endorsed this amendment, to support limiting funds in this bill to be used for issuing visas to nationals or citizens of countries that have notified our State Department of their refusal to extradite to the United States an individual indicted for killing a peace officer in this country. We owe this to our peace officers and their families.

   Mr. POE. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I understand the chairman's concerns about this amendment, but it will be an effort to, of course, get those people back in the United States who are charged with the specific crime of killing a peace officer. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. POE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill increases funding in the Foreign Operations bill to foreign countries almost at 10 percent. And as already stated, most Americans did not get a 10 percent increase in their income last year, but yet we are going to spend money in foreign countries. And much of this money is waste, total waste that Americans should not be funding at all. It gives money also to nations that constantly and consistently vote against us in the United Nations. 
   It's important to note, however, none of this funding decrease will affect aid to our strongest ally to the Middle East, Israel; money that is well spent for the security of not only Israel, but the United States. 
   So, increasing funding in this Foreign Operations bill is not acceptable. All we're doing in the gentleman from Ohio's amendment is to put in it at last year's level, and that's a good idea.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (STAR-SPANGLED BANNER AND WAR OF 1812 BICENTENNIAL COMMISSION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I thank Mr. Sarbanes for introducing this very important legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative for all Americans to know our early American history. Soon after the War of Independence and American independence, the new struggling United States had to go to war again with England to keep its independence. 
   Sometimes the War of 1812 is referred to as the forgotten war in American history. It is referred to as the ``second American War of Independence.'' Be that as it may, we went to war with England a second time because the British kidnapped American sailors on the high seas and made them involuntary servants in the British Navy. 
   When the British invaded the United States during the War of 1812, they burned this city, Washington. They used Thomas Jefferson's books to burn this Capitol. They burned the White House. The President had to flee in the darkness of a torrential rainstorm. The United States future looked bleak. 
   So after capturing Washington, DC, the British headed north to finish the United States off in Baltimore. During a heated sea battle, the British bombarded Fort McHenry, defending the harbor of Baltimore. But the fort commander stood defiant, refused to surrender, and hoisted a massive American flag over the fort. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is no small flag. It is 30 feet by 42 feet in size. Such a flag could be seen for miles and miles away from Fort McHenry. An American lawyer named Francis Scott Key was onboard a British ship during the battle. He was there seeking the release of an American captive. After watching the night battle and seeing the glorious U.S. flag at sunrise, he wrote a poem, later turned into a song called the Star-Spangled Banner to honor this American victory. 
   This national anthem of ours is played at sports games and ceremonies and events across the Nation every day. In fact, I think the first time it was played at a sporting event was at a Chicago White Sox game in the early 1900s. Chairman Davis could correct me if that is incorrect. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is important that Americans understand what the anthem stands for and why it was written. I totally support H.R. 1389. This bill will create a commission to plan activities, programs and observances of history events surrounding this War of 1812. I am proud of how the United States as a new democracy developed into a great Nation during this time. This war and Francis Scott Key should be celebrated and honored and recognized. 
   By the way, Mr. Speaker, the British left the United States permanently after the battle of Fort McHenry and after Andrew Jackson and his boys defeated the British at the Battle of New Orleans.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING A VOICE FOR VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES INVOLVED IN MISSING PERSONS AND UNIDENTIFIED HUMAN REMAINS CASES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding me time and for offering this important piece of legislation. 
   As a former judge and prosecutor and founder of the Victims' Rights Caucus, I certainly understand how crime victims may be distraught and scared and hopeless. Some die in this emotional nightmare and some of those who die are kids. But now they need not be voiceless. Congress can be a voice for crime victims, especially those who have been murdered. 
   I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 340. This resolution provides a voice for victims and their families, those that are involved in missing-person cases and unidentified human remains cases. 
   Any given day in the United States, there are over 100,000 missing persons. There are over 40,000 remains in medical examiners' offices and coroners' offices that cannot be identified. Cities and counties bury or cremate the unidentified human remains without collecting DNA in many cases. So Congress must continue to fund DNA testing, train and educate law enforcement on these issues, and raise awareness about the use of this scientific phenomenon, DNA, so that it can be used to identify the unidentified.     
   We owe this to those silent who cannot speak for themselves. 
   DNA identifies missing victims as well as convicts the guilty and frees the innocent. For all of these reasons, this resolution should be adopted. So I totally support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (HATEMONGER SPEAKS AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the University of Hate has a new branch campus and it is called Columbia University. 
   Madman, maniac, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is speaking today at Columbia. The Iranian President believes in the murder of the Jewish people in Israel. He is a hater of Americans. He is sending money, arms, and ammunition to Iraq that is used to kill American troops. Not the kind of person that deserves a U.S. audience. 
   But Columbia doesn't care. The University said that they would have even invited warmonger Hitler to speak on their campus. 
   But the university does have some people that they refuse to allow on campus. This is the same university that, in 1969 during the Vietnam War and peacenik movement, banned the ROTC from campus. And in spite of current law and a Supreme Court ruling, still bans the ROTC. 
   Columbia University clearly shows a pattern of being anti-American by promoting forums to warmongers and by preventing the U.S. military ROTC program on campus. Maybe the university should just relocate to Tehran. And in the meantime, the U.S. taxpayers have no business sending American money to the University of Hate. 
   And that's just the way it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. POE. (LET THE JURY HEAR ALL THE EVIDENCE -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, if the prosecution negligently or intentionally or by incompetence fails to give beneficial information to the defense, then our law says a new trial should be ordered. In the Ramos and Compean border agents trial, the prosecution based its whole case on the testimony of a drug smuggler who not only brought in $1 million worth of marijuana to the United States but was given immunity for it. He was portrayed as just a mule trying to get some money for his poor sick mama. Well, now it seems that after he got immunity for his crimes and while waiting to testify against Ramos and Compean, he brought in another large load of marijuana. 
   Here is the DEA report on the second case. I have read it. This case is simple enough that a third-year law student could prosecute it. But the U.S. Attorney's Office refused to prosecute the drug smuggler in the second case, and the jury never heard about this matter. The jury should have known about the second case to judge the credibility of the drug smuggler's testimony. The border agent should receive a new trial. Let the jury hear the truth about the star witness the Federal Government made a backroom deal with. 
   And that's just the way it is.
