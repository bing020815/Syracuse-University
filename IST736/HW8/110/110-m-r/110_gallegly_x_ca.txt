<DOCNO>Mr. GALLEGLY. (CONGRATULATING ALBANIA AND CROATIA ON BEING INVITED TO BEGIN ACCESSION TALKS WITH THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GALLEGLY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1266, a resolution I introduced that congratulates Albania and Croatia for the decision by NATO to invite these two countries to become full members of the alliance. 
   On April 3rd of this year, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at its summit meeting in Bucharest invited Albania and Croatia to begin accession talks to join the organization. This decision was in recognition of wide-ranging political, economic and military reforms undertaken by these two aspiring members. 
   Both Albania and Croatia have made significant progress in establishing civilian control in their armed forces and ensuring those forces are closely integrated with the militaries of NATO members. Both have made substantial progress in holding free and fair elections, establishing democratic institutions and building their free market economies. 
   Regarding Albania, I want to single out the assistance of their military in three areas of operation: Albania's participation in the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Bosnia; its contribution of 140 men to the NATO operations in Afghanistan; and the participation of Albanian Special Forces as part of the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq. 
   With respect to Croatia, it has been and continues to be a significant contributor to peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo. In Afghanistan, Croatia has been a supporter of the NATO-led mission and in the past year has sharply increased their military forces in that country. In addition, Croatia has strongly backed international efforts in the areas of nonproliferation and the fight against illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs and persons. 
   I have traveled to Croatia on numerous occasions and can attest to the fact that the Croatians and Americans enjoy a close friendship based on common interests and common values. Today we enjoy the closest bilateral relationship with Croatia since the country achieved its independence in 1992. 
   Madam Speaker, Albania and Croatia are two strong allies that have shown that they are ready, willing and able to become full members of NATO. I urge the passage of H. Res. 1266, and also urge the Senate to move quickly to ratify amendments to the NATO treaty that would allow these two nations to join our most important international alliance.

<DOCNO>Mr. GALLEGLY. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GALLEGLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6633, the E-Verify Amendment Act. E-Verify is an Internet-based system that can be used to verify the employment eligibility of newly hired employees. It does so by checking the worker's Social Security number and citizenship status against the Social Security database. For non-citizens, it also checks work authorization status against a separate Department of Homeland Security database. 
   E-Verify, formerly known as Basic Pilot, was one of the recommendations to come out of the 1995 Task Force on Immigration Reform, which I chaired. 
   While I support this legislation, I also firmly believe E-Verify participation should be mandatory for all employers throughout the country. We know that most illegal immigrants come to this country looking for work. If they are unable to find and hold jobs, most will go home on their own. Even more important, when they learn that finding jobs in the United States is more difficult, other illegal workers will be less likely to come to this country in the first place. 
   E-Verify is currently used by more than 75,000 employers. Almost everyone authorized to work in the United States is immediately verified by the system. Only about one-half of 1 percent of employees queried who are actually eligible to work in the United States receive a ``tentative non-confirmation.'' But this system gives them the opportunity to correct their information and ensure their tax and Social Security records are accurate. 
   Mr. Speaker, E-Verify works. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. GALLEGLY. (RONALD REAGAN CENTENNIAL COMMISSION ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GALLEGLY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5235, the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act.     
   To prepare for the upcoming anniversary of his 100th birthday on February 6, 2011, Mr. Blunt and I, along with 160 cosponsors from both parties, introduced this legislation creating the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission to pay tribute to our 40th President. 
   This 11-member bipartisan commission is similar to the others created for Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. This commission will develop plans and memorials to honor President Ronald Reagan. These events will take place all over the country, from here in Washington, DC to his birthplace in Illinois, to California, where he lived most of his life. 
   As a fellow Californian, I had the great pleasure of spending time with him when I first came to the House of Representatives in 1986. And as a matter of fact, his Presidential Library and burial place is only a few blocks from my own home in Simi Valley, California. 
   ``The Great Communicator'' spoke for the American people, capturing the hearts of small-town citizens and world leaders alike. His remarkable career and public life spanned over 50 years. It began as a student leader, sports broadcaster in Illinois and Iowa, then to Hollywood as an actor and long-time president of the Screen Actors Guild. 
   California enjoyed an economic resurgence during his terms as Governor, and as President of the United States, his legacy is extraordinary. In 8 short years as President, Ronald Reagan presided over international changes and ushered in unparalleled peace and prosperity, not only for our Nation, but for the entire world. 
   I want to thank my good friend, Roy Blunt and his staff for supporting, as well as Chairman Waxman and the ranking member, Tom Davis, and their staffs for their assistance in putting this bill together. 
   I also want to express my appreciation to our Majority Leader, Steny Hoyer, for bringing this bill to the floor today. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in strongly supporting H.R. 5235, the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. GALLEGLY. (ANIMAL FIGHTING PROHIBITION ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GALLEGLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As you know, along with my good friend EARL BLUMENAUER and ROSCOE BARTLETT, we have been trying to federally criminalize this brutal, inhumane practice of animal fighting for the past several Congresses. 
   When Congress enacted legislation to tighten Federal animal fighting laws, we left in place weak penalties that have proven ineffective and allowed the barbaric practice to thrive, in spite of bans in virtually every State. Misdemeanor penalties simply don't provide a meaningful deterrent. Animal fighters consider misdemeanor penalties as a ``slap on the wrist'' or merely the ``cost of doing business.'' 
   State and local law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned about animal fighting not only because of the animal cruelty involved but because of the other crimes that often go hand in hand with animal fighting, including illegal gambling, drug trafficking, and acts of human violence. In the last 6 months, virtually every reported arrest in an animal fight has also led to additional arrests for at least one of these criminal activities. 
   Cockfighting has also spread diseases that jeopardize poultry and even public health. California experienced this firsthand when cockfighters spread exotic Newcastle disease in 2002 and 2003. That outbreak cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $200 million to eradicate, and the cost to the U.S. poultry industry was in the millions. Cockfighting has been identified as the major contributor to the spread of avian flu throughout Thailand and other parts of Asia, where the strain originated. 
   I want to express my sincere thanks to you, EARL BLUMENAUER, and to ROSCOE BARTLETT for their work on this legislation. I also commend and thank my good friend and neighbor Mr. JOHN CONYERS, the chairman of the committee; LAMAR SMITH, the ranking member; BOBBY SCOTT, the chairman of the subcommittee; and RANDY FORBES, the ranking member, for recognizing the importance of this issue and moving H.R. 137 through the Judiciary Committee so quickly.     
   Also I want to recognize COLLIN PETERSON on the Ag Committee for his assistance. 
   Finally, more important than all, is recognizing the 303-plus Members that have co-sponsored this legislation. It is hard to believe that we have that many people agreeing on something like this when it is not often that we have that many people in the House agreeing on what day of the week it is. So I want to thank all of them for their support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with all of us in passing this legislation when we bring it to a vote here in a couple of minutes.

<DOCNO>Mr. GALLEGLY. (GEORGIA AND UKRAINE NATO MEMBERSHIP -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GALLEGLY. Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Chairman Wexler and Chairman Berman for their kind words in their opening statements. I stand here today to rise in strong support of House Resolution 997 which reaffirms the support of the House of Representatives for NATO enlargement. 
   The resolution also specifically calls on the United States to take the lead in supporting closer integration between Ukraine, Georgia and NATO. I would like to commend Representative Wexler, as I mentioned earlier, the chairman of the Europe Subcommittee, for introducing this measure and for being a strong, consistent advocate for strengthening our bilateral ties with Ukraine and Georgia. 
   Both of these allies have demonstrated the military capabilities and political reforms required to provide concrete benefits to the alliance. In the past several years, Ukrainian forces have participated with NATO troops in peacekeeping operations in the Balkans and Afghanistan. They have also made important contributions to coalition forces in Iraq in 2004 and 2005. 
   Georgia has also shown they are ready to take the next step toward NATO membership. Georgia has undertaken a top-to-bottom reform of their  military forces, often working closely with U.S. forces in this effort. 
   As previously mentioned by Representative Ros-Lehtinen, with over 2000 troops in Iraq, Georgia today has the third largest troop contingent in that country after the U.S. and Britain. 
   Madam Speaker, both Ukraine and Georgia are ready, willing and able to integrate more fully with NATO. Again, I would like to recognize Representative Wexler for his hard work on H. Res. 997 on behalf of a stronger NATO, and I urge passage of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. GALLEGLY. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE NEW POWER-SHARING GOVERNMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GALLEGLY. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 482, which I introduced on June 12, expresses the support of the House of Representatives for one of the most successful efforts in peacemaking in modern European history. 
   The resolution recognizes the success of the Northern Irish peace process that had its first major breakthrough with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. While the Good Friday Agreement provided the blueprint for lasting peace, it took years of negotiation and compromise by both communities in Northern Ireland for the agreement to be fully implemented. 
   This occurred on May 8 with the formation of a government based on a power-sharing arrangement involving the largest unionist and nationalist parties in Northern Ireland. The May 8 accord translated the general principles of the Good Friday Agreement into a concrete political settlement with important powers being transferred from London to Belfast. 
   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 482 expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should strongly support the new power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. The legislation also commends the Northern Irish political leaders, both of those who represent the Catholic and Protestant communities, as well as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish leader Bertie Ahern for their leadership in the formation of this new government. 
   Lastly, House Resolution 482 states that the U.S. stands ready to support the new government and to work with the people of Northern Ireland to achieve their goal of a long-lasting peace. 
   Madam Speaker, the restoration of power-sharing institutions, the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive Committee, will not ensure lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Much work remains to be done in terms of bringing the two communities even closer together. And Congress must stay engaged with Northern Ireland as an honest broker in the years to come. 
   However, the May 8 agreement represents major progress in resolving a sectarian conflict that has plagued Northern Ireland for over 400 years and has claimed over 3,200 lives just since 1969. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation is cosponsored, I believe, by every one of my colleagues that have taken a legislative or leadership role in the Congress in resolving sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. 
   I urge the passage of House Resolution 482.

<DOCNO>Mr. GALLEGLY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GALLEGLY. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, my concern about the Iraq resolution offered by my friends on the other side of the aisle is what impact it will have on our troops and our mission and its consequences on our mission. How can you say support our troops when you don't support sending in the people necessary to back them up to do the job that we sent them there to do to start with? 
   Let's be clear, Mr. Speaker, about who the real enemy is. We are at war with the Islamic jihadists. Jihadists have vowed to destroy America, the West and all sympathizers with democracy. We are at war for our very existence against jihadists who have vowed to enslave us with a fundamentalist philosophy that rejects all human rights. 
   The consequences of failure in Iraq are not just failure in Iraq. Iraq's stability has direct repercussions on Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel and all of the Middle East. If our efforts to bring peace and stability to Iraq are successful, we will accomplish a great deal. If not, if Iraq fails, it will provide Islamic jihadists with a sanctuary similar to the one we removed from Afghanistan, only the sanctuary in Iraq would be many times worse, as the terrorists would have access to billions of dollars of oil resources to carry out their evil plans. Such a sanctuary would threaten Europe and the United States. 
   If we are in support of our military men and women, we must support their mission against Islamic jihadists. The alternative is defeat in Iraq and a greater threat of attack here at home. 
   A defeat in Iraq would not just be a defeat for the United States. It would also set back any chance for peace and stability in the Middle East. It would empower terrorists to unleash greater sectarian violence, which would draw all of Iraq's neighbors into a Sunni versus Shi'a conflict for control of Iraq. 
   I am also concerned about the resolution because it does not offer any alternative whatsoever that could lead to a successful outcome for the United States in Iraq. All the resolution does is to criticize the President's plan to augment our existing force in Iraq by 21,000-plus troops. 
   The Democratic resolution offers no other plan. It does not address what should be the right strategy or the right tactics. In effect, and I think this is the real issue, it endorses the status quo in Iraq, a position that I certainly can't support, and I hear lots of those that are supporting this say they can't support either, but they are de facto supporting the status quo by supporting this resolution. 
   I look forward to the majority offering a comprehensive proposal that would set forth a specific course of action. Then we could have a real debate on the pros and cons of the Democratic plan versus the President's plan to secure Iraq and defeat the terrorists in that country. Unfortunately, the resolution before us fails to do this, and therefore I can't support it. It should be rejected.
