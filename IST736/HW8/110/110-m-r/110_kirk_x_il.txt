<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, 23 years as a staff member, I heard from WHO that AIDS was not an epidemic based in New York, San Francisco, or Haiti, as we thought back in 1985, but instead was an epidemic that raged in Zaire for years. 
   I got my then boss, John Porter, and Democratic Congressman Bob Mrazek to begin the foreign AIDS program. We were told by the leaders of the Appropriations Committee that we could not do this, but we did. We started with just a $25 million funding level, and as recently as 1999, I had a tough time even getting members to show up for a hearing on this subject. I feel a bit like a country music singer who worked in every honky-tonk for years before hitting the big time. But this bill is the big time. It's the largest investment in health of another country from just one country, the United States of America. The original legislation put too many congressional restrictions on this program. This frees up those restrictions.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, this legislation takes us in the right direction by freeing up restrictions because we knew even back in 1985 that to save the most lives this program should be run by doctors and not politicians. 
   Now, 23 years ago John Porter, Bob Mrazek, and I had no idea how large and successful this program would be. My only wish is the head of the Harvard Public School of Health, our first director of this early program, Dr. Jonathan Mann, could be with us. Dr. Mann was killed in a tragic airline accident, but I wish he could see us now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, we all know there is a growing Iranian threat, focused mostly on the people of Israel. 
   Earlier this year, JANE HARMAN joined my bipartisan letter with 70 Members of Congress calling for the U.S. to extend our full ballistic missile defenses to protect Israel. 
   Last night, the United States announced that we would make this key commitment. Secretary Gates told Defense Minister Barak that the first step will happen soon. America's most powerful radar, the X-Band, will soon defend Israel. 
   This is a historic step that sends a powerful message to Iran: A future attack on Israel will likely fail. Our two democracies are sticking together to ensure the safety of free peoples, even in the Middle East. 
   Yesterday's decision by America's defenders makes deterrence, diplomacy, and peace a much more likely future for the people of Israel.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (CONDEMNING THE PERSECUTION OF BAHA'IS IN IRAN -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, I co-authored this resolution with Rob Andrews as a call to action for the safety of the Baha'i faithful. 
   Never have followers of a more peaceful or gentle creed faced a more cruel and unjust tormenter. Founded in the mid-19th century in Persia, the Baha'i faith now extends to every country, including our own, but its faithful are most numerous in the place of its origin, now the modern day Iran. 
   The European Parliament has spoken out on this issue, and so we now add our voice as supporters of international human rights and the home of many Baha'i faithful here in America. 
   We have looked at a terrible situation unfolding in Iran. While Iranian Baha'is have suffered for many decades, their repression has grown significantly in the past few years. In 2006, Iran's Armed Forces Command headquarters ordered their Ministry of Information and the Revolutionary Guard and the police to identify all members of the Baha'i faith in Iran and to begin to monitor their activities. 
   In that same year, we saw the largest round-up of Baha'is. The Iranian Interior Ministry ordered provincial officials to cautiously and carefully monitor and then begin to manage all Baha'i activities. The Central Security Office of Iran's Ministry of Science, Research and Technology ordered 81 Iranian universities to expel any student discovered of being a Baha'i. 
   In 2007, the situation worsened. More than two-thirds of Baha'is enrolled in universities were expelled once they were identified. Police entered Baha'i homes and businesses to collect details on family members. Twenty-five industries were ordered to deny licenses to Baha'is, employers were pressured to fire Baha'i employees, and banks were told to refuse loans to Baha'i-owned businesses. As we heard before, Baha'i cemeteries were also destroyed. 
   In November of 2007, three Baha'i youths, Ms. Raha Sabet, Mr. Sasan Taqva and Ms. Haleh Roohi, were all detained for educating underprivileged children. They were later sentenced to 4 years in prison for this offense. The following month, the Iranian Parliament published a draft Islamic penal code requiring the death penalty for all apostates, a term that strictly applies to Baha'is and anyone who converts away from rigid Islam. 
   On May 14, 2008, seven members of the National Baha'i Coordinating Group were arrested. This is reminiscent of a mass disappearance and assumed murder of all members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is in Iran back in August of 1980. The seven arrested in May are still being held without any charge or access to attorneys. And in just the last 2 weeks, a number of Baha'i families were targeted with acts of arson. 
   This is government-sponsored persecution. And we in the Congress should not be silent as Iran sets up the mechanism to ethnically cleanse its Baha'i minority, totaling over 250,000 human beings. 
   This bipartisan resolution, which I introduced with Congressman Andrews, condemns the Government of Iran for its persistent repression of Baha'is and lack of due process afforded to this minority. Our resolution calls upon Iran to immediately release three Baha'i youths and to reject the draft Islamic penal code requiring the death penalty for all apostates. 
   Mr. Speaker, my district is also home to the headquarters of the North American Assembly of Baha'is. The son of the faith's founder laid the cornerstone on the Baha'i Temple in Wilmette, Illinois--now basically a de facto symbol of the North Shore and our commitment to diversity and tolerance. Would that this view be shared by the Iranian Government. 
   For the life of me, I do not understand why they attack Baha'is. The Baha'i faith teaches that Moses and Jesus and Mohammed are all respected teachers who added to the faith of our times. The Baha'is embody acceptance and tolerance and accommodation. They have a faith which renders them incapable of being a threat to a government, so it is up to us to speak for them. It's up to us to hold up a mirror to the Iranian Government to show it as a vicious and cruel state. 
   We have seen this movie before, but they have worn other uniforms in other countries. It is my hope that we can make this call to action to join with the European Parliament. We can help change the ending of this flick so that hundreds of thousands of Baha'is may one day be able to sleep well in future days knowing that the great democracies from across the seas in Europe and America watch over them. 
   I urge the adoption of this Kirk-Andrews resolution and mightily thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Berman, Ranking Member Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Chabot, for helping to bring this before America's Parliament and calling real attention to help avert what could be a new crime of the century.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (CONDEMNING THE PERSECUTION OF LABOR RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN IRAN -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, this resolution before us demonstrates America's commitment to human rights around the world. As the cochair of the Iran Working Group and a member of the Human Rights Caucus, I am proud to stand here as the co-author of this Kirk-Andrews resolution. 
   On April 9, 2007, Iranian agents arrested and imprisoned Mahmoud Salehi, the founder of the Saghez Bakery Workers Association. Mr. Salehi is a kidney patient who now sits in the Sanandaj prisons, his life in grave danger as the regime blocks his access to dialysis treatment. 
   July 10, plain-clothed Iranian agents severely beat and arrested Mansour Osanloo, the president of the Syndicate of Bus Drivers of the Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company. Osanloo now sits in Iran's notorious Evin prison with a chronic heart condition, no access to medical or legal assistance, and no contact with his family. The Teamsters have called on Iran to immediately release both men. 
   In August, the International Trade Union Confederation, together with the International Transport Workers Federation, staged an international ``day of action'' to free these union leaders; and now it's our turn. Together with my good friend and the cochair of the Iran Working Group, Congressman ROBERT ANDREWS of New Jersey, we introduced this resolution, a bipartisan  resolution condemning the Government of Iran for the arrest and imprisonment of Iranian union leaders, demanding their immediate release. Today, we speak with one voice, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to say to the Iranian people, we stand with your efforts to bring about political freedom and individual liberty in Iran.     
   As a board member of the National Endowment for Democracy, I am proud of the U.S. Government's commitment to international workers' rights. This resolution embodies that commitment. 
   I want to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their cosponsorship and continued leadership on this human rights issue. 
   I also want to thank my friend, Congressman Rob Andrews, and the vice chairs of the Iran Working Group, Congressman Boustany and Congressman Klein, and key staff members, including Alan Makovsky, Yleem Poblete, Alan Goldsmith, Luke Ballman, Michael Hare and Mira Kogen for their hard work on this resolution. 
   I especially want to thank Richard Goldberg of my staff, who did the heavy lift on this piece of legislation, so heavy he might become an honorary Teamster. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is very important to see what is happening in Iran, that there is now an attack going on against Baha'is, there is now an attack going on against intellectuals, and there is now an attack going on against free union members. We need to speak out against all of these if we adhere to our principles of faith to the dignity of the individual as enshrined, not just in the Constitution of the United States, but in the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which the Government of Iran is a signatory.

   Mr. KIRK. Madam Chairman, this bill stands for the principle that: Americans should not have a right to a secret ballot, but 89 percent of Americans want their Member of Congress to defend a secret ballot; Americans do not want their votes made public, but this bill stands for the principle that your vote will be made public, despite the fact that 89 percent of Americans want their votes to remain private. In sum, this bill lacks support from 79 percent of Americans who oppose its provisions. 
   Madam Chairman, the Fraternal Order of Police opposes this bill. The American Hospital Association opposes this bill. Thirty other major organizations oppose it because it is ironic that as we insist on free elections with secret ballots for Afghans, we remove that right for Americans. 
   I am sorry that over 300,000 Americans dropped their union memberships last year, but this Congress cannot rescue big labor from its own loss of popularity.

   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, today, the House will take up legislation that will remove the right of Americans to a secret ballot in their union elections. When asked, only 6 percent of Americans supported eliminating a secret ballot, while 89 percent supported keeping their rights. 
   Eighty-four percent of Americans said that they did not want their choices to be made public. And when asked about this legislation, only 14 percent of Americans said they supported it; 79 percent opposed. 
   Madam Speaker, we cannot advance the interests of Americans by taking away their right to a secret ballot. Since 2000, Congress has provided hundreds of millions of dollars to improve voting in America. We even support secret ballot elections in places like Poland and Afghanistan, where secret ballots are banned. 
   Madam Speaker, we know that the union movement has lost over 3,000 dues-paying members alone. But just because only 12 percent of Americans now choose to pay into a union is no reason to attack our rights as Americans to a secret ballot.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call upon Egypt to demonstrate it is a force for tolerance in the Arab world by releasing Kareem Amer from prison. 
   While other prisoners of conscience languish in Egyptian jails, the most troubling case is that of a young human rights blogger, Abdel Kareem Nabil Soliman. Kareem Amer, as he is known on the blogosphere, was sentenced to 4 years in prison in February 2007 solely for what he wrote on his blog--condemning Islamic extremism and the treatment of women. 
   Tomorrow, Egypt celebrates Revolution Day, a holiday during which the Egyptian President customarily releases prisoners. I strongly urge President Mubarak to release Kareem Amer, who now has served 17 months of his sentence. 
   Egypt is one of the largest recipients of U.S. taxpayer aid, and we should ensure that the partners of ours of this magnitude are also dedicated to the freedom of expression. The release of Kareem Amer, the first blogger arrested in the Arab world simply for what he wrote on his blog, would demonstrate Egypt's commitment to Internet freedom and to human rights.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I want to thank Mr. Wolf and our chairwoman for building a bipartisan bill that I think we all should support. 
   This legislation funds critical programs that advance our values overseas, it supports key allies of the United States, and it meets many of the humanitarian aspirations of the American people to do our part to relieve human suffering. 
   As a staffer, I helped found the global program on AIDS in 1985, and in this bill we have record funding to accomplish a great humanitarian mission of fighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic. 
   In this legislation, we support our best ally in the Middle East, Israel, now caught between two satellites of Iran: Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. In this bill, I helped sponsor language that increased the audit responsibilities over UNRWA programs in the West Bank and Gaza, a $2 million audit especially to look at incidents in which an al Qaeda cell was allowed to form in a UNRWA camp now bedeviling the Government of Lebanon, and where we saw Gaza Islamic University, a U.S.-funded foreign assistance recipient who is running in its chemistry lab a cell of Iranian military officers training students in the chemistry of making suicide bombs. 
   In this bill, I also helped fund increasing assistance in the Frontier Autonomous Tribal area of Pakistan. This is a program of almost theologic importance to the people of the United States because it is in north and south Waziristan and surrounding areas, that we think the world's most wanted man, Osama bin Laden, is hiding. And with this $20 million assistance package, we will bring new links and new friends in this region to help complete the arrest and bringing to justice of Ayman Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden for the murder of 3,000 Americans. 
   In this bill we also preserved new funding in fiscal year 2007 to help Christian communities in Iraq. There are still 600,000 Christians in Iraq, now concentrating in the Nineveh plain.     
   The $10 million designation we do there is a great help to these communities. 
   This bill makes a major forward step also in supporting a new democracy program for Syria, that one day that murderous and pernicious dictatorship may one day be replaced; and also backing women's rights programs in Iran, another country in need of a serious democracy make-over. 
   Lastly, this bill continues funding for Radio Free Asia and a voice supporting Western values, democracy, and human rights in a critical part of the world. 
   Before I was elected to Congress, I was a staff member with this subcommittee. I want to thank Christine Kojac and Rob Blair, Mike Ringler and Nisha Desai, Clelia Alvarado, Steve Marchese, Craig Higgins and Michele Sumilas, Mark Lopes, Lucy Heenan, Molly Miller, and my staff member, Richard Goldberg, for their work on this legislation. 
   In sum, this appropriations bill is bipartisan. It is supporting the interests of the United States, and it is strongly backed by our allies. It makes peace more likely and achieves important humanitarian goals of the United States.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, we have won the battle against the Bridge to Nowhere. 
   This $320 million federally subsidized structure would have been as long as the Golden Gate Bridge, standing 80 feet higher than the Brooklyn Bridge. It would have connected the mainland to an island, population 50, with no roads or stores. 
   Last year, the House adopted the Kirk amendment, blocking all funding for the Bridge to Nowhere. It was a  wise move to protect taxpayers. But the Senate said, no, and temporarily saved the bridge. House leaders of this Congress surprisingly backed the Bridge to Nowhere, but our arguments have finally won. Alaska has decided to block all funding for the Bridge to Nowhere. Following the collapse of the Minneapolis bridge, we now have additional funds to fix bridges in need of repair, and maybe return some of this money that was to be wasted to the American taxpayers that earned it.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, the history of the 20th century tells us that genocidal dictators say what they will do and then do what they said. Hitler told us in his writings that he would murder Jews. And he did. Stalin said that he would liquidate the Kulaks, Russia's small farmers. And he did. Pol Pot said he would eliminate the middle class and intellectuals. And he did. Now the President of Iran said he will wipe Israel off the face of the Earth. And he will. 
   Now, we Americans promised in 1945, never again. Ahmadinejad says that one Jewish holocaust is not enough, that he would wish to commit a second genocide, and he would deny that that would happen because he already denies that the holocaust happened. 
   Now, our options with regard to Iran are poor. Option one is to leave this to the United Nations alone. But that appears to lead to the Iranians having the bomb. Option two is to let Israel's armed forces remove the threat. But that mission is dangerous and uncertain. 
   Thanks to Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, we in Congress are developing a better and third option. Sanctions against Iran can work. This bill strengthens such sanctions. We can do more. We should bankrupt Bank Melli, a funder of terror. And we should quarantine gasoline sales to Iran. These measures could cripple Iran. Like the Yugoslav dictatorship, we can bring effective pressure to bear to achieve our objectives without military action. 
   The new President of France sees the growing danger and says the international community and Europe should act. The new French President is right. This bill takes us in the direction of a safer world and one in cooperation with our allies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia for this resolution. 
   In my judgment, most Members of Congress are quite naive about the security of their offices against an expert cyber attack from a foreign intelligence service. 
   With regards to China, these types of attack are uniquely damaging to the U.S.-China relationship. While the resolution before us concerns breaches in the security of House computers, we can assume that the Senate is also under attack. 
   The message we would send to China is that such a cyber attack on the Congress poses unique dangers to the long-term relationship of China and the United States. We all know that a Member of Congress will soon be sworn in as a President of the United States in just 7 months. To the senior leaders overseas that may direct such a cyber attack against congressional offices, I would ask, What are you thinking? The intelligence gained would pale in comparison to the damage directly done to U.S.-China relations. 
   House Information Systems should dramatically upgrade the protection of U.S. computers, especially in the House, and offer Members secure Blackberries to protect against that unique vulnerability. We should also review other security procedures that should lead the Congress especially to increase the protection of the White House, the Defense Department, and the State Department.

   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, I am very honored to have welcomed Pastor John I. Caples of Jesus Name Apostolic Church to open the House today. 
   I first really got to know Pastor Caples after the murder of Jarreau Patterson and David Mackins, just 16 years old. It was Pastor Caples that brought together the families of the murdered with the families of the murderers that ended a cycle of violence in my community. 
   He helped restart an athletic program. And with assistance from the wider community, he built a basketball court in just 8 weeks to relieve some of the tensions of the community. He then started the Family First Center, first in a basement, now three stories tall, reaching out to help at-risk youth turn away from violence and gangs, but especially despair, saving one heart at a time. 
   Pastor Caples tells us that the government can't do it all, but it can change one heart of one child at a time and make the most difference. He is one of the men I admire most whose ministry saves lives. He changes hearts. And most importantly, he returns the soul to a community that is in need of a very big heart with hope.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (THE SUBURBAN AGENDA -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, as we begin the work of this Congress, we should follow several key principles. Our first principle, which should be the main work of this House, should be focused on key major issues before the country; the second principle is that we should be effective and enact solutions for the American people; and the third is that we should use this debate to build consensus to deploy bipartisan action on behalf of our country. 
   One commentator looking at the record of the current Congress said that we are packing two days of debate into a four-day workweek. When you look at the record of this Congress so far, you can see that we have taken action on 13 bills to name a Federal building or post office or to build a road, we have enacted five bills to extend preexisting laws that were already on the books or passed last year, and we have passed eight bills cosponsored by a large number of Republicans or passed entirely without opposition. It is not an impressive record of work so far. And when you look at the actions of this Congress, you can see many pieces of legislation on which there has been no action in this Congress, despite a great need by the American people. 
   One of the key pieces of legislation that passed in the 109th Congress was the Deleting Online Predators Act. This is a bill which would protect children from online predators, especially those who use social networking sites like MySpace.com, the number one website on the planet, where the Center For National Missing and Exploited Children reports that at any one time there are 50,000 sexual predators online trying to get the attention of children. 
   This legislation, the Deleting Online Predators Act, passed the House of Representatives last year by a vote of 410-15. It stalled in the Senate, and as of yet in this Congress there has been no action whatsoever. 
   In the last Congress, we also passed the Student and Teacher Safety Act. The Student and Teacher Safety Act was endorsed by the National Education Association and would say that for any registered full-time teacher in America, that they have complete discretion to search a book bag or a locker to make sure that the classroom was gun-free. As a former teacher myself and as someone who has worked with many teachers, I think it is appropriate for the Congress to use a teacher's full-time professional judgment to make sure that their classroom, their workplace, was a safe place to be, not just for teachers, but especially for children. 
   When we have seen attacks in places like Winnetka, Illinois, or Columbine, or even Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Virginia, we can see that there is a need to fully empower teachers with the right to search to make sure that their facilities are safe. The Student and Teacher Safety Act passed the House unanimously in the last Congress, was delayed in the United States Senate, and no action has been taken this year. 
   The Congress in the last term also passed the Open Space and Farmland Preservation Act. We have seen throughout America, especially in suburban communities, rapidly disappearing green and open space. It is very important for us to defend the National Park System. In fact, I think the country should set a long-term goal of doubling the size of the National Park System. But we also want to make sure that we preserve green and open space close to where Americans live, in the suburbs. 
   This act would establish new and local grant programs to help protect suburban open space. Without action by the Congress, in 20 years time, many of the areas where we currently see green and open space could be an unending series of strip malls, removing an ambience, hurting our environment and delaying our ability to take effective action on global climate change. This legislation passed unanimously in the last Congress, but this Congress has failed to take any action on it. 
   One of the critical issues before this Congress is whether to pay Members of Congress who have been convicted of a felony and who have lost all of their appeals and beyond the shadow of a doubt stand condemned before the American people, and yet still collect a pension for their service in the Congress. 
   We have seen Members of Congress, like Dan Rostenkowski or Bob Ney or Duke Cunningham or James Traficant, all completely convicted by a jury of their peers beyond the shadow of a doubt, Members of Congress who lost or did not exercise any of their appeals, who are currently or have served in jail, and yet today or in months past have collected their congressional pensions from the jailhouse ATM. 
   In 1996, the Congress passed comprehensive reforms to kill the pension for any Member of Congress convicted of any one of 21 separate public integrity felonies. It was a bipartisan victory, with the full support of Speaker Hastert and Speaker Pelosi. This legislation, once again, was delayed and killed in the United States Senate. 
   Today we have seen Members like Congressman Jefferson from Louisiana, indicted on 16 felony counts, and, but for this legislation, would have a right as a nine term Member of Congress, if convicted and if losing all of their appeals, to collect a $50,000 a year pension, even if convicted for betraying the very taxpayers that pay that pension.     
   The Congress in February passed very limited pension reform legislation which wouldn't kill the pension for a Member of Congress on conviction of 21 felonies, but instead would only kill that pension for conviction of any one of four felonies. And basic felonies like wire fraud and income tax invasion would still allow the payment of a congressional pension. 
   Despite limited action by the Congress in January both in the House and Senate, legislation to kill the pension of a Member of Congress convicted of a felony has been completely stalled, completely stalled in February, in March, in April, in May, and now in the first weeks of June with no action and potential actions against other Members of Congress convicted of a felony.  
   In my view, the hundreds of thousands of dollars paid each year to Members of Congress convicted of a felony are a travesty and should be stopped by the elected representatives of the American people to defend the taxpayer. 
   All of this details the lack of a substantive agenda by this Congress which should be put before the American people working on issues that they care about, on key challenges before their families. As I have outlined, beyond naming some Post Offices, designating some roads, and passing legislation on which there is little to no debate, this Congress has not done much yet and right now is falling beneath its potential as a great deliberative body of one of the world's premier democracies. 
   What I would like to do tonight is lay out a new agenda, an agenda that would be meaningful to many Americans and taking on key problems before them. 
   This action was proffered before in the enactment of the suburban agenda last year which took action on a number of key items like the School Safety Acquiring Faculty Excellence Act authored by the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Porter). That bill basically took up the issue of Jessica Lunsford who was killed by someone employed by a school who had never had a background check. Despite his clear and demonstrable criminal record, this man was allowed to be in close contact with children leading to a tragic result. 
   The School Safety Acquiring Faculty Excellence Act passed the Congress and allowed every school in the country access to national criminal databases in order to ensure that every activity was taken to make sure that people who are put in close contact with children did not represent a clear and present danger to their safety. 
   The Congress also took on the issue of open space by passing the Charitable Donations For Open Space Act. This improved the treatment of conservation easements and other open space donations critical to preserving green and open space in the suburbs. 
   We also looked at the issue of helping families with expanding college costs by expanding permanently the charter of so-called 529 college savings account. 
   In my home State of Illinois, these are called ``bright start accounts.'' And by permanently extending these tax deferred savings plans, we helped Americans with their college savings. 
   With those pieces of legislation, and the ones I talked about earlier which passed the House in an overwhelming bipartisan fashion but were killed in the Senate, we laid out a work plan for the Congress strongly supported by the American people with overwhelming bipartisan support on the Republican and Democratic side. 
   But as I detailed, key pieces of legislation remain to be enacted like the Deleting Online Predators Act, like the Two Student and Teacher Safety Act, like the Open Space and Farmland Preservation Act. Persistence is a value strongly rewarded in the United States Congress, and following on that value, we have laid out a new suburban agenda for this year. The suburban agenda outlines a number of key pieces of legislation that directly meets the needs of American people in bipartisan ways to make sure that we are working on the key issues of the day and move the ball effectively, building bipartisan consensus. 
   Key items on the suburban agenda include the Gang Elimination Act by Representative Reichert, which looks at a key problem in the United States which is of internationally connected drug gangs representing major franchises in criminal activity, moving to the suburbs, potentially overwhelming suburban law enforcement communities. While large cities like New York or Chicago have large gang intelligence units and years of experience in dealing with international drug gangs, drug gangs that are now moving to the suburbs can quickly overwhelm a small police force like the one in Waukegan, Illinois, that is facing a criminal empire that comprises thousands of potential gang members, and links to a number of countries. 
   The Gang Elimination Act calls for the Justice Department to identify the top three national drug gangs and lay out a 4-year strategy for taking those drug gangs down. This is something entirely appropriate, to lay out a mandate for whoever is our next President of the United States to make sure that we remove this threat to the American people. 
   If you added up all of the documented gang members who are in the United States, it would total the size of the seventh largest army on the planet. The average gang shooter in my State of Illinois is in the 7th grade, and this is a threat that the Federal Government in Washington can help law enforcement deal with. 
   A second piece of the suburban agenda is the 401 Kids Family Savings Account Act by the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert). We look at key figures like 70 percent of Americans fear it will be more difficult for their children to remain in the middle class than it was for them. You have to simply ask the question: How likely or how easy will it be for your children to afford the very house that they are being raised in? 
   Access to college in our view is a critical step to making sure that your children have a chance to be full and successful members of the middle class. When we have seen universities like George Washington University now totaling $50,000 a year for tuition, we can see a substantial roadblock in the way of the future success of one's son or daughter. 
   The 401 Kids Family Savings Account, and previous legislation modeled after it, would allow every American to build success upon success. One of the best things that the Congress has done is to allow every American working with the opportunity to establish a 401(k) retirement program to build tax deferred savings for their families. 
   Tens of millions of Americans have now established those 401(k) programs, and we would like every American to have a chance, an opportunity, to establish a 401 kids account for their new son or daughter, from the first day they are born, tax deferred savings for college, for the first-time purchase of a home or for starting a new business. 
   This would not only help boost the savings of the United States, but it would be a dramatic way to upgrade the financial education of American children because these 401 kids account statements would come into parents and allow each one of them to sit down with their son or daughter and see how a disciplined pattern of savings and investment could build a lifetime of good habits for that child. 
   One of the other pieces of legislation is the Health Insurance For Life Act by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent). The Health Insurance For Life Act would basically look at a key problem in today's America which is that the average American family, especially in the suburbs, will have seven jobs over their lifetime, and we still have thousands of Americans exercising their COBRA rights to continue their health care coverage. Under Federal law if you have been covered by an employer-provided health care plan, if you lose your job, you can still continue health care and insurance for your family for at least 18 months at your own expense. But many Americans hit the end of that 18-month limit and they will not be allowed to have a safe place to cover their family without extension of these rights. 
   The Health Insurance Portability Act, otherwise known as the Health Insurance For Life Act of 2007, would allow families at their own cost to continue their health care insurance so there is always in a seven-job career a safe place for their family to be covered. And there would always be an option to maintain that coverage. 
   As I mentioned before, one of the key parts of our agenda is the Deleting Online Predators Act because throughout America we have not seen a reduction in people who would seek to use the new and powerful tools of the web and the Internet, and especially social networking sites, to reach out and attack children. It is already common knowledge through the culture, and especially through shows like Dateline NBC, that we have seen repeat offenders, even on the same network news show. 
   The suburban agenda also includes other key items. The one at the bottom is very important for the mid-21st century, and that is the Senior Safety For Dignity Act. The Senior Safety For Dignity Act updates a set of bill of rights for Americans who need nursing home care to ensure that they maintain their dignity. This is legislation  put forward by Mrs. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. 
   The Senior Safety For Dignity Act is very important because in our country the baby boom is aging. The first baby boomer collects a retirement check in 2009. The number of retirees in America will go from 35 million to almost 90 million, and the need for nursing home care in our country will grow. We need to upgrade the bill of rights for Americans in nursing homes because of the large expansion in capability that we will need in our country and to make sure that the quality of care is maintained. 
   One of the experts in this Congress is my colleague, a physician and a Member from Georgia, Dr. Price, who can comment on a number of these key issues.

   Mr. KIRK. One solution would be to have the government take over everyone's health care and to make sure we take action that breaks the link between you and your physician and insert a large bureaucracy that currently runs the post office and now put it in charge of your health care. 
   Many of us think that that may not be the way to go. The way to go is to make sure that for many Americans, they like the health insurance plan that they're on, and then they would like to carry that through the five to seven jobs that they will have in the 21st century.

   Mr. KIRK. The need here is to remove the fear that somehow a loss of a job or discovery of a preexisting condition will deny Americans and their families health care insurance. What we want to make sure is you already have a right under Federal law to extend your health care insurance for 18 months. Now, we're not talking about extending it indefinitely, because when an American reaches age 65, you're going to be covered by Medicare, and if you fall below the poverty line, you're going to be covered by Medicaid. 
   But for large numbers of people, especially looking at an unsure job market, we want to have them assured by this piece of legislation that there's always a safe place for their family to be covered.

   Mr. KIRK. The gentleman is one of the most respected physicians here in the Congress. The difficulty before this country is that the baby boom began when the troops came home in 1945. So, for an American born in that key year, you're going to be collecting a retirement check in 2009 when you hit your 65th birthday. There are so many Americans that then enter the retirement cohort and that may need nursing home care. That is the critical reason why this Congress may have to work on fewer bills naming post offices and designating roads and more on making sure that we maintain quality senior care as the baby boom generation retires.

   Mr. KIRK. I take the gentleman's point. When you look at our legislative work, in 5 1/2 months, in such promise with the new Congress, what we've done, these are all great Americans  who should be honored, but these actions should not be the sum total of what the Congress has done. 
   We've named the Gale McGee Post Office; the Rush Hudson Limbaugh, Sr., Post Office; Scipio Jones Post Office; the Lane Evans, one of my colleagues from Illinois, Post Office. All good Americans that should be honored, but this should not be the sum total of the work of the Congress. 
   The country witnessed a tragedy in Blacksburg, Virginia, with the attack on Virginia Tech. A number of experienced educators saw some warning signs, as we saw before at Columbine High School, as we saw before in the Winnetka school system when Laurie Dann attacked it. 
   The Student and Teacher Safety Act is common-sense legislation that this Congress should take up. It says to any full-time teacher, you know the warning signs, you know your children that are in the classrooms, and we want to make sure that you don't have to fear a trial lawyer and you don't have to get a warrant. If you suspect that a threat to your classroom, to your kids has come into a locker or in through a bookbag, and now the classroom is a dangerous place, you have complete authority to remove that danger.

   Mr. KIRK. I'm worried, too. The gentleman can talk about Atlanta. In Chicago, in the Chicagoland area, we are now seeing a great expansion of large national gang franchises like the Latin Kings, like the Gangster Disciples, et cetera, moving into the suburbs. A suburban police department has far fewer resources than a big city like Chicago and Atlanta to fight these, and so that's where the Federal Government can come in. 
   We're particularly concerned about a gang that some Americans have heard about called Mara Salvatrucha, MS-13, which seems to be particularly violent and one in which there are tantalizing clues that there may have been discussions with terrorist organizations with links overseas because the leaders of MS-13 don't have obviously any patriotic feeling toward the United States, and if they could link up to a terrorist organization for money, they would. 
   In the city of Chicago, we have now seen these gangs moving into places like Waukegan or Aurora or Joliet. I don't know about Atlanta, but it seems like particularly appropriate when you see that the average gang shooter for these international drug gangs is in the 7th grade.

   Mr. KIRK. The proposed amendment would have denied any documented member of an international drug gang from the chance to apply for the pathway to citizenship that it proposed, and that amendment was defeated 51-46. 
   When we came together and proposed the Gang Elimination Act, we at least looked at the several hundred thousand documented gang members in the United States and said how do we deal with this problem. 
   Sometimes I have to have the concern that this Congress may take action in which that number would increase, making the problem even worse by action of the Federal Government. That's why I think refocusing our work for actions beyond naming of post offices to looking at how small suburban communities are being overwhelmed by large gangs with international links, some of whom may add to members if the wrong legislation should pass the Congress, that is an issue that should be squarely put before this Congress.

   Mr. KIRK. It's okay to criticize, if we find that in 5 1/2 months we haven't done as much as we had hoped. But Americans, I think, at our core, look for solutions. This Congress has 18 months to go. So it's not enough just to criticize. You then have to put forward a positive agenda of not only saying we haven't done enough, and maybe we should not just consider 13 bills to name Federal property and 5 bills to extend preexisting law, but work at these problems. Then the question is, what is your agenda? 
   To date, I haven't seen a comprehensive agenda for the other side. I know that a vast majority of Republicans and Democrats will join on this agenda. When we look, we have a critical problem with online predators, at any  one time, 50,000 online predators contacting kids. There are hundreds of contacts in each month, in my own congressional district. 
   Now, people like Julie Wachtheim, the President of Wheeling High School, who, minutes after putting her class photo on a new MySpace page was contacted by a sexual predator using an advanced search engine that obviously showed us that he was contacting not just her, but hundreds of other young girls, in an attempt to find someone. I am not sure if that is the case in the Atlanta suburbs as well, but I think this is beginning to be a real threat to Americans. This was not part of our growing up.

   Mr. KIRK. I don't know of a single community in my district that hasn't been touched by this tragedy yet. 
   What we are talking about is laying out a new set of rules of the road in the 21st century to protect children, like advising parents through the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, that growing up in America today means having the computer in the living room rather than the child's bedroom, with a casual look and walk-bys by the parent so you can see who is trying to contact your kids. 
   Like one Pennsylvania mother said, in the 21st century I have a complete right to all of my children's passwords to make sure that I know who is trying to contact my young, minor child, and then to make sure that there are protections at school and in libraries. In my district, we have found some predators who are using library computers, school staff that were using library computers to contact kids, to make sure that our schools do not enable virtual hunting grounds to find kids. All of this is exactly what the Congress should work on, a new technology, which has an unintended effect of creating a new danger, and then Congress stepping in to make sure that danger is removed. We are not working on that right now. 
   With the eight bills cosponsored by Republicans or passed without opposition, five extending preexisting public law or order, and thirteen to name Federal property or to build a road, that action has not been taken. Action has not also been taken to kill the pension for a Member of Congress convicted of a felony. 
   We have just seen one of our colleagues indicted for 16 felonies. We have seen some of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, convicted, and yet they are paid their pension by the very taxpayers they have betrayed.

   Mr. KIRK. I just worry. Right now, the Congress took very limited action to kill the pensions for Members of Congress back on January 23, but then see stalled action. We have taken no action on ethics reform, killing pensions for Members of Congress convicted of felonies in February, no action in March, no action in April, no action in May, no action now for the first few weeks of June. 
   You worry because senior Members of Congress have the largest pensions, and they are in charge of this place. Why is it that we are delaying action on this critical reform? 
   I always thought that the most important thing about such a reform is to prevent crime. You know, if you kill the pension for a Member of Congress convicted of a felony, you almost turn their family members, their spouses, into adjuncts of the Ethics Committee, because they are worried about their future retirement income. That's as it should be, keeping everyone on the straight and narrow. 
   The State of Illinois is not seen as the cleanest State in the Union. Yet even under our State law, we kill the pension for public officials convicted of a felony, like even Governor Ryan, who just lost his appeal to do that. 
   I worry, though, that we haven't taken any of these actions. We have stalled actions on all of these items, with an overwhelming number of Republicans, Democrats and independents, wanting action on health care and making sure that we can afford college, and so far this Congress has fallen short of its potential.

   Mr. KIRK. I am just worried, too, because we have now talked about how George Washington University is 
   talking about $50,000 for 1-year of tuition, the first university in the country to break that mark. So you look at a 4-year bachelor's degree at $200,000, post tax, far beyond the ability of a middle-class family to reach that level. 
   So what should the Congress do? Should we have the government take over all college education? Should the government control prices? Should we have more controls from the House of Representatives so that those who run every other government bureaucracies now run every education institution in the country? I would say no. I would say that we have had too many shortages and too much waste if a bureaucracy can take control of a college.  
   On the other hand, could we all join together to increase savings and investment for each American family to build success upon success, the 401(k) program, by authorizing each American family the day that your son or daughter is born to establish a 401 kids tax-deferred savings account. 
   When we look at how this Congress can sometimes change culture, we have seen that 401(k), an obscure section of the IRS code, has now become part of the lexicon off our country because of how successful it is.

   So what is it that we can do that becomes part of the cultural experience of every American when their son or daughter is born? One of the things we can do is pass this bill so that every dad on their way home, or mom, if she is so inclined, can stop by some sort of financial institution or a savings and loan or a credit union, and establish a 401Kids account for their son or daughter.

   Mr. KIRK. Right. So the problem we have now is that we have not fully taken advantage of the successes that we have already put in place, that Congress lets each State establish a college charter savings plan like HOPE Scholarship in Georgia or Bright Start in Illinois. But these, each State program, has restrictions and the inability to transfer freely throughout the country. 
   One of the great things about the 401(k) program is that it allows, not only, for Americans to transfer their accounts between employers, but no difficulty to transfer between States. Should not we give that opportunity to each young son or daughter in America so that we can save and invest for college? 
   We know, already, with $70 billion invested in HOPE scholarships or in Bright Start accounts throughout the country, that this has been a great success. How much more of a success will we have if we simply gave the full national charter to 401Kids accounts. I come out of a military background, if you are transferred, or you are part of a large organization, you may live in several States and have the ability to fully transfer these amounts in a national program, bottom line, to make sure that there is much more money available for your son or daughter to be in college.

   Mr. KIRK. We have now seen also with the 401(k) program a change in how Americans look at the economy for the future. There was a time in which most Americans owned no stock and saw the New York Stock Exchange or the other exchanges as something far away, not part of their lives, and maybe for rich people only. 
   The 401(k) program changed all of that.     
   And so now we have tens of millions of Americans who are investors, and changing that one cultural attribute that we maybe shouldn't have, which is looking too much for the short term, and helping the whole country change into a new investor mentality, to invest for the long haul, to look at high technology and other investments to see that savings can be built up in a far more substantial way, beyond just a savings account at a bank if they can be put into long term stocks and bonds. 
   These are habits that have been built for adults, but have not been inculcated in children; that if we start 401 kids accounts with your son or daughter's name on that account, that as your child gets to be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 years old, it gives an education opportunity to say to your daughter, look at what we've done in just the last year and how much this has gone up, hoping that this will set an example for the rest of her life, making sure that she has successful habits to save and invest for the future.

   And Number 3, that we should work to build consensus to sustain bipartisan action. We should not operate this House in a way that, as one person said, packs 2 days of debate into a 4-day work week; that this House can do much more than name Post Offices or designate roads; that we are here not just criticizing, we're laying out an agenda that, based on the last Congress, we know an overwhelming number of Democrats and Republicans will join, like the Deleting On-Line Predators Act that passed 410-15; like the Student and Teacher Safety Act endorsed by the National Education Association that passed unanimously; like the Open Space and Farm Land Preservation Act that also passed unanimously. 
   If we can join together on these items, key pieces of legislation, already bipartisan cosponsors laid out, I think we would help this Congress reach more of the potential than currently in 5 months of work it's failed to do.

   American leadership, doctors in charge, new hope for patients, oh, and bipartisan cooperation to make each of these ideals a reality, that's why we should support this bill. 
   In my home State of Illinois, our researchers and doctors are forging ahead like Dr. John Kessler, one of the leading researchers in the field of embryonic stem cell research at Northwestern University, who said ``stem cell biology promises to revolutionize the practice of medicine.'' 
   I've also met with Dr. Daniel Peterson, an associate professor of neuroscience at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in north Chicago, working on a project where stem cells are used for structural brain repair, a critical treatment for soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress that offers new hope for veterans. 
   Or even a reference to today's Chicago Tribune, which talked about Dr. Richard Burt of Northwestern University and his work on stem cell research which could offer a cure for Type I diabetes. 
   Bringing hope to these patients and making sure the United States is in the lead and making sure that doctors are guiding this research and cures, not politicians, that's why we should pass this bill, and that's why I strongly support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I thank the Chairman. 
   I also want to thank my partners in this effort, Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, because their support for this amendment was critical. 
   Mr. Chairman, one of the most successful counter-terror programs run by the United States is not managed by the Defense Department or the CIA. It is the State Department's Rewards for Justice Program run by Mrs. Rachel Schindel-Gombis. 
   By offering rewards, we have brought a number of criminals to justice who killed Americans both here and abroad. One of our proudest successes was the program's production of matchbook covers, like this one here. Tipped off by a face and a telephone number on a matchbook, a Pakistani citizen provided a key tip for the arrest of Mir Amal Kansi, the man who murdered two Americans outside the CIA's gate here in Virginia. Thanks to this program, Kansi was arrested, extradited, convicted and executed for the cold-blooded murders he committed, as was the famous al Qaeda terrorist Ramsi Yousef. 
   As a congressional staff member, I drafted the amendments to this program that first opened this up to the arrest of United Nations war criminals, specifically people indicted for war crimes by the tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia. The program has helped bring dozens of mass murderers to justice, fulfilling some of the highest and best ideals of the United States when we promised ``never again'' after liberating the Nazi death camps. 
   As a Member of Congress, I coauthored the legislation for this program that allowed varied rewards and mass media campaigns. I took action on this after conducting missions on the Afghan-Pakistan border where I learned that tribesmen in that region would not respond as strongly to a $100,000 cash award but would respond more strongly to an offer of say one kilo of gold or a new motorcycle. 
   Using this new authority, the State Department launched an unprecedented multilingual campaign that yielded dozens of new contracts for the arrest of senior al Qaeda and Taliban leaders. 
   One target stands above all, and that is the arrest of Osama bin Laden for the murder of 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001. By many accounts, bin Laden and the core leadership of al Qaeda and the Taliban are hiding in the frontier autonomous tribal areas of Pakistan or in the border provinces of Afghanistan. The Rewards for Justice Program has helped to arrest several senior Taliban and al Qaeda leaders but not bin Laden or his number two, Ayman Al Zawahiri. 
   The amendment before us builds on the extensive legislative tradition of this program, bipartisan, effective and flexible, to make it more likely that the world's most wanted men pay for the murder of thousands of Americans. 
   In this amendment, we authorize the State Department to pay rewards to anyone in Afghanistan or Pakistan, including government employees, if the information leads to the arrest of ``exceptionally high-profile'' targets. 
   Mr. Chairman, the support for Osama bin Laden, like this poster here which went out in English as well as many in Urdu and Dari, remains high. For us, we need to rely on sometimes the only assets we have in this region which are government employees in the service of Afghanistan or Pakistan; and if they can provide the information that leads to the arrest of Osama bin Laden or Ayman Al Zawahiri, then we should gladly pay for this justice. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have discussed this amendment with senior officials in the White House who expressed their support. I will note the receipt of talking points from the State Department bureaucracy received this morning that  expressed concerns, and my reaction is that the officials who authored these points may work for someone, but they do not serve the American people. Their points are poorly written and disconnected and reflect strongly on a disappointing State Department tradition of sometimes serving an obscure academic point but not America's citizens or their future security. 
   If we can arrest bin Laden, we should. If reward money helps to lead to his arrest, we should pay it. This program should be run in the most flexible and effective manner possible so that the greatest mass murderers in American history should meet their final justice.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, today the House passed a bill claiming to be the U.S. Troop Readiness Act that included billions in pork barrel spending unrelated to the needs of our troops. The funding restrictions included in the bill were so unpopular that the congressional leadership loaded a $25 million bailout for spinach farmers, a $74 million payment for peanut storage, and a $283 million subsidy for milk producers, all to attract votes for the unpopular bill. 
   As USA Today stated: ``Votes were won for peanuts, or to be more accurate, for peanut subsidies.'' The bill also declares all of this spending, for spinach, for milk and peanut subsidies, as emergency wartime supplemental appropriations.  
   This bill passed $23 billion over budget. It only passed by four votes. Calculating a pork-to-vote ratio, that means that the Congress spent over $5 billion in pork spending per vote just to win passage for this legislation. And it is only March. How much more will the taxpayer be charged to pass other unpopular bills?

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Chairman, I am here today because one of our most precious natural resources is under siege. As the world's largest freshwater system, the Great Lakes provide food, recreation, and drinking water for nearly 40 million people. Yet with each day, our water grows more contaminated with sewage discharged from municipalities along the lakes. 
   Nearly 24 billion gallons of sewage are dumped into the Great Lakes each year. While cities like Milwaukee have begun to reduce the amounts of sewage they discharge, not enough is being done to terminate this harmful practice. Detroit, for example, dumps 13.2 billion gallons of sewage per year into the lakes. This has a devastating effect on the region's tourism sector. Studies estimate an economic loss of roughly $8,000 per day as a result of closing a Lake Michigan beach due to pollution. In 2005, sewage discharges contributed to the nearly 3,000 Great Lakes' beach closures, an increase of 5 percent over the previous year. In my own district, there were 150 beach closures in just 92 days of summer in 2004. This is unacceptable. 
   For years, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund has helped to fund billions of dollars worth of water quality projects, but Federal funding for this program is declining. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Government Accountability Office estimated a $500 billion shortfall in clean water infrastructure investment over the next two decades. The important legislation in front of us would increase the authorization for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which is imperative if we want to escape this massive shortfall. I had proposed an amendment establishing an added financing mechanism while also adding significant incentive for States and cities to eliminate their pollution into the Great Lakes. 
   The Kirk amendment would have set a date certain, 2027, to end sewage dumping directly into the Great Lakes by increasing fines for dumping to $100,000 per violation, per day. The next 20 years would allow municipalities to upgrade their sewage system and ensure a level playing field for all communities along the Great Lakes. This would not affect any current dumping restrictions or regulation. The amendment further would have established a Great Lakes clean-up fund within the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, to which all sewage dumping penalties would be directed. Funds would be used to spur projects to improve wastewater discharges and protect the water quality of our lakes with a special focus on greener options such as habitat protection and wetland restoration. 
   This amendment would have also required both cities and the EPA to publicly report dumping levels of sewage a year after enactment. Currently there is no uniform standard for public disclosure of wastewater violations. It is imperative that we understand the extent of the problem we are facing, and that education begins with public disclosure of all dumping into the Great Lakes. 
   With the growing populations living along the American and Canadian shores of the Great Lakes, it is appropriate to set a date that gives cities the time to make needed changes to their infrastructure to prohibit sewage dumping in the Great Lakes. We must preserve Great Lakes beaches, maintain the region's economic growth and protect the nation's largest supply of drinking water. 
   Madam Chairman, I support this bill in its current form. It would have been a better bill had the congressional leadership allowed the Kirk amendment to be considered. I do not understand why the House Democratic Leadership opposes setting a deadline to ban sewage dumping in Lake Michigan and other Great Lakes. By blocking my amendment, the congressional leadership missed a key opportunity to protect our environment.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (PENSION BILL REGARDING CONVICTED FORMER MEMBERS FALLS SHORT -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, today Congressman Ney was sentenced to 30 months in jail after pleading guilty to two Federal felonies. Amazingly, under our law he will still collect a congressional pension funded by the U.S. taxpayer. In fact, other Members of Congress who pled guilty or were convicted of crimes collect. Congressman Rostenkowski collects. Congressman Traficant collects. Congressman Cunningham collects. All taxpayer-funded pensions. 
   On Monday, we will take up a very limited bill to kill pensions for Members of Congress who commit only one of four felonies. The legislation we will consider misses 17 other public integrity felonies that the House already adopted with the support of Speaker Pelosi and Speaker Hastert in previous years. The legislation we consider on Monday has never been through a committee and the leadership will not allow any amendments to the legislation. There will be no vote permitted to add the other 17 public integrity felonies that should have been part of this needed reform. The legislation that we will consider on Monday will fall short of the potential that we had to reform this House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today just to support this legislation which increases funds, provides programs that protect our national forests and parks and enhance our clean water infrastructure. The bill also provides more than $1.3 billion for Great Lakes restoration and protection programs and an increase of $32 million over fiscal year 2007. 
   Providing water, jobs, food and recreation for more than 40 million people, the Great Lakes are one of our Nation's most valuable natural habitats. It is critical that we continue to support programs and provide funds that ensure the restoration and preservation of this National treasure. 
   Now, in this bill we fund the Great Lakes Legacy Act, which is a critical component of this ecosystems restoration. It provides funds for the cleanup of the most polluted sites in the region. There are 26 of these sites designated  officially as areas of concern located wholly within the United States and then five more inside Canada. From six of the projects that we receive funding since the program's inception, the EPA estimates that over 1.2 million cubic yards of contaminated sediments will be removed. 
   Madam Chairman, I really want to thank Chairman Dicks and ranking member Tiahrt for working with me to increase funds above the President's request to provide $37 million for this program, which is an increase of over $7 million last year. 
   I also want to thank these gentlemen for providing an increase of roughly $3 million to the National Great Lakes Program Office to fund additional staff to implement the Legacy Act. The aid will help us to eliminate the backlog in reviewing proposals to speed up the cleanup of polluted sites. 
   Madam Chairman, I just want to thank the two gentlemen. I am in favor of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (PEACE NOT APARTHEID: MORE FICTION THAN FACTS -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, in today's Washington Post, former President Jimmy Carter defended his book, ``Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.'' 
   President Carter wrote, `` ..... most critics have not seriously disputed or even mentioned the facts ..... '' 
   But after reading the book, I have become a critic and today will only correct the facts that he purports in his book. Regarding our policy towards Israel, there is little room for mistakes, let alone outright misstatements of fact. 
   For that reason, I want to present to the House eight factual inaccuracies found in President Carter's book. 
   Error number one, on page 62, President Carter quotes Yasser Arafat as telling him, ``The Palestinian Liberation Organization has never advocated the annihilation of Israel.'' No evidence is provided, and the book does not contain a single footnote. 
   Fact check, article 22 of the PLO's charter states, ``The liberation of Palestine will destroy the Zionist and imperialist presence.'' Yasser Arafat supported this charter, and he directly lied to President Carter. 
   Error number two, on page 57 President Carter writes, ``The 1947 armistice demarcation lines became the borders of the new nation of Israel, and were accepted by Israel and the United States, and recognized officially by the United Nations.'' 
   Fact, the 1949 armistice lines were never accepted as the official borders of Israel, United States or the United Nations. The error reflects a very poor attention to detail in the book. 
   Error number three, on page number 127, President Carter writes that there was ``a surprising exodus of Christians from the Holy Land.'' 
   Fact, Israel is one of the only Middle Eastern nations where the Christian community has grown in the last half century. But Christian communities and other faith communities like Baha'is have dropped in size in many Muslim nations. 
   Error number four, on page 152 President Carter writes, ``It was later claimed that the Palestinians rejected a `generous offer' put forward by Prime Minister Barak with Israel only keeping 5 percent of the West Bank. The fact is no such offers were made.'' 
   Fact, according to President Clinton's lead negotiator, Ambassador Dennis Ross, Prime Minister Barak accepted President Clinton's proposal, offering to withdraw from 97 percent of the West Bank, to dismantle isolated settlements, and to accept the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. Arafat rejected this proposal, and a quick call between President Carter and President Clinton would have corrected this error. 
   Error number five, on page number 148 President Carter presents two maps he claims were considered at Camp David, one of them labeled ``Israel's interpretation of Clinton's proposal.'' 
   Fact, there were no maps at Camp David. The map President Carter labeled as Israel's interpretation is a copy of a map that was created later by Dennis Ross for his book, ``The Missing Peace.'' Ambassador Ross's map is a representation of an offer agreed to by Prime Minister Barak and rejected by Arafat. President Carter violated Ambassador Ross's copyright of the map. 
   Error six, on page 197 President Carter writes, ``Confessions extracted through torture are admissible in Israeli courts.'' 
   Fact, the Israeli Supreme Court banned the use of torture in interrogations in a decision handed down by the court on September 6, 1999, by Supreme Court President Barak. 
   Error number seven, on page 188 President Carter writes, ``Kadima had been expected to gain 43 seats based on its pledge of a unilateral expansion of the `great wall.' '' 
   Fact, Israel's Kadima Party ran on Prime Minister Sharon's platform of disengagement, a pledge to dismantle settlements and unilaterally withdraw from territory. 
   Error number eight, on page 215 President Carter writes that the one option for Israel is ``withdrawal from the 1967 border as specified in U.N. Resolution 242.'' 
   Fact. The U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 does not define a border. 
   Madam Speaker, these errors, in fact, diminish the credibility of President Carter's book. President Carter is entitled to his own opinions, but not to his own facts. The errors I present here are only a sampling of the other errors included in his book. 
   Now, in the twilight of his career, with many at the Carter Center resigning from their posts, President Carter should recall the book and hire competent assistants to assure that his future work does not reflect such poor scholarship. 
   I want to thank, especially, Dr. Mitchell Bard and the Committee for Accuracy in the Middle East Reporting in America for helping compile this list of errors.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, the security at O'Hare Airport is not what it should be. Reports over the weekend showed 3,700 security badges have not been returned from former employees no longer allowed to work at the airfield. Many of the badges had not been canceled and would permit anyone access to an aircraft. 
   According to CBS TV, several of the employees involved had previous arrest records and convictions for nonmajor crimes. Reports also indicated that several doors at O'Hare did not even have ID scanners, allowing anyone who appeared to be official to enter the airfield. 
   The Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Agency and Federal law enforcement officers that I have met with have all promised action. While they can levy fines on the contractors involved, the penalties should be increased.  
   Later this month, I will introduce legislation levying a fine of $10,000 per day for an airport security badge that is not canceled for an employee that was fired. That should get their attention and help make the world's busiest airport more secure.

   We are told that despite the end of the 100 hours, this large bill cannot be amended. We have had no hearings on this bill. There is no report to accompany the legislation detailing hundreds of billions in spending, and we will not be allowed to offer improvements like taking the savings in canceling Federal earmarks and making sure the deficit is reduced. 
   In large part, Members of this House may be later embarrassed when enterprising reporters who have the time to read this legislation find out what we have actually done without review or consideration.

   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. Last week, I placed a wager with one of our colleagues, Dr. JINDAL, and Mr. Boustany, on the Bears and whether they would win a place at the Super Bowl. Who won? The Bears. And now we look forward to welcoming these two sons of Louisiana to pay their football wager, which is to spend a work session at the Lake County, Illinois, Habitat For Humanity, ironically preparing a home for a new family displaced by Hurricane Katrina and now living in northern Illinois. 
   Regarding the coming contest, my district is home to both Lovie Smith and the Bears' training facility, Halas Hall in Lake Forest. I am honored to represent Lovie, whose life story is an inspiration. Raised in rural Big Sandy, Texas, Lovie's modesty and work led him to become the premier head coach of the NFL. Since his 5-11 start in 2004, his first season in Chicago, Lovie coached the Bears to a spectacular 26-9 record over the past two seasons, including two impressive playoff victories. 
   Lovie embodies the Bears tradition of tough, hard-nosed football that has defined the organization since its founding in 1919. As the Bears' 19th head coach, Lovie has joined the coaching giants like Mike Ditka and George Halas as leaders of the Monsters of the Midway. Chicago has embraced Lovie as a football icon, and I am proud to honor him on the floor today. 
   And today we also have a message for the Bears organization. Lovie deserves a raise and a ring because he has earned the respect of everyone from Chicagoland. Best of luck to you, Coach, in Miami. And I won't say anything cheap like, Bears love horse meat for breakfast

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (SAVING ENERGY THROUGH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Chairman, as the gas prices continue to rise, the most effective and immediate way to offer relief is to provide incentives for mass transit use. According to a study published by the American Public Transportation Association, public transportation use saves an annual 1.4 billion gallons of gasoline, almost 4 million gallons per day. Factoring in the national average of gas at $4 a gallon, it saves consumers nearly $16 million a day in gas costs. 
   Now, I support our public transportation system, and I'm pleased to support an extensive grant program to help expand transit use across the country. But I am disappointed in this bill because it only requires that Federal employees be offered transit benefits. While I support expanding the current transit benefit program, all Americans should have this benefit. 
   Now, more than a month ago, Congressmen Lipinski and Biggert and I introduced bipartisan legislation, the Creating Opportunities to Motivate Mass-transit Utilization to Encourage Ridership Act, the Commuter Act of 2008. Our legislation offers employers a 50 percent tax credit for all transit benefits provided to employees. And under its provisions, employees would receive up to $1,380 in free mass-transit funds this year, with the employer receiving a $690 tax credit. 
   According to Forbes, the average gasoline costs in the ten worst commuter cities is $6.35 per day. Should businesses take advantage of this incentive, they would save their employees $1,600 per year. As family budgets tighten, an extra $1,600, or if there's two commuters, $3,200 would really ease burdens of health care and education. Such a benefit should also include Americans who are not lucky enough to have a Federal job. 
   I support H.R. 6052, but I'm surprised that this bill stands for the principle that if the taxpayer already pays your salary, we will help you more. But what if you're not lucky enough to have a government-paid position? Under this bill, you're out of luck. But under our bipartisan Commuter Act, you would have this benefit, too. 
   To help commuters, we should pass the bipartisan Commute Act to help all communities to really lower the gas bill of the United States and not just offer assistance to people already paid by the Feds.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, hours ago Iran fired nine long-range missiles, including the improved Shahab-III that can hit the State of Israel. It is time for the United States to offer full ballistic missile defenses for Israel. 
   Democracies are best when they stick together. We joined 10 years ago with the U.S. Army and Israeli military to build the medium-range Arrow missile defense system. While good, it offers Israel only a defense in the last minute. Three years ago we gave Israel ``Eyes in the Sky,'' early warning data that gave her warning time an increase from 1 minute to 11 minutes. 
   Now, in the face of the rapidly growing Iranian threat, the G8 should think about sanctions, like a gasoline quarantine because Iran is totally dependent on half its gas from foreign tankers, most insured by Lloyds of London, and we can work with the British on that. 
   But most importantly, we should follow the direction of 70 Democrats and Republicans in the Kirk-Harman letter to offer full ballistic missile defenses for Israel. Our defenses have five times the range of Israel's and can do the most to lower the rising tensions in the Middle East.

   Mr. KIRK. I thank the gentleman and I want to thank Congressman Emanuel and Congressman Ehlers for bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Ten days ago, Michael Hawthorne of the Chicago Tribune broke the story that British Petroleum planned to increase its dumping into the source of our drinking water, Lake Michigan. It was a stunning mistake. BP, a pretend friend of the environment, should have not done this. 
   Tony Hayward, BP's chief, claims he is ``Beyond Petroleum'' when he plans to actually become a ``Bad Polluter.'' 
   Governor Daniels of Indiana also made a big mistake. His State EPA failed in their duty to protect the public and authorized the first new dumping in the lake in a decade. Now 19 Republicans and Democrats joined with Congressman Lipinski and me calling on the U.S. EPA to pull this permit; and 2,700 of my constituents signed the petition condemning BP's plan to increase its dumping in the lake. 
   Congressman Lipinski and I authored bipartisan legislation moving us to a time in which all dumping in the Great Lakes ends. Twenty-four billion gallons of raw sewage are dumped into the lake each year, and 12 billion gallons of raw sewage are dumped in the Great Lakes by the city of Detroit alone. But that is current dumping which should definitely end. We cannot allow new dumping by BP. 
   Later today we will meet with the head of BP North America, and given the legislative tsunami we are preparing, we should simply be discussing BP's terms of surrender on their lake-dumping plan. BP, millions spent in the ``Beyond Petroleum'' campaign, but we know it stands for ``Bad Polluter.'' Hopefully, BP will back down and be a better partner in protecting Lake Michigan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, there are over 50 million Americans who have worn our country's uniform, and over 20 million are alive today. Among them there are 3 million Americans who are disabled from wounds in battle. Thanks to advances in military medicine, soldiers who once died of their wounds are now surviving and they return from battle with broken bodies, but not broken spirits. It is that spirit of men and women that we honor today. This Moore-Kirk bill will help raise funds for a memorial to disabled American veterans. 
   I want to particularly thank my bipartisan partner in this effort, Representative Dennis Moore of Kansas. We formed a bond and a partnership to pass this bill first authored by Representative Sue Kelly of New York. Mr. Moore and I worked many weeks to get over 290 cosponsors, Republicans and Democrats, to make sure this bill could come to the floor. 
   In 2000, Congress authorized the construction of the Americans Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial just south of the Rayburn Building within sight of the U.S. Capitol. Last December, President Bush signed into law a bill transferring control of the land for the memorial from the District of Columbia to the National Park Service. Now, the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation needs to raise approximately $65 million to cover the cost of construction. 
   Our bill today will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative silver dollars to be sold with a surcharge that will help the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation to raise the money it needs for this memorial. Not only will these coins be collectors' items, but they will benefit this worthy cause. 
   Earlier this year, I had the privilege of meeting with an extraordinary young man, Sergeant Bryan Anderson of Rolling Meadows, Illinois. Bryan's story is, unfortunately, all too common for our soldiers in Iraq, but his spirit is uncommon, and his attitude sets him apart from the average person. 
   You see, Bryan lost both legs and an arm to a roadside bomb in Iraq. He jokes that he would have lost both arms if he hadn't been smoking when the bomb detonated. His sense of humor and determination are clearly apparent in the interview that he gave to Esquire Magazine in January. In it he said, ``This wound does not define me. It may be how I look on the outside, but it is not who I am. I guess you could remember me easily as being a triple amputee, but that's not who I am. It has nothing to do with who I am. I have always been the same person.'' 
   Bryan is a self-described ``adrenalin junkie'' who hopes one day to become a Hollywood stuntman. Since his appearances on the cover of Esquire, he has had numerous opportunities to use his story for the gain of this legislation, often being baited to say if he has any political affiliation or asked what he thinks about the war. Each time he refuses to take the bait. He says he doesn't want to talk about politics. But he is always willing and excited to talk about the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. 
   Washington has legions of professional advocates who make a living convincing people to see issues from their point of view, but none of them compare to Bryan Anderson. With Bryan, what you see is what you get, an American veteran with an inspirational story that has dedicated a good portion of his life to seeing that this memorial be built, not just for himself, but for 3 million disabled American veterans, and for everyone to remember the sacrifices that they have made. 
   Bryan is a genuine man that you may one day meet. I hope passage of this legislation brings us closer to a day when Bryan returns to Capitol Hill to see the memorial that he helped to build. 
   With more than 3 million disabled American veterans in the United States, it is fitting that we construct a memorial in Washington, D.C., within sight of this Capitol. It is my hope that my colleagues will answer Bryan Anderson's call to action and support this legislation to make this memorial a reality. 
   With that, I just want to once again thank my colleague from Kansas (Mr. Moore) for an outstanding partnership and a great bipartisan victory today.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, Congress should kill the pension for Members of Congress convicted of a felony. In January, I offered legislation, H.R. 14, that killed a pension on the conviction of any one of 21 public integrity felonies. Both Speaker Pelosi and Hastert voted for this reform.  
   But the bill we consider today leaves congressional pensions intact for violating 17 of these felonies, including income tax evasion, wire fraud, intimidation to secure contributions, and making fraudulent claims. 
   In January, we passed a limited reform bill that killed a pension for conviction of only four felonies. But shockingly, this bill has now been gutted. 
   In January we voted to kill the pension for a Member of Congress convicted of acting as a foreign agent, but this felony has now been deleted from the final package. Who deleted it? Is it okay for a Member of Congress convicted of a felony by acting as a foreign agent? 
   As you can see, the bill we will consider today falls far short of its potential for reform. A Member convicted of acting as a foreign agent should not receive a taxpayer pension.

   Mr. KIRK. I thank the gentleman. 
   I would say, to correct the record, this bill does include violations of 18 U.S.C. 219, acting as a foreign principal. 
   There are several reforms in this measure, but what is most surprising are the reforms which are not in this measure, reforms which both Speaker Pelosi and Speaker Hastert supported. 
   Under this legislation, a Member of Congress convicted of income tax evasion would still have a full right to his Federal pension. Under this legislation, a Member of Congress convicted of  interstate and foreign travel or transportation in the aid of racketeering enterprises is fully able to have a pension. In fact, there are other felonies, all of which we included in previous reform measures which are were dropped from this reform measure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, according to a 2005 GAO study, employers reported the use of 1.4 million Social Security numbers that did not exist. Nearly 1.7 million numbers had been used by multiple individuals, sometimes as many as 500 times for the same Social Security number. In my district, the Waukegan police find that at least 20 fake Social Security cards are found by law enforcement every week. 
   Now, upgrading the Social Security card should be common sense. It's about seniors. It's about identity theft. It's about illegal immigration. And it's about keeping Americans safe. 
   When we look at today's Social Security card, we find a 1930s design. It lacks a picture. It lacks a bar code. It lacks a magnetic strip. It poses almost no barrier to the thousands of counterfeiters that make false Social Security cards. 
   Today, along with my colleague from Illinois Peter Roskam, we have introduced legislation to finally give Americans the choice between the old 1930s design Social Security card and the new secure Social Security card. This card offers enhanced protections across the board. It would replace that flimsy and easily counterfeitable Social Security card with a 21st century identity document that gives seniors real protection. Our legislation and this design is based on the government's common access card. Already the U.S. government has issued 10 million of these cards, and its protections, in our judgment, we believe, should be offered to people in the 21st century against Social Security card counterfeiters. 
   We think this legislation is important to propose a significant barrier to those who would counterfeit Social Security cards, to help seniors in fighting identity theft, and to make sure that a person who has that number and this card is really who they say it is.  
   We saw on September 11 that 18 of 19 hijackers had valid U.S. IDs during their crime of the century. I think it's time to make sure that at least the Social Security card has the 21st century protections that we can offer to make sure that we protect seniors, to make sure that we protect all Americans, and to protect the Social Security system. That's why we think that this legislation to create these secure Social Security cards is an idea whose time has come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, for the last 2 years, I've worked to kill funding for the bridges to nowhere, one connecting Alaska to an island with 50 people and the other to an island with just 22. These federally funded structures would be almost as long as the Golden Gate Bridge, and would be taller than the Brooklyn Bridge. Never in the history of the Congress has so much money been spent for so few. 
   Now, last year the House Appropriations Committee backed my amendment and put this House on record against funding the bridges to nowhere. We also completely deleted the Federal earmark that required spending on these projects, and that was the right decision. 
   The Federal Government spends too much, and higher spending leads to higher taxes, higher taxes to a smaller economy and fewer jobs, and we should not follow that road. But that is the direction that the Bridge to Nowhere leads. 
   This year was different. A new party and a new leader promised change here in Washington. Amazingly, under the Republicans, this House came out against funding the Bridge to Nowhere. But under the Democrats, the Appropriations Committee now voted to block an amendment cutting off funding for the bridges. 
   Under this Congress, leaders promised to kill pensions for Members of Congress convicted of a felony, but after 7 months, no such reform has been enacted. 
   And now, under this Congress, many Members promised back home to kill the bridges to nowhere, but under this bill, they will be funded, and funded for years to come because these bridges will take at least $400 million to build the structures. And one of the bridges is already $37 million over budget, a number that will likely rise. 
   Madam Speaker, my amendment to kill the funding for the bridges to nowhere is technically out of order because, according to our Parliamentarian, he says it violates clause 3 of rule XXI because it would trigger Alaska losing funding guaranteed by the previously enacted transportation bill. 
   The Appropriations Committee, my committee, is at its best when it decides to appropriate taxpayer money and also when it decides not to appropriate taxpayer money. 
   Amazingly, it is not in order to offer an amendment to this appropriations bill to deny appropriations. Our rules do not make sense, of course, unless you support the Bridge to Nowhere or like government spending. 
   We will be at this again next year, and we'll look closely at the cost overruns already with the bridges to nowhere and their burden on American taxpayers. But today, a simple amendment to block funding for the bridges to nowhere, an amendment that would be overwhelmingly approved if offered, cannot be offered because a point of order would be leveled against it. 
   Americans should know that, despite promises to reform this House under new leaders, the new leaders of this House has flipped the House of Representatives from being anti-Bridge to Nowhere to now being for the waste of taxpayers' money.

This is not the way to run America's busiest airport. 
   Later today, Representatives ROSKAM, BIGGERT, and I will introduce legislation creating Federal security zones where only badged and approved United States citizens can work next to an aircraft.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, this House needs more ethics reforms, rather than less. And the package before the House makes a positive step, but falls short in several key areas. 
   The most important ethics reform that is missing from this package concerns taxpayer-funded pensions for Members of Congress convicted of a felony. Under current law, both Congressmen Traficant of the Democratic Party and Cunningham of the Republican Party would still be eligible to collect a taxpayer-funded pension, even after being indicted and convicted beyond a shadow of a doubt by a jury of their peers of a felony. 
   Stopping taxpayer funded pensions for lawmakers who break the law is not a new issue. My home State of Illinois, a State not known for its clean government, in that State, we, at least, kill pensions for lawmakers who break the law, and we have done so for 30 years. 
   Ten years ago, Speaker Pelosi voted for H.R. 4011. That would have killed pensions for Congressmen for a conviction on any one of 21 separate felonies. She was right then, and it would be right now to terminate taxpayer-funded pensions for lawbreakers. 
   Mr. Speaker, Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman and I joined to support these very reforms in the last Congress. And we, at least, passed limited reforms and allowed the Senate at least to consider them. 
   But today, the 100 hours fails to take up this issue. None of these pension killing reforms are in the package or are currently scheduled. 
   I take what the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) says very seriously, that he has made a commitment to bring up legislation to kill pensions for Members of Congress convicted of a felony. 
   I have introduced legislation, H.R. 14, to do exactly that, modeled after the legislation supported by former Speaker Hastert as well as Speaker Pelosi. These are commonsense reforms, already part of the law of the land in the land of Lincoln, and long ago should be part of the ethics reforms of this House.

All of this spending is designated under the bill as emergency wartime supplemental appropriations, language that means that the bill waives the budget so we can pay pork producers. It is ironic that this bill treats pork producers better than our troops.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (BIPARTISAN EARMARK REFORM -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I thank the gentleman for yielding and join this group of what we might call apostate appropriators who are leading the reform cause, because I think we all agree that the current system was broken under Republican leaders and broken under Democratic leaders. 
   I believe that we should not tax the American people more than necessary, that taxpayer monies should be spent wisely, and that Congress should use its power to cut waste to keep taxes low. Many congressional earmarks are a waste of the taxpayers' money. 
   I authored the amendment to kill the Bridge to Nowhere. It was a difficult choice, taking on a very powerful Member of Congress who had the ability, in some eyes, to delete all transportation funding for my own district. But I looked at this project, it was an earmark not by the Appropriations Committee but by the Transportation Committee, to build a $320 million structure slightly shorter than the Golden Gate Bridge, slightly taller than the Brooklyn Bridge, connecting Ketchikan, Alaska, population 8,000, with Gravina Island, population 50. Gravina Island has no paved roads, no restaurants, and no stores. It was clear that this was an extravagant expenditure of money by the United States taxpayers to benefit a very, very few number of Americans. 
   It was also disturbing about how this project was handled, as so many other low quality earmarks are done: air-dropped without consideration by the House or Senate floors; no potential to amend or kill this project by Senators or Members of Congress; added to a conference report, that is a final bill, at the last minute where everyone is only given one vote, ``yes'' or ``no,'' on the complete package and not able to reach in and delete funding for a low quality project. 
   Our battle, after the Kirk Amendment passed, was a long one, but finally the Governor of Alaska relented. And thanks to public outrage, thanks to congressional scrutiny, thanks to concerned Americans around this country, the Bridge to Nowhere will not be built. 
   But we have seen so many other projects which do not pass even a laugh test among American taxpayers. For example, a new earmark, I understand, for the Berkeley school system would create French gourmet menus for school lunches, clearly something that does not even pass the laugh test here on the House floor among Republicans or Democrats. 
   Also, we have seen these earmarks for Monuments to Me. I think it is perfectly appropriate when we see a proud public structure funded by the taxpayers to be named after one of our national heroes, to be named after a great American, or just great humanitarian from history, but not for sitting politicians who currently hold public office. I am worried that, for example, throughout West Virginia we have many Senator Byrd centers. It seems like almost a large part of the State is now named after a sitting Member of Congress, who comes with feet of clay, someone who can have great, great attributes and great detriments, and someone who really should be judged by history before we name great public works after them. 
   Our reforms talk about ending funding for these Monuments to Me. It calls for an increased level of, I think, appropriate humility in what we fund. In the past, like many of my colleagues, I have requested earmarks because I have been struck by critical needs in my district. But increasingly, in order to get funding for small projects in your district, you are asked to support funding for large projects in other people's districts, for Bridges to Nowhere, for more Monuments to Me, for things that are, quite frankly, not defensible for the public fisc and for the taxpayers' expenditure. I think we have to recognize that some of these earmarks will simply lead directly to higher taxes for the American people and for programs which do not reflect an appropriate decision by the government to remove funding from an individual taxpayer to provide for these projects. 
   That is why I back this moratorium that we have come forward with and I back the Kingston-Wolf reforms, because I think it is a recognition by members of the Appropriations Committee that the system is broken; that the public's confidence in how this money is spent is not there; that Republicans and Democrats should join together to fix it; that the power of the purse is rightly put by the Constitution in the Congress. But it has to be a power that is respected. It has to be a power in which judgment is leveled and which the burden of proof is against spending the taxpayers' funds so that always we have a feeling towards the bottom line of balancing the budget and making sure the tax burden on the American people is as low as possible. 
   That is why I thank the gentleman from Tennessee and the gentleman from Virginia for having this Special Order and hope that this legislation can pick up bipartisan steam and be adopted by the American people. They get it, but some of the elected representatives of the American people here still don't get it, and their voices need to be heard. 
   I yield back to my friend from Virginia.

   Should the taxpayers spend $243,000 on Chez Panisse to create a gourmet organic school lunch program featuring ``Comte cheese souffle with mache salad'' or ``Meyer lemon eclairs with huckleberry coulis''? No.

   History teaches us that dictators say what they will do and then do what they say. The Iranian leader has indicated that one Holocaust against the Jewish people is not enough. Last April he said that Israel was headed towards annihilation. 
   This week the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency Director General announced that Iran has fully mastered uranium enrichment technology and Iran's military test fired a missile that can now harm the people of Israel. 
   This amendment restores funding for the missile defense of our country and says that the defenses of our country should be fully integrated with the missile defense of Israel. This motion  to recommit stands for the principle that democracies are best when they stand together; as our Founding Fathers said, when we face the threat from a tyrant that we will either hang separately or hang together. 
   Unless this motion to recommit carries, we will fail to put the full missile defenses of the American people against the full threat facing the people of Israel. But if this motion carries, then those who would seek to harm the people of Israel would know that they face the full weight of the great democracy across the sea who is standing behind the safety and security of our best ally in the Middle East, the State of Israel.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this as the original cosponsor of this legislation. We find that a hate crime can ignite group-on-group violence that would tear a community apart. We have seen it in other countries; we want to make sure it never happens here. 
   This is especially dangerous when group-on-group violence can overwhelm a small suburban police department, and this offers assistance so that a small problem doesn't become a big problem and doesn't become a national problem. We saw when Rodney King was beaten that a riot broke out in Beloit, Wisconsin, and overwhelmed that police department. 
   So to be able to make sure that the Federal Government can defend the Nation and to make sure that our country stands not just for freedom and democracy, but also tolerance, is one reason why we should follow enactment of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, under President George Herbert Walker Bush, to also pass this legislation.

   Mr. KIRK. I thank the gentleman, one of the only working scientists serving in the Congress. 
   I had intended to offer an amendment to this legislation with regard to the mercury issue, but working with the committee, I understand the better place I am talking about is in the EPA Office of Science. 
   So I would like to say that I strongly support investment in scientific and mathematical research, but I would like to engage in a colloquy with the chairman, especially to emphasize how essential it is for comprehensive and frequent research on mercury levels in one of our Nation's most treasured ecosystems, the Great Lakes. 
   Mercury pollution is now a serious problem for my district in northern Illinois, as well as across the Nation. The Great Lakes are particularly vulnerable to exposure, as 36 percent of mercury emissions are generated in the Great Lakes region. 
   In fact, there are currently 18 fish advisories for mercury contamination in the region, yet the Great Lakes are a source of food and especially drinking water for over 40 million Americans. This undoubtedly contributes to the recent estimate that the U.S. Government has seen more than 300,000 American babies born each year with a risk of mercury poisoning. 
   It's critical that we begin to take an annual inventory of mercury levels in the Great Lakes to understand the sources of this pollution and especially the trend to see whether this danger is growing. With this information the Congress would be able to provide more effective and comprehensive regulation of mercury pollution and mitigation of its harmful effects. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Baird for agreeing to engage in this colloquy on this important matter, and I appreciate all his support in working to ensure that we have the most comprehensive, scientific, accurate and timely information on mercury contamination. I look forward to working with the chairman on this issue.

   In 2005, the FBI recorded 7,000 hate crimes in our country, 168 in the State of Illinois, and two in my congressional district, one in Wheeling and one in Palatine. 
   For us, we remember a tragic night in 1999 when Benjamin Smith, a member of a white supremacist group, gunned down the Northwestern University basketball coach in front of two kids. Why? Because he was black. Smith then continued his hunting spree, shooting Orthodox Jews coming home from synagogue, and spraying bullets at an Asian couple driving home in Northbrook. 
   These were hate crimes, crimes designed to tear a community apart, crimes designed to commit and isolate and stigmatize others because of the color of their skin or the religion they practice.

   I joined with Congressman Ehlers and Congressman Emanuel to address that issue. To date we have been successful in cleaning five of 31 areas of concerns. One more is underway, and seven additional harbors are under evaluation. Under this very program, more than a million pounds of polluted sediment have been removed. 
   This bill before the House increases environmental remediation funds, and it speeds up the cleanup. It will help us to protect the Great Lakes, the source of drinking water for over 30 million Americans. I am particularly looking forward to Waukegan's cleanup. Shortly, we will announce the full Superfund cleanup of that harbor. Under Federal law, the Federal Government will take the lead to do its duty to remove this threat to human health. Some locals don't want the cleanup of our harbor, but they will not be able to prevent this needed environmental remediation. And when complete, it will increase Lake County property values by over $800 million. 
   We still have a few more days left to fund this program under the Great Lakes Legacy Act. I hope we do because then the cleanup will be even faster.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, as we take up the agenda of the new Congress in the 110th iteration, we should look to new issues which address the needs of the American people in this century, in this time. 
   When we look at what that new agenda should include, it should reflect the values and lifestyles and locations of Americans where they actually live today, and not the way that we think they lived 50 years ago. 
   When we look at the America of the 21st century, we see a country that has changed radically from an old vision of our Nation as one-third rural, one-third urban, and one-third suburban. If you hold that idea, you are about 40 years out of date. The new United States of the 21st century is a majority part suburban. In fact, in the last Presidential election, for the first time in our country's history, over half of all voters were living in suburban communities. When you ask these voters, ``What do you think the Congress should work on to make sure that it is addressing key needs of your family and your community,'' they overwhelmingly put forward a list of priorities that have been consistent for the last decade and that is: action on public education, on health care, on conservation, and on economic growth. 
   Responding to these needs, in the last Congress we formed the Suburban Agenda Caucus to then develop a political program here in the Congress to address those needs; and in this Special Order that we are going to have tonight, we are going talk about the next chapter, the suburban agenda for 2007. By talking about what these key pieces of legislation are, we have gone beyond platitudes or general policy descriptions to describe actual pieces of legislation that should be adopted in this Congress addressing the education, health care, conservation, and economic needs of the American people. 
   The suburban agenda is presented here in its new 2007 form. It includes the Gang Elimination Act of 2007, legislation by Congressman Dave Reichert that would seek to identify the top three major international drug gangs in the United States that represent a threat to our country's security. In fact, if you added up all of the documented gang members in the United States, it would amount to the fifth-largest army on the earth and one that represents a clear and present danger to the safety and security of many kids throughout America.     
   I will just say that in my own congressional district the average gangland shooter in North Chicago or Waukegan, Illinois, is in the eighth grade;  and this legislation is critical to provide Federal backup to suburban law enforcement to take on the new threat of gangs moving into the suburbs. 
   A second piece of the Suburban Agenda is the Teacher and Student Safety Act, legislation by Congressman Geoff Davis. This legislation seeks to make sure that every classroom in America is as safe as possibly can be maintained, using the judgment of full-time registered teachers who know their classrooms and their kids best. 
   Under this legislation, a full-time registered teacher would be allowed to search a book bag or a locker if they have any colorable suspicion that a weapon has come into the classroom. 
   In my own congressional district, in the Winnetka school system, and certainly we all remember the Columbine school attacks, we saw troubled kids bring weapons into the classroom with tragic results. 
   As a former teacher, I know that I knew my kids best; and, using that judgment, we can make sure that classrooms are safer in America. 
   One of the critical opportunities that we have in our country is improving health care, especially using new technology and expanding health insurance for Americans; and there we have the Health Insurance for Life Act by Representative CHARLIE DENT. 
   The Health Insurance for Life Act addresses a critical problem in America, which is that the average suburban family will have five different jobs over their life, and they may worry that in between jobs they would lose coverage or be dropped or develop a pre-existing condition which would interfere with the continuation of health care insurance for their family. 
   The Health Insurance for Life Act of 2007 simply says that for every American already in an insurance pool, who already enjoys COBRA health reinsurance rights for 18 months, that you can continue those, that insurance, for as long as you need to. 
   Almost every suburban family in America has a problem that they have heard about, either in their own family or in their neighborhood, regarding predators on-line, people that would be using, for example, the number one Web site on the planet, myspace.com, to reach out to kids and to attack them in a way that was simply alien or impossible in the previous century. 
   The Deleting On-Line Predators Act, which passed in last Congress by a vote of 400-15, says that our first line of defense are parents, moms and dads who know about this danger and are upgrading the protections of their kids on-line. For example, in the 21st century, how the computer should be really in the living room and not the bedroom, where parents can have routine and casual contact with their on-line habits of their kids; or that every 21st century parent should demand the rights of the passwords of their children to make sure that they know where their kids have been. 
   The Deleting On-Line Predators Act also says to schools and libraries that, as we upgrade protections for kids on-line in the home, that we also do them in public spaces to, consistently and across the board, deny opportunities to the estimated 50,000 sexual predators on-line who are on-line at any one time. 
   Congressman JIM GERLACH has also introduced another key piece of the Suburban Agenda. That is the Open Space and Farm Land Preservation Act to make sure that we improve the tax treatment and grant programs to preserve suburban open space, so that we do not enter a state of drift in which suburban open space disappears across the country, and we have an unending series of strip malls. 
   And the final piece of the Suburban Agenda for 2007 is the Senior Safety and Dignity Act by Representative Ginny Brown-Waite. That Act lays out a set of protections for seniors as America ages to make sure that their health care standards, especially in senior and life-long care, are maintained. 
   When we look at this all, there is one bill that stands above all others in the concern of suburban families, and that is how to pay for college to make sure that a child has a guaranteed road map into the middle class. And to talk about that legislation, let me yield to the author of that bill, my colleague from Illinois, Congresswoman JUDY BIGGERT.

   Mr. KIRK. When we look at this problem, we see that the Congress has taken critical action in the past to change our culture in favor of more savings and investment. The 401(k) program was relatively new to our society and our culture.     
   And yet millions of Americans now, when they get their first real job, establish a 401(k) program, saving on their own for retirement. 
   Last Congress you were leading the effort on behalf of extending 529 college  savings accounts that are chartered under each State. We already have $80 billion saved under investment. That is why I want to applaud you with the potential that this 401 Kids account bill could do.

Not only will we save tens of billions of dollars for college education, and I think everybody in this Chamber knows George Washington University just crossed the $50,000 a year tuition mark for kids, but more importantly, these accounts are going to have the names of each child on them. And so it is an education tool for parents. And I don't know if you want to talk about that. When the statement comes into the home that for a young teenage son or daughter, you might be able to talk about how the investment has gone.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, we have seen that several hundred thousand Americans each year exercise their COBRA rights to continue health care insurance for their families after they are laid off or leave employment. But, each year, over 200,000 Americans will reach the end of their 18-month COBRA period and then be unable to continue their health care insurance. If they have a preexisting condition in their family, they could then be left out of a coverage pool later. 
   I think that is why it is so important that, at the discretion of the family, at their own cost, they can continue that health care insurance to have peace of mind.

   Mr. KIRK. You are an expert on health care in this Congress. When we look at the delivery of health care, in a hospital emergency room, we have the most expensive setting to care for a family. Generally they have waited until a very late moment, and now we are in an acute emergency situation. 
   Had that family gone to a community health center early in the process, we would have dealt with the problem without the drama and without a potential catastrophic result, and at much lower cost to the public and the family. That is why this legislation is essential, because it expands these centers and expands care at this level instead of the very expensive place we do it now, in the hospital emergency room.

   Ironically, because we did not provide this liability protection for community health centers, we don't have any issue of malpractice because there was no practice of medicine whatsoever in that setting which I think defies common sense. A greater access to care and expanded capabilities for community health centers ought to be what this Congress is about.

   But for my constituents outside the Chicago suburbs, or yours in the Philadelphia suburbs, that might be only part of a summer vacation. 
   We need to pass this legislation so there is green and open space near home so we don't have an unending set of suburban sprawl, but we don't have the Federal Government take over this role; this is a decision made by landowners and communities throughout our local areas making local decisions. But in some, create more green and open space, new greenways, to preserve a quality of life and an ecological ambience that has become part of suburban living.

   I will just note, the Federal Superfund program, designated to cleaning up the most toxic places in America, has spent over half its funds on litigation and lawsuit costs, not on environmental cleanup. 
   Your legislation takes us back to the original core of what the environmental movement was first founded to do, which was to protect green and open space and key habitats for all time.

   Mr. KIRK. If we look at the suburban agenda about safe schools, extending health care, green and open space, et cetera, one of the things that is not part of the Suburban Agenda is a tax increase, especially a tax increase on working families. 
   One of the things that we have instituted as part of our general tax policy is to make sure that married families are not paying a higher tax, because a key part of the Suburban Agenda is a family together, raising kids under one household. 
   I am worried, though, that if there is inaction on tax policy by this Congress, many of the inequities in the Tax Code get reimposed and we start taxing families at a higher rate than people who are single.

   Mr. KIRK. We talk about the Suburban Agenda, what is in it, which is pro-school, pro-health care, pro-environment legislation, and what is not, which is a tax increase on the American people. There is the argument that is made very often here in Washington that the only way to cure our financial woes is a tax increase. But if I remember, looking back at the record of the 1970s, even when Congress did raise taxes, for every dollar in taxes that it raised against the American people, it spent another $1.08 in new spending. So the record of those years was that, even though we were raising taxes, spending here in the Congress went up even faster, and so our deficit woes became worse.

If I am not mistaken, last year was the largest increase in tax receipts coming into our Treasury, even though there was no tax increase by the Federal Government, simply because of economic growth, that since September 11, 2001, we have added over 2 million jobs. Maybe that is one of the key lessons of the Suburban Agenda: There is no Federal program or no social welfare act that is more powerful in improving the life of a suburban family than a job and a growing economy for small business.

We also recall in the last decade how we all thought that we would all end up working for the Japanese and that Japan, Incorporated, was the big threat. 
   Now we see an old axiom of politics said by one great politician, never bet against the United States, and also never bet against freedom. What we have seen here is an unbelievable economic performance by our country, record tax receipts coming into the Treasury without a tax increase, and the ability then to focus on the future of the United States, which is largely being written in the suburbs, with safe schools, extending health care and making sure that we are planning for the long term in what will be aging America, with the baby boomers entering retirement, but hopefully, with these policies entering retirement with some safety and security based on private savings and investment, encourage through first the 401(k) program and then we hope through the 401 Kids Family Tax Savings Accounts.

Health Insurance for Life, to make sure that we continue the COBRA insurance for Americans, for more than 18 months, the Deleting Online Predators Act to make sure we are empowering parents to control this 21st Century danger to their children; the Open Space and Farm Land Preservation Act to make sure that we have more preserved green and open space in the green and open suburbs, and finally, the Senior Safety and Dignity Act to make sure that as the baby boomers age, we are preserving our long-term health care for our Americans. 
   This is the suburban agenda, a vision for the future and a work plan for the Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, for more than 90 years, Armenians were denied recognition for the genocide of 1915. We promised in 1945 to never forget the Holocaust, to remember when such atrocities are committed. But the world could well forget the first genocide of the 20th century. In fact, Hitler used the world's denial of the Armenian genocide as the justification for his invasion of Poland and the ensuing murder of Europe's Jewry. 
   In a speech he gave in 1939, Adolf Hitler stated, ``I have placed my death-head formation in readiness, with orders to send death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women and children of Polish derivation and language. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?'' 
   Unfortunately, Members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, are seeking to, once again, bury this to appease Turkey. We remember Turkey well, a formerly strong NATO ally; but in 2003, when the United States Army requested permission to transit this ally's territory, Turkey said no, a decision which cost the lives of American service men and women. 
   Former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, once an ardent supporter of the Armenian Genocide resolution, is now registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent of the Turkish Government. Like many other former Members of Congress, he is lobbying against a bill that he cosponsored when he served in this body. As a defender of human rights, our country must formally recognize the genocide that Hitler so easily dismissed. 
   From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Turks systemically annihilated more than 1.5 million ethnic Armenians. There is no other way to describe this organized campaign of murder other than as genocide.  
   The Armenian Genocide resolution, H. Res. 106, was just approved today by a vote of 27-21 in the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. I urge Speaker Pelosi to bring this important resolution to the floor so that we may finally provide the Armenian community with the recognition that they deserve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, it is sad when another country turns its arms against the United States or our allies, but it is a tragedy when those arms were made by Americans. 
   Many of us remember when advanced F-14 Tomcat fighters were provided to the Kingdom of Iran only to see these airplanes become the backbone of the ayatollah's air force. 
   Newspapers indicate that the United States will now offer a large arms sales package to the Saudi Kingdom. And while much of what is proposed looks useful against Iran, patrol craft and warning radars, satellite-guided bombs pose a particular danger if used in the wrong hands. 
   These satellite-guided bombs, called Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or JDAMs, are particularly lethal in battle, and if misused against American forces or our allies in Israel, their effect could be not just devastating but tragic. 
   We should not provide such weapons without ironclad, written guarantees to the Congress that such munitions could not pose a danger to future Americans or our allies. I urge Members to sign the Kirk-Carney-Poe-Berman-Harman letter to block this sale unless guarantees are made.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (PROTECT AMERICAN FAMILIES FROM MEXICAN DRUG GANGS -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, the New York Times reports that our Mexican allies are now engaged in a life-or-death struggle against massive drug cartels. These cartels assassinated the Mexican FBI Director and now threaten the President's life. President Calderon has asked us for help, and for the safety and security of American families, we must. 
   If you see a red star on this map, it means that our Drug Enforcement Agency says that a Mexican drug gang is operating in your congressional district. If you see a green star, like in Las Vegas, Chicago, San Francisco, it means the DEA knows that the drug gangs have a command-and-control center in your congressional district. 
   Last month the gangs of Mexico topped their murder of hundreds of Mexican police officers with a new practice: beheading people and leaving their heads in coolers. It would be naive to think that such violence remains just south of our border. 
   That's why Congress should fully fund the Merida Law Enforcement Initiative.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I thank the distinguished chairman. 
   Our uniformed men and women have given great service to the Nation by ending a tyrant's rein and fostering elections in a region that only knew dictatorship. In my judgment now, the time for decisive military action led by American and British forces is ending and the Iraqi stage should be delivered to new political leaders to work out their own differences. I will support the House resolution that recommends against the troop surge because the United States should increase the responsibilities of the elected Iraqi government to solve its own problems while reducing the number of American combat troops sent overseas. 
   I did not come to this conclusion lightly. The long-term security of our country depends on the United States not being defeated in the Middle East. To prevent the collapse of democracy, tolerance and supporters in our region, we need a policy that relies on America's key strengths and builds additional support among our citizens and allies. 
   Looking back on the last years, our troops in Iraq achieved two major objectives: First, they ended the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, a leader that  invaded two separate United Nations member countries and ordered the murder of several hundred thousand Iraqis. Second, they backed the United Nations' sponsorship of Iraq's three national elections that approved a new constitution and government.     
   Iraq is no longer a military threat to her neighbors or minorities, especially her Kurdish families, who no longer fear that a third genocide campaign will be launched by their very own government. These are major achievements, worthy of the bravery and sacrifice of Americans in uniform. 
   But Iraq now faces new challenges that should be solved by Iraqis, not the U.S. military. Iraq's government, led by a Kurdish president and a Shia prime minister, faces a daunting enemy composed of people that would restore the old dictatorship, or worse. But this struggle is primarily political, not military. Foreign troops, be they American or British or otherwise, are not well-suited to advance the elected government's writ. 
   In the coming months we should build a longer term plan for the United States and our allies in the Middle East. Man for man, Iraqi combat troops operating under the authority of their own elected government are better suited for this mission than Americans on the front lines of Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, and it has been a great partnership. 
   I rise in support of H. Res. 240, calling on the European nations to grant open access to the Holocaust archives in Bad Arolsen, Germany. 
   To date, the United States and Israel, Poland, the Netherlands, Great Britain, even Germany, ratified the amendments to the Bonn Accords, amendments which would finally give survivors real-time digital access to millions of Nazi records, and provide researchers access to all of the archives. 
   But for some reason, France and Italy, Greece, Belgium and Luxembourg are dragging their feet. One year after agreeing to these amendments, these five European nations remain silent on ratification. Mr. Speaker, silence on this issue is unacceptable and reprehensible. 
   We stand at a crossroads of history, at a time when Iran, a member of the United Nations, sponsors official conferences to deny the Holocaust, we need to act here. At a time when the President of Iran calls for the murder of another 6 million Jews, we need to act on this issue. At a time of resurgence of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial throughout Europe and the Middle East, this is the time to act. 
   Sixty years ago the United States Army, when we liberated the camps, we made a solemn promise of ``never again.'' And today, as President Ahmadinejad says he wants to, quote, wipe Israel off the map, we must say clearly to Europe, open these archives now to show the world that we stand behind this pledge. 
   I want to thank my longtime friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), for giving me the privilege of working with him on this issue. I also want to thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Wexler) for their work. 
   I also want to thank Richard Goldberg, of my staff, and Eve Lieberman from Chairman Hastings' staff and Kay King from Chairman Lantos' staff for this, as well as action by outside experts, Paul Shapiro at the U.S. Holocaust Museum, Rick Hirshaut at the Illinois Holocaust Museum, Rabbi Alan Cooper at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Lonnie Nasatir at the Anti-Defamation League, and Jay Tcath of the Chicago Jewish Federation, who have all come together on an overwhelmingly bipartisan issue to send a clear message, open the archives. Make sure the message goes forth that the Holocaust deniers and especially the Iranian Government are wrong. We need to open the record, set it straight and make sure that the record is clear, especially to the survivors that are still among us.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor of H. Res. 624, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan resolution and urge its adoption. 
   For the first time in history, the State of Israel will serve as the chair of a United Nations Committee. We congratulate Mr. Ron Adam for his appointment as Chair of the U.N. Committee on Program and Coordination and wish him much success in this historic post. 
   While this appointment gives us hope of reform at the United Nations, other U.N. organs continue on a path of anti-Semitism with irrational vilification of the Jewish State. 
   In 2006, the United Nations took 135 actions against the State of Israel for alleged violations of human rights. By contrast, the U.N. took only 69 actions against Sudan--home to a genocide in Darfur--and only 23 actions against Iran, where the government is carrying out an ethnic cleansing campaign against its Baha'i minority. 
   In its first year of existence, the U.N. Human Rights Council passed 10 resolutions condemning Israel, while passing only one resolution condemning Sudan. 
   And we all remember the infamous U.N. ``Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People'' nearly 2 years ago when U.N. officials proudly displayed a map of the Middle East without the State of Israel. 
   For several years, I have worked with my colleagues to pressure U.N. members to end  their anti-Israel obsession. Israel's appointment to the U.N. Committee on Program and Coordination is the first fruit of our labor. But we know there is a long way to go to end anti-Semitism at the United Nations. 
   I want to thank my friend, Mr. Hastings, for introducing this important resolution, and Chairman Lantos and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for their continued leadership on this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (RECOGNIZING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I thank the gentleman, and I rise in celebration of this, one of the most important environmental laws in the history of our country, the Clean Water Act. 
   For 35 years, the Act has helped limit the discharge of pollution that poisons our water and our beaches. I think it's not enough just to commemorate groundbreaking legislation. As illness, beach closings, habitat loss, and billions of dollars in lost economic opportunity and environmental damage continue, Congress should move to strengthen the Clean Water Act. 
   This year sheds particular light on a gaping hole in the Clean Water Act. Just a few months ago, we learned that the State of Indiana ended a decade-long dumping ban in the Great Lakes, allowing British Petroleum to increase by 54 percent its ammonia dumping in Lake Michigan, and adding 35 percent more sludge to the lake each day. It was only due to the vigilance of citizens and environmental organizations and lawmakers around the Lake Michigan shore that we got BP to back down. 
   Thanks to the thousands of Illinois volunteers, BP has now agreed to maintain its current discharge levels. But shockingly, the permit that was issued by the State of Indiana was completely allowed under the current Clean Water Act. Now, Indiana is once again seeking to renew a discharge permit that failed to protect Lake Michigan. 
   The draft permit for United States Steel--Gary Works, already the largest polluter of Lake Michigan, will delay for 5 years compliance with Clean Water Act limits on dangerous toxic chemicals such as mercury, free cyanide, zinc, copper and ammonia. 
   The draft permit sets a very weak standard for mercury, oil and grease, free cyanide and other harmful pollutants. It also would allow United States Steel to follow a 10-year-old storm water pollution prevention plan. 
   I want to commend the Environmental Protection Agency, especially from my region, for at least delaying the issuance of this Indiana permit because I think this permit fails to protect the people that depend on Lake Michigan for their drinking water. 
   Current law right now will fail to protect the drinking water for nearly 30 million Americans who rely on the Great Lakes. I believe it's time to commit this Congress to upgrade our Federal protection of the Great Lakes under the Clean Water Act. We should move forward in a bipartisan way to enact a complete future ban on all dumping in the Great Lakes and bring forward a 21st century clean water act that builds on the tradition that we commemorate today.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THAT BANGLADESH SHOULD DROP CHARGES AGAINST SALAH UDDIN SHOAIB CHOUDHURY -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution which marks this family member and what has happened to him as a prisoner of conscience in Bangladesh. 
   When we see what happened to him after advocating the cause of religious reconciliation between Muslims and Jews, we see the condition of Salah Choudhury after a severe beating which he was subjected to.     
   This resolution urges the government of Bangladesh to drop all charges against Bangladeshi journalist Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury. 
   Mr. Choudhury now faces charges of sedition, treason and blasphemy. He faces these charges because of his belief in an interfaith dialogue between Jews and Muslims, and because of articles that he published critical of Islamic extremism. Under Bangladeshi law, sedition is a crime punishable by death. 
   Mr. Choudhury was detained in November 2003 at Zia International Airport in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on his way to board a flight for Tel Aviv simply to participate in the annual Hebrew Writers Conference. Mr. Choudhury's passport was seized, along with considerable sums of money and several personal items. On that same day, the police raided his home, his newspaper, and seized files, computers and other valuables. 
   Since Bangladeshi law currently prohibits travel to Israel, Choudhury was first cited for a minor passport violation, but he was subsequently charged with sedition and accused of espionage as an Israeli spy and incarcerated indefinitely. He was subjected to harsh interrogation techniques and received no treatment for a debilitating case of glaucoma. 
   After being denied due process, Choudhury languished in jail for 17 months until one tireless human rights champion, and my constituent, Dr. Richard Benkin, began a personal odyssey to free Shoaib Choudhury. Dr. Benkin met Mr. Choudhury through a pro-Israel Internet Web site, and Dr. Benkin brought this situation to my attention and now before the House. All together, we sought for his freedom, and shortly thereafter, we did succeed in getting Choudhury's release from jail, finally reuniting him with his wife and two children. 
   Following Shoaib's release, a senior Bangladesh government official made numerous public pledges that all pending legal action against Mr. Choudhury would be dropped. Nevertheless, the government pressed forward with formal sedition charges. 
   Mr. Choudhury has won the recognition of international human rights and freedom of expression organizations for his courage. He was honored by PEN U.S.A.'s Freedom to Write Award and was presented with the American Jewish Committee's prestigious Moral Courage Award in absentia in Washington, D.C. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom intervened and wrote a letter to Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher calling on the U.S. Government to strengthen the voices of moderation in countries like Bangladesh where the rule of law, democratic institutions, and respect for human rights are under assault by violent extremists. The commission identified Mr. Choudhury as one of those voices. 
   But despite such international attention, the persecution of Choudhury has persisted. Mr. Choudhury's newspaper offices were bombed by Islamic extremists in July 2006, and he was attacked by a mob in his office on October 5, 2006, where this very picture was taken. A judge with alleged ties to Islamic extremist groups then ruled that Choudhury must stand trial for his life for sedition. 
   Bangladesh today is at a crossroads. Much-anticipated elections were postponed due to irregularities, and a state of emergency was declared. In a country with 150 million people packed into a land mass smaller than Iowa, 85 percent of whom are Muslim, it is critically important for Bangladesh to demonstrate its commitment to democratic institutions, to religious freedom, and to human rights. For his message of moderation and interfaith dialogue between Muslims and Jews, Mr. Choudhury is facing unjust criminal charges in an effort to silence him. The House of Representatives sends a clear message today that we will not allow an outspoken advocate for religious freedom to be quelled by intolerance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in this resolution and would like to thank Chairman Lantos for his friendship and support in bringing this up and for his tireless advocacy on behalf of human rights of all as co-chairman of the Human Rights Caucus. I also want to thank Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for her support on the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   I would like also to thank our ambassador to Bangladesh, Patricia Butenis, for her outstanding work at Embassy Dhaka. Her team has been vigorously monitoring this case, attending Mr. Choudhury's legal proceedings, and making strong public statements on his behalf. 
   I also want to thank Dr. Richard Benkin, sitting in the gallery today, for his unrelenting pursuit of justice on behalf of Shoaib Choudhury. I am proud to join Dr. Benkin in this endeavor and look forward to one day when we may even host Shoaib Choudhury in our very own Mount Prospect, Illinois. 
   Lastly, I want to thank the best congressional human rights staffer that I have ever had: Jeff Phillips had worked tirelessly on behalf of an African prisoner of conscience for months until he finally won his release. Now he has seized on Shoaib's case and made it a cause in the United States, in Canada, in Europe, and the subcontinent. He, we, have all been inspired by Shoaib and Dr. Benkin, and we hope by this resolution this case and a potential death sentence against Shoaib can be lifted. Shoaib is not a criminal, and he should not become a martyr. He is a model for interfaith tolerance and discussion between all of those of different faiths in the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (NEW TRENDS IN THE GROWING AFGHAN DRUG ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, with the increasing number of cross-border attacks in Afghanistan that are coming from the Waziristan region of Pakistan, it is more important than ever to develop a complete picture of where al Qaeda and the Taliban terrorists are hiding and especially of how they are funded. 
   Last month, the Defense Department finally recognized what many of us in the Congress have been saying for years. The report states: ``Narcotics-related activities are fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan and, if left unchecked, threaten the long-term stability of the country and the surrounding region.'' It continues: ``The emerging nexus between narcotics traffickers and the insurgency is clear. Narcotics traffickers provide revenue and arms to the Taliban while the Taliban provides protection to growers and traffickers and keep the government from interfering with their activities.'' In short, the Taliban has become a fully functioning, South Asian narco-terrorist organization, protecting the source of 92 percent of the world's opium. 
   Production is so high now that the price is dropping after years of record crops. Never one to ignore market forces, Afghan drug kingpins are now expanding into new illicit markets, and they have become the major supplier of the global cannabis and hashish markets. 
   Now, Morocco used to be the traditional main source for hashish in the world, but that is rapidly changing. Morocco has been marginalized in favor of Afghanistan. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Morocco used to be the source of 31 percent of the world's hashish, but by 2006, the number dwindled to just 18 percent. 
   In contrast, the U.N. now reports that cannabis cultivation in Afghanistan has more than doubled since 2004. In 2004, 30,000 hectares were under cultivation. In 2007, that number had risen to 70,000, much of which is protected and nurtured by the Taliban as their new source of income. 
   U.N. figures also show that cannabis cultivation is surging in Taliban strongholds, including in the Kandahar, Uruzgan, Paktika, Zabol, and Helmand Provinces. If the Great Plains are the breadbasket of America, then these Afghan Provinces make up the production heartland of the international narcotics trade.

Through Congress' partisan lens, Iraq is the bad war, while Afghanistan is the good war. Our partisan lens will not recognize good news from Iraq or bad news from Afghanistan. 
   In Afghanistan, the Taliban is back, funded by billions from heroin. The U.N. reports that in 2008, Afghanistan is now also the top producer of hashish. Money from heroin and now hashish total hundreds of millions, if not billions. 
   In sum, the Taliban's drug profits now may equal the operations budget of General McKiernan and his NATO Army. 
   The hot issue today is a possible surge of troops to Afghanistan. I will sound a note of caution that without aerial spraying and other counterdrug programs that worked in Colombia, such an Afghan move will only accelerate violence between two very well-funded opponents. 
   To turn the rising Taliban tide, we must attack both heroin and hashish in the narco-state that is Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma, and appreciate the leadership, and especially my friend from Washington for bringing forward this legislation. It is a strong resolution that follows up on a congressional recognition of 2008 as the International Year of the Reef in support of research and development to preserve coral reefs around the world. 
   We all know that coral reef systems are vital to the ecology of our planet. They provide food and jobs and recreation to millions of people around the world. Most importantly, they provide key environmental benefits, including resistance to climate change and protection of shorelines from harmful erosion. 
   Coral reefs and their surrounding ecosystems are now under siege. They face damage from marine vessels, destructive fishing methods, development, and especially increased ocean pollution. Climate change has contributed to increasing sea temperatures, which also threaten these critical habitats. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 60 percent of the world's coral reefs may be destroyed by the year 2050 if the present rate of destruction continues. 
   The International Coral Reef Initiative deemed 2008 as the International Year of the Reef. It established a global campaign to raise awareness about the value and importance of coral reefs and their threats to sustainability. The effort also aims to mobilize action to develop and implement innovative solutions and strategies to protect and preserve this important natural resource. 
   It's very important for the United States to lend its support and resources to this effort. I would also say it's very important for the Congress to complete its work on another piece of legislation that my friend and I backed, the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Act, H.R. 2185. My colleague, Mr. Baird, and I supported this resolution, which is based on legislation coauthored by myself and Mr. Hastings of Florida. It would offer a key ``debt for nature swaps'' in developing countries to protect key coral reefs.     
   This legislation was based on work by my previous colleague, the former Member from Ohio, Rob Portman. We worked together since the late 1980s to pioneer a new strategy to support international ecology; that is, offering reductions for the debt of developing nations in return for investments in protecting key ecosystems. Using this technique, we created the largest park in the Western Hemisphere, the Beni Biosphere Reserve in Bolivia. 
   All combined, debt-for-nature swaps have now saved an area 50 times larger than Yellowstone National Park. The key addition of the Tropical Forest and Coral Conservation Act is to extend this debt-for-nature authority to the Department of the Treasury to protect coral reefs. This legislation passed the House overwhelmingly on October 9, 2007, but still remains pending in the Senate. Like so many other things, we would like to see the Senate complete the good work of the House of Representatives. 
   My hope is that by passing this legislation we continue to call attention on the attack of coral reefs across the world, on their critical role in preserving the biological diversity of the world, and especially the United States and its Caribbean coastline, and, most importantly, to pass the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Act, so that we can offer more than just help on a resolution, that we can have visible support to developing nations so that they can protect their coral reefs, much as the United States should do on our own shores. I thank the gentleman from Washington.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I rise in strong support of the underlying legislation, which provides critical protection for our Nation's waterways. For the first time, this legislation requires ballast water treatment of ships entering the Great Lakes, which claim to have no ballast water on board. These ships were previously not subject to any exchange or treatment requirements, and that created a massive loophole through which invasive species were introduced in our precious Great Lakes. I am very happy that this provision, similar to one I authored with Mr. Emanuel in H.R. 801, will close this dangerous and expensive loophole that, unfortunately, has so radically changed the Great Lakes environment. 
   However, there is another loophole which currently exists in the bill which could help spread endemic diseases affecting a myriad of Great Lakes fish. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia, or VHS, is a highly contagious viral disease that caused a significant number of fish deaths in North America since its introduction just in 2005. This virus is only present in four of the five Great Lakes so far, and threatens to cost billions of dollars to the region in lost fishing and tourism revenue. 
   While the bill currently requires foreign ships to treat their ballast tanks in order to prevent new diseases from entering the Great Lakes, it exempts vessels from treating their ballast tanks when they operate exclusively inside the Great Lakes. This is a loophole which should be closed in the event of an emergency pathogen outbreak. While the Great Lakes ships do not introduce new pathogens into the lakes, they can fully transmit a disease from one lake to another. Currently, Lake Superior is not yet infected with VHS. 
   My amendment would close the loophole by providing the Secretary of Agriculture with the authority to request that Great Lakes vessels install ballast water treatment systems approved by the Coast Guard, should the Secretary deem it necessary in order to prevent the spread of an infectious disease from one Great Lake to another. The amendment is supported by the Healing Our Waters, Great Lakes Coalition. 
   I want to thank the chairman and ranking minority member, my colleague from Ohio, for working with me on this very important amendment. It's crucial that we provide the Department of Agriculture with the authority to prevent the spread of VHS to a lake like Lake Superior and to give them the authority to slow down or stop the spread of other infectious pathogens. We must provide officials with all the necessary tools that they need to protect this critical ecosystem, the crown jewel of the Midwest environment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

Our environment has suffered from the introduction of the lamprey eel, the rock goby, the fishhook flea, and now viral hemorrhagic septicemia. This legislation is essential to slow down the assault on the Great Lakes with these new species introduced into our critical ecosystem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, especially its new security requirement for Pakistan to continue to receive U.S. taxpayer subsidies.     
   After September 11, the government of Pakistan performed admirably, allowing U.S. Army supplies to help our campaign in Afghanistan to end the Taliban dictatorship. The Pakistani military also moved into the lawless tribal areas where Osama Bin Laden sought refuge. 
   But that record of cooperation against Bin Laden has dramatically weakened over the last 9 months. In a set of two agreements, the government of Pakistan has largely given up on the conflict against Bin Laden and his Taliban allies. In two agencies along the Afghan borders, North and South Waziristan, al Qaeda and the Taliban now have safe havens immune from action by the regular Pakistani military. They are now at rest, slumbering in garrison, marvelously inactive against foreign terrorists operating on Pakistani soil. 
   This issue directly concerns the safety of Americans, both here and abroad. Waziristan and Pakistan could now be called ``al Qaedastan,'' as terrorist leaders have led organization efforts in attacks against Afghan territory. 
   Recently I accompanied Senators McCain and Lieberman to visit our garrison in Khost, Afghanistan, where they reported a 500-percent increase in attacks against their outpost organized from these regions of Pakistan. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to pass this legislation to send a message to Pakistan that you must continue to work with the United States and our NATO allies in Afghanistan against the Taliban and al Qaeda. A policy of safe havens and sanctuary for these people will not work, has not worked, is not working and represents a direct threat, first to Americans in uniform stationed in Afghanistan and later to our allies in Europe and America itself.

But so much of our intelligence is beyond the imminent attack on the United States. So much of us in the intelligence world, we have to watch the earliest signs of this. 
   Let's be clear, this bill before us has nothing to do with the rights of U.S. citizens; those are already protected. As an intelligence officer, we are always drilled on the code of conduct in dealing with U.S. persons. This bill has everything to do with creating new rights for people overseas.

This program was designed to clean up these Midwestern harbors, like Waukegan, Illinois, that suffered from George Soros' Outboard Marine Corp that polluted our harbor before Soros then looted and bankrupt the company. 
   The funding for this program also resulted from a unique story. Congressman Rahm Emanuel and I, as newer Members of Congress, were invited by the President of the United States on Air Force One. We decided jointly that in the corridor of that aircraft we would buttonhole the President, and me, somewhat more softly, and Rahm, somewhat more forcefully, urged the President to support the Great Lakes Legacy Act. Finally, the President relented and said, Okay, Mark, Rahm, I get it. Clean up Great Lakes harbors. So appropriations were found, even in the President's budget. 
   This program now has cleaned up five areas of concern, with 31 to go. The success of cleaning up harbors no longer can be doubted, especially in my area, because we are all now seeing what is happening in Kenosha and Racine, Wisconsin, recognized now as tremendous economic successes.     
   When we clean up Waukegan Harbor, in all likelihood, probably using a more traditional Superfund authority, we expect to see an $800 million economic boom in eastern Lake County. 
   Now Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Boozman have rightly backed this bill, which underscores a key point that environmental cleanup and economic development go hand in hand in the Great Lakes. We did run into a snag in the Senate, Senator Coburn, who set certain conditions on the passage of this bill. 
   I wish they could have visited some of these communities. I wish he could have seen how much economic development has already been fostered. I wish he could have seen the new entrepreneurs and businesses created. But, for now, here in the House, we rightly join together as Republicans and Democrats to build a success upon a success to keep this program on track. 
   I thank the authors of this legislation and commend their work and urge their quick adoption of this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, our country rises to its potential when we support NATO, especially when an ally asks for help. 
   In August, the missile threat to our allies grew. Russia invaded Georgia and fired over a dozen ballistic missiles at her people. And Iran also tested its first space-launched rocket. In response, our Polish allies signed an agreement calling for a U.S. missile defense base. It will not only defend Europe, but also us. 
   Poland is a good ally, having sent 18,000 troops to Iraq, covering five provinces, and now surging support for U.S. troops in Afghanistan. But in July, the House gutted funding for the base in Poland. Without a Polish agreement, the House cut $400 million. But now that agreement has been signed. Poland's foreign minister has asked for U.S. support, especially after Russia's President Putin threatened both Poland and Ukraine. 
   Tomorrow I will offer a defense appropriations amendment to refund the cuts made against Poland. If the lessons of the last century are clear, we know that America has fewer problems later if we support a friend like Poland now.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (TEN AMERICANS SHOWING AMERICA'S BEST FACE FROM THE 10TH DISTRICT -- (House of Representatives - February 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Speaker, I'd like to talk about 10 Americans showing America's best face from the 10th Congressional district. Today I rise to honor 10 very special individuals from my congressional district who are making a difference for the United States overseas. These ``Ten for the Tenth'' go beyond dedicating themselves to building a stronger community here, but also show the best face and values of America overseas. 
   Marillyn Tallman, from Highland Park, has been working for more than 60 years, leading the fight against anti-Semitism. After a trip to the Soviet Union in 1968, Marillyn joined Chicago Action for Soviet Jewry to fight human rights violations against Jews. Since 1972, the Highland Park-based Chicago Action has been a vocal advocate for the third largest Jewish community in the world, sponsoring fact-finding missions, linking synagogues with communities in the former Soviet Union, and pressing for legislative action. 
   Lori Dillon, from Lake Forest, works closely with Eric Peasah at the Counter Trafficking Center to support the rescued children sold into child labor in Ghana. They have been working to save hundreds of trafficked children. Lori started a pen pal program where children in the Lake Forest community write to rescued children in Ghana offering support. She also started a child trafficking awareness initiative at the Deerpath Middle School and Lake Forest High School where her daughter, Claire, is a sophomore. 
   Zack Harris, of Glencoe, was a New Trier freshman when he learned about and studied the conflict in Darfur, and he became determined to help. As an 8th-grade student and president of the Central School in Glencoe, he organized a ``Dance for Darfur,'' a fundraiser for the Luol Deng Foundation, which works with the World Food Program in Darfur, to assist in food distribution. The ``Dance For Darfur'' was the first charity dance ever held at the school, and helped raise awareness, and over $1,000, with over $5,000 more contributed by the community. 
   Gene Marks, of Northbrook, realized that many Latinos in the 10th Congressional District come from only three villages in Mexico: La Luz, Tonatico, and San Jose. Last year Northbrook purchased a new ambulance for the Fire Department, and instead of scrapping the fully operational older ambulance, Gene contacted my office and arranged with our Latino Advisory Board member, Miguel Arizmendi, to donate this ambulance to Tonatico, Mexico, the first ambulance they will ever have, where it will benefit thousands. 
   Connie Duckworth, of Lake Forest, after retiring as a partner and the managing director of Goldman Sachs, she founded Arzu to better the lives of Afghan women. This nonprofit group provides sustainable incomes and access to education for many women in Afghanistan by selling homemade rugs here in the United States. 
   The Fred Outa Foundation in Northbrook, in 2006 Susan Vaickauski of Northbrook and Maryann Gibbs of Gurnee founded this foundation to raise money for a girls school in Kenya. The foundation provides school supplies, food and medicines, all for Fred Outa's school in Kenya. 
   The International Sharing Ministry in Libertyville was created by Libertyville's St. Joseph's parish in 2005 to build an elementary school for the children of Mailisita in Tanzania. Additionally, the organization is now building a guest house in Moshi to generate revenue for people traveling in the country or climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro. To date, they have raised over $100,000 and built five classrooms already. 
   Pastor Stackhouse of Waukegan, who from May 2007 to July 2007 led his church members at Sign of the Dove Church in Waukegan and North Chicago to institute a water system and clean rainwater for local residents in Masaka, Uganda. This is notable because his community of South Waukegan and North Chicago is a lower-income community. But they are representing the United States very well overseas. 
   Wendy Abrams of Highland Park is one of the leaders in the fight against climate change. Wendy developed and implemented Chicago's ``Cool Globes'' art and public awareness exhibit along the lake front. In conjunction with the city, 123 five-foot-tall globes were designed for artists on environmental themes to raise awareness about reducing our carbon footprint. 
   The COVE Alliance of Indian Creek, in April 2005 formed a nonprofit organization serving orphaned and vulnerable children in central Uganda. Parishioners are actively involved in fund-raising, as well as mission trips to Kapeeka, Uganda. 
   Finally, an honorable mention to Dr. Wayne Goldstein, who is a doctor to  doctors in Sierra Leone. These 10, with an honorable mention, 11 Americans, have led the best face of the United States overseas from my congressional district.

   And what is offered in Second Life? My staff found rooms leading people to commit suicide, satanic worship, buying assault weapons, leading human sacrifice, and rape rooms; game players choose to rape or be raped. This content is totally inappropriate and leads to the objectification lessons that are especially inappropriate for young boys. 
   Linden Lab claims that it provides a teen area, but the fine print of their user agreement clearly states that adults prowl in the children's area and children are in the adult area. 
   Second Life's K Street lobbyists say, ``Trust us,'' but I think we should trust informed and aware parents. I urge Members to join me in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission worrying about the dangers of Second Life.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Beach Protection Act because it is critical that we protect millions of Americans who use the public beaches each day, like the ones in my own congressional district. Unfortunately, many beaches go unmonitored or face severe delays and do not receive testing results in time to protect the public health. Without proper monitoring and notification, thousands of citizens risk illness due to growing contamination. This legislation provides authority for funding for rapid testing of recreational waters that can save millions from unnecessary beach closings or even hospital bills. 
   We must not ignore also far more dangerous toxins which have far-reaching effects on the most vulnerable members of our society--our children. Mercury pollution is a serious problem for my district in Northern Illinois, as well as nationwide. 
   I would like to present to the House a chart which shows mercury depositions for 2001. What it shows here is a picture of both the West Coast, the Midwest and the East as mercury hot spots where further monitoring should be used to protect the public health. 
   In my own area, the Chicago region, other data shows we could be one of the hottest mercury hot spots in the country. Today there are more than 700 bodies of water throughout the United States that are impaired by mercury. The Great Lakes are particularly vulnerable to this exposure as 36 percent of mercury emissions are generated in the Great Lakes region. In fact, there are currently no less than 18 separate fish advisories for mercury contamination in our region. And yet the Great Lakes remain a source of food, and especially drinking water, for 30 million Americans. This undoubtedly contributes to the recent estimate by the U.S. Government that more than 300,000 American babies are born each year with a risk of mercury pollution. 
   I will note in my own State of Illinois, pregnant women test 14 times above the background level for mercury in their blood. 
   We are just at the beginning of learning what mercury deposited in our waterways are doing from American coal plants and other industrial sources. 
   Some scientists estimate also that 36 percent of mercury settling into U.S. ground soil and waterways comes from Asia, particularly China. We know that China is home to 20 of the 30 most polluted cities on the planet, and their extensive use of coal affects their water and their air in their mercury pollution. 
   In light of the newly discovered data on global mercury sources and new atmospheric modeling methods, it is critical that we revise the outdated monitoring and testing procedures for this dangerous toxin. 
   My amendment would require the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to update existing monitoring protocols and develop updated testing recommendations for the existence of mercury in the Great Lakes coastal waters, sediments and fish. Funds for this effort would not come out of scarce resources set aside for beach monitoring and testing. 
   To the chairman and the ranking member who have helped me out with this, I want to thank you for your leadership on this and helping support this amendment in protecting the Great Lakes. 
   As we enter the summer months when mercury deposition is the highest, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to help safeguard the future of our generations and the Midwest's most precious natural resource. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would seek to break up the partisan tone of this debate and offer this bipartisan amendment because I think looking at increased testing and protocols to monitor mercury pollution, making sure especially in the Great Lakes, the source of drinking water for 30 million Americans is safe, we should adopt this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (AMERICAN VETERANS DISABLED FOR LIFE COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, as the co-author of this legislation, the American Veterans Disabled For Life Commemorative Coin Act, I want to especially thank my partner, DENNIS MOORE of Kansas, for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor, where we are now, on to the White House for enactment. 
   Our legislation seeks to recognize the sacrifices made by more than 3 million living disabled veterans by building a memorial for them right here within sight of the Capitol. 
   In 2000, Congress authorized the construction of this memorial just southwest of the Rayburn building. In December 2006, the President signed a law that transferred control of the land for the memorial from the District of Columbia to the National Park Service. In February 2007, I joined my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Hare) in introducing a bill that extended the authorization for this memorial through 2015, and that was signed into law in October.     
   Now, the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation needs to raise approximately $65 million for the construction of this memorial. 
   Our legislation today will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative silver dollars that will be sold with a surcharge to help the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation to raise the money it will need to construct this memorial to our heroes. Not only will these coins be collector's items, but they will help raise millions for the memorial. 
   In crafting the bill, Congressman Moore and I had the privilege to meet an extraordinary young man, Sergeant Bryan Anderson from Rolling Meadows, Illinois. Bryan's story is, unfortunately, all too common for many veterans from Iraq, but his spirit is very uncommon, and his attitude sets him completely apart from the average person. 
   You see, Bryan at the age of 26, who finished basic training on September 12, 2001, lost both his legs and an arm to a roadside bomb in Iraq. Bryan jokes that he would have lost both his arms if he hadn't been smoking when the bomb detonated. His constant sense of humor and his determination are clearly apparent and came through loud and clear in a long interview he gave to Esquire magazine. 
   In it, Bryan said, ``This doesn't define me. It may be how I look on the outside, but it's not who I am. I guess you could remember me easily as being a triple amputee, but it's not who I am, has nothing to do with who I am. I've always been the same person.'' 
   Bryan is a self-described ``adrenaline junkie,'' who hopes to become a Hollywood stuntman. Since his appearance on the cover of Esquire, he's had numerous opportunities to use his story for some sort of political gain, but he has always forgiven that opportunity. For Bryan, he doesn't like to talk about politics, but always wants to talk and support the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. 
   Washington has many advocates for many causes here in this town but none more effective than Bryan Anderson. With Bryan, you see what you get. He is a veteran with an inspirational story, who wants to see this memorial built, not just for himself but for all of his disabled veterans from World War II, from Korea, from Vietnam, from Desert Storm, and from his conflicts both in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   Bryan is about as genuine as you can ever get, and with passage of this legislation, we come closer to the day when Bryan will return to Capitol Hill to visit the memorial that he helped to build. 
   I want to thank my friend Dennis and also a member of my staff, Patrick Magnuson, for helping shepherd this legislation through the House. 
   With more than 3 million disabled American veterans alive today, it is fitting that we now take the time to build a memorial in memorializing their sacrifice here within sight of the Capitol in Washington, D.C. 
   As someone who is one of the only Members of Congress still serving in the military as a Naval Reserve intelligence officer, it's my honor to be the lead Republican cosponsor of this legislation. It's our hope now that we go to the White House, enact this legislation, mint this coin, raise millions for our fellow disabled American veterans, and then build this memorial, not just to show all of the veterans how much we care about them and honor them but  also to remind future Congresses that freedom is not free, that a price is very high when the President calls on our Armed Forces to deliver, and when they do, we honor them and will always remember their memory.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in June of 2007, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission and toy company RC2 announced the recall of 1.5 million various Thomas & Friends wooden railway toys because they contained dangerous amounts of lead. 
   Lead poisoning causes vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, anemia, loss of appetite and abdominal pain, irritability, fatigue, constipation, difficulty sleeping, headaches, and coma. Of course, it can even be fatal. The toys on recall were made in China and retailed throughout our country. 
   Just about every family with young kids in America knows Thomas the Tank Engine well. And that's why I stand here this evening. 
   In 2004 the Consumer Product Safety Commission reported 121 United States product recalls. By 2007 that number had fallen to 83. Meanwhile, the commission recorded 148 recalls of products from China. But last year Chinese recalls totaled 287. 
   Now, last July I joined with Congressman Rick Larsen, the co-Chair with me of the United States China Working Group, in introducing H.R. 3100, the bipartisan Import Safety Act of 2007, to increase penalties for willful violators of Federal regulations on imported goods and increase our commitment to overseas inspections by the FDA and the commission. Our effort brought needed attention to this critical issue, and the legislation that we are discussing today, H.R. 4040, included provisions to increase penalties for violators. 
   Last August Congressman Larsen and I led a delegation to China for intense discussions on product safety. We met with the Vice Minister Wei at China's General Administration For Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. We told him that we would not stop until China allowed the Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to deploy United States product safety officers to China. When we returned, we made good on our promise. After months of work and intense consultations with the State Department, the FDA, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, and the commission, we are pleased to report that we now can announce the FDA will be deploying eight full-time United States product safety officers to China later this year. 
   Just a few hours ago, Congressman Larsen and I met with Mr. Christopher Hickey, who will be America's incoming FDA country director for China. We will continue working with our colleagues to ensure that Mr. Hickey has all of the resources he requires to get his work done and keep families safe. We particularly stressed on him the importance of having a letter from the Secretary of Health and Human Services giving him as country director power to stop a dangerous shipment from being unloaded in a U.S. port if, in his view as a country director, he feels that Americans could be at risk. We feel that this letter will give him important powers and negotiating leverage to make sure that he has access where needed on behalf of the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services to make sure that Americans are safe. 
   At a hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services in March of this year, I pressed Chairman Nord to follow FDA's lead and immediately deploy United States product safety officers from the commission to China. After weeks of intense follow-up discussions, we are pleased to have the commission's commitment to send its first full-time American product safety officer to Beijing. As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee that will fund this effort, our understanding is that the startup costs for this effort will total $310,000 with reoccurring costs of $550,000 per year to support the commission's deployment to China. 
   I want to thank our ambassador to the People's Republic of China, Sandy Randt, for working with us to secure the physical space in Beijing and Shanghai and Guangzhou to accommodate these critical deployments, and staffers from the Kirk and Larsen offices on behalf of the China Working Group did inspect those facilities just a few months ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, on December 19 of last year, the House passed H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act, by a unanimous 407-0 vote. This House came together on a bipartisan basis and defined a children's product as a consumer product designated or intended for children, and here's the key phrase, ``up to age 12.''     
   It would mean that toys for kids up to age 12 would be subject to lead testing. Now our colleagues in the Senate took up a bill and amended this definition and lowered the age requirement to just 7 years. 
   I take this action tonight on behalf of Americans like Ryan Fischer, age 3, who is now recovering from lead poisoning. Ryan's mother, Beth, came to the Congress to highlight the danger that she faced, among other Americans, including the toys of Ryan's 8-year-old brother that contained lead but would not be covered under the Senate bill. The toy in question in this case was a figure from a Nickelodeon character, Diego, that was among the 17 pounds of toys that had high lead levels in the Fischer home. 
   Today, I rise to offer what I think is a commonsense motion to instruct conferees on H.R. 4040 to insist on the House definition of a children's product over what the Senate chose. 
   Now, earlier this evening, I logged onto Etoys.com, a very popular Web site for children's toys. When I clicked on toys for children ages 9 to 12, I found 21 products in the Thomas and Friends line available for sale. 
   Did our colleagues in the Senate think that dangerous toys coming from China could only harm kids below 8 years of age? If so, the Senate would be out of touch and is not listening to the concerns of many American families. 
   On May 15, 2008, Linda Ginzel, the cofounder of Kids in Danger, called on conferees to adopt the House definition of a children's product. Linda knows what it's like to lose a child from an unsafe product. In Linda's words, ``Kids in Danger especially urges the conferees to include the definition of children's products that go up to age 12. Stopping at age 7 would effectively stop protecting children in the second grade.'' I agree with Linda, as I think do most Americans. The American Academy of Pediatrics agrees with her as well. 
   On November 6, 2007, Dr. Dana Best testified before the Congress on behalf of the AAP, issuing the following statement, ``The AAP further recommended that children's products be defined as one used by children under the age of 12 years in order to provide a standard that protects most children throughout periods of rapid brain development.'' 
   In her later testimony, Dr. Best went on to say, ``The AAP further appreciates the fact that this legislation requires lead testing in products designed or intended for use by or with children up to age 12 years. Children's brains develop rapidly throughout childhood, and significant damage would occur from lead exposure at any point during this time. This provision represents a vital protection for child health.'' 
   Now, for some reason, our colleagues in the Senate disagreed with Kids in Danger. Our colleagues in the Senate disagreed with the American Academy of Pediatrics and, in my judgment, the  common sense of the American people. For some reason, our colleagues in the Senate may have never logged on to Etoys.com to find out that products recalled less than 1 year ago because of dangerous lead content targeted children between the ages of 9 and 12. 
   Mr. Speaker, we should not allow toy manufacturers to stop protecting American children once they hit the second grade. 
   Mr. Speaker, legislation of this type has now been under consideration in the Congress for almost a year. We passed this very legislation in December. We went to conference on this bill over 4 weeks ago. As we work tonight, it is only 4 months until the Christmas shopping season goes into high gear. Likewise, Hanukkah begins 4 days before Christmas. 
   Time is quickly running out to send a very clear signal by this Congress in this month that lead standards in toys will not just be a recommendation of major retailers, but will have the force of law and will apply to products for children age 12 and down. 
   In my view, this is a commonsense, bipartisan issue that the House should insist on as it rapidly concludes its conference. We should maximize protections for our Nation's children. 
   In this effort, I want to thank Will Carty from Mr. Barton's staff for helping us out on this; Brian Diffell from Mr. Blunt's staff for this important motion today; and my key staffers, Richard Goldberg and Patrick Magnuson, for their assistance and work on this effort. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense motion to instruct, and reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. His State has gone through enough, and I am glad for the attention and time he has spent on this issue. 
   I think most Americans know with regard to Thomas and other faulty products from China, we have known about this problem for a year, and that the House of Representatives has passed completely bipartisan legislation on this subject 7 months ago. We have been in conference for 4 weeks now. 
   Quite frankly, our colleagues in the Senate made a mistake by making the protections cover only toys from zero to age 7. We risk having a situation in which parents who do not follow the rigid declarations of what is available on the labeling on the box may make a mistake, and we do not offer protections under the Senate bill; or, that older brothers and sisters may have toys available which clearly fall outside the Senate definition but would come clearly inside the House definition. That is why I think this is a very important motion to instruct. 
   I think this calls attention to this issue for a piece of legislation which should be rapidly finished to send a clear signal to the holiday-buying public. I think it gently corrects our colleagues in the other body that they made a mistake and they should back down to the House's position. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, one of the key principles of leadership is to lead by example, and the leader of this House, Speaker Pelosi, has moved us to restrict access to executive jets, as she should have. She has also moved to institute new spending controls for the Congress and for the government, as she should have. And she has moved to reduce our impact on the environment, especially man's effect on climate change, as she should. 
   I agree with each of these priorities. But the Speaker's staff request to upgrade her military domestic taxi service from a small plane that was offered to Speaker HASTERT for 12 passengers and a crew of five, to a major airliner with 45 passengers and a crew of 16 appears to be extravagant, appears to expand the Congress's excess to executive jets, appears to remove any spending controls from our operations, and dramatically increases our impact on the environment, especially climate change. 
   Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that a major airliner costing over $10,000 an hour to fly is an extravagance that is beyond the Speaker's status as third in line to succeed the President under our plan in the Constitution and in procedure for the continuity of government. 
   In fact, the Department of Defense has ruled that since the Speaker has never become the President of the United States in the 220 years of our country's history, that the continuity of government plan does not include providing 24/7 military taxi service within the domestic United States, carrying family, other Members of Congress, staff, and supporters to both political and official events. 
   Now, we know that jetliners emit a large amount of greenhouse gases, and we know that this aircraft costs millions of dollars, and we know that the Congress has dramatically restricted the access of executive jets to everyone else, but the Speaker. 
   I might inject a point of common sense here that the Speaker's staff has said that, for security reasons, she must have unlimited access to an aircraft at the 89th Military Airlift Wing like this one. 
   And I may point out that in my experience of watching public officials move through airports, a figure like Senator Obama or Senator McCain attracts a much larger crowd than one for the Speaker. I might think that if we have to offer a military taxi service to the Speaker, we would also have to offer one to the fourth in line for the Presidency, the President pro tempore of the Senate. 
   How much will this cost? How much in greenhouse gases will it emit? And last and not least, what sort of example does it send as a leader who is advocating all of these other policies that, in the operation of her own staff and her own offices, she is not following those principles? 
   For that reason, I urge the adoption of the amendment.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, successful counterterror campaigns teach that to win, you must attack both terrorists and their money. 
   Through our congressional partisan lens, the Iraq war is sometimes described as the ``bad war'' while Afghanistan is described as the ``good war.'' Our partisan lens does not allow us to recognize any good news from Iraq, and also blocks bad news from Afghanistan. But in Afghanistan, we see that the Taliban is back, funded by billions from the sale of heroin. 
   Last month, security situations in Afghanistan worsened, and the Taliban set new records for intensity, scope and frequency of their attacks. The numbers of districts under stress, the number of district centers attacked, and the number of roadside car bombs and suicide bombs all dramatically increased. In total, the death toll in June alone numbered over 40 NATO casualties, including 27 Americans, representing the highest number killed in  any single month in 7 years of conflict in Afghanistan. 
   According to open-source reporting on NATO-Taliban fire fights, the Taliban has not run out of people, ammunition or supplies. And NATO ground forces did not win every battle, a new and troubling development. 
   For many years, Afghanistan has become the world's leading producer of heroin, responsible for roughly 92 percent of the world's supply. But the U.N. now reports that in 2008, Afghanistan has become the top producer of hashish as well. Money from heroin, and now profits from hashish, total hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. In sum, the Taliban's drug profits may equal the operations budget of General McKiernan and his NATO army. This amendment will help focus the broader intelligence community on the clear nexus between narcotics and terrorism. 
   The hot issue yesterday was a surge in troops to Afghanistan backed by both Senators Obama and McCain. I would sound a note of caution, though, that without aerial spraying and other counterdrug programs that have worked in Pakistan and Colombia, such an Afghan move would only accelerate violence between two now very well-funded opponents. 
   To turn the rising Taliban tide, we must now effectively move against heroin, and now hashish, in the narcostate that is now Afghanistan. This amendment will commission a National Intelligence Estimate to look at the nexus between drug profits and terrorism. 
   We all note the record of the past. In 2001, the leader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, claimed to have eradicated the entire heroin crop of Afghanistan. That is what his PR agents wanted you to know. What they did not want you to know is Mullah Omar had stockpiled 300 tons of opium paste in warehouses south of Kandahar in an effort similar to what the Hunt brothers did with the silver market, trying to corner the market in opium and heroin. 
   In 2002, after coalition troops moved to replace the Taliban plan, our Ambassador to Afghanistan, Zal Khalilzad, convinced the new President, Hamid Karzai, to be against aerial spraying, saying that it would recall memories of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. That single move crippled counternarcotic programs in that country. Without aerial spraying, just to spray the leader's field, as has been done in Pakistan and Colombia, heroin production rose from no provinces in 2001, to 29 of 34 provinces today. 
   Such a rise in drug production led to enormous profits. And when asked the question, who is the chief financier of the Taliban, and partially of al Qaeda, the leading counternarcotics adviser to President Hamid Karzai told me it was Haji Bashir Noorzai, the banker to the Taliban. 
   In a very successful operation by the DEA, Haji Bashir Noorzai was lured first to the U.A.E., and then to New York City, where he was indicted in the Southern District of New York and is currently incarcerated. It was a great triumph for the United States, putting Haji Bashir Noorzai on the cover of Time magazine and underscoring the important contribution that the Drug Enforcement Agency can add to the intelligence community. 
   At the time, DEA was not part of the intelligence community. By action of the last Congress, we brought DEA into the intelligence community and supplied them with new intelligence collection assets to operate in Afghanistan. It is because DEA is in, that with their intelligence, this amendment should pass.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Reclaiming my time. The gentlewoman actually has amended the legislation within the last half hour to add a fifth charge of subornation of perjury. But this bill falls far short of its potential. 
   In 1996, the Congress is on record with the vote of Congresswoman Pelosi and Congressman Hastert of supporting legislation with 21 public integrity felonies, not the 5 under the legislation before us. 
   We are missing a key element in this legislation which falls far short of our potential for reform. We know under current law that Rostenkowski collects after mail fraud, Traficant collects after corruption, Cunningham collects after bribery, and Ney collects after conspiracy. But the key story tonight is what is missing in this legislation. 
   Our House leadership presented a bill which until an hour ago would have exempted the 110th Congress from any of these reforms. Now they are going to go back with the original intention of the bill with the new amendment that the Congresswoman added. But this list of felonies fails to include income tax evasion. 
   I would ask her, why didn't you add income tax evasion to the list of felonies under this bill?

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider legislation to kill the pensions of Members of Congress convicted of a felony. 
   Amazingly, lawmakers who broke the law collect taxpayer-funded pensions after conviction. Rostenkowski collects after mail fraud; Traficant collects after corruption; Cunningham collects after bribery; and Ney collects after conspiracy. 
   Today's bill is a step forward, but blocks pensions for only four felonies: bribery, being a foreign agent, conspiracy to defraud, and perjury. The key story is what is missing. 
   Our House leadership presented a bill, but banned an amendment that would add 17 public corruption felonies to the list. Under today's unamended bill, Congressmen would still get a pension if convicted of income tax invasion, wire fraud, intimidation to secure contributions, and racketeering. Speaker Pelosi voted for these tougher reforms in 1996, but appears to have changed her mind. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will support the bill before the House because it is the result of reform-minded Members like me who brought it to the floor, but it does fall 17 felonies short of the reforms needed to fully clean up this House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Chairman, the scope of this amendment now is focused exclusively on Lake County, Illinois, and mainly the watershed of the Des Plaines River. This is a river in which several outdated and unused dams are preventing the return of higher-end predator fish, specifically pike and walleye, through the upper Des Plaines and Fox River Valleys. 
   Now, I have worked on this amendment and consulted with my colleague, Congresswoman Melissa Bean, and we both agree on a bipartisan basis that the return of these high-end predator fish will not only help restore the environment of upper Lake County and its Fox River and Des Plaines watersheds, but also will be a help to sports fishing and boating in these areas. 
   For these reasons, the removal of these very small but damaging structures will go a long way to restoring the ecosystems along the lines of the Chicago Paddlers Association and the Nature Conservancy and their recommendations. 
   I want to particularly thank John Mica and his staff, especially Amy Steinmann for her work on this, as well as Chairman Oberstar for his help on this because this is going to make a big difference in the ecosystem of Lake County, Illinois, and we hope to invite all of you, maybe Mr. Baker as well, to come for a day, hopefully 5 years from now, of exciting sports fishing in northern Illinois.

   Mr. KIRK. As gas prices rise, an effective way to offer relief is to provide incentives for commuter rail. Commuter rail saves America 4 million gallons of gas a day and saves each individual commuter over $1,600 a year. 
   Next week, the Speaker will bring up legislation that will offer only Federal employees transit benefits. I support expanding the current Federal transit program, and believe that all Americans should have the opportunity to have this relief at the pumps. 
   A month ago, I introduced bipartisan legislation, the Creating Opportunities to Motivate Mass-transit Utilization To Encourage Ridership, or the COMMUTER Act of 2008. 
   Our legislation offers employers a 50 percent tax credit if they provide transit benefits to their employees. According to Forbes Magazine, the average gasoline cost in the 10 worst commuter cities is over $6 a day. Should businesses take advantage of this, we would lower our gas bills, but it should be offered to more than people with a Federal job.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   Madam Speaker, the budget coming before this House does more than approve the largest tax increase in American history. That is what it includes. But what this budget is notable for is what it also does not include. 
   The leaders of the Republican Tuesday Group and the study committees came together to outline reforms to help the government spend less. And why should we do that? Let's note that in 1961, when President Kennedy took office, the Federal Government spent just $98 billion. We didn't hit our first trillion until 1987. We broke the second trillion in 2002, and in 2010, we will go above the $3 trillion level. 
   The Federal debt held by the public has climbed to over $3 trillion in 2006, a 300 percent increase in the last quarter century. This year, interest payments on our debt alone will top over $200 billion. 
   Now, last night I offered an amendment cosponsored by Congressmen Dent, Pence and Hensarling. We laid out some commonsense reforms that this budget should include, like statutory discretionary spending limits, like the kind approved by President Clinton that helped us spend less; like provisions to slow the growth of entitlement spending by requiring offsets for any new benefits allowed; like enforcement tools that restricted the definition of ``emergency spending'' that would have helped us not declare a spinach farmer bailout last week as a national security emergency, which we did in the supplemental appropriations bill; like accrual accounting, to show what the taxpayers' long-term obligations are, and to clearly lay out for the American people our financial position. 
   And finally, periodic audits and summaries updating the accounting rules we use so the American people always have the most transparent view of what their government is doing. 
   Unfortunately, last night the Rules Committee rejected this amendment. We will not even be allowed to vote on these commonsense reforms. Ironic because most of these reforms were taken from the Democratic Blue Dog group that has advocated strong financial controls, but somehow backed this effort to deny this amendment from even a vote. 
   I urge this House to reject this rule and allow these commonsense reforms to go through. If the past is our guide, even the budget that the Congress will consider today and tomorrow will be waived shortly because when the supplemental appropriations bill comes back from Congress, it will include a provision that says the budget act is entirely waived and $125 billion, $23 billion over the President's request, will be passed, waiving the budget that we even approve tomorrow.

<DOCNO>Mr. KIRK. (CALLING FOR A SECURITY SUMMIT AT O'HARE AIRPORT -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, today's USA Today reports on a major security failure at two of our Nation's largest airports, Chicago's O'Hare and LAX. In a simulation conducted by the Transportation Security Agency, screeners at LAX missed 75 percent of hidden explosives and bomb parts carried through the security by undercover TSA agents. 
   Screeners at Chicago's O'Hare missed these items 60 percent of the time. According to the report, bomb materials were packed away in toiletry kits, briefcases and CD players. Now, more than 6 years after September 11, we have to fix the security failures at major hubs like O'Hare and LAX. 
   Security officials should call a security summit, bringing together local leaders and the Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation to schedule intensive retraining for TSA screeners, new testing standards, and accountability for lapses in security. 
   Much of our safety and a great deal of our economy depends on the security of O'Hare Airport. We can do this. And a security summit to fix this glaring security problem would help.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Chairman, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with the chairman about an amendment Mr. Lipinski and I offered in the Rules Committee yesterday afternoon regarding airport security badges. 
   Dave Savini of CBS TV revealed that, since 2004, 3,760 aviation security badges have gone missing at O'Hare. These badges are the only identification needed for law enforcement officials, independent contractors, baggage handlers, flight attendants and pilots to enter the airfield. When an employee is fired, some airport contractors are unwilling to reclaim their badges from employees, who retain full access to the airport. 
   This problem is not isolated at Chicago. In early February, officials at Los Angeles International Airport reported 120 missing TSA badges; in Oakland, 500 missing badges; in Buffalo, nearly 40 missing badges; and 42 missing badges in Dallas. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Kirk-Lipinski amendment we offered would require airport contractors to make a reasonable effort to retrieve badges from employees whose employment has ended and notify the local airport authority within 24 hours. Failure to comply would then result in a civil fine of up  to $10,000 per day. Hitting contractors where it hurts, in their pocketbooks, can help make our Nation's airports safer. And our amendment will now be included in a freestanding bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank you for engaging in this colloquy on this matter and appreciate your support in working with Mr. Lipinski and me in a bipartisan manner to address this issue in the future. 
   I yield to the chairman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, I am voting for H.R. 4 because I believe that the Medicare prescription drug program can be improved. And one improvement is allowing the Secretary an opportunity to negotiate lower drug prices. 
   At the same time, my support for H.R. 4 is contingent upon the principle that this legislation will not allow restrictions imposed by the Federal Government on patients' access to medicines. I firmly believe that every patient must have access to the medicines their doctors prescribe, without government intervention. I interpret this legislation to mean Medicare beneficiaries are protected against all types of government-imposed restrictions on patients' access to the medicines they need, and that no such restrictions will be allowed under the Medicare Modernization Act as amended by H.R. 4. 
   Seniors should pay less for prescription drugs, and Medicare should have more tools to achieve savings for our Nation's elderly. But these savings should not come at the expense of seniors ability to discuss with their doctors which drugs are best for their health and to have access to these drugs in the Medicare Part D program. I am disappointed that H.R. 4 was rushed to the floor today without any hearings or amendments allowed. I hope the Senate will take a more thoughtful approach when considering Medicare Part D reform to add more protections for our seniors.

Democratic leaders in Congress now support building the bridges to nowhere, one structure, connecting to an island with just 50 people, the other to an island with only 22, at a cost to the U.S. taxpayer of over $1 billion. Only 6 months into a new Congress, and now Congressional leaders do not want to kill pensions for Congressional felons, but do want to build the bridges to nowhere.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KIRK. Madame Speaker, on February 12, I joined my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Hare, in introducing H.R. 995 to extend the authorization of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial through 2015. This legislation will give the American Veterans Disabled for Life Foundation more time to raise the money needed to build this memorial just south of the Rayburn Building. I believe the time has come to recognize the sacrifices made by America's more than three million disabled veterans by building a memorial for them in here in Washington, D.C.  
   Last December President Bush signed into law a bill to transferring control of the land for the memorial from the District of Columbia to the National Park Service. Now the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation needs to raise approximately $65 million to cover the cost of construction. By passing H.R. 995 today, we will give the foundation time to raise this money. 
   Earlier this year I joined my colleague from Kansas, Mr. Moore, in introducing legislation to authorize the minting of commemorative coins to help raise money for this cause. As we extend the authorization for the memorial today, I want to encourage my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring H.R. 634 to issue these coins. No federal funds will be used to build the disabled veterans memorial, but it is appropriate for Congress to do all it can to support and encourage its construction. 
   With more than three million disabled veterans in the United States today, it is fitting that a memorial to their sacrifice be erected in Washington, D.C. It is my hope that passing Mr. Hare's legislation will bring us closer to making the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial a reality.

   It also resolves a political problem in my State. Under Governor Rod Blagojevich, our State is about to lose $4.5 billion in Federal highway funds. After 3 years under this highway fund, Illinois has failed to match any major Federal money. Supporters of total gridlock in Springfield told the reporters ``Don't worry, the Federal fund is broke.'' But it is not broke. This bill fixes that problem, and it does so in a bipartisan way. 
   Now our attention should focus on our totally incompetent State government that is locked in a Shakespearean war between the Democratic Governor and our Democratic State legislature. 
   The highway fund is not broke, and this bill fixes the problem. What should now be fixed is our State government. At a 15 percent approval rating for the Governor, the only path is up, and the best way to do that is not to let $4.5 billion in Federal highway money for Illinois lapse.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Chairman, I want to rise and maybe remove some of the partisan tension as a Republican Member in support of this amendment that otherwise, without action , the global gag rule would cut off critical providers of family planning assistance. 
   In this Congress the issue of illegal immigration is at the top of our agenda. And women in developing countries consistently report that they would like to have two to three children rather than five to seven. 
   As population pressures rise, so does the move to enter the United States, legally or illegally. To reduce the illegal immigration pressure on our borders, we need short-term solutions like border enforcemen t, and long-term solutions like backing voluntary family planning to help women in developing counties have the smaller family that they want. 
   The global gag rule has been used to cut off the International Planned Parenthood Federation because it used less than 1 percent of its own privately raised funds for abortion-related services. And when we cut off IPPF, we might have another provider of family planning assistance to the women of Mexico for example, like the UNFPA, but we cut them off too. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would argue that the American people would strongly agree with the principle that if Mexican women wanted to have fewer children, then we should help them. 
   Voluntary family planning would boost child survival rates. It would also lower the rate of growth of Mexico's population. A slower rate of growth of Mexico's population would improve the economy of Mexico. It would also reduce the environmental pressure on Mexico's ecosystem. But a slower rate of growth would also reduce the long-term i llegal immigration pressure on America's borders. 
   We should adopt this bipartisan amendment. We should help women in developing countries have the smaller families that they want. We should also adopt policies which reduce the population pressure on our own borders with a policy that supports the rights of women and lowers the pressure on our environment. 
   I commend the Chair for offering this amendment.

   Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago an incredible act of bravery took place in my district. Last Saturday, three high school students were stopped at a train crossing in Glenview, Illinois. At 8:30, as Glenbrook South High School senior Tom Foust and sophomores Tyler Brown and Zach Demertzis reached the intersection, they noticed an 83-year-old woman in her vehicle stopped on the tracks. It was clear the car was stuck, spinning her tires in the gravel. 
   At that moment, warning bells rang. The three young men rushed to the car and tried to help her move it. They didn't know how quickly the train was coming, at 79 miles an hour. When the woman did not leave, Tom reached in the vehicle and unclipped her seat belt. He pulled her out and got only 10 feet from the southbound train when it demolished the car, spraying glass and metal everywhere. The car was pushed into the northbound tracks and was immediately hit again by another train going in the opposite direction. 
   No one on the ground was injured. Tom, Tyler, and Zach saved this woman's life. I know I speak for the entire 10th District when I say how proud we are of the Glenview Good Guys, new heroes. Our community is very lucky to have them.
