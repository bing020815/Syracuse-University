<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, we need to send the signal across America that we are, indeed, going to get serious about this issue. And I was glad that a few moments ago, Speaker Pelosi referenced Mr. Pickens' plan, and I sure would like to vote on that. I sure would like to talk about all the things that he wants to do, because it is more than just one. We cannot afford to not have a plan to increase supply. In 2007, production fell from 125,000 barrels a day worldwide, while demand grew by a million barrels a day. 
   I voted a couple of weeks ago to halt oil from going into SPR. But I believe seriously that it would be terribly unwise to now remove oil from that reserve. 
   This bill is going to hurt us if it is enacted, long-term, particularly if there is a disruption. It is a Band-Aid, at best. It will remove our insurance policy in case something even worse happens. 
   Last week, in my district, gasoline fell from $4.21 a gallon to, a week later, earlier this week, to under $4. It was reflective of the price of oil at the barrel, where that fell from $140 a barrel to $125 today. Why is that? 
   One of the reasons I am convinced that the world price of oil fell was because President Bush took the very first step by saying that he would lift the moratorium on offshore drilling. But of course we know it is a two-step process. The executive branch and the legislative branch have to act. 
   But what happened was, it got the attention of those speculators on Wall Street. They might have said, I am convinced that they did, maybe Congress is going to do something. The President has taken the first step. Maybe the Congress will follow suit. 
   So it was no accident that the price at the barrel head fell dramatically from $140 to under $125 today. Let's send a signal to the American public that we are going to get serious about this. Let's defeat this bill.

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I was driving in this morning listening to the radio and I heard an ad. The ad said, vote for the bipartisan energy bill when it comes up today, and it told you to call your local Congressperson. Who are you going to call? Not even Ghost Busters can find a Republican to make this a bipartisan bill. 
   Our energy needs in this country are going to grow by about 50 percent by the year 2030, and there is no question that we need to do a better job on conservation, looking for alternative fuels; but this bill doesn't do that. This bill is not the bipartisan piece of legislation that we want. There is no bipartisan bill on the House floor. There is no Republican substitute. There were no Republican amendments. There was not even a conference named to try and iron out differences between the House and the Senate. Virtually, there was no Republican involvement or input on this legislation at all. And so, therefore, as a consequence, there are no Republicans at least on this side of the aisle that can make the bill bipartisan. 
   In 2005, we passed an important energy bill, and it was bipartisan. Chairman Barton did a terrific job in the hearings and the conference that we had, and it enjoyed the support then of Ranking Member Dingell to make sure that in fact it was bipartisan. But raising taxes, which this bill does, on energy producers is the last thing that our Nation needs as our consumers try and grapple with higher energy costs, whether that be heating or gasoline. 
   Yesterday, in an important hearing, my good friend from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) offered advice to the panel that was there when he took over the chairmanship of our important committee, Energy and Commerce. And he said this. He said: ``The Parliamentarian told me that the process needed to be fair and there needed to be a perception of fairness.'' Mr. Speaker, I lament that this bill is neither. It is not fair nor is the perception there. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote ``no.''

   Mr. UPTON. I thank the gentlelady, and I join in bipartisan spirit to get this amendment adopted as we've done on the other appropriations bills. 
   I might just note that this shining amendment will save the taxpayers literally $30 for every bulb that is ultimately replaced. It is not going to require that we take existing bulbs that work out when they expire. We will put in energy-efficient Energy Star bulbs. It will save the taxpayers ultimately hundreds of millions of dollars. 
   This is a bipartisan amendment. We found two additional cosponsors in terms of Mr. Lipinski and Mr. Inglis of South Carolina. We're also in the middle of a markup, so to be more efficient, I think both of us would like to yield back our time.

   Mr. UPTON. We just want to be on the record for this. Working with the Parliamentarians to make sure that the amendment is germane, we were not able to use the words ``or equivalent'' when we said ``ENERGY STAR or equivalent.'' We would like to see that happen in the conference, but we know that that is legislating on an appropriation bill. 
   We would also like to have a provision for historical lighting. Again, that needs to happen in conference, it cannot happen on the House floor, and that's why we proceeded in that way. We look forward to working with all parties to make sure those concerns are addressed.

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I might say that, as the gentlelady said, we've offered this amendment that has passed on every appropriation bill thus far. 
   We know the Federal Government is the largest purchaser of light bulbs in the world. By requiring that only Energy Star light bulbs are purchased, beginning October 1, in fact, we know that we will save the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars this next year in terms of energy savings. 
   We also know that if every home did what the Federal Government is going to do, based on the testimony that we had in the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, we would save as a Nation $65 billion, billion, B-as-in-big, kilowatt hours of electricity, which is the equivalent of 80 coal-fire electric plants every single year. 
   This is a good amendment. It has been bipartisan. We've appreciated the relationship that we've had with the chairman and ranking members of not only the full committee but the subcommittee. I would like to think that we would be able to pass this amendment again by a voice vote and make a stand that in fact the entire government is going to be saving billions of dollars at the end of the day based on the amendment that we're offering today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, this is a tough vote for some of us here this afternoon. For me, I support greater spending, spending for alternative fuel, so that we can lessen our dependence on foreign oil. For me I am appalled at the ineptness and bungling of the Interior Department's troubled program to collect royalties on oil and gas and public lands in both the Clinton and Bush administrations. It needs to be investigated, and it needs to be remedied. 
   But other items in this legislation, specifically the repeal of section 199, which will likely drive more refinery production elsewhere overseas, and thus more jobs, is not right. 
   When Joe Barton was chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, he was rightly proud of the process. It was open and, indeed, bipartisan. Lots of debate, Democrats and Republicans, and lots of amendments were accepted, Democrats and Republicans, and the proof was in the pudding. We passed a bipartisan bill, energy bill, which included the vote of Mr. Dingell, the chairman today of the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   Nobody saw this bill until late last week. No hearings, no markup in subcommittee or full committee, no amendments on the House floor allowed. We know this bill is going to pass, but listening to the debate, I know it could have been a much better bill and one that could have been called bipartisan, and it would pass by a much larger margin than it will this afternoon. 
   Maybe the margin of the vote could have helped us with the Senate to actually get the bill to the President's desk for his signature, rather than a veto. I urge my Republican colleagues to vote ``no'' so that we can truly pass a bill that will do something for our constituents in our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Waxman lamented on the floor a few minutes ago than this was the best that we could do. I am sorry that I don't agree with that. 
   By the year 2030, our energy needs are going to grow by more than 50 percent, and none of us, none of us here, none of us in the country are happy with the energy prices or our reliance on foreign oil, and all of us realize that we have to do a lot more. Just because this is the last day or two of the session, to bring up a bill to just say that we tackled the energy issue, I don't think is good enough. 
   This process was pretty much closed. There were few amendments that were allowed in the process. We had no conference. I can remember serving on the 2005 energy bill conference with Mr. Dingell and Mr. Barton, my chairman then, and together we collectively passed bipartisan legislation that we were indeed proud of. But this legislation is not as good as we can do. It is not comprehensive. It doesn't deal with coal, which provides nearly 50 percent of this Nation's energy. It doesn't deal with nuclear power, which today provides 20 percent of our Nation's needs. We know that we are going to need to build probably about another two dozen nuclear facilities by the year 2030 to maintain 20 percent. It does nothing on nuclear. 
   RPS, the renewable portfolio standard, I think many of us can support that. Maybe not the amendment that passed here in the House that the Senate rejected, but there is room for a compromise here. We can do things on wind and solar. We didn't even have the opportunity on this floor or in committee to really come up with a respectable RPS amendment. Coal-to-liquid, there is a bipartisan bill out there that is led by Mr. Boucher and Mr. Shimkus, I am a cosponsor, that deals with carbon sequestration. Again, it is not part of this bill. 
   Mileage standards. No, it is not a perfect provision. We can all support increasing mileage standards. But, again, we missed the opportunity to work together to get a bill that in fact could move this country forward. Biofuels, we have a biofuel mandate here, but we don't have the technology. How are we going to complete the action on this? How wise is that? Mr. Speaker, this bill is, frankly, incomplete. 
   Now, I am the new ranking member on the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, and I would like to think that in the days ahead, the weeks and months ahead, after this bill in the early new year, that Mr. Boucher, my chairman in my subcommittee, Mr. Dingell, the chairman of the full committee, and Mr. Barton, my great friend and former chairman and now ranking member, can in fact sit down together so that we can work on a comprehensive bill that deals with all of these different issues that we can then bring back on the House floor and bring back a bill that every one of us here can be proud of that will take a giant leap in the right direction, rather than taking a baby step here or there and somehow saying we have passed it, we have got a Band-Aid, it is now done. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can all do better than this, and I am sorry that this bill is coming to the floor in the shape that it is in.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, nobody likes these high prices, and I think most folks understand the law of supply and demand. Worldwide, this last year, we pumped 126,000 fewer barrels of oil and we used a million barrels more each day. 
   We have said no to ANWR, we have said no to tar sands, we've said no to oil shale, we've said no to nuclear. Sierra Club, I'm told, has opposed solar in California. This Congress has not extended R&D for renewables. Yet, 85 percent of our offshore sites are off-limits.     
   I would like to put a letter that I received a copy of from the American Association of Petroleum Geologists into the Record that was sent to the Speaker. They conclude that policies that increase exploration costs, decrease the available time to properly evaluate leases and restrict access to Federal lands in the OCS do not provide the American people with short-term relief from high prices and undermine the goal of increasing stable long-term surpluses. 
   We can't waive a magic wand and say here it is. If you say 5 years, but you still require some 27 different environmentally-mandated permits that are required, with no shortening of the time that it takes to get those permits approved, you are not succeeding. In effect, what you are doing is telling the companies to go look someplace else. They are not going to look in America. They are going to look someplace else, because they may not have to comply with these same 25 different regulations that you have to comply with in this country. You can't just say 5 years, without shortening that process. 
   Now, I am sorry that I didn't talk to Mr. DeFazio before I used that chart, but he cited I think a Shell development in Alaska that doesn't have access yet to the pipeline that takes that oil down through to the bottom of Alaska. Without the pipeline permits, they have to cap the wells.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman this amendment that I am introducing, which I will subsequently withdraw, expresses my concern about the committee's action to cap loan guarantees at $7 billion for new energy projects designed to reduce carbon emissions. 
   And before I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment, I am going to ask the chairman to enter into a colloquy with myself, and I will also submit remarks from Mr. Towns, coauthor with me; as well as my ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Barton. 
   Mr. Chairman, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Congress authorized funding to provide loan guarantees for any technology which reduces carbon emissions. That was designed to help a vast array of technologies such as wind, solar, clean coal, ethanol, and nuclear. Your committee excluded new nuclear plants as one of the technologies eligible for loan guarantees under the 2005 Energy Policy Act. And as a supporter of nuclear power, I oppose that exclusion. I am concerned that this may delay new projects that are being planned, and I am hopeful that these concerns can be addressed when you reach a conference with the Senate. 
   I would also note that the authorization in the energy appropriation bill is just that, an authorization. No appropriation is required. It is a standard practice that Federal loan guarantee programs have an annual loan volume authorization in an appropriations bill  and that the program which is authorized in title 17 of the Energy Policy Act is unique. We must remember that it is self-financing and requires no taxpayer funds. Utilities that are building these plants will pay all of the costs associated with the program, including administrative costs of processing the loan guarantee applications and the credit subsidy cost of issuing the loan guarantee itself. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I would like you to help us if you can address these concerns.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I commend the remarks by my colleagues from every State that adjoins Lake Michigan, whether they be from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and obviously in my State, the great State of Michigan. 
   My district does abut Lake Michigan, and I'm a member of the Great Lakes Caucus, with a long record of protecting our Great Lakes body. The Great Lakes are the world's largest body of fresh water, and our job here is to be good stewards. We know that, and we were stunned by the announcement that was made just a little bit more than a week ago with regard to the new refinery that's being built and expanded in Indiana. 
   Tremendous efforts have been made in this region to protect the Great Lakes, but we see it in other places around the country, the Chesapeake Bay, and it's a disgrace that the mighty Potomac is in the shape that it is. We don't want the Great Lakes to take a step back. It needs to be improved. The last thing that we need to see is that the Great Lakes take a step back in terms of the protection that we have. 
   I travel in my district in southwest Michigan to Chicago quite a bit, and I can remember as a young boy going through Gary, Indiana, and some of those places there, and it was awful in terms of the pollution. And to their credit, they've done a much better job. 
   But I've got to say it's my understanding that for the State of Indiana to issue an exemption to its own State law that prohibits mixing zones is wrong. This will result in a serious setback in the efforts to clean up the Great Lakes, especially at a time when this outdated mixing zone practice is slated to be eliminated altogether, and yet we're seeing an exemption to have it continue. It, in essence, rolls back the clock for sound environmental policy. 
   Last week I picked up the phone and I called Governor Daniels of Indiana. I told him that we had a hornet's nest in southern Lake Michigan, and that they ought to reexamine exactly what the State of Indiana was allowing. The State of Indiana needs to reexamine this. 
   We don't want industrial waste to be increased. We don't want raw sewage to be increased. We've had our beaches closed enough. I don't care what side of the lake you live on, no new dumping ought to be the mandate that we impose on every municipality, every State in the Great Lakes. We should not be adding pollution. Instead, we should be subtracting to make sure that this resource stays a treasure for every family, for every community, for generations to come.

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank Chairman Edwards and Ranking Member Wicker, Mr. Obey and others, particularly my coauthor, Ms. Harman, on this amendment. 
   As Congress tackles climate change legislation and examines ways to promote energy efficiency, it is so important that the Federal Government set a proper example, taking the lead in commonsense conservation measures. Some would say this is an amendment that sets a shining example for the rest of the country. 
   The Federal Government has to be the world's largest consumer of light bulbs, and with this amendment, we will likely save American taxpayers probably as much as $100 million. 
   Why Energy Star light bulbs? Well, current incandescent bulbs on store shelves are obsolete, and they're highly inefficient. In fact, only 10 percent of the energy consumed by each bulb is for light, with 90 percent wasted on unnecessary heat. 
   Energy Star light bulbs use about 75 percent less energy than the standard incandescent bulbs, as they last as much as 10 times longer. In fact, if every house in the Nation switched to Energy Star bulbs, we would have the potential to annually reduce the emissions equivalent of 80 coal-burning plants each year, saving 65 billion kilowatts. 
   This amendment will make the Federal Government a shining example of how we can conserve energy, one light bulb at a time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, there is a reason why Congress is in the 9 percent favorable rating. We have not done the Nation's business. I look at former Chairman BARTON sitting in the second row here. When we did the 2005 EPACT bill, we had lots of amendments here on the House floor, in fact, 23 different Democratic amendments, some amendments to amendments. And some of them would say at the end of the day that it was, in fact, a bipartisan bill because Congress worked its will. And I would say some of them were pro-energy. Frankly, some of them were anti-energy. One offered by Ms. Solis was described as an amendment that sought to delete refinery revitalization provisions in the bill. Thank goodness it was defeated. The bill moved forward, and it was signed into law. 
   But today we have a new bill that is hundreds of pages long. We haven't had a single hearing in subcommittee or full committee. We haven't had a single markup in subcommittee or full committee. And we have a rule that means when it comes to the House floor, there are no amendments allowed at all.

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment, though I wish it could do a lot more. I appreciate your remarks, my friend from Oklahoma, and certainly my good friend from Texas, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and I, in large part, echo the remarks of my good friend, the former chairman and now ranking member, Mr. Hunter. 
   Section 526, I'm not sure where it really came from. It was a provision that was snuck in a major energy bill this last year, and it somehow became law. And sadly, as we talk to our Canadian fronts, they're producing 1.5 million barrels of oil a day, 1.5 million barrels a day from oil shale, tar sands rather, in Alberta, and they want to send it to their good friends to the south, the United States of America. And this section 527 stops it at the border. It prevents it from coming in. 
   Now, I think we all know that we have a supply problem in this country which is why the price of gasoline continues to go up as it has every single day. And until we get the message out that we need more supply so that we can counter this price increase, they're going to continue to go up. It's crazy to think that our friends, the Canadians, who have all of this up there and want to send it to us down here in the Lower 48, cannot do that.  
   As I sat down with their ambassador a few weeks ago and their energy minister as well, they're producing at least 1.5 million barrels a day. They're anticipating within 4 or 5 years they're going to be producing as much as 4 million barrels a day. They can't consume that all perhaps, and guess what they're going to do. They're likely to build a pipeline, and they're going to send it west. It's going to end up in China or someplace else, rather than coming down and be refined in this country and used by our motorists across the country. 
   So, for me, I'd like to repeal the whole section, and I know the gentleman doesn't do that in this amendment. But it's a step in the right direction, and I would like to think that we can hold our nose and be able to support this amendment, make it part of going to conference and perhaps even make it better when it emerges from the House and the Senate. 
   I appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work with Members on both sides, and I certainly appreciate a number of my colleagues on that side of the aisle who are looking to work with me to try and repeal the whole section. But we realize that the Rules Committee was not going to say ``yes'' to us, and this is one step. 
   We'd like to take a giant step, which this bill does not do, but at least it is going in the right direction, increasing our supply to a degree so that maybe we can have some downward pressure on the price of gasoline at the pump for all Americans across the country.

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I will say I know that the hour is late. Many of us are trying to get home for the weekend, and there is business after me. So I don't at all intend to take too much of my 30 minutes that I have. But let me yield myself as much time as I may consume now. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are woefully unprepared to meet our energy needs for the next 30 years. Some estimates say that our needs in this country are going to increase as much as 50 percent by the year 2030. So we are going to have to do a much better job on not only looking at alternative forms of energy, we are also going to need to do much more on conservation, nuclear and a whole host of things. And as the majority leader indicated a short time ago, we are looking for some long-term strategies. 
   What this instruction to the conferees does is it takes, in essence, a piece of legislation, a bipartisan piece  of legislation that the Energy Subcommittee held hearings on earlier this week, a bill offered by the gentlelady, Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, which is bipartisan, and it expands the definition of renewable fuel and biomass to include wood removed as byproducts from National Forest System land or any organic matter that is available on a renewable basis from non-Federal land, including renewable plant material which includes feed grain, other agricultural commodities, other plants and trees, waste material, including crop residue, et cetera, food and yard waste. And it would instruct the conferees to include this on the farm bill. 
   Of course, the farm bill is a bill that is moving along. The farm legislation is a bill that is going to be on the President's desk we hope in the not too distant future. So this is a bill that is going to move. 
   Why not take a piece of bipartisan legislation that deals with alternative fuels like ethanol, expand that, and actually get it to the President's desk so we can do it right away rather than wait for more hearings, markups and dealing with the Senate? Who knows what happens over there. We can actually get this thing done and then address part of the needs that we have in this country to expand our alternative fuel base. 
   So I would like to think that we could adopt this. I know that there is quite a bit of support on it based on the hearing that we held earlier this week. 
   Madam Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. UPTON. (GREAT LAKES LEGACY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I do hail from the great State of Michigan, and I'm glad to say that my district borders one of the five Great Lakes, and I know the gentlelady from Wisconsin is equally as proud of our five Great Lakes as well. 
   Madam Speaker, one of my favorite guys here in the House is certainly former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, JOE BARTON. And he has a statement that he says, ``Don't mess with Texas.'' 
   Well, in the Midwest we have a statement as well: ``Don't mess with the Great Lakes.'' It doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat, a Member from Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, it doesn't matter. You do not mess with the Great Lakes. 
   We have seen, over the years, some great improvement in terms of the quality of the water in Lake Michigan and all of the Great Lakes. It is not by accident. It is because of the actions of this Congress, Republicans and Democrats working together, to make sure that we have adequate resources not only to have identified the problem, but then to come back with the clean-up. 
   Sadly, the Great Lakes Legacy Act, and I want to give great credit to my colleague, Dr. EHLERS from Grand Rapids, for pushing this along, it expires this year. So the work that we have done over the last number of years would have been for naught had it not been for the committee moving together, important legislation that otherwise would see this expire, literally within just a couple of weeks. 
   My colleagues have talked about the tens of millions of Americans that live and rely on the Great Lakes for so many different needs. This bill authorizes the appropriation of $150 million each and every year to make sure that, in fact, we can continue to clean up the identified contaminated areas. 
   Now let me just relate an area that we had big time on this House floor last year. We were going to see the expansion of a refinery in Indiana, and we made sure, as a delegation----

   Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, we saw last year a major refinery that was going to be expanded in the Great Lakes, and it was going to add to the discharge into Lake Michigan. And every single member of the Great Lakes Caucus, Republican and Democrat, all around that circle, stepped in, and we passed a resolution on this House stopping that from happening. We are proud to say that that did not happen. And that means we're going to actually save money because we're not going to have to clean it up. 
   But this is a bill that needs to happen. It has strong bipartisan support. I'm proud to say that we've had great progress over the last couple of years, but we're not done yet. This bill needs to happen. I commend the leadership on both sides of the aisle to make sure that it happens. And now we have to make sure that we work on the appropriators to make sure that the money continues to be there, to make sure, that, in fact, this remains a national treasure, because it is.

<DOCNO>Mr. UPTON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I know that Iraq has been on all of our minds for a long, long time. Many of us here have visited Iraq on multiple occasions. Many of us have also visited Bethesda Naval Hospital as well as Walter Reed and tried to comfort our brave and caring servicemen and women. 
   Yes, many of us have grieved with the families that have lost a loved one at a gravesite back in our districts. Mr. Speaker, we had a breakthrough this week in North Korea. It was a diplomatic success. And our country led the effort to engage other countries in the region: Russia, South Korea, Japan and China. The Six Party Talks helped see a negotiated settlement that made sense and the world today is a better and safer place. Diplomacy won again. 
   Now, one of our big problems in Iraq is that we have not pursued the diplomatic angle like we should have. We have not seen a diplomatic surge like we ought to. Let's talk about this resolution. The first finding, of course, is that the Congress and the public will continue to support and protect those serving in Iraq. That tells me that we are not going to cut off the aid for the brave folks that are there. 
   It is almost a daily routine for me when I see a man or woman in uniform at the airport, the cafeteria, at home, anywhere, Bethesda, Walter Reed Hospital, I take a moment and thank them for their sacrifice and their service. 
   Our troops need all of the equipment to make sure that their safety can be as secure as it can be. This week I e-mailed a number of our troops that I have met that are overseas. I talked about this resolution, including the policy of the surge. And many of them responded at length. I want to share part of their stories and responses without using their names. 
   One of my Army captains said this. ``Bringing in more Americans will force us into more confrontational roles. This is not the way to win. More American soldiers on the ground will not win the war, it will only delay the enemy's reaction. If the people do not believe that their government can protect them, they will look for one that they believe will.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, these folks are on the ground. They know what is going on. The generals on the ground, too, said that more U.S. troops would be counterproductive and in fact only increase or deepen the threats on our U.S. troops. 
   Let's face it, this is a civil war. It is real anarchy. And in fact the Iraqis do not want us there. Nearly 80 percent of them in Baghdad say that the American troops provoke more violence than they prevent. And these same polls show that Iraqis overwhelmingly want U.S. troops gone within a year. 
   In fact, we know that a majority on both sides, Shia and Sunni, believe that it is okay to kill our troops. So much for being a liberator. In other words, we are viewed as part of the problem, not the solution. 
   Mr. Speaker, all of us, all of us support our troops. But there are many of us that believe that this surge strategy will fail and will only prolong the day that the Iraqis will finally pick up the baton and lead their own government. 
   The Baker-Hamilton unanimous bipartisan report labeled the situation as grave and deteriorating. It called for regional cooperation and a new direction. Mr. Speaker, I am one that believes that the vote authorizing the war was based on evidence that was flat-out wrong. 
   Let's not continue to ignore the real situation and the mistakes of the past. It is time, it is time for the Iraqis, not the United States, to lead after 4 years. We need to send a message to our troops that, yes, we support them, and, for this administration, a signal for them to pursue a diplomatic surge involving the region. 
   For these reasons, I too support the resolution.

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Someone watching this debate and they hear the nice words between the two of us, they are, for sure, very genuine. We had many hand-holding scenes and meetings over the last number of months. 
   I am a cosponsor of H.R. 3919, and I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for allowing our thoughtful and constructive input into this process because clearly I think we ended up with a good piece of legislation. And I commend the gentleman's patience on our side as we were able to work out a consensus that, in fact, has brought us to the floor this afternoon. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Dingell and Mr. Barton for working with all of us to ensure that the bill was able to move forward in a bipartisan way. And Mr. Whitfield, who I remember at our first hearing on this as he talked about Connect Kentucky and the positive impact that it had there. He obviously added some good things as well to legislation. And I would urge all of my colleagues to support the legislation as it moves through this process. 
   I view the thrust of this legislation as an effort to get a better idea of the U.S. broadband penetration, not as a window to increased regulation of the already competitive broadband marketplace. 
   We were quite fortunate to learn from the successful statewide broadband mapping plan in Kentucky called Connect Kentucky. And it isn't often that we have the advantage of looking at a successful model such as this one, which could implement in a bipartisan way again there on a national level what we're able to do on this legislation in H.R. 3919. 
   Connect Kentucky demonstrated perfectly how a public/private partnership can work with industry in a nonregulatory manner that benefits not only consumers, but also provides a catalyst to greater broadband investments. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   The overarching goal of designating October each year as Children's Health Month is to draw attention to the need to provide access to health care, insuring preventative care, seek cures for diseases and chronic conditions, and promote healthy living habits for all of America's children. 
   There has been much discussion recently both on the floor and in the media about children's health care. The objective, obviously, to cover the health needs of children is of paramount concern, particularly with low-income children. Children's Health Month should remind us of that important message.

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank, in particular, Mr. Allen, Mr. Shimkus, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Barton, obviously Mr. Wynn for helping to manage this bill this afternoon. You know, this bill culminates an agreement that took many weeks of talks between the majority and minority members and their staffs. I want to thank all of the stakeholders that were involved in those discussions. Significant improvements clearly were made as that legislation moved through our committee, Energy and Commerce, as it winds its way to the floor this afternoon. 
   The bill tackled the serious concern that elemental mercury pollution in other countries will eventually convert to methylmercury pollution in the United States. Methylmercury is the  most potent form of mercury poisoning, and a serious, very serious neurotoxin. 
   And, obviously, as Mr. Wynn indicated, this bans the export of such mercury, elemental mercury in the year 2010. 
   This legislation directs the Department of Energy, which has experience storing elemental mercury, to set up a domestic storage option.     
   The legislation does not preclude any private storage solutions from occurring. Private entities wishing to take advantage of the DOE-sponsored storage option must pay the Department of Energy for that privilege, but in return they are indemnified against any environmental damage that is caused once DOE takes possession of that mercury. 
   The bill only covers elemental mercury. It does not cover coal exports. It is not intended to cover fly ash exports, from coal combustion, or small amounts of mercury in manufactured consumer products. 
   The bill requires that EPA monitor the global implications of a U.S. export ban on elemental mercury. EPA is also required to report back to the Congress on any negative consequences caused by that export ban. 
   The legislation permits EPA to grant targeted, temporary waivers for individual shipments of elemental mercury to other countries. And I would note that groups that are supporting this bill include the American Chemistry Council; the National Mining Association; the Chlorine Institute; the Environmental Council of the States; and the NRDC, the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
   Again, I compliment all those Members and staff that worked so hard to make this truly a bipartisan bill. I would like to think that we can pass this with unanimous support this afternoon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Again, I want to thank Mr. Inslee, Mr. Shays, Mr. Wynn, Mr. Barton, Mr. Dingell as well. 
   Recycling is an important environmental concept that predates, by decades, the first Earth Day and talk of global climate change. In fact, according to the National Recycling Coalition, before the 1920s, 70 percent of U.S. cities ran programs to recycle certain materials. And during World War II, 60 years ago, American industry reused and recycled 25 percent of the waste system. Today we're recycling and reusing about 33 percent of our Nation's waste. 
   Moreover, the need for serious recycling takes on an added dimension when one considers the state of America's landfill capacity. According to the EPA, since 1980 the total annual generation of municipal solid waste, otherwise known as regular household trash, has increased by more than 60 percent to its 2005 level of nearly 246 million tons every year. 
   And further, according to the EPA, over the last 15 years, 9 percent less, or about 9 million tons, of household garbage is going to our Nation's landfills. That means that the increased recycling efforts must step in to bridge the gap. 
   And while many folks may think that promoting recycling is confined just to picking up a newspaper printed on recycled papers, or buying a soft drink or beer in a recycled bottle, our domestic recycling industry is even more sophisticated and diverse than those perceptions. I've seen it firsthand in my district. In fact, domestic paper recycling helps create everything from cereal boxes, Kelloggs in Michigan, to furniture, recycled plastic soda bottles yield fibers that produce T-shirts, recycled carpet forms the basic fill for ski jackets. Recycling is not just a good environmental practice; it's also a great way to help grow our economy. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this resolution is simply not just a remind of the virtue of a good stewardship. It's also a charge to every one of us that taking time to recycle does indeed make a difference for the world. And I would urge that my colleagues support this resolution encouraging every American to participate in promoting the social, environmental, and economic benefits of recycling and buying recycled-content products.

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I want to take particular time to thank Mr. Markey, my good friend, Mr. Dingell, as well as Mr. Gordon, the bill's sponsor, as well as Mr. Shimkus and Ms. Eshoo for their really outstanding leadership on this issue. 
   This is a good bill. All of us here know stories, many of us can relate personally to stories, using 911. This goes a bit further when we talk about E-911. 
   There is a recent news story that highlighted the importance of this service. A mother in Washington State was playing with her 2-year-old daughter, Alana, one night when suddenly a migraine hit her. She collapsed, she took a few painkillers, she felt dizzy, collapsed to the floor, and yet the 2-year-old daughter, Alana, watching her mom collapse, walked over to the coffee table, picked up the phone, and dialed 911. 
   While she was on the phone, all she said was ``mommy, ouch.'' Those two words alone were enough to send the paramedics to their home. Inside they found the mom on the floor and the daughter in the other room getting a blanket for her mom who was shivering. Thankfully, she was released the very next day. But without that technology, who knows how the situation, or many others like it, would end up. 
   Our 911 system continues to evolve. We've made a lot of progress on enhanced 911 deployment, but E-911 can provide the actual phone number and location of a caller, which can be essential in reaching people who need the  help, especially if they're having trouble communicating. 
   The FCC helped move the ball forward in June of 2005 by requiring that VoIP providers offer 911 services to their customers. And while technologically it is more complicated for VoIP providers to provide the service, it certainly is of equal importance. 
   We've all heard the horror stories in the past of people trying unsuccessfully to use 911 from their homes or mobile phones, and I'm hopeful that with the leaps taken so far, along with this legislation, all consumers, regardless of the phone service or their location, will be better served in an emergency. 
   This bill, H.R. 3403, the 911 Modernization and Public Safety Act of 2007, is certainly a significant public safety bill. I would urge my colleagues to vote for it. And, again, I want to thank the bipartisan cooperation that we've seen every step along the way, not only in this body, but in the Senate as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   I want to again thank Chairman Dingell and Mr. Barton, the ranking member of the committee. I remember 2 weeks ago when we moved this through our committee, it was a very important piece of legislation. Ms. Bean is the author of this. I know Mary Bono on our side helped immensely in getting it through the subcommittee. We all rise in support of H.R. 3461, Safeguarding America's Families by Enhancing and Reorganizing New and Efficient Technologies Act of 2007. 
   This bill directs the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, to carry out a nationwide public awareness campaign about Internet safety, provides a 1-year authorization of $5 million to carry out that campaign, and directs the FTC to report annually to the Congress on its activities to promote Internet safety. I look forward to those reports as the ranking member of the Telecommunications and Internet Subcommittee. 
   The FTC has been very active in the area, and its current computer security education campaign is built around an innovative multimedia Web site, www.OnguardOnline.gov, with special tips and features for children, teens and their parents. H.R. 3461 expands these underway. Moreover, the Internet defines Internet safety to include threats to juveniles, including cyber predators and material that is inappropriate for minors, criminal activity beyond the FTC's authority and scope. And to fulfill that directive, the FTC would then partner with the FBI and the U.S. Postal Service and with prominent nongovernmental organizations such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
   Mr. Speaker, I visit a school almost every week, actually more than once a week, and often when I speak to an elementary school, I will ask those third or fourth graders, ``How many of you have seen something inappropriate on the Internet?'' It didn't used to be. It used to be that my question was, ``How many of you have a computer at home?'' Now practically everyone has a computer at home. But now when I ask that question, ``Have you seen something inappropriate?'' every hand goes up, including mine. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hosted an event in our district two Mondays ago on Internet safety in our intermediate school district in Berrien County, was attended by hundreds of people. We had votes that night so I couldn't be there. But it is a concern. Parents have to know what is going on. And that is why this new Web site, OnGuardOnline.gov is very important so that the word can get out, because the Internet is a double-edged sword. Yes, it helps our lives in so many different ways, but we have to look out for the nightmare that could come into that home from someone who we would not want in as a decent parent. 
   So this is good legislation. It is going to have a positive impact. There is a reason that it passed by unanimous vote among Republicans and Democrats. I hope that the Senate can move along quickly. We will be willing to give them a kick if they don't do that. 
   I don't have any other speakers requesting time, and I yield back my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mrs. Capps. And I also want to thank Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton, and others who have had a real hand in moving this legislation before us. 
   I rise today in support of this resolution, a resolution recognizing the impact of lung cancer and the recent recommendations of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute. This group's process is a comprehensive, collaborative, integrated approach to control and eliminate lung cancer. The group was tasked with making recommendations, strategizing, and reporting on progress made in an effort to control and eliminate lung cancer.     
   The group was able to identify scientific priorities and needs and set forth a national agenda for research on lung cancer. 
   This Progress Review Group made the recommendation to foster the creation of scientifically integrated multi-institutional research consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer rather than around specific research disciplines. The recommendation speaks to the ongoing work at the NIH as well as in the private sector for cross-cutting research. And as a Congress, it is our responsibility to endow these researchers to best pursue answers. This report clarifies the benefits of broad science. Putting disease research into silos so that, as so many authorizing bills often do, is not always helpful to the greater goal. Let's take these recommendations to pursue a multilevel, multidisciplinary science in an effort to find a cure for lung cancer or thousands of other diseases that afflict the world. Reducing the mortality rate of lung cancer is an objective to which we all can subscribe. It is our responsibility to make sure that the scientists have the tools and the access necessary to pursue a cure. 
   So many of us here have been with someone at a bedside that is suffering from this awful disease, one of the worst. It is a great step forward that we can pass this legislation, to see the research come about, the funding with it, so that some day in fact we will have a cure to prevent this tragedy in families across the globe.

   Mr. UPTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and want to commend all those that were instrumental in getting its passage to the floor, particularly my good friend, Judy Biggert from Illinois. 
   We have made some wonderful advances in health care research over the number of years. I can remember helping to lead the charge with my colleague, Mr. Waxman, on a bipartisan bill to double the money for the National Institutes of Health back in the nineties, and we had a similar effort in the Senate between John McCain, the Republican leader there of that same issue, and Paul Wellstone, a dear colleague who is no longer with us. But, together we passed that bipartisan legislation. And with those advances, of course we have to look at other things that are pertinent, too, and that is why this Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act is so important. 
   I remember traveling to the University of Michigan and meeting with one of the researchers there that in fact had received an NIH grant; and he just weeks before, because of that grant, had identified the breast cancer gene that strikes one in eight women across America. He was excited. And it wouldn't have happened without that NIH money; but with that discovery, it is clear that we have to in fact protect that genetic information from being discriminated against by who knows who. 
   And I would say that, thanks to my colleagues, Mr. Deal, the ranking member on the Health Subcommittee who is in a hearing right now, and Joe  Barton, the ranking member, that we have all made advances and worked closely with Chairman Dingell to mitigate what we believed were some significant problems with the legislation as it was introduced. 
   Among other items, we wanted to make sure that any use of information by certain entities regulated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act not also be regulated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under title II of the bill. Such dual regulation of the use of information would have been highly disruptive and certainly inappropriate. 
   We also made numerous clarifications to make sure that the new regulatory scheme did not disrupt reasonable and needed activities by health plans to improve health care, coordinate benefits, process benefits, or educate beneficiaries. It is important for the Congress to be mindful that we are not writing on a blank slate each and every time that we launch one of these new regulatory and liability schemes. And I certainly join many here that are satisfied that these important improvements made by the Committee on Energy and Commerce are preserved in the bill. I want to commend the bipartisan and bicameral discussions that led to this compromise, and I would urge that we all support it when a roll call vote comes. 
   At this point, I would yield the balance of our time that our committee controls to my friend from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert).

<DOCNO>Mr. UPTON. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, by the year 2030, our country is going to need between 40 and 50 percent more energy, and that means we need more nuclear, we need more clean coal, we need more renewable, we need better technology, carbon sequestration and, yes, we do need tax incentives for wind and solar, there is no question about that. 
   But raising taxes on the oil and gas industry is not the answer. My State of Michigan in answer to our budget woes, in fact, did raise taxes. And a couple of things are happening: people are leaving and so are businesses. 
   Many of us in this body have been complaining for years that we didn't have new refineries being built and established in this country. We passed the 2005 act and we have seen some changes. What's going to happen if we take those incentives away? We are not going to see new refinery capability again come back to this country. 
   We need to have incentives in place to help our oil and gas industry. And to take those incentives away, well, they are going to leave. Frankly, I view that as a national security issue. 
   Countries overseas would love this bill to pass. Countries like India, they can hardly wait for us to raise taxes here so that they will have a better advantage as they build new refineries to send their refined oil to this country. 
   In fact, right now, 10 percent of the gasoline that comes to this country comes from refineries overseas. That wasn't always the case, but it is today. 
   So what's going to happen if we raise the taxes? Two things: number one, we will have further incentives to have those companies leave and costs are going to be passed on to the consumer. With gas prices, at least in my district, already averaging about $3.30 a gallon and reports that they are going to go to $4, what's going to happen then? Those costs are going to be passed along. Does anyone really think that this is going to help?  
   Now most of our renewable sources, wind, hydro, solar, those facilities are, frankly, where there are not often a lot of energy needs. They are not in our big cities. They are not in our suburbs. 
   I don't know if you can remember, but this last summer, we had a vote that, in fact, was somewhat regional in nature, but it took away, it took a stand on a new transmission line that impacted folks here in the Northeast. I viewed it as a test vote as to whether additional renewables, services, that we do want, would we have the transmission line to actually send that energy to our cities and to our suburbs. 
   I don't know if you saw yesterday's USA Today, but ``Lines Lacking to Transmit Wind Energy,'' we don't have the sources in it. It takes 5 to 10 years to build these transmission lines, and yet it only takes about 18 months to build the wind and other different devices that we have. But if you don't have the transmission, we can't get that energy to our folks that need it the best. 
   I'll bet that just about all those that voted to deny that transmission line last summer will be voting for this bill. You can't have it both ways. Let's have a serious discussion that's bipartisan to address the country's energy needs.

<DOCNO>Mr. UPTON. (DEXTROMETHORPHAN DISTRIBUTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I also want to compliment our fine Reading Clerk for getting the pronunciation of dextromethorphan correct. I know she has been practicing for days, as many of us have. 
   But I too rise in strong support of this bill, H.R. 970, the Dextromethorphan Distribution Act, I am going to call it DXM, of 2007, legislation that I introduced with my friend and colleague Mr. Rick Larsen of Washington. He has been absolutely a champion as we have worked this issue on both sides of the aisle to restrict the distribution of this product to entities registered with the FDA. 
   I want to thank the House leadership for scheduling this bill; I want to thank my friend and chairman, Mr. Dingell of our committee, as well as Mr. Barton, the ranking member, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee for allowing this bill in fact to come to the floor, not only in this session but in the last session of Congress as well. When we did pass it on the House floor, I think it was actually one of the last bills that was passed in the 109th Congress in the House, but the Senate failed us at the end. We are hoping that by passing it at this point the Senate, in fact, will move together. 
   I also want to thank my staff, particularly Jane Williams, who has sat in countless meetings as we have worked and finessed this legislation, not only the industry folks here, but obviously with House and Senate leaders on both sides of the Capitol. 
   This drug normally is a safe and effective nonnarcotic cough suppressant that is used in many over-the-counter cough and cold medicines. While medicines containing DXM are used safely and effectively by millions of Americans every year, taken in extremely large quantities this drug produces a high that can cause brain damage, seizure, and obviously death. 
   Studies have shown that teenagers are obtaining unfinished DXM on the Internet to get high by consuming  large amounts or mixing it with alcohol. And already there have been too many deaths linked to the abuse of pure DXM. According to the DEA, abuse among adolescents is increasing. Abuse of DXM has been found in several forms, but has been increasingly found in an encapsulated powder form which is now being sold over the Internet. Currently, there are no restrictions, none, on the restriction of raw bulk dextromethorphan, and this bill would help to ensure that DXM is used only for legitimate purposes and stays out of the hands of drug dealers and adolescents. FDA would have the authority to seize bulk dextromethorphan if found in the possession of anyone not authorized to have it, and those measures would cut off the supply chain of unfinished DXM to those purchasing it on the Internet to get high or to sell it as a street drug. 
   This bill has been endorsed by the American Pharmacists Association, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the Food Marketing Institute, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores and Partnership for a Drug-Free America. 
   As the parent of two teenagers, I am certainly alarmed by the number of teens who are abusing cough syrup and pure DXM to get a high. They are under the false impression that getting high off this drug is harmless because it is an ingredient in cough syrup. Nothing can be further from the truth. Our kids are playing a game of Russian roulette every time they get high off this drug, and sooner or later someone will die, as they have already. Enough is enough. 
   This commonsense bipartisan piece of legislation will certainly put an end to the bulk sale of DXM on the Internet and will keep our kids safe from the dangers of this type of drug abuse. I hope that all of our colleagues can support this even on a voice vote, and I hope and pray that the Senate will take action as soon as they can so that we can get this bill to the President's desk where I expect him to sign it.

<DOCNO>Mr. UPTON. (INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. I thank the gentleman for allowing me to have a little bit of time this morning to talk about a very important issue. 
   Madam Speaker, I am one of those Members of Congress who actually reads and signs all of his legislative mail from their district. I can remember not too long ago there was a write-in campaign to every congressional office complaining about a bill that Congressman Snell had introduced that was going to tax the Internet, every single piece of transaction that one might have on the Internet. Of course, as we know as we look at this board, and I have served in this Congress, I like to say not long enough, but I have never served with a Congressman Snell in the 21 years that Mr. Smith and I have served here together. 
   I went through it to find out when did Congressman Snell serve? There must have been a Congressman Snell. Well, there was. He served in the 64th Congress. Now, that was a long, long time ago, and I daresay it was before the Internet. It was before Al Gore invented the Internet, and it was before the Senate and the House discovered it as well. 
   But can you imagine taxing every different thing that one might do on the Internet? 
   I look at our own household here and back in Michigan. Often we come home, my wife and I, the first thing we do is we get on the Internet. We check what our daughters might be saying at college. Two nights ago I was doing some Internet surfing, and I got IMs from my daughter, probably about 20, 25. It was a wonderful experience that she and I had communicating. But can you imagine if there was a tax on every single IM message that came back and forth? 
   A lot of us do our banking on the Internet, check our different accounts. Can you imagine every single time you are going to get a tax on the Internet? For me, I am a sports nut, my Wolverines. I was at MGoBlue last night a couple of different times. When is the Michigan-Michigan State game going to be on this weekend? Can you imagine if you got taxed every time? I wanted to check if Michael Hart was going to play this Saturday. I checked a bunch of different Web sites. Can you  imagine if you got a tax every single time? That's just nuts. 
   Thank goodness we are extending the current moratorium that otherwise expires this week. Now, I am one that wanted to make it a permanent extension. I join with Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Smith and others as a cosponsor of legislation so that we don't have to do this every single year. We passed in the House a couple of weeks ago a bill that was unanimous, in fact, as I recall, that extended it for 4 years. 
   The Senate finally did something right; they actually extended it beyond 4 years. We are going to see an extension for 7 years. Even though it's not permanent, 7 years is better than nothing, and that's what we are doing today. 
   But as I think about all the different uses that we use on the Internet today, to think that we would tax every e-mail, every search of the Web, all those different things. As the former chairman of the Telecommunications Subcommittee, I know that this will stifle the growth of the Internet in a major, major way. 
   I would ask all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to support this extension. Let's get it to the President. I am sure that he will sign it, hopefully, before the week is out, so that we can no longer have the audacity to think that a Congressman Snell will come back and, in fact, perhaps introduce a piece of legislation that will, in fact, tax every Internet transaction. It would be disastrous. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.

<DOCNO>Mr. UPTON. (PROTECTING THE MEDICAID SAFETY NET ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5613 the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act, and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it. 
   Last week, my colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously approved H.R. 5613, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act. This bill places moratoria on seven regulations issued by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS. If allowed to go into effect as currently written, these regulations would seriously erode federal funding to the states for a range of Medicaid services, including rehabilitation and medical services for schoolchildren with disabilities, and would totally eliminate federal Medicaid matching funds for Graduate Medical Education at a time when my state is already in the grip of a growing physician shortage. 
   I am particularly concerned about the detrimental effect that these regulations would have on students and schools in my district and districts across the country. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, schools are required to provide medical and rehabilitation services that are necessary for children to enter and continue to attend school. If federal matching funds are reduced or eliminated, our schools will still be required pay for these services, meaning other vital services and programs would have to be significantly cut back or eliminated. 
   Another major concern of mine is the extent to which these regulations would reduce or eliminate federal matching payments for many of our community hospitals, seriously undermining access to care for poor and disabled women, children, and persons with disabilities. Our hospitals are already struggling under low Medicaid reimbursement rates and higher rates of uncompensated care as my State's economy has worsened. Like schools, hospitals are under a federal mandate--this one to examine and stabilize every patient who walks through their emergency room doors. These regulations could significantly increase hospitals' burden of uncompensated care. 
   I am also concerned about provisions in several of the regulations that could well undo the progress we have made over many years in enabling persons with mental and physical  disabilities to live independently and participate as fully as they are able in the workforce and the life of their communities rather than being confined to institutional settings. 
   Because of all these factors, I again encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. UPTON. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, time moves on, but before some of us begin pretending that we are legislating on a blank slate when it comes to 9/11, I am going to take this moment in my time to remind everyone of the good work that was indeed accomplished over the last 2 years. In fact, we are also standing on the shoulders of giants who, in the face of the tragic events of 9/11, actually took action to make this Nation a safer place. 
   Congress's first responders were both Republicans and Democrats, and some of them were here just last session writing laws to protect America. America's firefighters, police officers, ambulance crews, the ones who received $1 billion, ``B'' as in big, to help save American lives surely haven't forgotten about Congress's efforts, and neither should we. 
   The issue of our Nation's own security is too important to play politics with. And while some on the other side perhaps would prefer to give the impression that Congress has done little, nothing could be further from the truth. 
   I am proud of what was accomplished and what we can do more. Indeed, we succeeded in enacting within the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction a number of provisions improving public safety communications. For example, the digital television provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act cleared 24 megahertz of spectrum in every market in the Nation exclusively for use by its first responders. 
   The interoperable communications provisions provided in the Deficit Reduction Act did not merely authorize funding but made $1 billion in direct spending available for equipment to enable first responders to more effectively communicate with each other in times of disaster. 
   The Call Home Act accelerated to September 30 of this year the deadline for distribution of that $1 billion for interoperable communications. 
   The Warning, Alert and Response Network, WARN Act, created a framework through which wireless communication providers can transmit emergency alerts to the public on a national, regional or local basis and required that the Federal Communications Commission adopt technical standards for that alert system. 
   The national alert provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act made $156 million in direct spending available for use with the national alert system created under the WARN Act. 
   The E911 provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act made another $43 million in direct spending available to implement the Enhance 911 Act of 2004, which provides grants to upgrade existing 911 systems for advanced capabilities. 
   The Department of Homeland Security appropriations legislation created an Office of Emergency Communications within the Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight. That office is directed to develop a national emergency communication plan and to report on the communications capabilities and needs of emergency response providers and relevant government officials. 
   These are all critical items that we have already enacted into law over the last 2 years, better preparing our Nation to respond to natural or manmade disasters. 
   From my own leadership spot as chairman of the Telecommunications and Internet Subcommittee, I seized on one particular recommendation offered by the 9/11 Commission. I wanted to help our first responders, and I am proud of the work that we did on a very strong bipartisan basis. First of all, we provided a slice of the spectrum for the first responders, 24 megahertz, and we saw that with Katrina as well, that our first responders in New York couldn't get the signal to evacuate the building. We saw that our folks helping folks in Katrina couldn't communicate between  the Coast Guard helicopter and the sheriff boat down below. That is going to change because we are going to give some of the responders some of that spectrum. 
   Second, we know that the cost for this equipment is enormously high. We provided $1 billion in the Upton amendment, which I helped shepherd through our committee and through the conference, to provide the means for our first responders so that they could purchase the equipment. It was done. The President signed it into law. 
   As much as we would like to say that this could be effective today, January 8, 2007, we cannot do that. First of all, we have to get the spectrum. That means we have to retrieve it from those that are using it, in this case, the broadcasters. They have to make the transition from analog to digital. A lot of them have done that, but it is more than $1 million often for some of these stations. We also have to think about the consumers, the millions of Americans who do not have a digital TV set. They can't receive the signal unless they have got that converter box. They aren't made yet. We have a transition for that to happen. 
   At the end of the day, we set a date, a hard date, when that all would happen, February of 2009. There were many that took us on that didn't want a hard date. They wanted to extend forever and a day, perhaps. In fact, there were amendments offered to delay the date even further. I would like to say that, at least on our side of the aisle, we opposed every one of those amendments to extend the deadline, and thank goodness we were successful because that date is now set. We had to work and negotiate with the Senate, with ourselves, but it is now set. It is a good thing. 
   We have an unmistakable record of results. Let us work together and build on them. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to my colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the honorable gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), a very valuable member of our subcommittee as we helped shepherd this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. UPTON. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Well, I thank my good friend from my neighboring district. And I am pleased to join you tonight and my colleagues from Georgia here and Texas now as well. I'd like to just make a couple of points. 
   First of all, I'm not on your list of 93 that signed that discharge petition, but that's because the line was too long. I hope that I can be there tomorrow when we're on the floor for votes, because you have to do that, of course--as any student knows of this Chamber--you have to sign the discharge petition in the well of the House. And when I was available to do that, the line was way too long. So hopefully tomorrow I will put you over 100 and get closer to the 218. 
   I want to say just a couple of things that perhaps haven't been said yet and enter into a dialogue with my good friend, Dr. Gingrey. 
   First of all, when we talk about Alaska, I did support drilling in Alaska multiple times over the last couple of years. It was adopted, actually, in the House and in the Senate with some bipartisan votes, and sadly, President Clinton vetoed that bill 10 years ago saying it's 10 years away. Well, here we are today. 
   We had a couple of very good provisions in that bill that were important; that all of the oil drilled in Alaska had to stay in the United States. It couldn't go to China, couldn't go to Korea or Japan, it had to come here. Of course that meant we would have to have the refining capability to do it as well. We also made it so that we limited it to no more than a couple thousand acres. And as the gentleman from Georgia indicated, that's about the size--for me, it's the size of Western Michigan University, not Dulles Airport--in an area that's the size of the State of South Carolina. So that's pretty small. 
   And of course what we know, too, is that if that oil can be drilled successfully, we can just build that tangent a little bit to the spine--you know, those of us from Michigan, you put your hand up like this. I can't quite do that with Alaska. But if this was Alaska, you only have to drill that pipeline to the spine, and then it comes down, and it's economical to do that. So that's number one. 
   Number two, you know, right now President Bush and other world leaders are talking to a number of the nations in Arab lands talking about what they can do to increase production. Because we all believe in supply and demand. And as the demand continues to rise, because the supply has stayed relatively stable, the price has only gone up over $4 in my district and yours, and now across the country. 
   Well, how can we ask the Arabs to increase their production and we won't do it ourselves? We've said no to Alaska. We've said no to the offshore drilling off our west and east coasts and even parts of the Gulf of Mexico. Eighty-five percent of our coastline is off limits, and yet we know oil is there. 
   Let's look at different alternatives. One of the alternatives, of course, is the development of oil shale out west, where it's anticipated that there could be as much as 1.5 trillion barrels; don't quite have the procedures down right, it's a couple years away, but you've got to begin that process, to begin the permit process. Much of it is on Federal land. No, I'm not talking about Yellowstone Park and our national parks, but in BLM land. And yet, on a vote that we had in this House last summer, by six votes we failed to allow the Department of the Interior to allow the first permits to be approved to allow the private sector to go out and explore for this oil shale--which we could develop, I would like to think, within a couple years, four to six, something along that line. But, in fact, a trillion and a half barrels are available. 
   We have to do more on conservation. I was one, coming from Michigan, a tough vote was increasing CAFE. You know that. We have to have the R&D, the research and development to help our auto companies develop the technologies that we, the consumers, want. And Joe Knollenberg from our State has a great bill that does that that he unveiled just a couple weeks ago. 
   We have to do more on conservation, and a number of different steps that I know can be taken along that front. 
   But the bottom line is this: If we want the price to come down, we have to increase the supply. That means we have to get away from where we're drilling today. We have to look at new sites, new techniques, and in fact we can do something, I think, about that $4 plus gasoline that all of us are pained to pay. 
   And if I could, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Georgia to talk a little bit about an issue that I know a little something about as well, and that is Section 526 up in Canada.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Well the gentleman is exactly correct. And let me just say one quick thing. When you look at oil shale and you look at tar sands, it takes a little bit of energy to then derive that oil from those bodies, the shale, the tar or the sand. Basically you have to heat it up. And for tar sands, the Canadians are producing literally one million barrels a day up in Alberta. And they are going to make that whether we are the buyer or not. To use the analogy of the Clampetts, and maybe they still have that technique back in Oklahoma and Texas, I see some of my colleagues, and I'll be careful, but the Clampetts, they put that pipe down and the oil came up. And it didn't take any energy to get it out of the ground. 
   Well it is different today. That easy energy is gone for the most part. So we have to do a lot of things. We have to inject carbon to bring it up. But in essence in Canada they have to have the heat to separate the oil from the sand, and then you have to refine it. And that takes a little bit more energy than the Clampetts, just to use that analogy.

   Mr. UPTON. If the gentleman would yield just briefly. The Canadians have said that they are going to increase production up in Alberta. They want to go to four to five million barrels a day. And they have the buyers. Let's face it. Wouldn't we rather have that pipeline come down to the Midwest and have us refine it here and be able to sell a cheaper product to Americans than have it come from overseas some place else? And if we're not going to buy it from them, and the Canadians told me this, they are going to build a pipeline out to the Pacific. They are going to put it on one of those big freighters. They're going to spend a lot of carbon going up into the air shipping it to someplace else, China, Korea, Japan or some place else. Let's have it come here. We'll actually save energy. We will help pollution wise in terms of reducing greenhouse gases from where it otherwise would have gone. And our consumers will be a lot better off. 
   And with that, I yield now to the gentleman from Georgia.

   Mr. UPTON. Well, there have been different studies showing different things in terms of what to count. One of the bills that I have cosponsored, it is actually a bipartisan bill, is to look at increasing ethanol from nonfood source, or noncorn, and there are a couple of bills to do that using switch grass and a number of different things. We are not quite there in the technology, but we are not too far away, within a couple of years. And I think we ought to be investing more on that type of technology so that we can take some of the pressure off these rising food prices. I represent Kellogg's as well, as does the gentleman in the well, Mr. Walberg.

   Mr. UPTON. Now that the price of oil has gotten up to $135 a barrel, there is a lot of things that 1 month ago weren't economical to do. And that is why by putting more alternative fuels in the mix, we can have some downward pressure on the overall price of gasoline. And obviously ethanol is part of that mix, whether it be corn-based or nonfood items, and we need to explore those and see what we can do to put downward pressure on the overall price of gasoline.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. I thank my friend, Mr. Ryan. 
   You know, gas prices yesterday in Kalamazoo, Michigan hit $3.99 a gallon. You know, I can remember when our imports from other countries for oil and gas crossed the 50 percent threshold. And then it was 60 percent. In a few years, it's going to be 88 percent of the oil that we consume is going to come from overseas. Sadly, I report that this country is woefully unprepared for the future for a country that's going to need 50 percent more energy by the year 2030. 
   Now, we've done some things on conservation. We've done some CAFE standards, but that's not overnight, it's going to take a number of years. We've done some things on building standards and appliance standards, lighting. Those things kick in a few years from now. But you know what? I think all of us here, based on last night's vote, believe in the theory of supply and demand. 
   Worldwide, the demand is going up dramatically. China and India, 10, 15 percent annual growth rates. Our demand has actually declined because of the price by about a percent over the last year, but the supply has stayed the same. Yes, you can talk about more wells drilled, but the old existing wells aren't producing the oil that they used to. From the nineties to now, Alaskan oil has declined by 50 percent. And yet Bill Clinton, when he vetoed the ANWR bill 10 years ago, said, that's 10 years off, we don't need that now. Well, guess what? Ten years later, we need that oil. We need greater supply. 
   Last night's vote, taking oil out of SPR, 60,000 barrels a day, a lot of us voted for it because that means that the supply is going to go up for consumers by 60,000 barrels a day. So we're onto that. That passed overwhelmingly here in the House. But whether it's Alaska, whether it's offshore drilling--I don't know how many of you here know that China is drilling off Cuba, 45 miles off the Florida coast. China is drilling off Florida, yet we can't do that. I think we have a limit of 100 miles. Eighty-five percent of our offshore drilling is off-bounds. We need to reverse that. 
   Last year in this House, we had a vote that prevailed by six votes that took land in our BLM lands, public lands out in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, it took it off so that we can't allow the permits to get oil shale. The oil shale reserves there are expected to exceed a trillion barrels. That's more than the Saudis. And we can't even allow the permitting for companies to go in and explore and perhaps increase the supply so that we can decrease the price with such a provision. I look forward to a revote on that same amendment perhaps this year. 
   The Canadians. I met with a Canadian Minister of Energy a couple of weeks ago, with a Canadian ambassador. They are now successfully extracting a million barrels a day from oil shale in Alberta. And because of a certain section that was in the energy bill offered successfully last year, we can't take that in this country. If you want to increase the supply so that the price can come down, we have to look at domestic resources, whether they be off our shores, whether they be in our own lands and we know that we can produce it safely, or in Alaska as well, ANWR. 
   We want the oil here. And we want to help have some decreasing pressure on that price that is costing consumers in lots of ways, not only their transportation, but food and all those different things. 
   So I would like to think that we can adopt this resolution, looking for more receipts for the domestic industry.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, 4 months ago, this Nation was not talking about a bailout. They weren't talking, say, about a bad economy, although it was certainly weak in Michigan, to say the least. We weren't talking about the loss of 525,000 jobs the month before. No, we were talking about energy and the need for an all-American energy plan. Part of that debate was to wean us off foreign oil and to develop the cars that, in fact, will do just that. 
   As I sat down with Ford and with Chrysler and with GM and saw their Volt and the other vehicles, we were excited. We were going to make a lot of progress to wean us off foreign energy,  but we could only do it if we got the money to retool. 
   Four months ago, in August, we, in fact, got the tip that the lenders weren't lending. No. They were coming in at 20 percent interest rates. That's what they were going to charge. We went to the administration. We went to the leadership on both sides of this Congress, and we said, if that happens, they'll never get the money; we'll never build these cars, and these companies will go bankrupt before the end of the year. 
   Sadly, we are here today on December 10, and that may exactly happen if we do not get a bill to the President's desk. It looks like our prediction from last August may be right on track, but if you thought 525,000 jobs lost last month was a problem, you wait until we get to 2 million to 3 million jobs when we lose those in a month or two if we don't get this bill done. 
   This isn't new money that we're asking for. It has already been directed. It has already been appropriated. What we ask is just redirection to help a domestic industry so that we can make these vehicles in America--that's right--made in America, not someplace else. 
   China, as my colleague SANDY LEVIN has indicated, has already approved $55 billion for the domestic auto manufacturing in China. Europe is doing the same thing.

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, we are in a recession now. We've been in one in Michigan for a long time. You can only imagine where we're going to go--into a deep recession for who knows how long if we don't get this money approved for the Big 3 so that we can build the cars that consumers want that will wean us off foreign oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. UPTON. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>

   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I have to believe that we all support ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries are getting the very best deal possible on their prescription drugs and that they want that, that they have access to drugs that their doctors believe will work best for them, and that they will continue to get their prescriptions filled at their local pharmacist. And in many rural communities, and in urban ones too in Michigan and across the country, the local pharmacist, in fact, is on the front line of health care. H.R. 4 doesn't get us there. 
   As many have mentioned and will mention today, the CBO estimates that having the government negotiate drug prices would, in fact, have a negligible effect on prescription drug prices. The current program which relies on the experience and expertise of the private sector drug plans and on strong market-based initiatives, incentives, is producing significant savings today for our seniors. 
   Here's a real example: one of my staffers reported that her mom signed up for a Medicare prescription drug plan. It took a bit of doing to sort through the many options available, but she is very glad that she did. She was paying before $106 for her Glucovance diabetes prescription. Now she is paying $5. She was paying $202 for Actos, another diabetes medication that she needs. She is now paying $30. And she was paying almost $29 for Coumadin. Now she is paying $5. 
   While failing to produce savings like these, many are concerned that H.R. 4, as currently written, would undermine access to medically necessary drugs for persons with HIV/AIDS, serious mental illnesses, ALS, epilepsy and other diseases and conditions. And let me quote from a letter I received this morning from the President of the Michigan Brain Injury Association: ``Let me exhort you to take the time to have adequate committee deliberations on H.R. 4 prior to its passage on behalf of our constituents and all persons with disabilities. Significant modifications are necessary to protect patients' access to prescription drugs as currently provided under Medicare part D.'' 
   Needless to say, we have not had a minute of committee negotiations since we were sworn in. 
   Finally, while the current program includes requirements that beneficiaries have ready access to prescriptions through their local pharmacies, real concerns have been raised that H.R. 4 could seriously undermine that local access. That is why we need to vote for the motion to recommit which addresses those concerns. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this: we do, everyone here does, want folks with Medicare to get all of the prescription drugs at the very best price. And I believe that consumer choice and the private sector competition can better drive lower cost and more availability than forcing the government to negotiate prices which may, indeed, lead to the withdrawal of drugs from the program alltogether. 
   As Secretary Leavitt wrote earlier this week: ``There is a proper role for government in setting standards and monitoring those who provide the benefit. But government should not be in the business of setting drug prices or controlling access to drugs.''

   Mr. UPTON. Madam Chairman, I must say, when I saw the whip notice this last week, I saw some good things and some bad things. One of the bad things that I didn't see was that we're not addressing what my constituents are talking about, and that is gas prices. 
   Yes, this is a good bill, beach nutrition. It has water monitoring there, Great Lakes are now part of it, and I want to thank particularly the Members from the Great Lakes area who  were able to include that, particularly my friend who represents the east side of Michigan, CANDICE MILLER, on that committee. 
   But as far as I know, this bill passed without dissent. Frankly, it could have been under suspension of the rules. I bet we would have passed it on a voice vote, two-thirds voting in favor of it. After the Flake amendment, maybe there are some that wish that it did come up under suspension so that they wouldn't deal with the Flake earmark amendment. We'll see. 
   But, you know, my constituents back home, they're complaining that we're doing things that aren't maybe on the top of their agenda. We're talking about steroids, we're talking about a whole number of things that don't impact the economy or, in fact, their pocketbook. They're talking about gas prices. 
   On Tuesday when I left to come back from Michigan, diesel prices were $4.11 a gallon. Gas prices, unleaded regular, $3.35 a gallon. I can hardly wait till I go back this week and see what they might have gone to. 
   What have we done on this? That is their question. What are we doing about supply and demand? 
   Well, I'll tell you some of the things we've done. We've raised taxes on them. Thank goodness we've got the Senate saying no so far because, of course, if you raise taxes on energy production here, those costs are just going to be passed along to the consumer and they'll go up even higher. Go talk to the French or the British and those folks. They tax gas a lot and they pay a lot more per gallon. 
   There's some things that we haven't done. I know some in this body have advocated for raising the gas tax by as much as 50 cents a gallon. We haven't done that. Maybe, certainly I believe that's a good thing. 
   But we've blocked using oil shale from Canada. You know, they've got a field up in the Northwest there that they think rivals the Saudis, that can actually heat up the sand and the oil comes out. They're actually taking 1 1/2 million gallons.

   Mr. UPTON. We need to do more. We are now, by 2012, our domestic needs, we're going to be only producing 12 percent of our gas here. That's got to change. 
   Madam Speaker, let's not go to the beach and leave our work undone. Let's pass this bill, but let's deal with the real issue that Americans feel in their pocketbooks literally every day that they go to the pump.

<TEXT>
   Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, last year the Congress, this Congress, authorized $25 billion to help the auto industry. But, as we know, an authorization is no good unless you appropriate the money. 
   The auto industry has to have access to that capital. This is not a bailout. It is a loan. It will be paid back, just like what happened with the Chrysler issue a couple of decades ago. And it impacts tens of thousands of workers across this country, certainly in the Midwest and around the balance of the country as well. 
   I appreciate the work of the leadership on both sides. They listened and they delivered. Our Michigan delegation, particularly with our leader, the Dean of the House, John Dingell, we worked together for weeks and weeks, many hours, and we used the strength of every Member, be it Republican or Democrat, to try and get the interests of the appropriators and the leadership to include it as part of this package, and they delivered. 
   We thank the administration, all of the Cabinet members. They understood the impact that would happen without the money being appropriated. 
   And we thank both candidates, Obama and McCain, for their support as well.
