<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my very reluctant opposition to the underlying bill. 
   Over the last 8 months, the Financial Services Committee has had several hearings on this important topic, including one that I attended in New York City. I thought these hearings were very productive and I am pleased that the Committee and this House are focused on an issue that is not only very important to the 5th district of New Jersey, but to our national economic well-being. 
   After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, terrorism risk insurance either became unavailable or extremely expensive and many businesses were no longer able to purchase insurance that would protect them in any future terrorist attack. Financially, terrorist threats pose a risk of serious harm not only to the insurance industry, but also to the real estate, transportation, construction, energy, and utility sectors. Even beyond the horrific human toll, terrorists could inflict real pain by melting our infrastructure and economy down. 
   Recognizing the detrimental effects an attack could have upon our economy, Congress acted quickly and responsibly to debate and pass the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, better known as TRIA. This temporary Act helped stabilize the terrorism insurance marketplace and restore capacity to that large part of the U.S. economy. 
   In 2005, Congress extended the TRIA program with some additional reforms and changes for 2 more years. I supported this extension because I felt that more time was needed to allow the private markets increase their capacity and develop new and creative ways to work out the problems that existed. 
   Since September 11, insurers and reinsurers have cautiously reentered the terrorism insurance market, allocating more capacity year-to-year. More commercial policyholders are becoming insured, year-to-year. At the same time, the federal role has scaled back correspondingly, with higher deductibles, higher co-pays, higher triggers, and fewer lines of insurance covered. I view this increased private-sector involvement and decreased government involvement, to be a positive development. 
   Unfortunately, the bill before us today sets these positive and natural developments back. Still more unfortunate is that though this is an issue that the Financial Services Committee has historically acted on in a bipartisan manner, the Chairman rebuffed in full and without, what I believe, proper consideration a number of very reasonable proposals that my colleagues on this side of the aisle offered--amendments that might have made this bill more palatable and perhaps staved off the Presidential veto threat now on the table. 
   My primary concern is the proposed length of duration of the government program. This bill would extend the life of this program by 15 years. A short-term, temporary extension allows for periodic reassessment of market conditions to see if there is more room for private sector participation. It allows for a gradual scaling-back of the government program going-forward as we observe how private insurers and reinsurers continue to expand the market. A short-term extension permits the natural evolution of the market to occur. 
   Given that the private sector continues to increase its capacity to cover terrorism risk insurance, I believe a short-term extension is more appropriate than creating a permanent government program. If we establish an essentially permanent program, the private sector will lose its incentive to look for innovative and newer solutions. 
   And realistically passing a 15-year extension is equivalent to passing an essentially permanent program. If we extend the program for too long of a time period, I fear we will not revisit this important topic and continue to try and make improvements like we did after the last time the program expired. As we all know, Congress rarely opens already passed legislation to make changes and improvements. We did not reopen the Transportation Bill, the Farm Bill and other long-term reauthorizations regardless of the problems that arose. And, we will not reopen this bill either. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, while I would support a temporary extension of this important program, I cannot support extending the program by 15 years, decreasing the amount of private sector participation, and loading an extra burden on the U.S. taxpayer. I ask my colleagues to vote against this legislation.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. You spoke about the flood bill and the problem we had here. Anytime we stifle debate, and that is what occurred when the Democrats did this, they alter substance. 
   What we were trying to do with an amendment that went through committee and we worked on with the chairman's staff, an amendment that the chairman said withdraw the amendment from committee and he will make sure that it gets through Rules and to the floor, our amendment simply said we should no longer have the rich and the wealthy who live in these great mansions on the coast and what have you, have them be subsidized by the poor widow in the house right across the street. We thought that was absurd. This amendment would have fixed that situation. The chairman was on board with us. He went to the committee and testified in favor of it as well.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. What happened was the Rules Committee decided to not allow the amendment to come to the floor. So at the end of the day, we have a bill where the rich are still being subsidized by the poor. Substance was altered by the stifling of debate.  
   I will commend the chairman of the committee for all he did and by not voting ``yes'' on the rule because even he, a Democrat chairman, saw the error of their ways in what they did.

Although we are in the minority here, this is not an issue for the minority; this is for half of America. And it doesn't matter whether the Americans watching tonight are Democrat or Republicans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentlewoman for the time. 
   Madam Chairman, I come to the floor optimistic inasmuch as I have heard, I think, where maybe five or six Members on the other side of the aisle raised the issue of exactly what transpired with regard to Bear Stearns and that circumstance some 2 months ago. I come optimistic but at the same time somewhat perplexed because, as I say, this did occur with regard to the Federal Reserve some 2 months ago, and immediately thereafter my office contacted the full body of our committee, both Republicans and Democrats, saying should not our committee be investigating what transpired there? And we extended a hand to the other side to say let's do two things: First, let's contact the Federal Reserve and Secretary Paulson to raise the issues that are now being raised at this belated date by the other side of the aisle. We came through at that time with a list of upwards of nine pertinent questions, questions such as, the SEC states that it monitored Bear Stearns' capital and liquidity positions on a regular basis and that levels of both capital and liquidity appeared adequate right up into the week of March 11, but given the subsequent rapid deterioration in Bear Stearns' financial condition, does the SEC have the capacity and authority it needs to assess these risks? Secondly, why wasn't the loan made in a traditional manner? If, as stated in President Geithner's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee that the Federal Reserve did not have the authority to acquire interest, what authority does it have now? 
   These were the questions that we were posing that should have been answered several months ago. We extended the opportunity to the other side at that time to join with us in this letter to make this investigation. Oddly enough, at that time no one on the other side of the aisle found a need to do so. 
   Also what is odd with regard to the investigation in this matter, the committee of jurisdiction looking into what the Federal Reserve did would be the Financial Services Committee. Once again, our side of the aisle suggested to the chairman that we should be delving into the issues that the other side is raising tonight, belatedly. We extended the opportunity to send a letter to Chairman Frank, with signatures of most Members on our side of the aisle to the chairman, saying should we not be looking at these issues, these nine issues that I just referenced before to the Federal Reserve and also Paulson? Should we not be looking into this in Financial Services? Two months ago no one from the other side of the aisle saw it as pertinent. Tonight, as we go into it here and from the rhetoric that comes to the floor, they all say that they are interested in examining what the Federal Reserve is doing. 
   That's why I say I come to the floor optimistic and a little bit happy because now I believe that when I leave the podium tonight, I can go to the other side of the aisle and I will be more than happy to do two things: To make an addendum to our questions to Secretary Paulson and the Federal Reserve and to make an addendum to Chairman Frank to say that in both cases we should be investigating it and that we would ask that Chairman Frank schedule hearings forthwith, immediately, so that we can go into the matters that you are raising and that I have raised as well to see what authority the Federal Reserve has to conduct these activities.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, actually at this time I'd just like to put into the Record the letter that was signed by Members from our side of the aisle to Chairman Frank back on April 7, which would have been a month ago now, requesting an expedited hearing with regard to the Financial Services situation with regard to the Federal Reserve and the Financial Services hearing. Also, I will put in the Record a letter dated April 16 to Secretary Paulson from the Department of Treasury and Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve as well, itemizing the nine particular questions with regard to their authority and activity; and also the letter in response dated April 14 from Chairman Barney Frank with regard to not setting forth a date for any hearing going forward.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I find it amazing and amusing that the chairman raises how many Republicans signed onto the two letters when, in fact, it evidences the fact that zero Democrats signed onto that letter and zero Democrats have done anything with regard to Bear Stearns for the last 2 months since this occurred. If there was even one Member from the other side of the aisle from the committee, when we invited the entire committee to sign onto it, I think the chairman would be in a stronger position, but he is not because none of them signed on then. And even earlier this evening, when I invited them to sign onto an addition to it, none of them have come across to sign onto it. 
   Secondly, I find it amusing when the chairman's response in the letter was that he has more confidence in Bernanke and the Fed than we do. So if your question is that we did not point out that there were problems with it, your response points out that--as I've said, I'm not quoting because I cannot get a copy of the letter back here--you had more confidence in the decisions and in the actions of the Fed and the administration. So if you had more confidence, maybe that explains why 2 months after the action we are still asking for the chairman to hold a hearing on the matter, and here it is, 2 months later, all we are getting is rhetoric from this side of the aisle.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   How many times do we have Members come before us on this floor with an amendment, and they begin their statement by saying, here I have a commonsense amendment to this piece of legislation. Well, in this case, I do believe I have a commonsense amendment to this legislation, and in fact most Members of this House I believe would agree with that statement as well. 
   Why I say that is because the language of this amendment is similar, or dare I say identical, to language that I have used in previous amendments on appropriation bills in past Congresses, and these amendments, quite fortunately, have passed pretty much by voice vote in those Congresses.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I appreciate that. For those who are watching, let me let them know what the amendment does. 
   What this amendment does, and I appreciate both gentlemen's accepting this, is to say our Federal agencies should use common sense when they go to international conferences. 
   In the past, there were extravagances. There were cases when over 100 individuals, government employees, would go to these conferences overseas, costing literally millions of taxpayers' dollars to do so. We are saying, let's rein that in a little bit. Let's put a number on that. Some people say this number is too high. This number puts it at 50. So any particular agency going overseas, Africa, Asia, wherever else, let's have them not send more than 50. Some of us would like it to be lower, but we will put it at 50 of their agency employees to that conference. I think just like any business or family, they would have to absolutely exercise priorities and common sense as well. We do so here. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank both gentlemen for accepting this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we are able to bring before the House today H. Con. Res. 71, commemorating the 85th anniversary of the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, AHEPA. 
   I am a proud original cosponsor of this resolution that honors an organization that spreads the universal truths of Hellenism--humanity, freedom, and democracy--across the United States and around the world. 
   AHEPA was founded to stand against the forces of bigotry and hate and to help Greek immigrants to become part of our Nation. The organization also helps young people achieve their dreams of education and supporting philanthropy and public service that helps the neediest in our society. 
   As a Member of Congress, I am proud to participate in the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Affairs. In this capacity, I work with fellow Members to enhance and strengthen the United States' relationship with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus. The friendship  between our nations has a long and rich history, and by continuing to further this important bond, we can stand together to advance the causes of liberty and democracy. 
   At this 85th anniversary we can reflect on AHEPA's past successes and upon the many ways in which Greek-Americans have enriched the fabric of our country. It is also a time to look forward with hope and anticipation to a future of continuing to build the vision that is AHEPA.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate the gentleman for hosting this special hour tonight and also very much importantly for all of your work all over the years on this very important issue. 
   And this issue really does strike at the heart of my constituents back in my great State of New Jersey whether it's from my home County of Sussex County, where over 60 percent of them have to commute out of the county every day by car, or Warren County or Bergen County where a host of so many commuters are being hard hit by this hard energy crisis that we're facing right now. 
   I join with my friend from Tennessee where--I don't come to the floor to blame anyone because the American public simply wants the Congress to come up with answers to the problems  that we are all facing back in our district. 
   And I think really when you get right down to it, it's not that complicated in one sense to take a look at the various policies or ideas out there. It's easy, I think, one way to tell whether a good--whether a policy is a good energy policy or not. All you have to do is look at three things: supplies, cost, and security. 
   A good energy policy is a policy that will do what? It will give you more energy. More supply. A bad energy policy will give us less supply. A good energy policy is one that will lower costs for Americans. A bad energy policy is one that is going to continue to raise or escalate costs, meaning that American families are going to have to have less money for their food, housing, education, and so on. And thirdly and finally, a good energy policy is one that will make us a stronger, more secure America. A bad energy policy is going to be one that makes us less secure, less independent of foreign, unstable regimes like Venezuela and overseas and Saudi Arabia and places like Russia and the like. 
   So why don't we take a minute to see what has, quite honestly, the other side of the aisle proposed for us. I have in my hand right here, the Democrat plan to lower gas prices. You may recall that when Democrats were campaigning for the 110th Congress, they said that they had a commonsense solution to lower the price of gasoline and energy for the American public. And we are now 18 months, I think, into the 110th Congress. And, well, there is absolutely nothing in the Democrat's plan. 
   Their commonsense solution, and that's why we're so eagerly awaiting it, and that's why we, on this side of the aisle, come to the floor every night to hammer home the point that something must be done. But we can look to see what has occurred over the last 17 months, 18 months of the 110th Congress now that the Democrats have been in charge of dealing with energy. On these three points: on supply, on cost, on security. 
   On supply. As I stand here tonight, as was already indicated from the gentleman from Pennsylvania, 85 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf where our energy supply comes from, natural gas principally, but oil as well, it's basically locked up off limits to us for further exploration even determining what is actually out there. There was legislation to do that just to say what's out there. Let's find out the information. Off limits to us. 
   Deep sea exploration. Over 100 or 200--200 miles off sea totally off limits right now. Eighty-six billion barrels of oil, 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas could be at our disposal to give us greater supply, but it's not. 
   Oil shales In the Midwestern part of this country. 
   Oil shales were reported in the paper just today as it was going through committee and will be coming to the floor later on, proposals to keep that off-limits as far as greater supply for the country. 
   Let me give you some quick little number here. U.S. has two trillion, that's with a ``T,'' two trillion barrels of oil that effectively are involved here. And to put that in perspective, from 1859 from the first days that oil was pulled out of the ground to today, one trillion barrels of oil has been used. And we have basically two trillion barrels over there that we could basically be getting in economically viable ways. 
   Supply has not been addressed, unfortunately, during the 110th Congress by the Democrats. 
   Costs. Well, when they were campaigning for office, I know in my district you could buy gasoline for $1.80. Now, of course, it's up to $4, doubling the price, and that's hurting the American family. 
   What else has occurred during these last 17 months? Four times legislation has come through this House that would raise taxes on energy costs. And who actually pays those taxes at the end of the day? You and I do at the pump or any other ways where we buy our energy. 
   And finally, there are still proposals, believe it or not, from the other side of the aisle that want to put more taxes on us like 50 cents-a-gallon gasoline taxes has been proposed by Chairman Dingell. So the next time you go to the pump and you're paying around $4 bucks per a gallon of oil, just remember the other side wants to add another 50 cents; and there is another proposal for a nickel as well by Chairman Oberstar. So 55 cents more if they have their way in taxes. 
   Finally on security. Well, right now this country imports around 63 percent or is dependent upon foreign oil. Places like Saudi Arabia, places like Venezuela, places like Nigeria where they have so many problems, Down south in South America as well; and that number continues to grow for the reasons I have just stated. 
   Gasoline. We have not built refineries in this country so now we are like many countries across the globe. We have to import gasoline, 10 percent of our consumption of gasoline is coming into this country, which makes us a less secure Nation because we do not have our own supply of refineries right here at home. 
   Let me move off of what we're doing here on the floor to an outside source to look at this. And the Investors Business Daily has taken a look at this issue. And what they said is this. They said just going back a couple of years, under the eight Clinton years alone, U.S. oil production declined 1.3 million barrels per day, or 19 percent, while our foreign imports increased 3.5 million barrels a day, or 45 percent. 
   During President Clinton's time, he vetoed legislation that would have increased legislation that would have increased production of our own vitally needed oil supply, not only for Americans but for our national defense emergencies as well. 
   The article goes on to say--it poses this question. So were the Democrats and Members of Congress together merely short-sighted with only a few having any real business experience, or were they just ignorant about economics, the fact that the law of supply and demand determines the price of oil commodities such as oil, steel, copper, and lumber? Or were they utterly irresponsible and incompetent in their actions that led us to become dangerously dependent on increasing oil imports from foreign companies? We think, it says, we think it was all of the above. 
   The unintended consequences of the Congress Members' poor judgment and meddling micromanagement of U.S. energy policy is that they actually hurt most of the people that they profess to help: the average American consumer, lower-income workers, and those in the inner cities who can't afford an extra $100 a month to drive to and from work. 
   So that, ladies and gentlemen, is the dilemma we face here in the 110th Congress on a proposal, on plans that do not address supplies, costs, and energy. And that is why I so commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania for the solutions that he's offered over the years as well and his legislation that goes to the issue of supply to increase the amount of energy that the American consumer can attain, to lower the cost of energy for the American family so that they have more disposable income for other needs, and to increase national security to strengthen America to make us more independent of these volatile countries. 
   And with that, I thank the gentleman.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, today we honor an ally who is standing with us in the Global War on Terrorism. An ally who knows what it is like to fight for peace and freedom, South Korea. Just over 50 years ago, Korea was the most violent spot on the planet as the North Korean government, backed by the Soviets and Chinese, swooped in to destroy the fledgling democracy in the south. 
   I am a proud cosponsor of this resolution which recognizes the significant contributions that the South Korean military has made in Afghanistan and in Iraq. Our South Korean allies maintain the third largest contingent of personnel in Iraq, where they are helping each day to rebuild that nation and spread the freedom they too earned with blood, sweat, and grit. 
   While as many as 3,600 personnel have at some time served, currently 2,300 work in the country to provide medical services, build and repair roads, power lines, schools, and other public works. 
   The Republic of Korea has contributed both men and money to rebuilding Iraq because they know how difficult it is to rise from the ashes of war. Since the end of the Korean War, the people of South Korea have built one of the world's most modern and dynamic economies. 
   We hope that the Iraqi and Afghani people can look to the South Korean model to develop into a peaceful and prosperous nation. We thank the Republic of Korea and the Korean people for their sacrifice and their stand for freedom.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (COMMENTS ON THE CONSTITUTION -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah. 
   Of course, it is humbling to follow after such a gentleman who is learned in these things and also previous to coming to Congress a teacher of such topics of our history and of our Constitution. So I will try, while I will never live up to his standards, but try to emulate him as best I can. When I conclude, I guess I should end by say saying ``Goodnight, Rob.'' 
   When we looked at those expressions, we remember the words of talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, who often does say the expression ``words mean something.'' He is usually expressing it about one of his callers who has just called in and talked about a particular topic or what have you, and he will take a little slight angle on it and say, well, those words mean something that are being said there. 
   So too it is with our Constitution, the fundamental document, the Founding Father document of this Nation. It is unique in a sense and it was recognized at that time. Back in 1803, Thomas Jefferson stated, ``Our peculiar security in this Nation is in the possession of a written Constitution. Let us not make it a blank paper by construction.'' 
   How prescient Jefferson was to see how future generations of this country possibly would and have and courts have as well taken that document; taken its plain meaning, and manipulated it to whatever the understanding of those words currently mean, as opposed to getting an understanding of what the founding document writers intended at the time. 
   James Wilson, writing in the Study of Law in 1790, said, ``The first and governing maxim in the interpretation of a statute,'' or in this case the Constitution, ``is discover those meanings of those words by those who made it.'' 
   So when we come to the floor today, or any day, to take a look at our Constitution, we must have an understanding of those terms as those meanings of the words had when the Founders first wrote them. 
   The gentleman from Utah just went to the point as far as the fact the Preamble goes to the issue of a limiting basis. I would just suggest, and I believe he made one reference to this, that despite the fact that today certain people look to the actual words of the preamble as giving us certain rights or powers now, Gouverneur Morris, the delegate from Pennsylvania at the time, added the preamble, I won't use the word as an afterthought, but certainly after the rest of the Constitution was written down. And specifically preambles at that time in any legal document that were written, were understood to say that they did not have a substantive legal basis or meaning to them.     
   That is to say a Preamble did not grant nor did it limit powers. 
   So today, when people come and look at the Constitution and say there is the general welfare clause in the Preamble, they should have an understanding that that was not an intention of the drafters of the document, to expand the powers of the Federal Government. 
   This can be understood if you look to how those who wrote it and lived at that time understood the document. Anybody who has an understanding of the life and times of Alexander Hamilton understood that there was a brilliant mind, a confidant of George Washington. At the beginning of the revolution, he became an aide in battle, and later when George Washington became our first President, Hamilton was there as the Treasury Secretary and one of the most powerful men in government at the time second to the President himself, more powerful than the Vice President and the Cabinet members at the time, someone who had an array of employees under his control inasmuch as the Treasury was dealing with the collection of excise taxes and the like. He had people under his control throughout the entire country. 
   He understood in order for this country to be great, and he wanted this country to be great, just as the mighty powers of Europe had been at that time, he had envisions that this country could expand and grow through different aspects of building bridges and roads and building canals. But even Hamilton understood that if he was to try to go down this road, that the powers that were granted to the Federal Government at the time were limiting on him. Even Hamilton suggested that a constitutional amendment would have been necessary for them to do  some of the things that Hamilton thought necessary at the time. 
   So in 1790, Alexander Hamilton said an amendment to the Constitution is necessary in order to make the improvements to the country that are needed for a flourishing democracy. Of course, that amendment never occurred, and therefore the country and following Presidents never had the authority to do many of the things. 
   Mr. Bishop will probably cite some of examples of some of the constructions that they were intending to do, and Presidents such as Madison and others vetoed those initiatives. 
   How all of this is relevant to us today, as someone who may be listening to our debate or discussion right now, this past week the House of Representatives began the debate and now passage of several appropriations bills. We will be coming back in the weeks to come on the consideration and eventual passage of other appropriation bills. Likewise this past week, or the week before last, I should say, this House had a considerable debate on the issue of earmarks. 
   Just an aside on the whole issue of earmarks. The debate on that topic goes to whether or not the Congress has the authority, and no one really questions this, but the authority to make, the issues of spending money on particular projects, and I don't think anybody debates that too much. The debate we have had on that topic is the transparency issue and whether or not Members of Congress and the American public are able to see exactly what individual Members are requesting that the American tax dollars go to. That is an appropriate debate and one which I supported, and I supported openness and transparency and to shine the light of day on what we do here. 
   But that really begs the question as to where American tax dollars go at the end of the day. Earmarks are just a very small fraction of the overall government spending. Sometimes we hear of egregious examples, the proverbial ``bridge to nowhere'' and the Cowgirl Hall of Fame and the like. These things are targeted in an appropriation bill, either on the House floor or in the Senate or in conference. People are outraged both here in the House and at home as well when these things are added to the budget. 
   But we must understand that such spending does not occur simply through earmarks, it occurs in the underlying bills as well. And it occurs also by the executive office and the administration as well. 
   So the fundamental question that we must be asking is whether it is a particular earmark, whether it is for a bridge to nowhere or a Cowgirl Hall of Fame or a museum someplace that we tag onto a bill here in the House or the Senate; or whether it can be exactly the same type of project that the administration puts into the spending pattern through their agencies and departments, or whether it is the same type of spending in the underlying bill. The larger question is, and this is a question that every Member of Congress should always consider every time they reach into their wallet or their pocket, wherever they keep it, and they pull out their voting card and they put it into the little device to vote ``yes'' or ``no,'' does Congress, does the Federal Government have the authority to spend those dollars on those purposes? 
   The argument is, and this is where the gentleman from Utah was leading to in the Preamble, which is also referenced in article I, section 8 of the Constitution, is the general spending clause. 
   So all the adherents of those who support the earmarks and support the spending on these particular topics will either look to the Preamble or article I, section 8, the general spending clause of the Constitution, which says for the general welfare of this country. 
   Well, as the learned gentleman from Utah would say, we have to have an understanding what the ``general welfare'' of this country was intended by the Framers when they penned that document. 
   Today we would take that to mean anything that the House of Representatives can think of that would be an improvement for this Nation. That broad and general, expansive meaning, interpretation of the language is not what the Framers intended. What they intended was the opposite. They intended it as a limitating factor on spending. 
   The Founders intended the general welfare clause and the spending clause in the Constitution was limiting to the extent that Washington could not spend the American taxpayers' dollars on just a parochial interest for this one particular Member's district or for this one particular Member's town or for this county or what have you. Instead, it had to be generally good for the entire Nation. 
   There is a story that came out of a book that was written in 1884 which I would like to share about a former Member of Congress, the name of which most Americans know, used to be on Disney TV, but he was a real Member of Congress back in 1827-1831, and that was a Member of Congress by the name of David Crockett, more familiarly known as Davy Crockett. He was, I guess you would call him back then, a conservative Member of Congress. 
   He actually addressed in his writings after he served in Congress this issue of whether or not under the general welfare clause he, as a Member of Congress, had the authority to actually spend money on these parochial interests. Let me share that with you. 
   He stated: ``If Congress is not given such extensive powers, then who is?'' The answer lies in the 10th amendment. Of course, I am not the first person to suggest this; others have as well. 
   He writes about how one day in the House of Representatives, that would have been in 1827-1831, a bill was taken up appropriating money for the benefit of a widow of a distinguished naval officer. Several beautiful speeches were made in its support. The Speaker was just about to put the question to the floor of the House when Congressman Crockett rose. 
   ``Mr. Speaker,'' he said, ``I have as much respect for the memory of the deceased, and as much sympathy for the suffering of the living, if suffering there be, as any man in this House, but we must not permit our respect for the dead or sympathy for a part of the living to lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living. I will not go into an argument to prove that Congress has no power to appropriate money as an act of charity. Every Member on this floor knows it. We have the right, as individuals, to give away as much of our own money as we please in charity. But as a Member of Congress, we have no such right to appropriate a dollar of the public money. Some eloquent appeals have been made to us upon the ground that it is a debt due to the deceased. But, Mr. Speaker, the deceased lived long after the close of the war. He was in office to the day of his death, and I have never heard that government was in arrears to him. 
   ``Every man in this House knows it is not a debt. We cannot, without the grossest of corruption, appropriate this money as payment of a debt. We have not the semblance of authority to appropriate it as a charity either. So, Mr. Speaker, I have said we have the right to give as much money of our own as we please. But I am the poorest man on this floor, and yet I cannot vote for this bill, but I will give 1 week's pay to the object. And if every Member of the Congress will do the same, it will amount to more money than this bill.'' 
   At that point he took his seat, and no one replied. The bill was put upon for passage, and instead of passing unanimously, as no doubt it would but for his speech, it received only a few votes, and of course it failed. 
   Later, when asked by a friend why he had opposed the appropriation, he explained. Here is the crux of the story. 
   He told how several years earlier one evening he was standing on the steps of the Capitol with some other Members of Congress when their attention was attracted by a great light over the city of Georgetown. It was evidently a large fire. They jumped into a hack and drove over. The houses were burned, and many families were made homeless, and some of them lost all the clothes they had. The weather was cold, and he said that I felt that something ought to be done. And so the next morning a bill was introduced appropriating $20,000 for the relief. All business was put aside, and the bill was rushed through as soon as it could be done. 
   Davy Crockett stated, The next summer, when it came time to think about the election, I concluded I would take a scout around the district. When riding in a part of my district, I saw a man in  a field plowing and corning towards the road. I spoke to him. He replied politely, but I thought rather coldly. 
   I began, Well, friend, I am one of those unfortunate beings called candidates. The stranger said, Yes, I know, you are Colonel Crockett, but you should not waste your time. I have seen you before, and I voted for you once, but I shall not vote for you again. 
   Davy Crockett was shocked by this, but the man stated, You gave a vote last winter which shows that either you have not capacity to understand the Constitution, or you are wanting in the honesty and firmness to be guided by it. In either case, you are not the man to represent me. Your understanding of the Constitution is different than mine, and I cannot overlook, because the Constitution, to be worth anything, must be held sacred and rigidly observed in all its provisions. 
   To which the Congressman replied, I admit the truth of what you say, but I do not remember that I gave any vote last winter upon any unconstitutional ground. But the man responded that he knew about it, having read about it in the papers, and how last winter you voted to appropriate $20,000 to some sufferers in Georgetown. Crockett admitted that was true. 
   The gentleman pointed out it was not the amount of money that Congress appropriates that he complains of, it is the principle. In the first place, Congress should not have excess funding. And secondly, it is the principle whether or not the Congress is abiding by the Constitution when it appropriates its money. 
   He said, so you see, while you are contributing to relieve one person, in that case the people in Georgetown, you are drawing it from thousands who are even worse off than he. If you have the right to give anything, the amount is a matter of discretion. You gave $20,000; you could have given $20 million. If you have the right to give to one, you have the right to give to all. And since the Constitution neither defines charities nor stipulates the amount, you are at liberty to give to anything and everything you believe in as charity, and for any amount you believe. You will easily perceive what a wide door this will open for fraud and corruption and favoritism on the one hand, and for robbing from the people on the other. 
   The man continued, Colonel, Congress has no right to give to charity. Individual Members may give as much of their own money as they please, but they have no right to touch a dollar of the public money for that purpose. You see, you have violated the Constitution in what I consider a vital point. 
   In the end what the poor farmer was saying was this: That he had a better understanding of what the Constitution meant and what the Founders had intended when they crafted it less than 100 years earlier at that time; that the Constitution set out limiting powers on the spending of money, both on the Preamble which sets out no powers whatsoever, as previously stated, and under the general spending clause of article I, section 8 of the Constitution. 
   And this is not just my interpretation or the farmer's reading. The Supreme Court has commented on this in several instances of note.     
   In 1905, the Supreme Court made that comment that the general welfare of laws under the preamble is not a grant of power but a limiting of power. 
   This tendency of the understanding of the Constitution was the case from the time of the Founders basically up until around 1930s. Starting in the 1930s in the New Deal, this Nation changed substantially. 
   It was at that time that this Nation began to have an interpretation of the Constitution that the Congress would be the arbiter of what the general welfare clause meant, and that the general welfare clause basically means that Congress can decide to spend money on any process or program that they desire. Then furthermore, subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held that the U.S. Supreme Court would not interfere with the determinations of Congress that these are basically political decisions. 
   To conclude, what this all means, that when the House of Representatives comes back together next week in the weeks that follow on the appropriation bills, when we hear discussions on earmarks and the likes, and when we hear from the other side of the aisle that we will be spending ever more money on the appropriation process than we ever had in U.S. history, the question we should always be asking, is it within the limits of the general welfare clause. 
   A strict interpretation of that clause would say no, but the Founders have said in order for it to be a general clause it must be for individuals all across this country and nor for a particular town, city or area of a State. It must benefit everyone. 
   But you will see in each and every one of those appropriations bills, in just about every one of those earmarks that those dollars are going in contravention of the Constitution and in contravention of what the Founding Fathers intended. 
   For that reason, we come here on a regular basis to try to raise up these issues to have a better understanding of what our Founders intended for the Constitution. 
   With that, I will say good night, or at least, good evening, Gracie.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (COMMENTS ON THE CONSTITUTION -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I will conclude with the quotes of Thomas Jefferson, who addressed this overall issue, in 1791, when opining on the constitutionality of a national bank, so, in essence, what he was doing is what we were doing, we do every week. The thought was at that time in 1791, of course, Alexander Hamilton at the time was pushing for such, and whether there was a constitutionality to do so. 
   He said: ``I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground that `all powers not delegated to the United States, by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States or to the people,' '' obviously our 10th amendment. ``To take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specifically drawn around the powers of Congress is to take possession of a boundless field of power, not longer susceptible of any definition.''  
   Jefferson was very clear that once we overstep the authority that is granted to us by the Constitution, there is no limiting factor on us any more in Congress and the Senate can spend whatever they want on any purpose that they want. The Supreme Court has already opined that they are not going to be the element to rein us in. 
   So we, therefore, must, fortunately or unfortunately, if not going to rein in ourselves, look to the American public to be the political process to rein the Congress back in the manner that the Constitution and the Founders intended.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (EDUCATION -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to bring information before this body about the current status of education in our Nation. 
   I had the distinct pleasure of speaking before the Committee on Education recently during Members Day regarding No Child Left Behind, NCLB, and its reauthorization. But I felt compelled to come to the floor as well to join with my other colleagues and reiterate my concern with the current state of education in this country and what I hope to see come out of this year's reauthorization. 
   Now, I share with all my colleagues here in Congress the ultimate goal of providing a high-quality education for every child in America. 
   Surely, we can do better than what has been done so far. What, then, should we do? I have looked at past reauthorizations of ESEA, and I noticed a troubling trend. With every reauthorization, now problems are identified with American schools. With every reauthorization, the solution proposed by Congress is for the Federal Government to become more involved with education. 
   So, with this reauthorization before us, I have to ask, what has this interference wrought? Back in 1983, a famous report entitled ``A Nation At Risk'' said that America had fallen dangerously behind the rest of the world in education. Today new studies say many of the exact same things. 
   According to the National Center For Education statistics, for example, in 2003, U.S. fourth graders were outperformed by their peers in 11 countries, including four Asian countries and seven European countries. U.S. eighth graders were outperformed by their peers in nine countries. Yet, as a percentage of GDP, we spend more money now on education than at any time in our Nation's history. In fact, we spend more in the United States on K through 12 education than the Philippines, Saudi Arabia or Sweden spend on everything in their countries. 
   Our problem is this: We have increased Federal paperwork which requires increased taxpayer dollars to pay for increased administrative staff. But we have decreased teacher flexibility. We have decreased accountability to parents and decreased student performance. 
   So for this year's reauthorization, I am proposing something different. Very soon, I will be dropping in legislation that will allow a State to in essence opt out of the majority of the requirements of NCLB, but at the same time, allow those taxpayers in the States to keep their education funding through what we call a refundable tax credit. 
   I understand this is very different than what some other Members were proposing. But I feel that only by allowing the States and local governments to bear the burden of education accountability, accountability on that level, will we ever, as a Nation, make the progress that we need to make in the classroom so that we can stay competitive in the twenty-first century. 
   I recently held a town hall meeting back in my district about No Child Left Behind. Every person in that room had something negative to say about the administrative requirements in the program in general. At one point in the meeting, I asked how many people there had contacted and met with a local teacher or principal or school board member regarding their problems? Nearly everyone in the room raised their hand. 
   I then asked the question, how many of the people in the room here met with somebody in the State capital or in the New Jersey Department of Education about their concerns? About half the people raised their hands. I then asked, well, how many of you have had contact with someone from the U.S. Department of Education in Washington? Only one person raised their hand. 
   My point is this: By transferring the requirements for NCLB in Washington, we are moving the accountability for education further away from the parents, the teachers, the school boards, to where it belongs. It belongs close to the parents, the students and the educators in the local school boards. 
   In addition, the reporting requirements under NCLB have created basically a confusing system, a system that ends up punishing our best schools. One of the high schools in my district is consistently cited in publications in the State as one of the top-performing schools in my State. This very same school was placed on an early warning list 2 years after NCLB was instituted. 
   This was not an underperforming school. Every year, nearly 100 percent of the kids graduate and they attend college. The average combined SAT score for the students in that school was around 1,100. Fourteen AP courses and tests were offered and so on. So it is a great school. And, yes, it is on the warning list. 
   So I worry that while trying to meet the requirements of NCLB, students attending this high school will actually be held back by burdensome regulations rather than pushed to excel at already high standards that the school had previously set for them. 
   I am certain there are many other schools in my counties in my district in my State and across the country, which is why we need a change to NCLB.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those latter points. And it gets to the question of people who hear our discussions of why is this all-important to me? Over the last several days, as we have begun to look at the President's budget as he submitted it to Congress, we have heard from the experts, we have heard the debates, we have heard the speeches, we have heard talk of the CBO, the OMB, dynamic scoring, static scoring, a whole list of other acronyms and technicalities and the like. But you have to really at some point in time step back from all the Byzantine make-up that Congress is when it comes to a budget and say is there some sort of common principle that we can base all this on that underpins this almost $3 trillion endeavor that we are all engaged in? 
   For all the complexities of this process, the fact of the matter is that what we are doing is nothing different than what every family in America has to do every day of their lives. They have to look at the amount of money that they expect to have and get over the next 12 months and decide what are their priorities, where are they going to spend it, how are they going to spend it. Now, there are some differences, of course. I guess there are three of them between what we are doing and what the average family budget is. First of all, it is on the scale. We are doing things here on a mammoth scale compared to the average homeowner. 
   Years ago there used to be a $1,000 bill. I don't think there is a $1,000 bill anymore. I think they did away with that. But if you took a $1,000 bill and you stacked them up, you would need 1,000 of those $1,000 bills just to get up to $1 billion; and then if you had that stack of $1,000 bills, you would need 1,000 of those stacks to get up to $1 trillion. And we are looking at a $3 trillion budget. So we are looking here at a size that is different. 
   Also, families realize that their family budget has a finite amount of money that they deal with, whereas we look at it slightly differently because we know we can always borrow and spend and print more money. 
   And, finally, one other major difference in what we do here than the family budget is that we are spending other people's money. So many times people come down to the floor and say we have to be compassionate for this program or that, but we have to realize at the end of the day it is not our money we are taking out of the pocket. It is the American taxpayers' dollars that are coming out of the pocket to pay for these programs. So that is where the difference is. 
   But at the end of the day, it is all the same in the sense that we have to live within the boundaries, just like a family should. At least that is what the American taxpayer is looking at and asking us why we don't. Why don't we live within a confined budget like they do? And why don't we go one step further, as many families do? Just as many families save for their children's education for the future, why can't we get to the point of actually having a balanced budget where we can set aside some dollars for the future generations? 
   Now, I, like my colleague from Texas who just spoke, also serve on the Budget Committee. And I have to be honest with you that what we have heard there from the other side of the aisle is that they are laying the groundwork, from their comments at least, to do two things, to attack the budget on the point of taxing and spending. They are laying this groundwork on spending saying that we are not spending enough and on the side of the taxes that we are not taxing enough. 
   And on that latter point I will just close on this point. The budget cuts that this Congress, Republican Congress, has done in the past have been progressive budget cuts. That means it helps the average-income family more than anybody else. And I get the static information not from the CBO or these other experts. I get this information from nobody else but the New York Times. And they have looked at the budget cuts that we have done, and they proved the point for us; that if you are making less than $50,000, that you saw the percent change in your average tax bill by a 48 percent reduction. So the lowest incomes under the progressive tax cuts help the lowest-income people the most. If you are making between $50,000 and $100,000, a 21 percent reduction; $100,000 to $200,000, a 17 percent reduction; $200,000 to $500,000, it flows into a 10 percent reduction. So you see the trend. 
   What we have done in the past is help the average taxpayer in the State of New Jersey around $200,000. What we must do now is make those tax cuts permanent and do as a family budget, live within our means.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (CONSTITUTIONAL CAUCUS ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity  to come back from our break, come here to these hallowed halls to speak on an important subject, and before the gentleman from the other side of the aisle leaves, and I know he is involved in a discussion right now, but before I repeat my remarks, I will reference his closing remarks, which was an outreach for bipartisanship to address the economic situations that the country finds itself in. The gentleman can rest assured that, at least from this gentleman from this side of the aisle, he can find that bipartisanship, because I think when we all go back home to our districts, regardless of the States that we are in, we are hearing the same complaint, outcry, what have you. It may be different in different portions of the country. Certain States are certainly harder hit than others. But I think there is a general perception out there that no matter where you are, the economy is in, let's say something of the doldrums. 
   So this side of the aisle is glad to reach out to the other side of the aisle. I also know that the White House is more than willing to work to address the economic situation that we find ourselves in. That being said, I think that the American public wants to be sure, wants to be sure that whatever solution that we come up with out of this House, the House and the Senate, and the President eventually signs onto, will do something that will create more good than harm, and that will be long lasting and not just short-lived or a flash in the pan. 
   A flash-in-the-pan might be something like we have seen in my very own State. I come from the great State of New Jersey. We do something in our State which is called homestead rebates. Every year around election time, whichever party is in power at that time sends out a homestead rebate check of around $300, $400 or $500. I guess that is supposed to be good for the economy and that sort of thing, but at the end of the day of course that has just de minimis effect on the overall economy, and if you look at the State of New Jersey economy right now, you will know it is not doing well at all. That, coupled with the fact that the State legislature has raised taxes on the people, but corporate taxes, income taxes, sales taxes and the like, we have seen 72,000 flee our State.     
   So we know that we do not want a flash-in-the-pan approach, but instead something that will improve the economy in a better way. That would most likely be something that would allow a permanent return of people's money to their pocketbooks, such as lowering the tax rates, allowing the creation of more jobs and the like. But I digress, because I was just referring to the closing comments to the gentleman on the other side the aisle. 
   Now I would like to turn the attention to what we are here for the next hour to speak about, and that is during the Constitution Hour. As I do that, let me just take an introductory moment to thank the gentleman from Utah who will be speaking shortly. I thank him not only for his usual diligent work as he works earnestly in his capacity as a Member representing his great State as a Member of Congress and all the responsibilities that that takes, I thank him not only for his work that he does in addition to that to try to come up with methodologies to improve the performance of this House, which we are all eager to look forward to and take part and see the work there as well, but in addition to all those responsibilities, he has also taken on the chore and responsibility, and I don't think he looks at it as a chore, to come to the floor once a month as part of the Congressional Constitutional Caucus to address the important philosophical and fundamental issues of the day. 
   So before I begin, I want to thank the gentleman from Utah, Mr. Bishop, for all of his work to his constituents and also to the members of this conference as well. 
   As I say, we are here tonight as we begin another year of our monthly Constitutional Hour. During this second session of the 110th Congress, the members of this caucus will use this opportunity to emphasize for our colleagues and also for the Nation the necessity of ensuring that our government is operating according to the intent of our Founding Fathers and the original intent in the Constitution. 
   As the tenth amendment affirms, as I often speak of on this floor, the authority over most domestic issues belongs to the States, either directly or through their political subdivisions and the people themselves, and not here for this House to be haranguing about. 
   As the one who helped begin this caucus, I have discovered that for many Americans, including unfortunately some of my fellow colleagues, I guess, the Constitution is nothing more than a historical document, not germane to the current hour. Too many citizens do not know what the Constitution says about the governance of this Nation, let alone how to help discern its meaning and therefore apply it to what we do in this conference. 
   Therefore, one of the goals of this caucus is to help educate both the Members of this Congress and also the public as well about the original intent of the Founding Fathers and how some portions of that document got here, and tonight we will be talking about the Bill of Rights. 
   Last month, on that point, we celebrated the 216th anniversary of the ratification of that Bill of Rights. It was on December 15, 1791, our Founding Fathers decided to attach the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. After months of deliberation, they succeeded, I believe, in securing liberties and freedoms that were unimaginable, truly unimaginable, to previous civilizations. 
   Just as an aside, some scholars would perhaps disagree and say that this was seen in other documents such as the Magna Carta and the like, but nothing to the poignancy and the directness as we have in the Bill of Rights was ever seen prior to this documentation. 
   Tonight I join, as I say, with Mr. Bishop and others in focusing on the ratification of this Bill of Rights, and I would like then to begin a discussion of how this document continues then to affect us today. 
   According to Thomas Jefferson, the Bill of Rights was largely the brainchild of one man, George Mason. In fact, Jefferson wrote, ``The fact is unquestionable that the Bill of Rights in the constitution of Virginia,'' which is where he was from, ``were drawn originally by George Mason, one of our greatest men.'' Yet, unfortunately, not many people today have even heard of him. It is for this reason that many have called him the forgotten founder. 
   But most Americans recognize the name from the movie and Cinderella story of 2006, the NCAA tournament, in which the George Mason University Patriots made its way to the final four. But it was George Mason's tremendous contributions and accomplishments himself that have largely gone unrecognized. 
   Mr. Mason established himself as one of the richest planters in colonial Virginia, and, like George Washington, who everyone is familiar with, he preferred to remain at home working on his plantation and spending time with his family. But when duty called, he did not ignore it nor hide from it, and throughout his adulthood, consented to the request of his fellow Virginians and served in various political capacities. He was a Fairfax County justice, a trustee of the City of Alexandria, and a representative in the Virginia House of Burgesses. 
   It was when England enacted the Stamp Act that he wrote a letter to London merchants, who he had often many dealings with, explaining the colonists' position and asking for their support leading to the revolution. 
   One of his greatest accomplishments was his contribution to the Virginia Declaration of Rights. When he became a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, he was one of the five frequent speakers there. 
   Despite all that, he ultimately refused to sign the final version of the Constitution, for two reasons: One, and most importantly to our discussion tonight, he wanted to have a Bill of Rights in that original document to protect individuals against a grasping, overgrowing central government, one which we see today. Secondly, he disagreed with the convention's tacit approval of the institution of slavery. 
   So, because of his stands, he refused to sign the document and he also lost a longtime friendship with George Washington and others. But it was one year before his death Mason was vindicated. That was when the Bill of Rights was  finally adopted by all the States. Moreover, much of the adopted language was actually the identical words that he used and crafted in the original Virginia Declaration of Rights. 
   Author George Grant describes Mason as a rationalist who had little faith in the workings of government bodies. He fought passionately for the freedoms of the individual, whether it was a citizen or slave at the time, and he was largely responsible for ensuring that the protection of the rights of the individual would be such an essential part of the American system. That is our responsibility as Members of Congress, to ensure that those rights are continuously protected in the legislation that we deal with on this floor. 
   To show you how much we are indebted to Mason, let me quote a portion of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which I just said he authored. ``All men are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent natural rights, among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.'' 
   Those were his words. They sound very familiar to us all. Mason was also among the first to call for such basic American liberties as freedom of press, religious tolerance and the right to trial by jury. As he understood it, the Bill of Rights would protect citizens, as I say, from encroaching Federal Government, and so his original language then eventually made its way into our current U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
   As my colleague will detail, I presume, or talk about, and I will a little bit later on, the Bill of Rights has been in certain cases misinterpreted in certain court cases in the past over the last centuries. In certain instances these errors have allowed the government to seize some of the very freedoms that the Bill of Rights was intended to protect. 
   I will go into those in a little bit dealing with the first amendment and the establishment of religion, an issue that is very poignant today, and also in the first amendment, issues of the court's interpretation of abuse of freedom of speech and the press and how they have changed in the interpretations of recent Supreme Court decisions as to which is more important and paramount, commercial and independent speech. 
   The second amendment, I believe we may have some speakers later on again on very poignant cases that will be coming dealing here with issues right here in the District of Columbia. 
   The fifth amendment, taking clauses again, legislation that this House has dealt with and we will be talking about very briefly later on as well. 
   Right to speedy trial and how what we do here with regard to the criminalization of laws can have an impact on that as well. 
   In closing my remarks right now, the tenth amendment, I believe Ms. Foxx will be on the floor a little bit later on talking about that and how that closes up and compresses or closes the end tail, if you will, of the entire Bill of Rights. 
   So those are some of the elements of it, our discussion tonight. With that, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Utah. Again, I appreciate your being with us.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I would encourage the gentleman, because I know I have been on the floor and while we have established this Congressional Constitutional Caucus, which is open to all Members of both sides of the aisle, I believe I have heard sitting on this floor that there is another caucus on the other side of the aisle which I guess is open but I haven't heard yet, the First Amendment Caucus. So at least there is at least one caucus over there who is concerned about the first amendment, if I am not mistaken, and hopefully maybe some of those Members would be willing to, if they are eager to speak on the first amendment, they will want to be knowledgeable about the entire Constitution as well. We might want to reach out to them. 
   I share with the gentleman from Texas his eagerness to see this legislation. It is one of those commonsense sort of things that if you are engaged in crafting laws, then you should know what your authority for crafting those laws are. And, of course, that authority comes to us not from previous laws that we have passed, but from the Constitution of the United States, which was obviously ratified and supported by all the States and the people thereof. 
   The gentleman from Texas also makes me think back on my history. I am an attorney, and you got me thinking there for a moment what my history as far as the courses that I have taken over the years. I went to a State school for undergraduate studies, Montclair State College and now it is Montclair State University, I believe I took a constitutional law class there and I believe it was a requirement for that class to read the Constitution. But then I went to law school; and as I am sitting here listening to your remarks, I don't believe that I was required in any of my courses, whether it is contracts or torts and the whole litany of courses that you are required in the first, second, and third year of law school, I don't believe that I was required as a law student to ever sit down and read the entire Constitution. Most of what you do in law school, actually, is the case method, in which case all you are doing is reading cases. And cases simply give you information of judges' interpretation of other cases.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (CONSTITUTIONAL CAUCUS ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I like that idea. CE credits, continuing education credits for Members of Congress. 
   There are two avenues to get people to do something, whatever their professions are. One is the CE way, and the other is just personal pressure. If you are in a profession, you have to be good at your profession to continue to be hired. I guess, in Congress, you have to be good in your profession to continue to be reelected. But the other way, I would suggest to constituents who may hear these remarks tonight, to ask their Member of Congress at the next town hall meeting, at the next town hall meeting when the questions come up just to ask the Members of Congress, ``By the way, when was the last time, if ever, that you have read the U.S. Constitution?'' I know there are a few folks out there like Roscoe Bartlett that carry the Constitution with them. But that would be a good question for the members of the public to ask their Members of Congress. Give them a quiz, ask if they know what any of the 10 amendments are to the Bill of Rights and so on. 
   Going back now to comments by the gentleman from Utah of the foundation or the formulation of the Bill of Rights, and I note the gentleman touched upon this. Part of the reason initially why there was a, I don't know if you want to say a pushback, but not so much of a strong desire, except for folks such as Mason and also what were called the anti-Federalists, a lot of people who talk about the Federalist Society and the Federalists who gave us this and Hamiltonians. But the anti-Federalists were on the other side. Part of the reason why there was a pushback and saying we don't need this was because the original push for creation of the current Constitution came after the Articles of Confederation. And originally, when they set up their, convention is not the right word but in essence that is what it was, to establish a new document, what they were intending to do was simply to create a new document or make amendments to the old Articles of Confederation to grant certain powers to a centralized government. So if their intent was to create or to establish powers for this new centralized government, there was not the mindset to say, well, we also at the same time need to set out for what the powers or rights of the individuals are; because that is taken as a given, that it is the people who have the rights and the powers, and we are just simply granting some of those rights or powers to the Federal Government to be able to better administer the commerce and trade and so on and so forth that the Articles was incompetent of doing. 
   So I think that was part of the discussion that was going on: If we are simply giving certain rights over here to a central government, we really don't need to establish it. 
   The anti-Federalists realized, however, that there was a need for it; that without establishing the paramount power of the individual and also the state, that this centralized government could consume the States. And that is exactly what Mason was talking about when he set forth his objections to it. It was, as I said before, I believe in September of 1787, it was during the final days of the Constitutional Convention that George Mason wrote the reasons for his refusal to sign the Constitution. He did it, interestingly enough, on the back of a committee of style report. Since we have committee reports up here, he simply wrote them all down. Copies of those, manuscript copies of that document were then circulated, and Mason sent copies to various individuals, including George Washington, a long-time friend of his. Washington, though, was on the other side of this issue. So, on November 22, the objections were printed in the Virginia Journal. Interestingly, again, it was done at the behest of Washington's secretary, and the reason they were printing them out publicly like this was so that Washington could publicly refute them. Those original documents are still with us today. They are in the Chapin Library in Williams College.     
   The preamble of his objections read: ``There is no declaration of rights, and the laws of the general government being paramount to the laws and constitution of the several States, the declarations of rights in the separate States are no security, nor are the people secure even in the enjoyment of the benefits of the common law.'' 
   So Mason is simply saying here that I may live in a State, and my State may provide certain rights, but if the Federal Government's rights or powers are paramount to my own State's rights, the Federal Government can step in and take away any rights that my State constitution guarantees me, and I would lose those rights and privileges that are God given. 
   Now, a lot of this discussion by people listening is: How does this affect me? This is a lot of philosophical talking. Well, it isn't really. Day after day, as the gentleman from Utah mentioned before, we pass bill after bill, and some are signed into law. Some are perfunctory, naming of a school or post office, but others are profoundly important upon our daily lives. Do I have to remind the public about the PATRIOT Act and the discussion that entailed there? Later on I believe we will be discussing the FISA Court's issues and the powers; again, the issues of the powers of the various branches of the government and how they impact upon our individual liberties. 
   These are all fundamental questions that come back to not powers created  in the House or Senate or the executive, but rights or powers that we see in the documents, the Constitution of the United States. 
   It is germane that we bring these things up this year, 2008, a Presidential election year. Most of the candidates are speaking about change. Either side of the party is talking about change. But the fundamental question that the voter has to ask: Is the change that they are espousing and bringing about founded on any constitutional principles or are they simply giving us change for change's sake and change that does not have any constitutional powers or rights given to the Federal Government? 
   I see we have been joined by the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), and if she would like to speak now, I appreciate her participation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, and I will leave the final word to the gentlewoman. 
   I just wanted to come to the floor to commend your work here today and the press conference that we had earlier today and the work of the RSC on this matter. 
   As was indicated earlier, the soothsayer said to Julius Caesar ``Beware the Ides of March.'' And that is exactly where we are right now, the center of March. A time of doom, a bad omen in many ways. And it is a bad omen for many Americans because many Americans across this country right now are sitting at their kitchen tables or their dining room tables getting all their paperwork together to do their taxes. Actually, I don't know how many Americans still do their own taxes. Many people actually pay now to send it out to some of these accountants out there, that you were referencing before, to do them, because it has gotten just so complicated. It has gotten just so incomprehensible. 
   Earlier today we saw the little stacks of books of the regulations and the Code that is made up of the incomprehensible regulations. And that is why Americans can't understand the entire Code. And for that matter, and I raised this question earlier, I think it would be interesting if someone did a survey of all the Members of the Congress and the Senate, 535 Members of the House and Senate. These are the people who actually made that Tax Code. How many of them actually do their own taxes anymore? I don't do it anymore because, quite honestly, I find it incomprehensible, as well, and I send it off to an expert. 
   The initiative that we are all pushing here tonight is to say that it has gone far too long to have an incomprehensible Tax Code. We can't be sure that we are paying a fair amount if we don't  know what we are filling out. So what we are doing here is not only citing the problem, but setting the road to recovery of that problem as well by coming up with a comprehensible system of paying our taxes. 
   While that is incomprehensible, how you fill out your taxes, what is not incomprehensible is the fact that we have been paying and spending far too much in the Federal Government for far too long. The American family realizes that they have to live within their means, that they have only so much of a paycheck each week and they have to make sure that that goes as far as their expenses, and they can't spend any more than that. 
   The Federal Government, as we know, does that every day, spends far more than they take in. That is what the American public doesn't understand. If the American public has to live within their means, why doesn't the Federal Government have to do so? The initiative that we are talking about here would say, balance our budget, be just like American families at home, and live within our means. 
   The final point is this: We have talked in the past, also on this floor, with regard to ethics, and I may be wrong but I think it was in an article in The Washington Post that said, why are we exceeding our spending and why do we have these ethical problems on K Street and the like? And one of the reasons they said, and this references the point that the gentleman from Iowa said before, is because we exceed our constitutional authority, as Mr. King was pointing out; that we spend in areas that the Constitution never permitted us to do in the first place. 
   The Washington Post article made the same reference. If we live within our means, live within the constitutional boundaries, we would meet the objectives of the American family. 
   I see by the clock on the wall we are coming to the end of the time. And I appreciate the gentlewoman's work in this area.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I come today to the floor to point out something that's really already been pointed out in the press, and that is, as they say, that the Democrats, unfortunately, have horrifically failed as the majority party getting most anything done. Now, they made promises after promises to help the American people, and maybe it's no surprise that most of those promises have come to naught and have been broken. 
   This is most evident by the recent Democrat budget. It includes a massive $683 billion tax increase which only further burdens our children, kills jobs, hurts small businesses, and basically just punishes the American family. And worst of all, this budget was created to finance wasteful spending and the special interests here in Washington. 
   So what happened to all of those promises of cleaning up Washington and cutting spending? Well, it seems they simply got lost in the shuffle of all of their spending taxpayers' dollars.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. As I come to the floor tonight, the first week of December, standing here in the Nation's Capitol of the greatest Nation on Earth, today, and has ever been, I think about our constituents back home in the great State of New Jersey and across the country as well as they look to our Nation's Capitol and expect us to do the responsible things on their behalf and on the behalf of freedom and liberty around the world as well. And a portion of that responsibility, of course, is handling their hard-earned tax dollars as they send them to us here in Washington to administer this government and spending, some of which was just addressed by the other side of the aisle. 
   For the next hour, I would like to engage in a discussion of these issues and shed some light on them, perhaps pointing out some of the fallacies in some of the arguments that we just heard from the other side of the aisle on these points. 
   As we begin there, I think there is no place better to begin as to try to address some of those points that have been raised. So at this time I would be honored to have a fellow colleague join us at the floor right now. I yield the floor to Ms. Foxx.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Will the gentlelady yield? 
   I think the gentlelady makes an interesting but important point at the same time, in that if we see our role here in Congress as to satisfy every desire, wish, whim, and I am not saying education is a whim, but desires, wish, needs, as well of our constituency back at home, in your State and mine, then of course that wish list or the desire list or that need list would go on ad infinitum. Then we can become here, as one may say, as the 51st State, the 51st State legislature, trying to solve every single issue, whether it's building new schools, filling in potholes back at home on the street in front of someone's house, or any other minutia that is back in the States. Obviously, some of these things are quite vital to you and I and our constituents, but the question is where do those dollars and cents come from, where do the responsibilities lie? If we are going to assume at all, then I can tell you that this budget is going to balloon even further than where the Democrats already want the budget to balloon. 
   But it is, just as you said before, an issue of, and I will probably say it 22 more times before the night is over, an issue of setting priorities, and part of setting priorities is setting what are our responsibilities. So you hit the nail on the head when you begin to look at that, how do you set priorities, what is our responsibility. If we can just hone in on what our responsibility is and if we can get doing those things well first, then everything else comes in time. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentlelady from North Carolina, and I do believe that the American public is paying attention; and they are doing better than that, they are reading between the lines. And they know when they are being talked to straight and honestly, just as you have been for the last few moments now setting forth what the record is with regard to what the Republicans' intentions have been and will be in the future with regard to getting the fiscal house in order of this country, and what the actual record has been for the last 11-plus, almost 12, months now, as we stand here under Democrat control. 
   Some of the numbers, I must say, that we talk about when we discuss this issue are quite large. It is really hard to get your hands around them, to get a handle on them. When you are talking about total spending in 2008 in the fiscal budget of $2.9 trillion, who can imagine that size number? When you are talking even a smaller number about an increase of $118 billion over 2007, $118 billion? We just can't relate to it. 
   What we have to all bring it right down to is the fact that this is the American public tax dollars at heart, and it does mean dollars and cents to people at home listening to us tonight, working all week long, paying their bills. It does mean something to the American family's budget, how the tax increases that have been proposed by the other side of the aisle are going to impact upon them and their lack of responsibility when it comes to the issue that curbing spending will have an impact upon them as well. 
   I am very pleased that I have been joined here tonight by another strong stalwart leader on this entire issue of fiscal responsibility. I have the pleasure of serving with him on several committees, but most importantly right now on the Budget Committee where he has been an outspoken critic of wanton expenses and spending, both now under Democratic control but also, too, when the Republicans controlled. So I would like to yield such time as he needs to the gentleman from Texas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I again thank the gentleman from Texas for your work and for coming to the floor and for the points you make here. 
   You point out several significant points. One is the dichotomy between what has been said by the other side of the aisle, both before the election and now 
   during the course of the year, and literally just moments ago before I came to the floor this hour as the Blue Dogs were on the floor speaking. 
   Let me take a moment to remind those here with us what was said by the other side when it comes to fiscal responsibility and their ability to get going rolling forward, because the gentleman from Texas made reference to the point we are likely to see an omnibus bill that none of us had an opportunity to consider, just as has been the case with other bills that have come to the floor. 
   Back on November 8, 2006, a little over a year ago, Democrat Speaker Pelosi said Democrats are prepared to govern and ready to lead. 
   Would that be true, whether she was prepared to govern and lead a year ago, here we are a year later, and we are still waiting for their appropriation bills to make the way through the process. Here we are in the second week in December, which means we are already, October, November, December, all those months, a quarter into the next fiscal year, and we are still waiting for those appropriation bills to make it through the House, Senate, and onto the President's desk. Were they really ready to lead a year ago if they can't get it done at this point in time? I guess not. 
   A year ago their Democrat caucus chairman, Mr. Clyburn, said Democrats offer a new direction which includes fiscal responsibility. If you just put the period after ``they offer a new direction,'' maybe that would be more telling. Their direction is deeper in debt for the country, and therefore for the American family's budget as well, because their solution is always increase taxes. 
   You might find that odd to think their solution is always to increase taxes if you simply listen to their rhetoric, because back in March of this year their majority leader said there are no tax increases in this budget, referring to the budget which came through the Budget Committee and eventually came to the floor of the House. 
   If there are no tax increases, why do we know that the tax increases are going up significantly, upwards to $400 billion on the American public because of the bills that the Democrat majority has put through? 
   I would point out to the gentleman from Texas that just prior to coming to the floor, the other side was speaking. It was the Blue Dog Democrats, and their solution, and you don't have to, as the gentlelady from North Carolina  says, read between the lines. Their solution to this issue of fiscal responsibility is only one-sided, and that is revenue, revenue enhancement, which is a nice way of saying tax increases. 
   How do we know that? The Record proves the case. The chart to my left shows the Republican minority attempted during various appropriation bills that were coming down to say that maybe the solution when your fiscal house is not in order is not always to raise taxes; maybe part of the solution is to rein in spending, something that every family has to do from time to time. When an American family has a problem with their budget and they are not able to make ends meet at the end of the month or week, what do they do? They usually have to rein in spending and set priorities. We suggested that. I know that the gentleman from Texas was part of this process as well to suggest perhaps what we should do is not make any draconian cuts, not say we are going to eliminate this program or that program, although some programs are certainly worthy of being eliminated. We had a much more modest proposal, and that was simply to say can we go for a 1-percent reduction in spending. 
   What was the Democrats' response to that? Well, on bill after bill after bill after bill, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven of the House appropriation bills proposed by the House Democrat majority, on each case we suggested can we afford a 1-percent across-the-board reduction to try to bring our House in fiscal responsibility.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate that point. The gentleman is absolutely correct. It is not a reduction in overall spending so we can say today we are spending a dollar and tomorrow we would be spending 99 cents. In fact, today we are spending a dollar and we may be going up to $1.05, let's bring it down to $1.04-something as far as the actual spending. So the actual spending would still be going up, but we were suggesting going up on a slightly lower curve.     
   Democrats voting in favor of that modicum of fiscal responsibility. Well, we could get into single digits several times, with 10, 7, 11, 13, 11, 11, 11; only 11 votes out of that entire side of the aisle. I'm not sure where any of the Blue Dogs were on that one when they had the opportunity to rein in spending. 
   You know, I think if I recall correctly, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, the reason they said that they could not be supportive of being more fiscally responsible and support any measure was that we were not being compassionate enough. But the element of compassion in Washington, DC. apparently is measured by simply how much more money you throw at the problem. Whether or not that program is efficient, whether that program has been rated as being adequate and getting the job done, the measure of compassion in Washington is always whether or not you are throwing even more money than the party next to you is doing. 
   I guess it comes down to a very simply thing like this: at the end of the day they want to be able to go home to their kids or grandkids and say, well, we were more compassionate than those Republicans because we spent more money than they did on a particular problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Just a quick two points, one on the compassion issue is perhaps it is appropriate when you're dealing with money to say that if I'm taking money out of my own pocket and deciding that I will spend this on a particular program, I can honestly say if I wish to be so boastful that I am being compassionate for that individual. 
   But we know that the Federal Government is in debt right now. We are involved in deficit spending, which means that we are not only spending more money than we are currently taking in from the current taxpayers in this country, but also we are going into debt borrowing as well. So where are we borrowing from? 
   Well, we are borrowing from the next generation. So in that hypothetical conversation that a Member from the other side of the aisle must have when they go back to their children and say, well, I was compassionate today because I decided to vote ``no'' on all these fiscally responsible measures that the Republicans propose as far as reining in the spending on this side. Well, the compassion that the father or mother Member would have to say to his child, I am being compassionate because I am simply basically giving you an additional debt on my children, and my children and your children will be obligated for all of these expenses. 
   Now, to the other point that you were raising as far as the letters and the phone calls that you get from your members or from your constituents who are concerned about what we are doing here and that they are on the brink of foreclosure, or brink of fiscal solvency in their own right, well, that's perfectly understandable, especially in light of all that has transpired over the last 11 months with regard to new taxes that have been proposed by this Democrat majority. And I'll just refer to the chart here for a moment. And if you care to speak on any of these, you're welcome to. 
   These are new majority proposals, new taxes at every turn. I digress. What was Senator Hillary Clinton's statement with regard as running as a Presidential candidate, which I believe she said something to the effect of, I have more ideas than this country can afford to spend dollars on, or something to that effect. Well, apparently the other side of the aisle, the Democrat side of the aisle, has the same idea, that they have more proposals, more bright ideas to spend on than we  have money in the bank nor does the American family have in their bank as well. But they're going to still go and try and spend them, and they're going to do it by raising taxes. 
   So what do we have here? One, two, three, four, five, about seven different new tax proposals. Fiscal year 2008 budget $392.5 billion tax increase. Of course the gentleman from Texas recalls that we saw that at the very beginning of this year in about March or April of this year when we saw at that time that was the largest tax increase in U.S. history. The largest tax increase. And where is that going to be on? It's going to be on the backs of American families. 
   Secondly, $15 billion in new energy taxes. Well, we just passed 2 weeks ago, or last week I guess it was, we passed the energy bill, and that's even in addition to that as far as the tax increases that will be on energy production in this country. $5.8 billion in new tobacco taxes, $7.5 billion, again these are all in billions. If you can't get your hands around it, those large numbers, but that's what we're talking about. $7.5 billion in new taxes in the farm bill. A nickel-per-gallon tax increase on gas for infrastructure. So if we're not already paying enough at the pump and, remember, that also was one of the promises that the gentlelady from North Carolina was referring to before, a whole list, before you came in a whole list of promises made by the new majority that they were going to do. 
   One of them was an energy policy to reduce the price of gasoline. I can tell you in my neck of the woods 
   prices are higher now substantially than when the majority came in. Now they want to add a nickel tax on top of that. A 50 cent-per-gallon tax, increase on gas for global warming. So now you're up to 55 cents on gas. 
   New taxes on homeownership by ending mortgage deductions and a new tax on every American with a private health plan. And actually this list is an abbreviated list that can go even further than this as far as taxes on the American public. 
   And with that I'll yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. The gentleman and I also, besides being on the Budget Committee, I also have the honor of serving with him on the Financial Services Committee. And one of the issues that we're dealing with right now of course is with the subprime situation, subprime situation as far as the tightening of the credit market of course and the decline of home prices that is probably going to continue for some period of time, peaking with regard to the resets sometime in February or March of next year. But most experts would agree that the price of homes in this country on average will be going down 3, 4, 5 percent; and this will continue during the course of 2008. And it's one of the reasons, as well, why we see consumer confidence beginning to erode, after a substantial period, a lengthy period of where consumer confidence was up. 
   So when you think about the economic situation of the American family right now, energy costs going through the roof. I heard a figure the other day, I think they said on average American homeowners are going to spend around $2,000 more this year just to heat their homes. There's 2,000 bucks more out of their wallets. That's in addition to more money out of their pockets for gasoline, going to and from work. And that's in addition to the fact that the values of the house in certain pockets of this country will be going down. Their financial situation for the American public is being constricted. 
   And what is the solution that we are hearing from the other side of the aisle while the family budget is being tightened like that? 
   Well, it's Uncle Sam reaching out and saying, can we have, Washington, have 2, $3,000 more so we can spend it down here on who knows what. And some of those who-knows-whats, you remember earlier on in this year, with all the pork spending that was coming from the other side of the aisle, you recall this discussion of some of the pork that was thrown into legislation, $50 million for wild blueberry subsidies, farm bill, $17 million for the National Sports program, $20 million for the National Writing Project, $6 million for unused plane tickets, $36,000 for Kentucky to protect bingo halls and on and on infinitum. 
   Anyone who listens to the gentleman from Texas or the gentleman from Arizona talk about earmarks will know about the wasteful spending that goes on here. But that's what's going to continue to go on so long as Washington is controlled by the other side of the aisle that says we can continue to spend without limitation because we are not setting those priorities. But we will be willing, the Democrats will be willing to reach out and take more money out of the family's pocket. So that really is the issue here at home. 
   And I always remember this expression from the gentleman from Texas: the focus has got to be on the family budget and not on the Washington budget. The other side of the aisle obviously has misplaced that axiom and has put the focus entirely on the Washington budget, as opposed to the Federal, the individual budget. 
   Again, if you were here earlier when the other side of the aisle was saying that their solutions to the fiscal dilemma that we're in right now and the problems need to be addressed in a fiscally responsible manner, never once during that entire hour discussion, and never once during any of our hearings that I can recall in the Budget Committee, have we heard from them the basic suggestion that the answer lies in the spending side of the equation as opposed to revenue. 
   In Washington, we really do have a spending problem, not a revenue problem. The revenue continues to come in at unprecedented rates, and that despite the fact that we had tax cuts going back as far as 2003, despite the fact that we lowered the tax rates for Americans so that they can keep more money in their pockets. The amount of revenue coming into Washington continues to go up, most times over the last several years, actually in the double-digit range year over year. 
   So it's not a revenue problem that we have experienced. It is a spending problem. I'm just waiting for the day that the other side of the aisle begins to realize that and will begin to work with us on some of these issues that you and I and others in the RSC as well have decided is the appropriate approach, reining in this budget as the family does.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. And to get an idea, again, as to how that all plays out or actually where that all comes from, I gave you before a list, just a partial list of the tax increases that would be coming down the pike under the new Democrat majority. 
   Let's look at it as you would look at your own income tax return in a way. Part of the tax increases that you will see will go from the top to the bottom. So you can say compassion to either the richest or the poorest. The ordinary income tax at the top rates will be going up, 35 percent to 39.6 percent. Capital gains tax, which are not only for the rich, it's for our senior citizens as well who are relying on their retirement accounts, the annuities that they have put away during the course of their life, their pensions and the like which are invested, and now they're taking those funds out as far as capital gains. That's what they're living on on a fixed income. What do we see there with capital gains, 15 percent to 20 percent. That's a 5 percent increase, or actually a 30 percent increase over the 15 percent. 
   Dividends, likewise, increase 15 percent up to 39.6 percent, more than a double increase there. 
   Estate taxes. Well, estate tax, of course, is something we've debated on this floor for a long time, for the small farmer, for the small business person. Their taxes are going to go from 0 percent to 55 percent, basically making a lot of small farmers and little families when they sit down at the end of the year saying we may actually have to sell our business to hold on, and this is why. 
   Finally, for the lower income tax bracket, child tax credit from $1,000 to $500. Now, to people who actually really need that money, that extra $500 can be crucial. That could be a month's rent payment. That could be a food bill. That could be a car payment. They're reducing it from $1,000 down to $500. 
   And finally, the lowest income earners, the bottom income individuals and families in this country, they, too, will be bearing the brunt of the tax increases and the prolific spending that we see down here by seeing the lowest tax bracket go from 10 percent to 15 percent. Percentage-wise, of course, that's a 50 percent tax increase when you think about it, from 10 percent up to 15 percent, as far as a percentage increase. 
   So from the richest to the poorest will all be suffering, and the dollars and cents, as you make out, the gentleman from Texas, very well, comes out to how they pay their bills at the end of the month. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman again. 
   You can see this sort of going on in a microcosm from the State that I'm from, the great State of New Jersey, where a poll was done a month or so ago I understand that said if you had the opportunity, would you leave the State, and 50 percent of the respondents 
   said, yes, they would. If you look at the actual demographic numbers over the last year, between 72- or 76,000 New Jerseyans have left the State of New Jersey. One of the reasons why they indicate they've left the State is because taxes are so high. They cannot afford to live in that State. So the individuals leave, the families leave, businesses leave the State, which will cause obviously a death spiral, if you will, to the overall economy of the State of New Jersey if it's going to continue.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I'm sure the gentleman would like to have them. I would like them to stay in the State of New Jersey and just see that our fiscal house is set in order in the State of New Jersey, where the Democrats just raised the sales tax by a penny and corporate taxes as well, and property taxes continue to go through the roof. 
   But that's a microcosm of the United States of America as well. People are doing what Ronald Reagan once said, and that is they're voting with their feet and leaving the State. Businesses will be doing the exact same thing as we begin to see taxes go up across the board in the United States if those hard decisions are not being made of prioritization. 
   I believe we're getting near the end of our time here. I will extend a hand to the other side of the aisle, as we continue this debate during the course of the week, to the Blue Dogs or any other Members who came down to the floor during this night or other nights as well who are looking for fiscal responsibility. If we can come to an agreement that the answer is not raising taxes but, rather, reining in spending, I believe it was the RSC a year ago that came up with a list of, correct me if I'm wrong, approximately a half a billion dollars in savings in overall spending by the Federal Government. We'd be glad to share that information with the Democrat majority if they would just take even just less than 5 percent of that to rein in their spending to keep it under the control of where the American public would like to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (A WALK THROUGH THE CONSTITUTION: THE PREAMBLE -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, we are here today to announce a new series of weekly topics for the Congressional Constitution Caucus. I found that many Americans, including some of my fellow Members, are not as familiar with the Constitution as they might want to be. 
   Last Thursday this was demonstrated to us when three local schoolchildren, ages 8 to 12, came into the office. They were wearing these little ``Liberty Day Kids'' T-shirts and buttons, and they announced that they were going to door to door in the buildings asking congressional offices questions in honor of James Madison's birthday, questions such as what is necessary to override a Presidential veto, or where do all of the appropriations bills originate from. 
   Out of curiosity we asked them if most people had been answering the questions correctly, and the children emphatically shook their heads no. So tonight and each Tuesday after votes, we hope to help correct that problem by taking a walk through the Constitution, and I encourage other Members to join us as we educate each other and the Nation about our preeminent founding document. 
   So we begin by looking at the Preamble of the Constitution. It is perhaps one of most well-known sections, the Constitution's introductory sentence, which reads, ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.'' 
   So this passage sums up in a condensed version what the Founders were intending in this document. So let's look at some of the phrases. 
   The first phrase, ``We the People of the United States.'' Now, these words by themselves almost sound trite today, but they were groundbreaking pronouncements when they were written. You see, the previous document, the Articles of Confederation, was an agreement solely between the States, and other earlier documents, including the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France and the 1783 Treaty of Paris did not even include the word ``people.'' 
   In convincing Virginia to ratify the Constitution, the Governor explained to them why the word was appropriate. He said, ``The government is for the people; and the misfortune was, that the people had no agency in the government before. If the government is to be binding on the people, are not the people the proper persons to examine its merits or defects?'' The Constitution therefore binds America together.  
   The next phrase is ``In order to form a more perfect Union.'' The Founders simply believed that the new government would be stronger than the one under the Articles of Confederation. You see, the loose confederation of States had led to bickering and ineffective government. But this new arrangement of States has allowed the States to retain their power, but also work together for the common good. 
   Thomas Jefferson wrote therefore, The union is the last anchor of our hope. 
   The third phrase is ``to establish Justice.''     
   This refers to a problem that had arisen in the State court systems. And so by creating a Supreme Court of the land, the Framers hoped to prevent egregious examples of trampled rights. But the Framers had a higher purpose in mind, too. In Federalist No. 51, James Madison wrote: ``Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit.'' 
   The next section is to provide for the common defense. This phrase is perhaps the most evident today. See, the War for Independence had been fought for that very reason; and in the years following the war, our fledgling Nation had been unable to defend itself against the Barbary pirates and also from Spain and England threats. So the States realized they needed to unite to preserve the Union. 
   The next one is very important for today. The phrase ``to promote the general welfare,'' this has been commonly interpreted to mean that the Federal Government can do almost anything as long as it accomplishes something beneficial. But you see, this definition ignores the Founders' real intent. See, they deliberately used qualifying words such as ``general'' because they meant to limit the powers rather than expand it. Think about it. Would it be proper and fair for the Federal Government to recognize certain groups over other ones, certain States over others? If the Founding Fathers didn't intend to create these special rights or special privileges or socioeconomic programs, there would not have been any reason to list the specific powers that are listed in the Constitution. 
   James Madison even stated that the ``general welfare'' clause was not intended to give Congress an open hand ``to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare.'' 
   The final section reads ``to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.'' These words come from the previous phrase, for without law, it is impossible to achieve liberty for future generations. 
   I will close by saying we look forward each week to come to the floor on Tuesdays as we walk through the Constitution week after week to better understand this important document for this House and for this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I just come to the floor tonight to commend  you and to commend the work you have done on this area with your legislation, and also your efforts tonight to try to educate the Members of this House and also the American public as well. A couple of points come to mind, and you have touched on some of them, but they hit home for me, and that is the missed opportunities of resources, is one; the issue of parental rights is another; and the overall issue of the public being mindful of what they need to look out for when it comes to campaigns. I know you touched on each of those briefly. 
   I had the opportunity to meet today with different groups, as you know we do, all day when we are not on the floor and in committee rooms. The issue of education and the issue of raising our kids came up, and we were talking about other issues other than this one. But the bottom-line issue always came to this, who cares more about your kids than you do? Who cares more about my children than I do? 
   Other people may, the teachers in the school, the local school boards may care for them, the health officials or the county and the State in Trenton, my capital, may, the bureaucrats down here in Washington or someone else may have some concern, but no one is going to care as much as the parents. We know that loving interest that the parents have in their children is that they are going to be doing right by them. Secondly, the parents are going to know what is the best interest of that child more than anyone else. 
   Parents are going to know the difference between that child, who, as you described before, may be 11 years old and in many circumstances no way, shape or form is going to be sexually active; and parents know other children, 15, 16 years old have been, are starting to be sexually active, in which case this treatment, the shot or what have you, would be appropriate. 
   I think it's what the Founding Fathers intended for this country is to have control over our lives, at the local level most possible, and when it comes to children, the most local level is the home setting and the parents. 
   So the point is that those decisions that are touching the intimate aspect of our lives and our children are best left to the parents themselves and not some bureaucrat outside. 
   The second issue is resources. You were just touching upon one when I came in. You kindly yielded over to me. The issue is about the cost and how widespread this will be, how many kids, children, this could be used for across the entire country, if what is being done in Texas and elsewhere is going to be spread across the country. 
   We live, as you know here, with limited resources, certainly limited medical resources. We want to make sure that those limited resources go to the most areas necessary. I always say, in our budget meetings, you can spend a dollar once, but that is it. You can't spend it a second or a third time. Once it's spent, it's spent. 
   So when it comes to our health care dollars, we have to decide. I rely on health officials or health professionals such as you to help us to make those decisions where those limited dollars should go, and where there is not a need. When you are talking about 8, 9, 10, 11-year-old girls who are not sexually active and most likely will not be sexually active until their maturity, there is no medical necessity for that. 
   The third point I think is this: I think this whole discussion here should be an eye opener, a light bulb going off, something. As I say, an eye opener for parents and citizens across this country to see how things can move so quickly and touch upon your families without you even knowing about it. 
   One day you are sitting at home and your wife and kids in the kitchen are just going about your normal routine, getting ready to go off to school, or what have you. The next day, all of a sudden, you are getting an edict from the Governor someplace or some other bureaucrat telling us your child is going to have to be inoculated for an ailment that they are never going to get. 
   How does that happen? It happens in a way in this case as we saw with an instructive affirmative campaign in various places around this country, saying, you know, a push by certain factors, pushing out, saying this should be done. 
   Then what happened after that? Well, the media jumps on board, as they often do, and sells us, says this is a great thing, how can you say no to this. All of a sudden it has become politically incorrect for you to stand up and say, wait a minute, I may have a question about this. Wait a minute, these are my little kids you are talking about. Wait a minute, my personal physician or pediatrician says there is no need for this. All of a sudden you are backed into a corner. 
   This is a case where I think a light bulb should go off for all parents and citizens across the country just to see how quickly these things can come down. That is why I came to the floor tonight just to commend you for throwing the light of day on this very important topic and illuminating it for all of us and for the people watching this evening to realize this is happening now. There may be other things that they need to be paying attention to, again, with regard to the health care of their children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. 
   You brought up another fact, which was good, and then you went on to the details of it more. But I think the point you raised was a good one and I would like to elaborate on for 30 seconds, and that is this: That young girls do go in this country to see their doctors, they do go to see their pediatricians. And the concern I had before, that I mentioned just about 5 minutes ago, that this current action is intervening and causing a wedge, is causing a wedge between the parent and the child. 
   The point that you are alluding to here as well is now we are actually having another wedge. I said before, the closest relation out there should be between the parent and the child, father and mother and the daughter. Maybe the next close relationship is between the doctor, the pediatrician and the child. And that is what we are talking about here when you are talking about a 9-, 10-, or 11-year-old girl is a child. So not only are we driving a wedge between the parent and the child now, the State is now also driving this wedge between the doctor, the pediatrician and the child as well. 
   The American College of Pediatrics and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons are opposed in these circumstances to legislation which would require HPV vaccinations for school attendance, because they know that they are already having that correct and proper relationship. They are already seeing that little girl once a year usually for examination. They are making the examination, and I presume that they would be able to make that determination if that child is becoming sexually active and what have you. And so they would be, just as the parents are, in a better position than a bureaucrat in a State capital someplace or a bureaucrat here in Washington to determine what sort of treatment or what sort of inoculations are needed. 
   So I just want to draw out that point you raised, that two wedges now of very close familial contact have been created by this new proposal to require this for young children. So I appreciate your bringing that point out.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, despite the hopes of the other side of the aisle, the constituents in my district are pretty smart people. When they were paying a little over $2 a gallon for gasoline a year or so ago and now they're paying upwards of $3 per gallon, they know that's an increase out of their pocket. Likewise, when it comes to taxes, when they see that they are paying so much for their taxes now on the Federal level now, and after this package goes through on the other side of the aisle, they will be paying upwards to $3,000 or more. They know, they're smart enough to realize that's a tax increase as well. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have to look to outside nonpartisan groups they call them, really nonpartisan liberal think tanks I think is the best term, for those think tanks to say that these are not tax increases when they really are. When your taxes go up from this year to the next year to the next year, that is a tax increase. 
   They talk about the budget planning process and say, don't worry, it only comes at the end of the budget. Well, you know, regular families plan during the entire budget. If you have a weekly budget for your food allotment, you want to make sure you have food at the end of the week. If you're doing a monthly budget, you plan the entire month. If you have a yearly budget or a 5-year budget as this is, you do it in the entire 5 years. And under the Democrats' budget, your taxes during the course of that time will go up. In New Jersey, you're looking at a $3,000 or more tax increase. 
   When it comes to Social Security, my constituents are also very smart and loud when they say, ``Keep your hands off of my Social Security.'' The Republican plan does that. The Republican plan stops the raid on Social Security, and it does so without a tax increase. 
   Now, there is some rumor I am hearing by some Democrats on the other side of the aisle that they may support our motion to recommit. But mind you, mark my words, if they support this motion to recommit, it will be as disingenuous as their support and their comments and other things they have done in the past this year. When they said that they were going to curtail spending, what did they actually do? They increased spending by over 11 percent in this budget. When they said they weren't going to raise your taxes, what did they do? They increased your taxes by $392 billion. And when they said that they were going to solve the AMT problem, what did they do? They did not solve it at all. 
   Support this motion to recommit.

   May 15th marks the 44th annual Peace Officers' Memorial Day and to mark the occasion, law enforcement officers from around the Nation will gather here in Washington, D.C. This visit will include a gathering here on the Capitol lawn to pay their respects to their fallen comrades. 
   All of these officers--both those who have passed and those who carry on today--deserve our gratitude and our respect, But, during this time of remembrance, I would like to especially recognize those 72 brave officers who were lost on September 11, 2001, the single deadliest day in law enforcement history. Thirty-seven of those lost were officers of the New York/New Jersey Port Authority and we are eternally indebted to them for their bravery and sacrifice on that tragic day. The memory of their service and the sacrifice their families have made on our behalf should be always in our thoughts. 
   In our great Nation, there are 870,000 sworn law enforcement officers who risk their lives daily to ensure the safety of their neighbors. Every 53 hours one of these officers is killed in the line of duty. It is in their memory that we gather each May to pay our respects to the fallen and to honor this noble profession. 
   Many thanks go to the law enforcement officers in New Jersey, here at the United States Capitol, and around the United States. We thank you for your service and join you in honoring your fallen comrades.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise now to honor an ally who has stood with us in the global war on terrorism. An ally who knows what it's like to fight for peace and for freedom. An ally that continues to pursue liberty even amid increased threats. That ally is Israel. 
   A millennia ago the Israelites providentially escaped from captivity in Egypt. That event is remembered this week as Jews around the world celebrate Passover. Yet their struggles, of course, did not end after Moses' leadership. 
   Less than 10 decades ago, Israel was one of the most violent spots on the planet as various governments sought to destroy the fledgling nation. Today, just 60 years after its establishment, Israel has prospered and contributed to the economic, scientific, medical, and agricultural success of nations both in the Middle East and around the world. 
   I am a proud cosponsor of House Concurrent Resolution 322, which recognizes the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel, and it reaffirms the bonds of close friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel. 
   Tonight I also want to recognize Israel's achievement in one particular area as well, and that is agriculture. And maybe it's fitting, with Earth Day here, this topic is especially relevant. 
   Israel is 60 percent desert, and yet scientists have found innovative farming methods that have allowed the desert there to bloom. Not only has Israel shared its newfound knowledge with the United States, but they have also shared technology and techniques with other nations which contain desert regions. 
   For example, the world's first surface drip irrigation system was developed in a Kibbutz near Beersheba in the 1960s. It was after an Israeli water engineer noticed a hedge that was noticeably different, healthier and taller. The man, Simcha Blass, used his discovery to create an irrigation device that uses friction and water pressure loss to leak drops of water at regular intervals. So today fruits and vegetable growers in many dry areas around the world use this drip irrigation method thanks to Israel. 
   In addition, scientists in Israel have developed genetically modified, disease-resistant fruits like bananas and peppers and other crops. These fruits and vegetables help expand the world's supply of food and maintain low prices at grocery stores here and abroad. 
   Since the 1970s Israel has partnered with the U.S. in several joint scientific ventures, including the Bi-national Agricultural Research Development Fund, BARD. This group basically focuses on enhancing agricultural productivity. 
   Israel has also pioneered advances in desalination. It was in Eilat, an arid city located at the intersection of the desert and the Red Sea, and it used to be a really barren settlement due to shortages in the water supply. Back then visitors had to bring their own water and wash their laundry in buckets. But today residents own swimming pools, plant flower gardens, and relax in shaded, grassy yards. It is due to desalination, and now the city is self-sufficient in maintaining its own water supply. 
   Desalination, which turns seawater into freshwater by separating salty compounds from water molecules, is now being considered here in the U.S. in places like Georgia and Texas and Florida. And according to the International Desalination Association, desalination makes up more than half of the freshwater used in the Middle East and North Africa, again thanks to Israel. 
   Clearly, Israel has demonstrated expertise in agricultural innovation. And as representative of the great State of New Jersey's Fifth District, which is home to many small farms, and New Jersey is called the Garden State, I appreciate Israel's agricultural developments and its willingness to disseminate research and to share that across international boundaries. 
   So I conclude simply by saying I salute Israel on its anniversary and its many achievements, and I thank that nation for making that nation what it is and for making the United States a better country as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (EDUCATION: THE QUALITY OF OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the ranking member for all of your work in the area of education. 
   I think the chart at my left points out the dilemma that the previous  speakers have been making. This chart shows the involvement of the Federal Government with regard to dollars, and it also reflects the issue with regard to their involvement with regulation and the like. 
   From 1966 up to 2000, as the Federal Government became more involved, dollars spent increased. And as the years have gone on, what is the result of that, basically a flat or no increase in education. 
   Two points, one point on the issue of accountability, and the other on new approaches. In the area of accountability, the question we have to ask is accountable to whom? The gentlewoman from Illinois made my case for me when she said that she was concerned about her kids and therefore she decided to run for the local school board. 
   I would suggest that the best place to get accountability is just as she did, locally, from the local school board, teachers, principals and the like. If you ask most parents who is a local teacher, they will know. If you ask who is the local principal, they will know. Ask most parents who is the Secretary of Education in Washington or the bureaucrats down here making the rules, they unfortunately will not have a clue. And yet what we have been doing over the last several decades is having them have greater accountability and responsibility than the teacher and the principal. 
   The second point is the approaches. I agree with the ranking member on this in that it is great that we have so many new approaches tried in schools across the country. The problem is when you get to a Federal level, two things happen. Sometimes you potentially nationalize some of these, and that is good if you pick out the good ones. But if you happen to pick out some of the bad ones, such as whole language in California, and that had a dismal track record and result, you can end up having a terrible effect on the entire national education system. 
   My second point is, and the ranking member made a good point on this, Washington doesn't move as quickly as local school boards. Sometimes it takes 5 years or more to reauthorization and even more years to get something done in the district. We can move more quickly at the end of the day. 
   I conclude with this. Accountability to whom, it should be accountable to the local teachers and the principals, not to somebody in Washington. 
   New approaches, it is better to be done locally. And as we move forward and move to reauthorize No Child Left Behind, I just throw out a modest, simple proposal, allow those States who need the Federal Government to tell them and dictate to them how to run their schools and so forth to stay in No Child Left Behind. But allow those States who have parents or community leaders or principals who feel that they can get it done by themselves without the Federal Government, allow those States to opt out, but also to keep their own tax dollars in that State so they can decide how their education money will be spent.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Well, it's been reported in the press that the Democrats have horrifically failed as the majority in Congress of getting almost anything done. You know, they made promise after promise to try to help the American people and, to no surprise really, most of those promises are now broken. 
   This is evident by the fact that there's been a dramatic increase in the price of oil that we all have had to suffer and go through. Some people now call that the ``Pelosi Premium.'' 
   Before taking the majority, the Democrats vowed that they would address this issue and, more importantly, that they had a plan. Well, here we are 16 months into this administration of this Congress, where's the plan? 
   Now I was on the floor just last week. At that time the cost of oil was about $115 a barrel. This week it's approaching $120 a barrel. $5 increase in just 1 week. Where is it going to be a week from now or a month from now or the summertime? I can only guess. 
   I can also guess as to when are the Democrats going to make the American people and their family budget a priority, as opposed to these other things we've been doing on the floor? 
   We really can't afford to keep on paying these skyrocketing energy prices and gas prices. If only the majority weren't so occupied with their special interest spending and earmarks, we would be able to focus on the energy problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House Committee on Foreign Affairs will consider H. Res. 106, affirming the United States' record on the Armenian genocide. I will ask my colleagues on the committee to carefully consider this resolution and the vast body of evidence that supports its conclusion. 
   The allied powers of the First World War early on recognized that the Turkish Government at that time was committing crimes against humanity by perpetrating the organized slaughter of Armenians. The U.S. Congress of that time affirmed these crimes in hearings and resolutions. Though the chief organizers of this crime were convicted of the massacres by the Turkish military courts, they never were made to pay any penalty. 
   We fully recognize now the friendship of our allies in Turkey, but it cannot change the past. I hope that there can be some reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia and that a proper acknowledgment of the crimes of the past can allow them to move forward into the future of peace and mutual understanding.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman from Texas for this amendment. And let me begin where the gentleman from the other side of the aisle concluded when he asked the question? What if there is not enough money to go around? 
   That is a question that we ask here in Congress in the House all the time. What if there's not enough money for my pet project to go around? 
   What if there's not enough money for this earmark to go around? 
   What if there's not enough money for this brand-new program to go around?  
   But let me suggest to you that there's another variation of that question that we would be mindful of, and that is the families back at home that we represent. When the mom and dad sits at their dining room table at the end of each week with their checkbook out, paying their bills, be it for the electric bill, some other utility or heating bill, their rent or their mortgage, their food bill, their health or education bill for their children, or any other vital bill that that family has, and the husband looks over to the wife, and they realize that they have all these stacks of bills in front of them, and they have more bills than they have money in their checking account, and the wife asks the husband, what now, because there's not enough money to go around, what does that family do? 
   Who does that family turn to when there's not enough money to go around? 
   I can tell you where this Congress turns to when we say there's not enough money to go around. When we say there's not enough money to go around, what this House has done, or at least in the new budget that was presented in the Budget Committee which I serve on, by the other side of the aisle, what the Democrats propose to do is to simply raise taxes. And as we have seen in the proposed budget from the other side of the aisle, it is now the largest tax increase in U.S. history, on the backs of America's families, on the backs of that very same husband and wife who is sitting there saying to themselves, there's not enough money to go around to pay our bills, to pay our mortgage, to pay our health care bills, to send our kids to go to school. 
   They can't raise taxes on anybody else. They can't go out to their neighbors and say, we can't afford food this week, we can't afford our rent this week. We can't afford to send our kids to the colleges we want to, so we're going to raise taxes on you. They can't do that. But somehow or other, Members of Congress think when they get elected around here, that we can do that by raising taxes, the largest tax increase in U.S. history, that somehow or other that we're entrusted to do such things and create slush funds and the like. 
   Well, I stand before you and say that no, that the American public has sent a message to us, to both sides of the aisle, to Republicans and Democrats alike. Yes, the Democrats are now in charge, Mr. Chairman, of this House. And they are so because the American public spoke this last November, quite candidly, because perhaps the Republicans weren't listening well enough during that period of time. 
   But I can tell you this, and those who listen to us on this floor today, the Republicans are listening very well right now, and the Democrats are not listening very well. The voters sent us a message in November and said enough is enough. We have to be concerned about the family budget sometimes instead of the Federal budget. We have to put the focus on the moms and dads out there being able to pay their bills for their kids' health care and the like, instead of always worrying about ever-increasing budgets on the Federal level. 
   Now the proposal that is before us to look at would simply look to save a few million dollars out of a several trillion dollar budget, something that most Americans, myself included, can't really get our arms around when you think about how large this budget is. In a way, it's just a drop in the bucket when it comes to the budgets back here. But to the budget of the family at home, that's still a lot of money. 
   The proposal that the good gentleman from Texas proposes here right now would simply try to rein in spending in such the smallest of ways, but it would be a good step in the right direction. It would be saying to the voters from last November, we heard you; we have to put the focus on the family budget, we're going to try to live within our means. 
   And even when we are dealing with important issues, such as the gentleman from the other side of the aisle raised, whether it's water resources or the like, we're going to fund those programs. We're going to take care of those programs, but we're going to do it in an efficient and a manageable manner, and we're going to do so in a way that is not a burden on the American family budget any longer because we have heard you, and we realize that there will never be enough dollars for every single program that every single Member of Congress and the Senate come up with. But we are going to prioritize them, put them in order of importance, put them in an order that are most significant to the American family, fund those programs to the levels that are necessary. And the rest, we are going to do just as every family in America has to do, set limits on what we are going to spend on, set limits on how much we are going to spend, and live within our means. 
   So to the good gentleman, Mr. Hensarling from Texas, I commend you for your work in trying to have this House live within its means.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor in support of yet another good and commonsense amendment. Good and common sense because it asks of this Congress to do the very same thing that any family in America and any small business in America would do under similar circumstances. 
   The American public right now is looking at, as we have already seen, the largest tax increase in U.S. history. And let me just take a moment, though, before I go into the particulars on this amendment to explain how that impacts upon the average American family. 
   There was an article in the New York Times several months ago after the Democrats proposed their budget, which is inclusive of what we have here before us, to say how would this, the  largest tax increase in American history, impact a family of four, the average American family of four maybe in the Fifth Congressional District, maybe in Bergen County, which is one of the great counties of New Jersey that I represent, an average family of four, four individuals, making around $70,000, which I should point out by no means in the great State of New Jersey would be considered by most people an affluent family. That family would see their taxes, because of this underlying legislation combined with the overall budget, go up by upwards to $1,500, $1,600 year. That would mean $1,500 or $1,600 more coming to the Federal Treasury into the Federal checkbook as opposed to being able to stay in the family checkbook. That means $1,500 or $1,600 more coming down to the Washington bureaucrats as opposed to being able to remain in the family checkbook on the kitchen table where Mom and Dad are able to decide should those dollars be spent on their son's college education, on their daughter's health care expenses, on their in-laws' necessary expenses that they must share with, whatever else, to Washington as opposed to the family budget. 
   Now, the good gentleman from Colorado comes up with an amendment to try to address that. If we are able to hold the line on overall spending just as an average family would have to do, we would not see the need for this, the largest tax increase in American history. And what does the good gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) do? Well, he simply says hold the line on spending for, let us say, the bureaucrats, if you will, all good men and women, I am sure, the people in the policy and administration account under this bill, under the Bureau of Reclamation, hold the spending at 2007 levels. By doing so, we will be saving some money. That will represent a $1.236 million reduction, from $58.8 million to $57.57 million. 
   Some of you may say in this grand scheme of things when we are looking at our Federal budget upwards of almost $3 trillion, saving $1.2 million is not that much. But the flip side of that argument is if it really isn't that much of a cut, then it really shouldn't be that much to bear for the Federal Government. If we are not really not cutting that much, then the bureaucrats and the rest who have such a huge budget as it is should not feel the squeeze that much. But all we are asking them to do, like any other family does, is to live on their budget for this year. 
   I ask how many Americans saw their income rise last year by one, two, two- 1/2 times the rate of inflation? I can tell you quite candidly most of the people that I talk to in my district, unfortunately, did not see their incomes rise that much, but yet that is what we are asking them to do in the sense of higher taxes to pay for the increase in spending for the overall budget that we have here. 
   Let me just conclude in the same way that the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) does in his letter. He says, and I think these are the most poignant words: ``We must restore fiscal discipline and assure the American people that we are doing whatever is necessary to reduce our national debt. To do this, we must find both commonsense and innovative ways to do more with less. The American people have asked Congress to rein in Federal spending and to tighten its belt. This reasonable amendment does just that.'' And he asks us all from both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat alike, to join with the gentleman from Colorado to work to make sure that we do not have the largest tax increase in American history, to work to make sure that we have a system that is common sense, efficient, and appropriate on the Federal level, just as we have asked for the American family at home.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I think it is a significant point that you raise with regard to what level of American taxpayers will be subjected to these taxes. 
   I come from the great State of New Jersey, where we had similar rhetoric, if you will, from the other side of the aisle on the State level. And we actually heard the exact same arguments being made: Don't worry, they're going to come up with what they call the millionaires' tax; and if you're not a millionaire, don't worry about it. Well, truth be told, after all the dust was scattered away from the bills, after all the hearings were held, after all the press conferences and everything else was done by the Democrats in the State of New Jersey, we found that that level went from $1 million to $900,000 to $800,000 to $700,000 to $600,000 to $500,000, $400,000, $300,000, 250-some-odd thousand dollars at the end of the day. Now, you still say they may be a large income? Well, in the State of New Jersey, if you're a two-income family making a hundred-some-odd thousand dollars, you found that you would still be subject to tax on that.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, first of all before I begin, let me commend a prior speaker, the gentleman from Texas, with his references to homeland security and the efforts that need to be made. I completely concur with the majority of the points that he makes. 
   This House, as you know, just dealt with those issues the other day on homeland security and how it relates to my congressional district is one of the forefront issues that I deal with. I commend the points he is making there. 
   Tied to homeland security is energy security as well. We will not be a secure country if we are not secure with regard to our energy needs. Much in  this underlying legislation and what the administration is calling for is working towards that laudable goal, energy efficiency and renewable energies as well. And I concur with the previous speaker with his remarks as well, that we must move in that direction. 
   I guess the rub is how you get to some of these things. When you talk to your local constituents back at home. When we have the opportunity to go back to our districts and talk to them and they see just how Washington spends their very hard-earned dollars, they must think we are literally burning their dollars down here and wasting them on inefficient programs. Some of them of course are important. Others need to be prioritized down the line to put them in the proper perspective. 
   The legislation we have before us, more specifically the amendment, goes to that ultimate goal, setting priorities. Now the gentleman who is proposing this amendment is from the great State of California, a very warm State. I have come from the great Northeast where weatherization is a critical matter, especially for the low-income individuals who need to do something in order to make sure that their limited dollars go as far as they possibly can. 
   They are called upon in their daily lives to be as efficient as they can with their limited dollars, whether it is spending on food or rent costs, or in this case, their energy costs. 
   But they are asking us the very same thing in Washington. They are asking us to be efficient and effective with their dollars because they want to tell us these dollars are limited as well. Because it comes out of the American taxpayers' pocketbook. 
   What we are looking at here is the largest tax increase in U.S. history, and this is going to be a negative impact on the average American family of $1,500 or $2,000 more that comes out of their wallets and is sent to Washington. They are asking to make sure that the dollars spent are done effectively. 
   I am a Member of the 108th Congress. I came in with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and a few others, I believe, that started a group called WWW, Washington Waste Watchers. They would come to the floor each week and talk about areas of concern to them and this entire Congress to make sure that Washington moves in the right direction, to be stopping this wasteful spending of dollars. 
   So before we take a program that is already in existence, that we know as the testimony here earlier from the gentleman from California may be a laudable program in some sense in terms of providing assistance to those who need it, but it is wasting the dollars in another sense because it is not really getting to those individuals who desperately need it, and it is going elsewhere and being done in an inefficient manner. 
   Before we simply up the dollars and not make sure that those dollars get to those low- and moderate-income people to get the job done, as the gentleman from California pointed out, let's make sure that we have something, something to make sure that we do so in an efficient and effective manner. That is what the WWW, Washington Waste Watchers, is trying to do. That is what the Republican side of the aisle is trying to do. 
   Let's implement programs to say we will operate this House of Representatives the same as a family's budget would; that we will operate just as stringently with our dollars here as if they were our very own. We will make sure that there are systems in place, accountability in place to make sure that the dollars really get to the places they need to get to. And before we get those mechanisms set up and established, we are not going to waste any more taxpayer dollars by going to them and saying we are going to raise tax dollars or raise tax rates, and simply up the spending on a program until we can certify that program is being run effectively and efficiently. 
   I commend the gentleman from California for trying to move in the right direction to make sure that we don't have the largest tax increase in history, and to make sure that programs like this are run efficiently and effectively.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Before I begin, let me just say I concur with the gentleman from Minnesota on his priorities that he is setting forth, and I cannot honestly say that I am familiar with each and every aspect of the provisions that he is raising there; but from his testimony before the House right now, they seem to at least rise to the level of significance, especially when you go to the concern of making sure that people need to have adequate drinking supply. So I appreciate him coming to the floor and making that point. 
   I think the gentleman's point coincides with the point that I wish to make right now in support of the gentleman's amendment that is on the floor before us right now, and that is that it's incumbent upon this House and this body to set priorities. The American public asks no less of us, inasmuch as we are spending their hard-earned tax dollars. The American public has seen the misapplication of setting of priorities of this House in past administrations and past Houses in the past. 
   The American public has been outspoken when they saw, with regard to what happened with Katrina, and the infamous case of buying of FEMA trailers, literally thousands of them, that were then set on land and never used for their rightful purposes. The American public was outraged when they said the priorities were not appropriately spent with their tax dollars in that instance. 
   Likewise we were outraged when they heard about the proverbial ``bridge to nowhere.'' Again they asked were not priorities set as to where their tax dollars go when it comes to transportation purposes. 
   Again, finally in the area of earmarks, and the latter point raises the earmarks. When the American public hears about the litany of earmarks that come out of both this House and Senate as well, the Cowgirl Hall of Fame and other such things, again the American public asks are priorities not set on these matters, again, with their hard-earned tax dollars. 
   Well, the American public spoke this last November and at least this side of the aisle heard them loud and clear. We must set appropriate priorities when it comes to the American tax dollars.  
   Unfortunately, unfortunately, the priorities that seem to be coming from the other side of the aisle in the majority of cases are not the appropriate priorities that the American public would set for themselves. Priority number one from the other side of the aisle is a budget which raises taxes, the largest tax increase in U.S. history upon the American family. 
   Priority number two from the other side of the aisle appears to be an increase in spending with little or no regard to accountability or cutting spending in any areas. We see that in this case. 
   When I hear the arguments made, both pro and con in this bill, I am taken aback. All this amendment simply does is to say that the American taxpayer dollars should not be there and spent to subsidize Big Oil. 
   We had similar language in legislation last year. I know I supported it saying that the American taxpayer, in light of oil now being sold at over $60 a barrel, should not be forced into a situation anymore to support Big Oil in coal industries when it comes to these things through tax credits and tax cuts. I supported those, saying the American public in that regard. 
   But, now, today, when we have a Member, Congressman Kline, saying let's at least rein in, let's at least set some priorities as to where our energy dollars should go, let's go to those areas, as the gentleman here said, perhaps some who support carbon capture issues; let's have some of those dollars, as a Member from the other side of the aisle says, go to renewable energy resources, whether it be wind, water or geothermal or et cetera. Let those dollars go to those areas, but let's set the priorities of those dollars to go specifically to those areas and not on extraneous purposes, as we saw in this bill. 
   Congressman Kline gave a couple of examples that really just threw me when I heard them once again. The American public must really scratch their head, as I did, when they say, should we be giving, as Congressman Kline said, given the record profits being made by oil, gas and coal, the research of oil and gas resources of the Russian Arctic should be done and paid for by those oil companies and not by American taxpayers. This amendment simply goes to make sure that occurs. 
   Likewise, again in the Arctic area, submersible deployed microdrill sampling, ultralight cement and oil and gas resource assessments in that area. Who should be paying for that? The American public? 
   We already pay for that when we go to the pump each time. Shouldn't it be the oil companies who should make it a private investment and not the American tax borrowers? This amendment simply says let's set those priorities, let's reduce spending on those areas and make sure that we have the dollars from the American public to spend on those other areas, be they renewable energy or otherwise.     
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor to speak in favor of this very important amendment. 
   Serving on the Budget Committee, as I have the honor and privilege of doing, I see the relevance of addressing such an amendment as this, that goes to the very heart of the principles that Republicans bring to the handling of the budget. 
   As the previous gentleman just ended his remarks, I will begin mine. What we have seen in the last several weeks with regard to the legislation that is coming down, what I have seen as a member of the Budget Committee, gives us, this House, the largest tax increase in U.S. history, a breaking of the promises under rules that have been made during the past campaign, the establishment, which we were able to defeat this past week, of the creation of slush funds to hide some of those dollars going forward. 
   Why is all of that relevant to the amendment that is here before us? From a very practical purpose, when a family or a small business sets about to handle its daily budget, how do they do so? They do so from a logical perspective in deciding what is in the best interest of that family as far as the purchases they make, or when a business sets out to create its budget for the year ahead and the purchases that it will be required to make. 
   How does it do so? It does so on a logical, regional basis. It looks out at all the purviews and the parameters of the opportunities before them, and then decides what is best for their family or for their business. 
   You can say a family does a competitive bidding process, although the average family probably doesn't think of it that way. When they do their shopping from grocery store to grocery store, or from Wal-Mart to Target or to Kmart or wherever else, they are, in fact, engaging in a competitive business process, business nature, if you will. 
   When a business does it, a small business, which is the backbone of the American economy, they engage in a competitive business bidding process as well. They know what they need in order for their business to survive in this year and this quarter and the years ahead. They know what the parameters are and the order that they must meet. They will go out and about and engage in a competition, if you will, between the options that are out there before them and decide which one works best for them, which is at the best price, which is the most economical and which is the most efficient. 
   If the family budget can make these decisions, if the small businesses of this country can make those decisions, then I think it's incumbent upon us here in this House, this House of the people, to make, likewise, those decisions in the same manner as well. As the gentleman from Texas often says, the focus should be on the family budget and not on the Federal budget. 
   Likewise, when it comes to the way we handle the taxpayers' dollars, the focus should be on the same way the family and the small business handle their budget and their procurement, instead of the role and the methods we have done in the past. 
   That's why I come to the floor this afternoon in support of the other gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), his amendment today. Because that's simply what this amendment will do, will strike section 105 from the bill and that is the section which prohibits funds from being used under OMB's circular 876, which is basically the outsourcing proposed process: ``to process or approve a competition with regard to the Army Corps of Engineers.'' 
   By striking this provision, OMB would be allowed to use a competitive process in conducting private-public competition to determine who, the government agency or a private business, performs certain activities. Just think for a moment, if we were to engage in such activities, how much further the hard-earned tax dollar of the American  public could go in this House, in this American economy that we have. Just think how many more of these necessary programs that we are called upon to support could be engaged in and provided. 
   Now, I come from the great State of New Jersey, a State that oftentimes has to look to the core and to the Federal Government for various programs to provide for the health and safety of the citizens of not only my district but my State as well. 
   Think for a moment how much further we would be able to go in providing these services to the State in my district and my county, and through the State of New Jersey as well. Think of how much further we could go if we could be able to provide these services in a more economical and efficient basis. 
   The amendment before us does that. It will allow for the operation of the Federal Government to engage itself the same way as a small business does, the same way as a family budget does. 
   Closing then, bringing this all back to my opening comments with regard to what we have seen at the beginning of the process with the Democrat budget and what we have seen in the past several weeks with regard to the largest tax increase for the American family in U.S. history, what this amendment will do is drive down the pressure on this government to raise taxes on the backs of American families.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I am pleased to come to the floor today with my colleague from New Jersey, Morristown, and also my other colleague here as well from Connecticut, CHRISTOPHER SHAYS, as we propose an amendment that will ask the FAA to basically more closely consider how their proposed airspace redesign plan will impact upon the quality of life of the residents of the State of New Jersey, from Connecticut, and also from the State of New York as well. 
   Now, we all recognize that the skies over our area are more crowded than ever before, and air travel is, obviously, a worthy goal. But the FAA must make noise and air pollution a top consideration whenever they work to redesign their airspace.  
   Residents of the communities across the five States are facing a threat now to the quiet of their communities and also to the value of their homes as well. The residents of my area, the Fifth District of New Jersey, are especially concerned about this. Just recently we held what you call a town meeting of sorts, and nearly 1,500 people came out to the public hearing up in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey, and that was just about a month ago. And they came out to voice their concerns directly to the FAA. 
   The FAA received comments from all present, but wouldn't it have been a lot better if the FAA had taken those comments before they drafted their preferred alternative? The citizens who came to that meeting left with a deep concern that the FAA just is not listening. So this amendment is really here to help force the FAA to listen to those people in the area. 
   So as noise in these communities increases, there is a very real possibility that the values of their homes are going to decrease. Residents are concerned their communities are going to be drastically affected by the fact that the FAA is simply trying to save 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes from the travelers' air time. 
   So, in conclusion, we are simply asking now through this amendment that the FAA reconsider their preferred alternative with an eye towards protecting the communities and considering that at the same time that they consider the air travelers as well.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I recall last term in the 109th Congress in the Budget Committee where I served the gentleman from Minnesota who's no longer with us, Mr. Gutknecht, who made a point with regard to spending by this House and Washington, D.C. You know, in that committee you could always put up charts on the wall with regard to spending, chart A on mandatory spending or B on discretionary spending or health care or other spending. You would put them all up there. And Gil one time went through all the charts and he said, now, can you put up the chart of all the people and lobbyists that come down to Washington to ask for a reduction in their program and spending? And of course they put up a blank screen. Of course, Gil's point was, no one ever comes to Washington, no lobbyist ever comes before the House or committee and says that their program should see a flatlining or a reduction in their programs. And that's really the point here tonight, and it has been all last week. 
   We are here to set the priorities because everyone that comes to every Member of Congress looks for us to spend more on them, and so we must set priorities because they won't do it for us. So just as the American family has to set priorities, we do. Just as the American family says, we're not going to buy a cable TV system and a Dish TV system and a satellite TV system, we're going to set priorities, pick one if we can afford it. Maybe we can't afford it at all. And when it comes to heating our house, we're not going to have electric heat and hot water heat and coal heat and gas heat. We're going to pick one, hopefully the most efficient. That's what families do. And we would hope that Congress does the exact same thing with the money. Set priorities. 
   And this amendment really just calls us on doing that, looking to see, not a 6.7 percent increase but a 6.2 percent increase and try to set priorities.     
   Now, the other side of the aisle says, well, we are being stingy with all these programs if we are not able to go up by a 6.7 percent increase. 
   I would suggest to the other side of the aisle maybe they are not looking at the right side of the ledger, the right side of the equation. Look at the families who have to pay for all these inefficient, duplicative, and unnecessary programs that they want to spend taxpayer dollars on. Look instead at the American family when it comes to education. 
   When it comes to education, well, if they do successfully pass the largest tax increase in U.S. history, which they are about to do, the American family is going to have to see their educational spending cut. The American family is going to have to decide whether they can send all of their children to college or not. 
   The other side should look at the issue of health care for the American family because what they want to do is tell the American taxpayer, you have to cut your spending on health care. Maybe you have a child that needs new braces or glasses or something like that. Well, with their tax increases, the American family is asked to cut their spending. 
   How about housing? The other side of the aisle would say the same thing. Maybe it is a young family trying to start off to save enough money to buy their first house. Well, the other side of the aisle would like to raise their taxes on them so that they can put these duplicative programs through, and they will not be able to afford their housing. 
   Finally, most importantly, after the other side puts on all these burdens when it comes to cutting the taxpayer with regard to education or health care or housing, the biggest burden is on time. When the Democrats raise the largest tax increase in American history on the American family, what they are also doing is taking away time from the American family because now families which weren't working two jobs now have to work two jobs. Families that weren't working overtime before now have to work overtime just to pay for the extra burden that this government in Washington, under Democrat leadership, is imposing on them. 
   So the most basic thing we could all look for, time with our family, is being robbed, is being taxed, is being taken away from the American family just so we can implement what the Democrats see as necessary, but truthfully we have shown are not priorities, truthfully are unnecessary, duplicative, hugely increased, inefficient programs. 
   Let's focus again back on the American family. Let's focus again back on allowing them to have time with their family and put the burden where it should be. 
   I support this amendment and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do so as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor realizing that there is a problem on Wall Street that will affect Main Street, and I also come here today hopeful, but also realistic. 
   I will not be supporting this bill today, but I know the bill will pass later on because so much has been added to it to get the votes. But I am hopeful then that all the promises that have been made by the proponents of this bill will come true, after we give $700 billion to Secretary Paulson and whoever follows him 2 or 3 months from now. The promise is that the markets will open up and the markets will go up and credit will be free-flowing soon. 
   But I come here also realistic, realistic to know that if you don't tackle the underlying problems, we will be right back in this House again on this floor seeking more money and more reform. Realistic also to know if you don't allow for alternatives, you will not get the best bill. And we know that Speaker Pelosi and the White House were not open to listening to any alternatives, and there were alternatives out there. And realistic also in knowing that if you fail to investigate earlier enough, these problems will come up, as they have. 
   Back in the spring of this year, we, my Republican colleagues, asked for investigations on this matter, and we were rebuffed, being told by the chairman, ``I do not think it is necessary that we have hearings on the soonest possible date.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I come here not in support of this bill, but in support of doing something, in light of the remarks of economist Robert Shimer, who said, ``The U.S. has long been a beacon of free markets. When economic conditions turn sour in other countries, we give very clear instructions on what to do; balance the budget, maintain free trade, the rule of law, and do not prop up failing enterprise.'' 
   He said it. I agree with him. That has always been the U.S. approach, and I believe it is the correct approach. 
   But when the United States ignores its own advice in this situation, we reduce our credibility of this stance. Rewriting the rules of the game at this stage will therefore have serious ramifications, not only for the people of this country, but for the globe and the world as well. You see, Madam Speaker, the social costs of this are far, far greater than the $700 billion that we talk about today.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (CONDEMNING THE ONGOING PALESTINIAN ROCKET ATTACKS ON ISRAELI CIVILIANS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, today the United States Congress will stand up for the people of Israel by sending a message to the terrorists and also to those countries that aid them. Rocket attacks and intentional violence against innocent civilians will not be tolerated. Israeli communities like Sderot and Ashkelon have sustained terrible, egregious damage, and the citizens have suffered from serious injuries, even fatalities. I should point out that oftentimes Palestinians as well, those who do not support the violence, are also victims of the crossfire. It is time that this brutality come to an end for all people. 
   Passing this resolution today truly is just a stepping stone to help end those egregious, aggressive acts of Palestinian terrorists and ensuring that innocent civilians in Israel can live together and live peacefully. It is violent Palestinian groups and terrorist organizations that must be held accountable for their horrific acts. Organizations such as Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committee, the PRC, need to understand that when they attack the people of Israel, the United States and other countries and the U.S. House of Representatives will not remain silent. Unjust actions like this must not go unpunished. 
   Today, we have a gentleman from one of those communities, Sderot, with us here in the House, in the House galleries. If he was here on the floor with us, he could share with us the life-and-death circumstances that he and his family and his neighbors and his community experience on a day-to-day basis. 
   As we are here on the floor of this House, in the safety of this city and of this community and of this country, we have to think about the men and women, think about the children who are back there right now, the children who, for all we may know, are in their safe rooms cowering, wondering when the next attack may be coming. 
   Many of those members of the community have already made the decision that it is just unbearable to live under that threat, under the constant pressure of not knowing when the next attack, when the next missile strike will come. And upwards around 20 percent of the country or the community has left, fled the area to safer havens, wherever they may be. 
   If this was an incident occurring in our country, along the borders of the United States, would we sit idly by while our neighboring country or the terrorists within that were lobbing rockets into it, into our territory? I think not. 
   It is for that reason that it is so unfortunate that other portions of the world community, parts of the U.N., have condemned Israel for taking defensive measures such as they have here. 
   I come to the floor today with my colleagues as well from both sides of the aisle and I appreciate the bipartisan support, to say, who will condemn the attackers? 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, I will. We will. This House of Representatives will, and this country will. Rest assured that I will continue to ensure that the Islamic radicals are held responsible for launching these vicious attacks, and also that countries like Iran, Egypt and Syria, which support terrorists and allow this activity to continue, should be held accountable as well. 
   I will join with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to continue this fight until the global community joins in with the U.S. in condemning terrorism and its violent acts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we come today on the floor in September, 9 months into the 110th Congress under Democrat control where they promised us the most open, honest and transparent Congress in U.S. history. And looking back at yesterday on their last rules decision, what have they wrought? Just the opposite. 
   I come to the floor today, as well, to oppose this rule and to oppose the closed-door proceedings and partisanship that the other side has exhibited yesterday with the way that they handled their rule. Their methodology is basically closing out the voices of almost half of Americans when they want to have their voice heard here in this Congress. I, too, came and submitted an amendment to the committee. Although the other side indicates that 13 amendments were approved, there were no single Republican-initiated amendments approved last night. That is because, as I said, half of America's voices were silenced. 
   Now, the amendment to the rule that I proposed is quite simple, to try to bring back fairness to this flood program, a flood program that most Americans would support in a bipartisan approach. Picture this, if you will, out on  perhaps the California Coast you have a mansion, a PreFIRM home, a mansion owned by some megastar, a movie star millionaire in that home. He is paying one rate for insurance. Next door, literally across the street, is this little 1970s home, a little bungalow, owned by a poor widow. She now is paying higher rates for her insurance. She, in essence, is subsidizing that multimillionaire movie star on the other side in this lavish megamansion that he may own by this poor widow. 
   Can't we do something about that? Yes. I propose an amendment that would bring actuarial fairness to this system. And I should say this, too. This was discussed in committee. The chairman of the committee said that he would work with me. My staff did work with his staff. I did work with the chairman. And the chairman even agreed with our language. The chairman even agreed, and I believe testified before the Rules Committee, that what we were doing here was bringing fairness to the committee and the rules process last night. 
   So, at this time, in my closing comments, I would just ask if the gentlewoman would be willing to enter into a colloquy to explain why is it that she will not, and the Rules Committee would not, enter into a discussion on this bill in Rules, and why is it that they wish to exclude this rule, and why would the gentlewoman in the Rules Committee decide that we should not have fairness, and why should the poor widow be subsidizing the rich and the millionaires in this country? 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman if she can explain why this amendment was excluded last night.

   If the gentlewoman could explain on the merits? I would gladly yield to the gentlewoman if the gentlewoman could address the point as to why this particular amendment was not considered to be appropriate to be considered for this rule, and why it is that we should have the poor and the infirm and those people who have been living in their homes for decades have to subsidize the rich and the wealthy in this country. 
   I would yield to the gentlewoman, if she would explain why the inequity should continue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to come to the floor tonight as we wrap up this week's session in Congress. It was just last week, Monday, the 17th of September, when we celebrated the 220th anniversary of the signing of our founding document of this country, the Constitution. It was on September 17, 1787, 39 revolutionary and visionary Founding Fathers changed the course of history in this land and the world as well. 
   It came about after months of deliberations. What they did was succeed in securing liberties and freedoms that were, quite honestly, unimaginable to previous civilizations. I should just note, to commemorate this and honor the civilization's most ingenious governmental guidelines that we recognized last week, I introduced House Resolution 646 to that end. 
   Tonight I come to the floor, as we do often as part of the Constitutional Caucus, to raise up the issue of the Constitution, that seminal document, that document that we should be looking to each and every day when House Members and Senate Members come to the floor after having deliberated various issues and bills, and taking out of their pocket their voting card and sliding into that slot, to ask themselves: Is what we are about to vote on constitutional? Is it within the confines of the Founding Fathers' document? 
   Tonight I am joined by my colleagues, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), and I believe shortly the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) as well, as we deliberate and discuss the issues of the Constitution. 
   We do this for several purposes. It is an illuminating event we believe both for Members of Congress and also for the general public as well, an opportunity to explore and expand and expound upon this important document. Because if we lose that, if we lose that as a guiding principle, obviously there will be nothing as a guide for us or a restriction into the role we are elected to abide by. 
   Tonight we will touch on various issues, all within the confines of that document, but we are generally going to stay within the area of voting. Some legislation that we have looked at in the past, and I will probably touch upon a little later on, and some legislation that is coming down the pipe fairly shortly, to address some of the issues that people have raised throughout the country with regard to the veracity of past voting patterns in this country.     
   So at this point, I would like to turn the microphone over to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) for his comments, who I always appreciate Mr. Bishop's insight.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. First of all, let me say I am impressed by  your opening comment, and I guess this is just a typical reflection of your dedication to an issue. Your opening comment was you began to look at this issue back in the year 2000, and here we are at 2007. And knowing your dedication to this issue, to the way you handle matters is that you have been looking at it ever since then and investigating it to make sure that you come up with the very best answer. So I commend you for that. This is just reflective of how you handle just about every issue that I have ever known you to deal with, that you stick onto it early on and then stick with it right to the end. 
   Before I play a little of devil's advocate with you on this, if I may, the gentleman from Utah is probably a better historian than I am. But it is interesting, when we talk about paper ballots and ballots in general, people today probably have somewhat of a misconception about the veracity or accuracy and the legitimacy, I guess you might say, of past elections in this country, way before we had those electronic machines today or the mechanical machines that you were referring to earlier. I know the stories from reading textbooks and school books and what have you is that election days in this country years ago were celebratory days more so than they are today. Nowadays, we have to really push people to the polls. Years ago, it was something people, I don't want to say, spontaneously wanted to do, but they actually were more excited about it. 
   Although, one of the ways I understand that they were encouraged to come to the polls was through town celebrations. And that is, in the county seats or that sort of thing, the candidates who were running for office would host large parties, and what would happen is people would come from the countryside and the hillsides and what have you into the county seat where they would be voting. And this would be a large celebration where food and beverages, I suppose adult beverages, as Rush Limbaugh would say, would be served, what have you, so it would be a celebratory time. People would come in and they would vote, and they would vote with, back then of course all there was was paper ballots, and many times the paper ballots were color coordinated paper ballots. And so if you were voting for STEVE KING in that election, you might be voting with a blue ballot, and if you were voting for SCOTT GARRETT, you might have the brown ballot. So it would be a way that actually going into the election booth there was no secrecy to it, because you would be getting your brown ballot from the Garrett campaign or the blue ballot from the King campaign, and you would be going in. And that would also indicate which party, literally, which party you came to, and then you would put it into the election box. 
   I don't know whether the gentleman from Utah knows those stories as well.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. And on that point, how this ties in besides a history lesson, which I think is important as well, how it ties into one of your comments was one of the suggestions that has been made, and you touched upon it, was with regard to a paper ballot today would be either simply that you would have a single paper ballot that you would take with you when you leave, and that would be the only receipt. Or, I think you suggested both. In other words, a paper ballot would be made and printed that would go into a locked box, plus you would get a receipt to confirm how you voted. So there would be two. 
   The dilemma with either scenario, where you take a ballot out with you, goes back to what we are referencing right here. Now when you leave the poll, you have some document to prove how you just voted. Now, not to suggest that anyone in this day and age is paying people to vote, although we have heard such accusations, but of course without any documentation, someone can say, well, here is $25 to you if you will vote for my candidacy in the election. And of course the guy will take the $25 and come out of the election booth and say, ``Don't worry, I voted for you,'' and there is no proof that you did. If, however, there is a paper receipt, now you can come back and say, ``Well, here is the proof that I just voted for you or your candidate. Give me my $25.'' Or whatever the going rate may be in certain cities or elsewhere to confirm that I did. So I am not sure whether you have ever heard of that dilemma with that.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. And the gentleman from Utah made a passing reference to the 17th amendment earlier on, and then I will yield back to the gentleman from Iowa. But just to illuminate on that point, originally the Founding Fathers of course intended that the other body, the Senate, would be elected not by direct vote but by the legislators of those States. And the idea behind that was probably to address the point that the gentleman from Utah just made; that the various States, such as Utah, which is probably ahead of the curve in just about every facet of running a government that we have seen so far, based on his testimony and previous evenings, the State of Utah prior to the passage of the 17th amendment would have elected their U.S. Senators through their State legislators. That Senator many times would have come from the Utah State Legislature prior to coming to Washington, would know what Utah was doing, and would have a personal stake or a local interest in maintaining the integrity and the sovereignty of that State. Likewise, from Iowa or New Jersey as well. 
   Obviously, the 17th amendment changed that, so now the U.S. Senators are now directly elected by the citizens of the respective States, and you break that bond between the sovereign issue that a legislature may have had. And you may have seen that reason on this issue coming from the bill from the other side of the aisle that we are talking about here, or some of the other issues that we have talked about on the floor as well as Congress begins to exceed its bounds and actually sees no bounds with regard to our control in every aspect of our lives. 
   Earlier today, just to digress for a moment, we voted on the flood insurance bill and we were going to expand into a wind map plan and for wind insurance as well. Basically, the Republican side of the aisle voted ``no'' on that bill, primarily because they said we would be exercising outside and pushing pressures on the economic forces that are already there providing that coverage. And really, the question is as I said at outset of my opening comments, and they often do when you put your card in here to vote is, does the Congress have that authority? Prior to the 17th amendment, a U.S. Senator would say, no, we have that authority in our own States to handle the regulation, whether it is insurance or otherwise, and want to confine ourselves to confine the Congress or the Senate to the areas that the Founding Fathers intended. Voting, of course, is a carefully construed area in the Constitution, and I will just close on this before I yield back to the gentleman. 
   Earlier, there was another issue, and I know the gentleman spoke quite a bit on this issue several months back. This House had another heated debate, if you will, when it came to a voting issue, and that was whether or not we would give voting rights to the citizens here of the District of Columbia, and I know the gentleman from Iowa also, I believe, came to the floor and spoke extensively on that topic.     
   And the answer to that issue, as much as the other side, just as on this issue, just as the other side would like to stand up on this issue and say, well, we have the infinite detail and plan to the finite level to the Nth degree on how to do this issue that we have before us today as far as every little nook and cranny has to be covered on voting. They said the same thing when it came to the D.C. voting rights as well. We know what is best and how to implement that program and voting rights for the District of Columbia, 
   And well, may they should or may they did; what they didn't seem to do with that one, nor apparently did they do in this case as well is look, as you and I would suggest they probably should have, and I think you discussed it at the time, to a copy of the U.S. Constitution. And had they done so, they would have realized on that issue, I'm not going to redebate that issue, but had they done so, they would have realized that the Constitution specifically addressed the issue of the District of Columbia and how it should be set up and how the control of the District would be. The Constitution also defined who is a citizen in terms of voting and who is a representative and that he would come from a State. And of course this is not a State. So all you really have to do on many of these cases is look to the terms of the Constitution, and they begin to answer some of these questions. 
   But I have a question for the gentleman from Iowa, again just to look at some of the finer points to it. You raised the issue of actually having a piece of paper, a trail, if you will, and you raised the question whether or not we can trust the electronic aspect of the machines and what have you. Just to be the proverbial Devil's advocate with you, some people would suggest that, well, for our entire financial system in this country nowadays, we look to electronic transfers and what have you and we rely on that nowadays, as opposed to paper ballots or paper documentations. 
   And likewise, there is another suggestion in this area, whether it comes from Congress or it comes from the States, as opposed to a paper ballot, but an electronic receipt, if you will. And I'll just give you one of these and then I will close. 
   One of the suggestions for an electronic receipt would be not a written message that I just voted for a Steve King, but an electronic voice activation message that I just voted for Steve King. So instead of going into the ballot booth, and I don't know whether the gentleman's ever heard of this proposal before, and pushing the button and clicking down on a piece of paper, electronically it would record and you would hear, vote for Steve King for U.S. Senate. 
   Would you see any of those as alternatives to this as we move into the electronic age to be an equal or sufficient record?

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. And I thank the gentlelady. And as our time comes to a close here shortly, I'd just like to say I appreciate her comments and also to say she hits on the point directly as far as the role and appropriate breadth and scope of the Congress, the Senate, and the Federal Government. You know, the U.S. Constitution, article I, section 1, the very beginning of the Constitution sets forth the parameters, if you will, of the role and responsibilities of the Federal Government. They are then, that point is reinforced in a couple of different ways, actually, when you think about it, both there and at the end. There it's reinforced in the section in as much as article I, section 8 sets out specifically what are the appropriate roles, and it delineates what the appropriate roles are for the Federal Government. 
   And an interesting thing there, and I don't want to go into too much detail on the verbiage of the Constitution here tonight as it's getting late, but many people often look to critics on the other side on this point, and on article I, section 8 say, well, in there is  what is called the general welfare clause, and for that reason, Congress has the right and ability to move on and act on any sort of issue that they want to.     
   But a closer study of the Constitution points out that the article I section 8 general welfare clause comes before the delineation of the specific points and authority granted to the Federal Government. That is at the beginning of the Constitution. At the very end of the Constitution, at least back in 1787 and a couple years after that with the adoption of the first ten amendments, which eventually we call the Bill of Rights, the 10th amendment, of course, is the one germane to this discussion and all of our discussions on the floor with regard to the Constitution and the role of Congress, and that is that it says all rights not specifically delegated to the Federal Government are retained by the States and the people respectively, which those two points tied together reinforces the gentlewoman's comment that we have to be careful as far as the role of the Federal Government in these areas. 
   So it is appropriate that when we look to the bill that comes from the other side of the aisle on this issue of voting, which is so expansive in scope as far as its authority that it is trying to impose and so restrictive at the same time as far as what they are allowing the States to do, it is appropriate for us to come and discuss that issue and debate that issue to find out if there is not a better way. And that's why I very much appreciate the gentleman from Iowa's being with us tonight. 
   I see the gentleman from Iowa is back with us again, and I yield to him.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Reclaiming my time, I agree with that and I appreciate that. 
   And I think that the seminal answer to your question of what was in the minds, if you will, of the Founding Fathers when they created the Electoral College was if they wanted the electors to have freedom to make that decision so it was their own wisdom that would be decided on the day of the casting of the ballot, which is what I believe that the Founders intended. Their alternative would have been to say, no, that you are bound by however you were elected. Well, if you were going to be bound by however you were elected, then in reality there's no need to actually have a person there to make that decision to cast the ballot. The Constitution would have been worded completely differently to say that, in effect, it was not an automaton but an automatic collection of all the votes. The majority of votes would not go to a specific elector, Steve King, but the majority of the votes would then therefore go to that candidate, whoever those electors are specifically delegated to vote for, whom they were representing. In other words, you would not need to elect a delegate, an elector, if he was going to be bound without any discretion. 
   I think the Founding Fathers realized that still within the confines of the limited amount of times that the electors, within the terminology of the Constitution, had to actually vote following the popular vote, there was still that flexibility that they could consider whatever changing moment the times may have necessitated them to do. 
   And of course, also, the other aspect of that that you didn't get into is the election of the Vice President and how the electorals play in that as well.

You think about John Quincy Adams, who was first in Congress and then President, and then went back to sitting in Congress once again after he served as President. I think he was the only one that ever did that, and I cannot imagine any President today leaving the White House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I just come to the floor to rise to answer the question that the gentleman from the other side just raised as far as the information that the shareholders have the right to know, and I agree with him completely. The shareholders do have a right to know what is going on in the corporations that they are investing in. 
   When you think about it, what should be the ultimate objective of any of the legislation that we are addressing here today or any of the amendments that we are addressing here today? And that, I think, is to make sure that the shareholders, A, have information, and, B, have the best return on their investment possible, whether we are talking about senior citizens who are relying upon their investments for their pensions and their security for their remaining days and they have to make absolutely certain that these investments are good investments because this is what they are relying on because they are no longer working or whether these are young people who are just starting out and are beginning to put a way a little money for their children for their education 5, 10, 15, 20 years down the road. 
   They want to be sure that their investments have a good return as well. They want to have information as well. Or maybe it is somebody in their middle years, such as myself, 40, 47 years old. We want to make sure that the money that we set aside for our retirement is going to be there and that we are getting a good return. So we want information as well. So the gentleman on the other side of the aisle is correct when he says we need to know that information. 
   Well, that is exactly what this amendment does. This is to provide more information. And that is exactly what the SEC has already done with their proposed rules and regulations as far as providing more information to the American investor as far as the pay packages that are going to CEOs. 
   So let's step back again and see what is already out there. The SEC has initiated proceedings to make sure that the investor, whether it is a senior citizen, middle-income family, or a young person starting out, has the information that should be available to them. And I commend the gentleman from Georgia because he is following on in that tradition of making sure investors have additional information. Because what do we not want to do by any legislation that passes through this House? What we should not want to do is to hurt the investor. What we should not want to do is to add costs to the system that are unnecessary. What we should not want to do is hurt that senior citizen by adding a burdensome process to the system that will actually diminish the value of his or her current investments. 
   What we should not want to do is hurt that young family just starting out putting money aside for their children's education by hurting the investments that they have already made. The underlying language in this bill has the potential to do that. This amendment by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) will alleviate that problem. 
   This amendment simply asks to investigate, to study, to find out, to perform, to provide transparency, if you will, to the system to make sure that whatever we do here is for the benefit of the investor in the long run. 
   I will just close on this: the other day I had my own amendment, which says that, like the other side of the aisle, we too on this side of the aisle agree that some of the pay packages that we read about in the media seem egregiously high or very excessive and what have you and we have our questions about them as well; but like this amendment and my amendment that came yesterday, we all want to do the same thing and make sure that at the end of the day the investor is not hurt by the actions of the other side of the aisle or by Congress, but are helped.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, this House will soon be considering a reauthorization of No Child Left Behind. Now, when President Bush signed No Child Left Behind into law 5 years ago, the theory went that schools would raise their standards and strive to make improvements and that this would then eventually trickle down and assist all, even the underperforming students that needed the help the most. Now as we now reconsider this reauthorization of this bill, I submit that many of these changes brought on by this bill have had tremendous burdensome unintended consequences.  
   See, instead of giving local school districts the flexibility to develop their own curriculum, they are instead hampered by the NCLB's testing requirements and must tailor their classes now around these tests. Instead of schools setting their standards high in an aggressive drive towards excellence, we have seen just the opposite. In order to maintain their Federal funding, the States are now setting their standards low. In essence, it's a race to the bottom, if you will, as far as standards in this country. And instead of allowing our educators to focus on education, NCLB has instituted some absurd regulatory burdens on the States. 
   According to the GAO, 41 percent of the financial support and staffing of State education agencies was a product of Federal dollars and regulations. In other words, this means that the Federal Government was the cause of 41 percent of the administrative burden at the State level, despite the fact that the Federal Government only sends 7 percent of overall education funding in this country. 
   Also, according to the GAO, the testing requirements of NCLB alone will cost States around $1.9 billion between 2002 and 2008 and spend up towards 6.6 million hours to administer all the paperwork that comes with it as well. 
   Now, I recently held a town hall meeting on NCLB. Every person that came to that meeting, showed up, had something negative to say about the administrative burdens in NCLB. At one point during the meeting I asked how many people had contact and met with either their local principal or their local school board about some of these problems. Just about every hand in the room went up. 
   So then I said, Well, how many people here in the room went and talked to somebody down at the New Jersey capital, the New Jersey Department of Education? About half the people raised their hand. 
   I said finally, Well, how many people went to Washington and took the time out to go and visit somebody with the U.S. Department of Education? Only one person raised their hand. 
   You see, my point in this is, by instituting these requirements for NCLB in Washington, we are moving accountability for education farther and farther away from where it belongs: parents, students, educators at the local level. 
   In addition to this, the regulations NCLB places on schools often attempts to fix problems that really don't exist. 
   One of the schools in my district consistently was cited in publications as one of the top performing schools in the State, but it was placed, because of NCLB, on its watch list 2 years after NCLB was instituted. Now, notice, this was not an underperforming school. Every year nearly 100 percent of the kids graduated. Most went on to college. The average combined scores of SATs was 1100; 14 AP programs were offered at the school. This was a great school. But instead, NCLB found it underperforming. And because of this, now the teachers and administrators at this school have to turn their attention away from what they were doing, which was running an excellent school and now focus on the paperwork and the burdensome accountability requirements of NCLB. So less good education is coming about because of this. 
   Now, let me be clear. I share, along with all my colleagues from both sides of aisle in Congress here, the ultimate goal of providing a high quality education for every child in America. This year I introduced legislation that would allow a State then to opt out of the majority of the requirements of NCLB, but, at the same time, would allow that State to keep their education funding through a refundable tax credit. 
   My bill is H.R. 3177. I call it the LEARN Act. That stands for Local Education Authority Return Now. It gives the States the ability to opt out of NCLB and provides residents of those States a State tax credit equal to the amount of money that otherwise would have gone to Washington and then come back to their State for Federal funding. What it does is give control back to the States, allow them, the States, the parents, the school boards, the option to pursue local and State educational initiatives based on what they know is best for their kids. It allows the States and local school districts to set their own standards, enforce their own penalties for failure, and establish their own goals for their teachers and their students. With my bill, education accountability is transferred from D.C. bureaucrats back to the people who know the schools and the students personally. 
   See, under my proposal, States that feel that the regulation of NCLB is both necessary and beneficial to continue on, well, they can stay in the system. If they need Washington bureaucrats in their State to tell them what to do, well, they can stay in NCLB. 
   However, if the State's residents feel that the responsibility for educating their children is best left in the hands of the State, then this legislation will empower them to do so and keep the funding in place that the States rely on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman. 
   I rise to oppose this legislation which is really unfair and unjust to the people of the State of New Jersey. I say so because it perpetuates an unfair system to our State, our State made up of commuters, because it does not change a system where in fact we do not get back a dollar on a dollar. Our commuters only get back pennies, 87 cents on a dollar in the current system, and this perpetuates that system. 
   See, New Jersey is a commuter State. Whether you work or play, you  have to rely on your car or truck to get around, and you're being attacked both from our State capital and in Washington, D.C. 
   You're being attacked by our State capital by perpetual toll increases from High Point to Cape May, from Alpha to LBI, there are always threats of higher taxes there. And in D.C., we're under attack as well for the failure of this Congress and this Democrat leadership of passing an energy package. 
   With gasoline at $3.50 a gallon and diesel at $4 a gallon, where it costs over $1,000 to fill up your truck to get to work or to get to school or elsewhere, New Jersey commuters are consistently being attacked by a system out of control in our State capital and our national capital as well, and that is why I stand here opposed to this legislation until we change the existing system of funding for tax administration.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I wish to rise to say that I appreciate the work of both the Chair and ranking member with regard to their work on behalf of veterans of this country. 
   The amendment that is before us is an amendment to seek increase in funds for the State veterans homes. It does so in the amount of $10 million. There are 126 facilities, veterans homes, across the 50 States and Puerto Rico. These are State veterans homes and they care for nearly 30,000 of our Nation's heroes. The number of veterans that are going to be requiring care is large and is going to continue to grow through the year 2020. And the conflict today is leading to more veterans that will need special care throughout the rest of their lives. 
   As many of our veterans move into these extended care facilities, we must continue here in this House to ensure that the facilities are both safe and comfortable for the residents. As you may know, there is an extensive list of backlogged projects just waiting for the funds, many of them in the area of critical health and safety needs. Of the $500 million of projects waiting for Federal funds, nearly half are classified as priority one. 
   We must also see that these facilities are able to provide for high quality of life as well for those individuals who have made great sacrifices in the past years for our Nation. These are homes, as I said before, for our heroes. They are not simply institutions that we are funding. If we are not able to fund the priority one projects that I am worried about, these homes will be inadequate and we will not be honoring our veterans. 
   The staff at these homes work hard to honor our veterans and work with them to provide that they have, for the remaining years of their lives, a comfortable environment. I have had the opportunity to spend some time in these veterans home, particularly the Paramus Veterans Home in my district in Bergen County, and I particularly had the chance to visit with the people who live there and the staff and their friends and relatives who come along. In addition to that, there are local veterans service organizations that have worked hard to secure State matching funds for these essential projects as well at this facility, just as their counterparts are doing the same sort of thing all across this country in their homes as well. 
   Finally, I would like to point this out, that our colleagues in the Senate Appropriations Committee just this week approved $250 million for this account. So including my amendment here would still mean that we are falling short of where the Senate is by around $75 million; so I therefore believe that this $10 million is well called for. 
   While this backlog is much greater than what this amendment can provide, I wanted to call attention to this difficulty these homes currently are facing and have been facing for some period of time, and I hope that we can work together now to find a way to honor these vets and make sure that they receive the best care and the best quality of life in their remaining days. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. As you know, this is not an issue that is new. I actually brought this up and talked about this back early in the year in the Budget Committee, and we had a discussion on it at that time. 
   Just a question to you: That account you are referencing where we are drawing the money from has grown as well, has it not? 
   Two questions. And the second question is there are other aspects of that account other than just that provision that you are referencing; so does it necessarily mean, in your opinion, that if we do withdraw some funds from the fairly large account that it will have a detrimental effect on the area that you are specifying, one which I agree with?

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. And we are on the same page as far as both aspects that we wish the Department to deal with. 
   On this amendment, I think your comment was ``just not this year.'' And obviously as a Member who has been here 4 years now fighting, as you have also, probably before me, but myself here on this floor fighting for these  veterans homes, fighting literally for the ones back in my districts as well for the veterans there and seeing just the smallest improvements in just a certain number of the safety areas. And there are other area safety areas that would seem to me to need improvements in and health areas as well, and we just can't get the funds.     
   And the quality of life even goes beyond those issues as far as what these gentlemen need in these homes. 
   So I bring this amendment to the floor today for that reason, firstly. And secondly, also from a pragmatic point of view that this will go to the Senate and, as I did make the reference, that the Senate has already marked it up even significantly higher than what the gentleman has already done. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, we come here this afternoon on the eve of one-quarter of the way through the 110th Congress, and we have to ask ourselves, what now that the Democrats are in control of this House have they wrought? Three things: The largest tax increase in America's history on America's families; secondly, a breaking of the rules and/or their promises; and finally, what we learned last night, slush funds in very important appropriations bills. 
   If you were listening to this discussion last night, some of our friends on the other side of the aisle, in essence, justified their actions here today with this legislation by looking back to a couple of incidents in the past, back in the 1990s or what have you, and said, well, if it was done in the past, we're going to continue this tradition in the future. 
   I think the gentleman from Minnesota raised the point before quite accurately. Did they not hear the message that the voters of this country sent in the November election? I can tell you, we heard that message loud and clear. 
   The American public is tired of politics as usual. The American public is tired of the games in Washington. The American public is tired of changing the rules as you go along just to get your end. 
   We heard that message, and that is why we came to the floor last night and today. We are not politicizing this. We are just trying to protect the American public on important issues such as homeland security. At the end of the day, we heard. On the other side of the aisle, we thought the other side of the aisle did. 
   On these three points, tax increases. I have the opportunity and honor of serving on the Budget Committee, and I quite honestly was amazed, after all the hearings that we heard at the beginning of the year about the fiscal constraints we should be living under and the problems that we have, and yet we saw the budget that they presented us at the time of a $392 million tax increase in their original budget would affect everybody with tax increases. 
   Increase in the marginal rate of $182 billion; reduction in the child tax credit of $27 billion; increase in the marriage penalty of $13 billion; increase in the death tax, $91 billion; increase in the capital gains and dividend tax, $32 billion; other tax increases, $47 billion, all huge numbers. But if you break it right down to the individual family, you know what it comes out to be? Well, the New York Times answered that question. 
   They said the average family of four living in my area in the State of New Jersey, would see their taxes go up by around $50 or $100 or more. That's what the other side gave us when they gave us the largest tax increase in U.S. history. 
   Breaking of the record, breaking of promises, breaking of the rules. Well, if you follow what we do here on the floor, you will recall that it was just about a month ago when the other side of the aisle was trying to change the rules of the House that had been put in place as far back as 1820 to allow the minority to have the opportunity to offer motions to recommit and the like in the manner in which we have done in the past, as I say, for over 200 years. We fortunately were able to thwart those moves. We hopefully will be able to thwart their moves now as they try to break the rules again when it comes to transparencies and earmarks and the like. 
   And finally, when it comes to the third point, slush funds, slush funds? Can you imagine that we're still talking about in this day and age Members from the other side of the aisle creating an appropriation process where there are slush funds, where one Member is going to decide where literally billions and billions of American taxpayers' dollars go? 
   These are not just my comments as far as the criticism of the other side of the aisle. Let's take a look at what outside individuals and the media are commenting on this. 
   Public Citizen's Craig Holman said, speaking of what the Democrats are doing, ``It violates the whole spirit of the reform itself. We really did expect that earmark requests were going to be an open book so that all of America could sit there and take a look at who is requesting what earmark.'' 
   Over on CNN, not a conservative network by any means, CNN's John Roberts said, ``The question people are asking today is, 'What happened to the Democrats' promise to shed light on the earmarks?' Because this plan as announced seems to do the opposite.'' 
   Brianna Keilar, also from CNN, ``Democrats now are on the defense with Republicans ..... But advocacy  groups say'' their actions ``still violate the spirit of what Democrats said they would do when they came into power in January.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, we are not trivializing this. If anything, the other side of the aisle is trivializing a very important piece of legislation, Homeland Security, an issue that is extremely important to my district, inasmuch as we live in the shadows of the Twin Towers. 
   Let's hear what the American public says and return civility and the rule of law to the House of Representatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentlelady, and I'll consume just a portion of the time. 
   First off, to the gentleman from the other side of the aisle asking what truth is, and he went through a litany of truths, I ask, are his truths the same truths as America's truths when it comes to what is occurring here? 
   And as the gentleman behind me from Michigan, who is often quoting lyrics of music from Jesus Christ Superstar, are truths not unchanging law? And in this case, I would suggest that they are. Your laws are constantly being changed, or I should say your rules are constantly being broken that you implement and that you promise. So your truths are simply truths based upon laws that have been rules that you decide in November you're going to promise and then later on break. 
   As I've said each time that I come to this floor, what has this Congress under the Democrat leadership brought us? The largest tax increase in U.S. history; a breaking of the rules, so that now we see that they can change their definition of truths; and as we learned last night, surpluses, or rather, hidden fees and funds within these accounts as well. 
   But the point that I wanted to make at this point is to a point that the chairman raised last night, and that is to the difficulty of actually trying to address these earmarks. He said that they would rely upon the staff of his committee to effectuate this. 
   While I think we all take our hats off and commend the work of his committee. The staffers for the Appropriations Committee are probably some of the best and the brightest that this House has. These Members of the Appropriations Committee are also the same Members who appropriate their own salaries, for that matter. That committee is charged with the responsibility of bringing these facts not only to the House, but to the American public as well. 
   If the truth is that they are unable to perform their job, perhaps they can look outside this Chamber for assistance. I have a letter here of an organization, a good government organization, that made such an offer. Tim Phillips from Americans for Prosperity indicated to Chairman Obey just a week ago, realizing what he had heard as well from Chairman Obey that he is having difficulty, as he said, the extra time ``to evaluate the 36,000-plus earmark requests that have been submitted to the Appropriations Committee this year.'' 
   The chairman says, I think we have a hell of a lot more ability than the individual working alone to do it, referencing the staff. 
   Well, Mr. Phillips, of American Prosperity came up with, I think, an appropriate manner or way to address these problems, if his committee and his staff and himself are not able to get this job done on time as the American public wants him to. May I read from the letter which says, ``I think that the thousands, the millions of individual taxpayers, working together, could greatly aid you in completing your earmark request evaluation before you resort to sticking earmarks into unamendable final legislation behind the closed doors of a conference committee. That's why, on behalf of thousands of Americans for Prosperity members from coast to coast, I'm writing to offer our help to you and your staff in evaluating this year's earmark request.'' 
   You know, it's interesting. The chairman said last night that it would take literally weeks, if not months, to get the job done if they were to start right now. I think we have to ask the question, why are we even considering them starting right now? Why haven't they started weeks ago on this matter? 
   Let me get back to the letter. ``As you know, Internet technology has made research faster and easier than at any previous time in history.'' This is the crux of the argument. ``By releasing your 36,000 earmark requests to Americans for Prosperity, our allies and other taxpayer groups, and to concerned citizens around the country, we will be able to unleash taxpayers across the country in a cooperative effort to determine which Members of Congress may have financial conflicts attached to their earmark requests, which local projects may be unworthy of Federal funding and which may be of value to the taxpayer.'' 
   He thanks him for the consideration, the members of Americans for Prosperity, millions of taxpayers who stand ready to help to evaluate those 36,000 earmark requests because, after all, it  is those millions of American taxpayers, they're the ones, at the end of the day, who are going to be responsible for paying for those requests. 
   The least that we can do in this House is, if the chairman and his committee and his side of the aisle cannot get the job done, the least we can do is turn over that responsibility and seek the assistance of the American taxpayer. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Fallin). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the ayes appeared to have it.

   And what has this leadership wrought for the American public? During this time, firstly, the largest tax increase on the American family in U.S. history; secondly, a breaking of the rules, a breaking of the rules and the promises of transparency and openness that they made to the American public and that the GOP, the Republicans, began to initiate in the last Congress; and finally, we learned last night from this new majority, they bring to us slush funds, slush funds under the direction of one man on the other side done at the late end of night to control billions of dollars. 
   The Homeland Security bill that we were debating last night and will be debating today is too important to trivialize in this manner. It is too important to the American public, and it is too important to my constituents in the 5th Congressional District of New Jersey who live in the shadows of the World Trade Center.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for heading this program tonight to bring about the Truth Squad, which when I'm not here on the floor, I'm in my office turning on C-SPAN to make sure that I can find out the latest of what the actual facts are, because we can't always be assured that we hear them correctly from the other side of the aisle. 
   Actually, that's where I want to begin on this one. I was tuning in as I was doing some work at my desk for the last 10 or so minutes of the other side of the aisle, and I was a little bit amused by their closing comment. They seem to be chagrinned by the fact that they don't have the opportunity to get the message out, if you were listening to them, that the President seems to be able to have the bully pulpit and be able to get the record straight out to the American public, and they don't. I had to scratch my head at that time because I thought, well, gee, doesn't the Democrat Party now control both this House, isn't Nancy Pelosi now the Speaker of this House? Isn't HARRY REID now the lead in the Senate as well? I thought the Democrat Party was the majority party. 
   And I know that every time that I leave this Chamber during the day there are microphones out there waiting for speakers to speak. And they're not coming to me to ask for comments; they are looking to the Democrat majority. So I think they were a little bit flippant or disingenuous, if you will, when they're saying that they're not able to get the message out. I think what they are really saying, though, is the message that is getting out is not a truthful message, and some of the points that you've already made. 
   And if I may just touch upon a point or two here. If you go back in time a little bit to when President Clinton was in office, he laid out the groundwork of what his vision was for health care in this country. He told us where he would like to take this country and maybe where his wife would also like to take this country when it comes to health care. And he said that he wanted government-run healthcare. He wanted universal, socialized, Washington-controlled health care. And how would you get there, he said? Well, he laid it out in plans; he put it out in a book, almost, for us. He said, you get there not overnight, although I guess Hillary Clinton tried to do that, but he said, no, you get there incrementally. First what you do is you insure the indigent children, then you will insure all the children, and eventually you will insure all the adults as well. And what does that bring you to? Well, that's socialized, government-run and controlled health care. Now, that may be something that he would like and maybe a small segment of this country would like, but when I go back to my constituents, they remind me that Washington government may not be the most effective and efficient entity in the entire world of delivering services. They remind me of what happened back when Katrina occurred and we had FEMA step in to try to deliver services, and it was abysmal. They remind me continuously, regardless of which party is in control, earmarks, and we can talk about that ad nauseum later on probably, about the waste, fraud and abuse when it comes to spending their hard-earned dollars on earmarks. 
   They remind me, also, some of them who were trying to leave this country during this past summer for a summertime vacation and they found out that they needed to get a visa in order to do so. And they could not get their visa even though they put in their request one, week, two weeks, three weeks, eight weeks, nine weeks in advance. A very basic function of the U.S. government to supply visas to people, and they couldn't get them on time. They remind me that the government couldn't even do one of their basic functions. 
   They remind me, finally, when it comes to what is one of the most seminal issues when it comes to any government, and that is to protect your borders, and they say, you know, Congress, here under this majority, can't even get that issue resolved and done. We can't get the money to the border security guards. We can't get that fence built along there. If the government can't do those functions, they ask me, why in the world do we want to turn over our control, life-and-death  situations, really, and you're a physician, you know this, to an entity that can't run the functions that they're doing right now. 
   They tell me, the American public, my constituents tell me that they want to make sure that health care remains in their hands, that health care remains as a private matter in the sense of a doctor-patient relationship. Maybe you want to comment on that at some point, where they're in control of the delivery, of the questions and the asking and what have you and the needs for the services, and the doctor is in control of the services that are being provided. They don't want big brother, if you will, stepping in and saying, well, no, we're going to exclude you, include you and what have you. So they are very hesitant to go down the direction that Bill Clinton wanted this country to go down and now this Democrat majority wants us to go down as well. 
   And if the gentleman would continue to yield.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. The very definition of a middle-class entitlement, which, as Bill Clinton would say, is the next step to go to socialized, government-run health care, well, the very definition of a middle-class entitlement can be seen in what the Democrats are trying to do right now with SCHIP. Look at the numbers. And I know I don't have a chart behind me like you do to have these numbers right next to me, but let's think of these basic numbers. 
   Right now the SCHIP program, as originally intended, was to fund indigent care for children, at what level? Two hundred percent of poverty. Ballpark figure, that's around $42,000 for a family of four; that's what is defined as poverty for that family. The medium income, that's the middle income in this country, for a family of four all across this country on average is about $48,000. So, $48,000 is the middle range. Any time you're going to start spending more, providing a government-run program for somebody making more than the middle by definition now becomes a middle-class entitlement, and that leads us to government-controlled health care. 
   So, when they're talking about providing services above 200, 250, 300, well, 300 percent of poverty, that would put you at approximately $62,000 for a family of four. In New Jersey, we're at 350 percent of poverty; that puts you around $72,000 for a family of four. So, by definition, they're telling us that they are not trying to create a program for the indigent and the poor in this country. By the very definition of the words they're using and the facts that are out there, they are trying to create an entitlement program for the middle class. And then of course the question is, who is going to pay for that?

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I came to the floor this week, and, America, I said, you should be concerned about what Washington is about to do. Last night I came to the floor and I said you should be alarmed about what Washington is doing because of the lack of deliberation. Today I come and say, America, you should be outraged about what Washington is about to do because Washington is not listening to you. 
   Whether you are Republican or Democrat, our offices have been hearing phone calls, 10-1, 100-1 against this proposal. But Washington is not listening. They are going ahead with the proposal as well. 
   There is a problem. We recognize the problem. We must work on it now. But we should not go for the solutions to that problem to the same people who have brought that problem to us. We should not go to the administration, who has brought this problem to us through their actions in the past; the Federal Reserve with their roller coaster interest rates from 2001 to 2004, 6 percent to 1 percent down; and then 2004 to 2007, 1 to 5 percent up; bubbles and bursts from the Fed and their false promises with Bear Stearns and AIG and GSEs. 
   Nor should we turn to the Democrat leadership that has signed on to this bill; that Democrat leadership who has given us CRAs in the past that has led to the meltdown in the subprime market. Nor should we turn to the Democrat leadership who has blocked reform in the past to these GSEs and unbelievably say they will block any reform in the future to the GSEs.     
   No. The stakes are too high to turn back to those who have brought us the problem in the first place. We should look for new solutions. And there are solutions. 
   But I will close on this, Madam Speaker. The noted University of Chicago economist, Robert Schimer, tells us that the U.S. has long been a beacon of free markets in the world. When economic conditions turn sour in Argentina or Indonesia, we give very clear instructions on what to do: Balance the budget. Cut government employment. Maintain free trade and the rule of law. And don't prop up failing enterprises. Those approaches by the U.S. are correct. 
   But when the U.S. ignores its own advice in this situation, it reduces our credibility in the future. Rewriting the rules of the game at this stage will therefore have serious ramifications not only for the people in this country but for the future of the globe. The social cost is far, far greater than any $700 billion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to address the Chamber and also to commend the gentleman for his excellent amendment. 
   As the gentleman knows, I come from, hail from the great State of New Jersey where we are all too well aware of why we are here on the floor tonight discussing the issue of homeland security. My district is in the shadows of the Twin Towers. 
   I commend the gentleman for his opening comments when he stated that we need a balance between response, recovery and prevention. I would suggest, if we're going to strike that balance, that we might want to tip that balance a little bit to the way of prevention. 
   While as glad as my constituents are, immediately in the aftermath of 9/11, of how tremendous the response was from people, not only from New York City, New Jersey, my State, the entire tristate area, but America in general to what happened on 9/11. That was the response. 
   And as great as it was, the recovery after 9/11, and putting people's lives back in order as well, the thing that most New Yorkers and all Americans would agree on is if we could have prevented 9/11 to occur in the first place, how much better that would have been. 
   Now, we just had another incident in the State of New Jersey as well, I'm sure the gentleman knows, down in the southern part of the State with regard to several terrorists, this time homegrown terrorists trying to get into a U.S. military establishment and shoot up that establishment. In that case we did not have to look at that balance with regard to response or recovery because our government did such a phenomenal job in the area of prevention. 
   And what does the gentleman's, his amendment do today? He addresses that point of prevention, trying to prevent another 9/11, trying to prevent another incident that could have occurred in the State of New Jersey and the loss of life there. 
   And what does the amendment do? It tries to restore the $10 million cut that would have occurred should this amendment not occur. 
   Now, the other side of the aisle, on this amendment and a previous amendment, and I presume for the rest of this evening as well, they will be coming to the floor defending the bureaucracy. They will be coming to the floor defending the bureaucrats. They will be coming to the floor defending the status quo. 
   I would suggest that we do not want to defend the status quo. We want to improve the situation.     
   The gentleman's amendment will do that by putting the resources where they should be, in intelligence, which is prevention so that we should never have such an incident in this country again. 
   I commend the gentleman and encourage my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support this amendment when it later comes to the floor for a vote.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. 
   And I just want to reiterate a point that you made at the end, and that is to take a brief look at history to see where our intelligence apparatus, if you will, has been in this country. 
   I was going to step up to the floor a little earlier on a previous amendment when one of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle began to give a history as to the budget process and the deficits and the like, and I was going to say at that time, we really shouldn't be looking back on some of these issues. But I think you raised a point that we need to look back to, and it brings us to the point of 9/11 and why we got there in the first place. And that was, we went through a time, following the collapse of the ``evil empire,'' as Ronald Reagan called it, the Soviet Union, the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, the end of the so-called Cold War. And there were Members from the other side of the aisle in this House and the other House, but specifically in this House who said, we do not need an intelligence apparatus in this country anymore. 
   I remember one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle said that we can even get rid of the CIA because we no longer need such an apparatus in a world free of the Soviet Union and the like. That was impetus during a previous administration, back during the Clinton administration. 
   The dollars of investments were not made during that period of time, and what was wrought because of that? What became because of that? Well, not just 9/11, which we are all familiar with. Something that people are less familiar with or already forget was the first bombing of the World Trade Center, when at that time the towers did not come down, collapsing upon the neighbors and the people in the area; but you may recall that bombing in the cellars and the trucks. 
   What it led to also was bombing of U.S. interests around the world as well. In each instance it was because of a lack of dollars and investment in apparatus, invested in our intelligence community, in the CIA and other apparatus, National Security Agency and the like. Because of that those things came about. 
   So the gentleman is absolutely correct in this case of looking back to see where we did not make the investments in the past and where our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would say continue that wrong philosophy of not investing in intelligence but instead just looking to the recovery and the response. 
   We believe that we must be looking to the prevention, as the author of this amendment said at the very outset, that we must look to the prevention, and that has come about through the investment of our intelligence. 
   So I just want to reiterate that point that the gentleman raised. Look back to history. Look at which party led us to the problems that we have today and what we need to do about it today. Look back at history.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, the 110th Congress now under Democrat leadership, we're 6 months into this Congress now. If you think about it, that's one-quarter of the way toward the completion of this term. The American public at home should be thinking, what has this new Democrat leadership wrought in many different areas? 
   What has it wrought? The largest tax increase in U.S. history, the breaking of promises during the campaign of openness, the repealing of transparency that the previous majority had instituted, repealing of the openness in the area of earmarks and budget process reform. 
   And now on top of that, on top of the largest tax increase in history, on top of the repealing of transparency and openness, slush funds, slush funds in the very appropriations bills that the majority campaigned on that they would bring a new air of relief to this House. 
   The other side has said they were trying to slow down the process, that the amendments that we make are not about the bills. Well, Mr. Chairman, this bill is a homeland security bill, and as long as I have breath, I will come to this floor and speak about trying to improve homeland security in the legislation that passes this House. 
   I represent a district that was tremendously impacted by 9/11. I do not go to a county in my district where I do not meet victims of 9/11 or family members or people who did business with or are related with victims of 9/11. 
   While the rest of the world and the rest of this country may see 9/11 as something that is going by year after year and less and less part of their lives, mine is a district that remembers it every day. Mine is a district that remembers it every year still on its anniversary. 
   So, homeland security legislation, and amendments such as this one which work to try to improve that legislation, are incredibly important to me. And more important than that, it is incredibly important to my district. 
   This piece of legislation that's before us deals with the financial aspect of homeland security. Quite candidly, this is not just a matter of dollars and cents when we talk about dollars and what we spend here in Washington. What we spend here impacts upon the Federal budget, but more important than that, it impacts upon the family budget. 
   What the average family in Bergen County, Sussex County, Passaic County, Warren County have to do every day in their lives in order to get by is impacted by what we do on this floor and what we will do on this amendment later on tonight on how much we spend. It may be vast numbers here in Washington, but it is dollars and cents back at home. 
   I have the honor to serve on the Budget Committee, and on that committee for the 4-plus years that I've been here, I felt there was one thing that both sides of the aisle generally agreed to, I thought, and that was that we have a problem in this country with regard to our deficit. The difference, however, is on how to resolve that issue. 
   The one side, as we see now in control, sees that problem and continues to exacerbate it by spending more, more than the President asked for, more than this side of the aisle would suggest is needed, more than the American public would think that we should be spending on the American Federal budget. 
   We had looked to the other side after this last election to give us relief and give us reform, and what did they give us instead? The largest tax increase in history and significant spending on top of that. I guess the two really go hand in hand. If you are going to enlarge budgets without end, well, you're going to have to look back to the American public and ask them to dig ever deeper into their pockets, into their wallets and send it here to Washington. You're going to have to ask the American public to send their hard-earned tax dollars to Washington to spend on bureaucrats in offices and other such matters as opposed to allowing the American public to keep it for themselves, for their health care need, for their children's education, for their food and their housing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I am deeply disappointed that the Democratic leadership has chosen to bring up H.R. 1700, the COPS Improvement Act of 2007, under suspension. While the Committee on Judiciary reported the bill out without objection, I am concerned that the hundreds of Members not on the committee will not have any opportunity to offer any improvements to the bill. 
   Had I been allowed the opportunity, I would have introduced an amendment to more fairly allot grants by State. According to last year's funding statistics, small States received a disproportionate amount of funds. In fact, in some cases small States have received more funds than States more than five times their population. For instance, Alabama gets more assistance than California. 
   My home State, New Jersey, a densely populated State nestled between the major metropolitan centers of New York City and Philadelphia and also home to a heavily trafficked drug corridor and its own inner-cities, receives less than 2 percent of all grants. 
   As if this imbalance weren't bad enough, the Office Management and Budget's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) graded COPS as ``not performing: results not demonstrated.'' The bill authorizes $1.15 billion for this program next fiscal year and another $4.6 billion over the next 4 years. With so much taxpayer money at stake, and so few positive results demonstrated, why is the House missing this opportunity to fully consider how we might improve a program that is failing despite its good intentions? 
   The people of New Jersey watch a disproportionate share of their Federal taxes go to Washington to carry out this unproven program in other States. And for these reasons, I regret that I simply could not support this bill on the floor today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I too join in supporting this amendment, and the gentleman from North Carolina for doing it, for saving so much money for the American taxpayer. 
   Just prior to this we heard the chairman from the other side of the aisle, in essence, asking us in some ways to trample on our free speech rights in this House. And you know, when you do that, when you ask that we not speak on important issues here in this House for hours, for a period of time, and the other side of the aisle always points out that we're spending more time this year than we did in the past years trying to debate these issues. And I think the American public, quite honestly appreciates that, whether it's 86 hours or 186 hours. I think the American public looks to Congress to make sure that we spend their money appropriately, and looks for us to debate those issues appropriately as well. 
   We, each Member of Congress, as we stand here, represents a little over 600,000 individuals, men, women and children, across this country in our respective districts. When we come to this floor and speak on this floor, we are representing their voices. We bring their voices from New Jersey to this floor. 
   And so when the other side of the aisle says, oh, you go on too long over there in the minority, well they're saying that really to my constituents. They are complaining that my constituents' voice should be silenced. And I come to the floor right now and say, no, sir, my constituents voices will not be silenced. I will speak out when I can, where I can on behalf of the constituents of the Fifth District and the State of New Jersey as well. 
   Now, I know that we're looking at a bill here with $18.6 billion. Right now we're looking at an amendment for $100,000. To us, and my constituents, that's a lot of money. And if it takes us an hour or two hours to debate this one amendment, to get consensus to save $100,000, well, that's a lot of money to my constituents, and they would say that hour or two hours of debate is well worth it. 
   Now, maybe the other side of the aisle will disagree with me. Maybe the other side of the aisle doesn't care whether we spend 50,000, 100,000 of our hard-earned tax dollars. And maybe they will accept the amendment as they did in the past, and if they do so, the $100,000 amendment, we appreciate that. 
   But you know, in that regard, this really is a bipartisan effort then. It is really two parties coming together to solve a problem. The one party, the majority party, comes to this floor, raises our taxes, increases our spending. 
   The minority party, the Republicans, equally come to the floor, and we reach out our hand and work together. While the Democrats raise our taxes and raise the spending, we reach out a hand and say how about trying to bring that spending down just a little bit by $100,000, and by bipartisan effort we're able to get that down. So this is a bipartisan day, and I hope that we will see other amendments to increase that bipartisanship as well, as we try to rein in the spending that the other side has brought us. 
   And when we talk about what the other side has brought us, and one of the reasons why we need to save this $100,000, just think of what we've gone through in the last few months already and just recently in the last couple weeks. We have seen taxpayers on the American taxpayers go up by over $400 billion in one of the first bills that House passed under the majority party of their budget. 
   We have seen just recently them raising taxes again through the farm bill. And now with this underlying bill that we'll be looking at in a little bit on the SCHIP bill, another $60 billion in taxes. 
   And let me add just one more tax increase that maybe Members of both sides of the aisle may be forgetting about. Just a few hours ago, as I look at the clock, I came out of Financial Services Committee, where we, or the majority party, added the last piece to the puzzle with regard to another tax increase on the American public, and that's the MTI. That's the mortgage tax increase. That's a tax increase on every family in America who needs to go out and get a mortgage to buy their first home or their second or an additional home as they move into it. 
   Every family in America who will want to get out a mortgage in the future will now have to pay an MTI, a mortgage tax increase, thanks to the majority party in the legislation that is just finally put in place. So whether it is an increase in the budget taxes or the farm bill or the SCHIP or now an MTI as far as a tax increase as well, we're working with the other side of the aisle. As they raise taxes on the American family, we work with them here and there, to bring down the spending to a level that our taxpayers in our districts are able to abide by. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate the gentleman from California yielding. 
   New Jersey is proud to be number one in a number of things. But, quite honestly, we do not like to be proud, we are not proud of the fact that we are number one when it comes to paying taxes in this country, whether you are talking about local taxes, sales taxes, State income taxes, property taxes. I think we are just about number one in all of those combined. 
   Yet when you take that and you add what is happening here, this could be one of the most expensive weeks for the citizens of the State of New Jersey if this House proceeds with what the Democrat leadership plans to do. 
   Now, I have the privilege of serving with you, the gentleman from California, on the Budget Committee. And as you know, we just debated, if you will, the Democrats' budget proposal just last week. Actually, we had a number of hearings over the last 3 months now, during which time we have had a number of experts come and testify on various aspects of the Federal budget and the ramifications of not doing some things in the area of mandatory spending. 
   When you think about all the rhetoric that we have heard from the other side of the aisle, and maybe it was disquieting at some times, I think the one thing that maybe we can reach across the aisle here and maybe hear one language, one word that we are on the same page on at least, in rhetoric at least, is they agree with us on this one point and that is that we should get to a balanced budget at some point. The distinction, of course, is how they get there and how we get there. 
   Now, anyone who tuned in to C-SPAN, if people did tune in C-SPAN and listen to those budget hearings that we had, they may realize, or they watch the stuff on the floor, what have you, might realize just how complex the Federal budget is. With talk of rescissions and special orders and earmarks and everything, it is a hugely complex matter that we deal with; and I appreciate your expertise that you come to the House with to be able to handle this. 
   But, in reality, if you just step back for a minute, what we all do here on the House floor and in Budget Committee isn't a heck of a lot different than what every single American family, my own included, and the residents of the State of California and New Jersey have to do every single year, every week, every month when it comes to their own family budget, and that is to say they have to live within their means. 
   Now, Washington doesn't have a good track record on this, but that is what families have to do. When it comes to families, I guess families don't really have a choice to say whether we are going to have a balanced budget or not. Washington does. People know how much money they are earning.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. No, you are absolutely right on point. The average family has to sit down and say, this is what my income is going to be for the week, the month or the year for the year ahead and say I am going to live within those means. At the same time, what they have to do is they have to set priorities. And I think that what the gentleman was also trying to elicit from the Democrats during this last budget hearing was to set priorities. What are your top-ranking priorities? What must we spend on and where should we spend it? And if there are other things that you don't want to spend on now because you don't have the money, what are they? 
   They would never agree to do that, if the gentleman recalls. That is why I think they came up with this hollow, empty trust fund which, in reality, they could have said the trust fund is this big, since it is empty, or they could have said it is this large. Because if there is no money in it, there is no limit to how large the empty promises are. 
   But the family budget can't do that, just like you said. 
   But the other thing that the Democrats in Washington are able to do, besides print money, that the average family can't do, you know what else the family can't do? They can't raise taxes. A family cannot simply go out and say, I am short on cash this week, so I am going to raise taxes. That is why I started off by saying, as you pointed out, that this is the most expensive week for a family in the Fifth Congressional District for the State of New Jersey. 
   Let me just give you one other number while I stand here. It was the New York Times, that paper did a study just recently looking at what the Democrats in the House and the Senate are proposing. They looked at it a little bit slightly differently but came up with a little bit different number, but still draws the point. 
   They looked at an average family of four making $70,000 in the State of New Jersey. Now, if you are from the State of New Jersey, I don't think anyone from either side of the aisle would say that a family making $70,000 is rich by any means. It is expensive to live in our State. 
   But they said that family, who did very well under the Republican tax decreases in 2003 that we passed with the creation of jobs and the like, that family, under the Democrats' budget that may pass this House this week, would see their taxes go up by $1,500. 
   So if you think you are rich at $70,000, which I guess the other side of the aisle thinks New Jerseyans making $70,000 are able to pay more in taxes, those taxes are going up by $1,500. I think that is a burden that that average family should not have to bear in light of the property tax. 
   The overall average is the number that you brought out for the entire State of New Jersey, approximately $3,000. You may have it in front of you. I don't have it here.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. So around $3,800 or almost $4,000. And you think about it. What could that $4,000 be used for? If you are the family and the husband and wife sitting down with your family, well, I would like to use that $4,000 to go on vacation this year. I would like to be able to use it on some other niceties or what have you. Or maybe, if they can't use it on that, maybe they have health expenses. 
   I have a daughter in college right now. Maybe they have college expenses, other things like that. I am sure they could find a use for $4,000 to spend. 
   I will yield.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. I remember one of the comments from the other side of the aisle during budget process, I think you shook your head when they said this as well, where they said, Well, if we do a tax cut, the Federal Government is subsidizing that taxpayer. And we just shook our head at that because a tax cut is not a subsidy to the American taxpayer. A tax cut is simply saying to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and family that you don't have to send quite as much of your hard-earned money each week to Washington. You are able to keep $3,800 of that money. And maybe you want to use that $3,800 in New Jersey to go on vacation to a beautiful State like the State of California.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I will just close on these thoughts: the difference that we are seeing here between what the Democrats will be proposing in their budget and the Republican alternative budget that should also come before the floor is in three areas, I think. We are both aiming towards the same goal, fortunately, of trying to reach a balanced budget by 2012, 5 years from now. But the Republican budget will reach that goal of 2012 without raising taxes by almost $400 billion, which is what your chart behind you shows. And that is critical. 
   So, number one, we will not put a burden of almost $4,000, $3,800, on the families in the State of New Jersey, $1,500 if you are a family of four making $70,000. 
   Secondly, by not raising taxes we will not be undermining the pro-growth policies of this administration and of this government over the last 10 years. Those pro-growth policies, for New Jerseyans at least, have created tremendous employment, very low unemployment, so that that family that is making that $70,000 a year or more or less in New Jersey at least knows that the unemployment rate is almost at historic lows at this point. So they know there is the opportunity for jobs, and because of that, there is great opportunity to improve yourselves in careers and what have you. And because of that pro-growth policy, we have seen the deficit shrink by 26 percent. 
   And, thirdly, and I think this is very important to everyone at home, is that we are making sure on the Republican proposal that those dollars that we do spend, because we are always going to have some spending by the Federal Government, that those dollars will not be wasted, not waste, fraud, and abuse, but will be spent on those things that are critical to my State, to your State, to national security, to homeland security, and to our veterans as well. 
   So balance the budget without raising taxes, make sure we continue the  pro-growth tax policies that we have had in the past to create jobs, and make sure that those dollars are wisely spent. They all come under the umbrella of one thing, and you said it: to realize that these dollars come from the family budget. And our focus should be on the family budget and not on the Washington budget all the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (IT IS IMPRUDENT FOR CONGRESS TO RUSH TO BAIL OUT WALL STREET -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. As the gentleman just explained, the dilemma that we are in and where the proper recourse or result should go to at this point and what the solution that has been presented us is not the correct solution, and that alternatives such as allowing the free market to develop, lowering taxes on capital gains and the like, allowing the private sector to develop an alternative, which has already occurred through the RSC and other forms here in the Republican Conference, is perhaps the better avenue to pursue. 
   Let me, though, take the next 3 or 4 minutes to answer the question that many in the American public are asking tonight, how in the world did we ever get here? 
   Well, many financial analysts will tell you that the underpinnings of the problems that we are facing today in the credit markets on Wall Street that are affecting the homeowners on Main Street go back a number of years and apply to the situation with the GSEs, that is Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And the suggestion is that had they been appropriately regulated over the years, we would not be in this severe financial crisis that we are in today. 
   So who was raising those red flags years ago to say what should have been done? Well if we go back, let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 years to 2001, in fact it was the Bush administration that began raising some red flags. In 2002 in their budget request they declared that the size of Fannie and Freddie is ``a potential problem'' and could cause financial trouble and either one of them could cause strong repercussions in the financial markets. That was back in 2002. 
   2003 is when I joined Congress and served on the Financial Services Committee. I immediately began to call for a step-up in regulations of Fannie and Freddie. The White House was at the same time doing the same thing. They said in 2003, the White House was warning about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that they needed an upgrade in what we call world-class regulation to address something called systemic risk, a risk that could spread beyond just the housing sector. In the fall of 2003 the administration was pushing Congress hard to create a new Federal agency to regulate and to supervise both Fannie and Freddie, these government-sponsored entities. They and I and other Members from our side of the aisle said that we need a strong world-class regulator to oversee their operations of their safety and soundness. 
   As a matter of fact, I recall a hearing when the then-Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Snow, came in. And he made that point as well. But I also remember him getting a lot of pushback from both sides of the aisle, but also from the gentleman who is now the chairman of the Financial Services Committee. It was back on September 25, 2003, when he was in the minority at that time, but he is now the chairman of the Financial Services Committee today, Barney Frank said ``there are people in the country who are prepared to lend money to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at less interest rates than they might get elsewhere. I thank those people for doing that. I must tell them that I hope that they are not doing that on the assumption that if things go bad, I or my colleagues will bail them out. We will not.'' 
   Well the legislation that has come through in July did exactly that, bailed them out to the tune of over $200 billion. The legislation that the gentleman who just came before me just spoke about will be bailing out the financial industry to the tune of $700 billion. 
   Mr. Frank goes on to say, ``I think it is clear that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are sufficiently secure so they are in no great danger.'' 
   Well of course we see what has happened to them. We just had a hearing on them today. And they are now in conservatorship. They were in great danger. They were in danger of systemic risk, which has eventually brought them down.  
   He also said on that day, ``I don't think we face a crisis. I don't think we have an impending disaster.'' We all just heard the President of the United States on TV last night. He described the crisis that the United States is in right now. Whether you call that an impending disaster, whether we take action or not, I don't know whether Mr. Frank would say or those who pushed back to Mr. Snow, who pushed back to the administration, who pushed back to those of us on this side of the aisle that said we need to move forward and try to address the issue of systemic risk. 
   Unfortunately those efforts did not come about. We never got the world-class regulator in over the GSEs until it was too late. And now we are left with the situation at hand. 
   The gentleman who came before spoke of the dilemma that we are faced with, a Hobbesian choice of sorts is the way it was presented last night: Either you do this or everything will fall apart. Well we suggest that there is an alternative to the proposal that the administration has proposed. We humbly suggest that alternative should be considered in a thoughtful and thought-out process, not one that is a rush to judgment, not one that would put the American taxpayer on the hook, one that would ask the private sector to take their lead and take their step in the process as well. 
   We would ask for the time in order to engage in the process.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (DEAL OR NO DEAL -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to follow the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and address the issue of the bailout. She started her talk with deal or no deal. There was talk in the media that there was a deal. We heard from Senator Dodd and the chairman of our committee and other leaders on the other side of the aisle yesterday that there was a deal. Unfortunately, the fact of the matter was that there may have been a deal between themselves and the White House, there was no deal obviously to bring the bill to the floor, or at 8 or 9 at night, we would have seen the Speaker of the House bring the bill to the floor. That is evidence of the fact that there never was a deal. 
   We do know the fact is we have a serious problem in this country, a problem that must be addressed now, a problem which requires both sides coming together to try to find the solution to the problem. 
   As the previous speaker said, there are alternative solutions on the table, solutions that economists and business schools across the country have come behind and said can be the credible solution and one which would not put the taxpayers of the country on the hook. 
   I would suggest that one way of coming to a solution is to decide that we are not going to go back to those same people who helped bring us to this problem in the first place. 
   One of the underlying problems that brought us to this situation is the fact that there was easy money in the economy for too long a period of time. From 2001 to 2004, interest rates slid from 6 percent all of the way down to 1 percent of the Fed's fund rate. There was an expression used of the Greenspan put, if you will, as far as trying to boost the economy and Wall Street all during that time. 
   Then that was followed from a switch turnaround from 2004 to 2007 where the interest rates shot up from 1 percent up to 5 1/2 percent. Let me suggest to you that those higher interest rates have been reflected in the housing market today, and will be potentially affected due to a lag time to other sections of the economy later. And that is another reason why we should not engage and support a measure as has been proposed by the White House and the other side of the aisle of spending $700 billion or anywhere near that amount of money that would put the taxpayers on hook because we can anticipate future problems due to that tightening up of the credit market by the Fed.     
   Now, another area where we should not go back to the same people who helped bring us to this problem are those very same people who helped exacerbate the problem by their misregulation of the GSEs. The GSEs, what are they? They are your Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   Those entities that supply the credit for about half of the mortgages in this country were allowed to grow out of control and to grow too large to fail and to grow to such an extent that there was systemic risk in this country  and in the marketplaces that brought us to where we are today with the crisis we are facing. 
   Now, this is something that was not unpredicted and not unforeseen. Our own administration came to this Congress in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005, in their budget requests and elsewhere, making pleas to this Congress to try to put in some regulation. ``World-class regulators'' is what they called them. Secretary Snow came to the Financial Services Committee and made that request and said we should have regulation. However, we were thwarted on every front. The current chairman of the Financial Services Committee was one who stood and said we should not do so. 
   I went back and looked into what the record of this was in 2005 to see what my position was on it and to read what I said on it. At that time in 2005, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) suggested that we could begin the process of reining in the GSEs so as to avoid systemic risk in this country with regard to them and avoid a future crisis. He put in an amendment to the bill to provide and to prevent systemic risk. 
   I came down to the floor to support the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) in his amendment. At that time, I said that I rise in support of this legislation which strengthens the language with regard to portfolios and GSEs. I indicated that GSEs claimed that they are shock absorbers. This line is somewhat ironic today. The GSEs claimed back in 2005 that they were shock absorbers to the system and that one of the main reasons that Fannie and Freddie claimed they should not have portfolio limits was that they provided a stable means of support for the residential financial market in times of crisis. How ironic that they were claiming that they could be of help in a time of crisis when, in fact, they are what have now brought us to this time of crisis. 
   Back in 2005, Fannie's CEO, Dan Mudd, testified: ``Our mortgage portfolios allow us to play a shock-absorbing function for the finance system during times of potential difficulty.'' Well, there is no function that they're serving now except that they are causing the difficulty. 
   This week, they said Freddie's president, Eugene McQuade, was quoted as saying: ``The enterprises provide a source of stability to the market, mortgage, finance system.'' 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to conclude by saying that the problems that the GSEs have brought us to today--although we were warned by the administration and although many saw it and many people from this side of the aisle--were because of the failure to implement those regulations on a timely basis. We'll discuss this further at a later date.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the good work of the gentleman from Georgia on so many areas that I work with you on, Financial Services and otherwise; but here tonight most specifically what is important to the American public and American taxpayer, and that is just how much money is coming out of their wallet, out of their pocket here and being sent down to Washington, where those dollars are going and whether are being held responsibly. 
   I am not sure whether you were on the floor at the moment, but prior to your speaking we had a Member from the other side of the aisle on the floor giving their comments, and the gentleman from the other side of the aisle, the Democratic Caucus Chair, who was speaking for a little bit about the new book that is out there on Federal responsibility and issues of such. Alan Greenspan just did the book. 
   If you listen to his comments, it almost harkens back to prior to the elections and the exact same rhetoric we heard at that time as we did just 35 minutes ago from the other side of the aisle. He was lambasting and had been lambasting this administration and the past Congresses, saying that they have spent too much money, that the past leadership in this House was being fiscally irresponsible, that they were passing bill after bill, spending increase after spending increase. 
   On and on the rhetoric went, just 35 minutes ago, the same rhetoric that we heard during the last election about looking towards the past and all the mistakes that were made in the past. 
   Now if you listen to that, you would always assume that the next words out of their mouth were going to be: but this is what we are going to do when we get into the majority. We are going to reverse those trends. If spending was too high, we are going to go in the other direction. 
   That is what you think would be the next words out of their mouth, but of course they can't be. Here we are in September, 9 months into this new 110th Congress, under the leadership now of the Democrat majority, both in this House and the Senate, and we have their track record to look at to see what course do they take. They lambasted, attacked the path of too much spending. 
   Did they reduce spending? They did not. Instead, they have piled onto that spending. Increased spending in the past was bad. Well, they exacerbated that problem by spending even more. 
   There was a study recently that goes to this point, taking a look now at this new 110th Congress. The National Taxpayers Union, basically a nonpartisan organization, looking at both sides of the aisle fairly recently did a study that shows that the 110th Congress, both Senate and House, have introduced far more bills for budget savings than they have in previous administrations, previous Congresses. 
   On first blush, that would be a positive thing until, again, you think of what the record has been over the last 9 months. Has anyone seen any of those savings bills passed through this House and passed through the Senate and get signed into law? I can't think of any. 
   It's one thing to talk the rhetoric, which they have been doing. It is another thing to drop in the savings bills, which some of them may have been doing. But when we see the leadership will not post any of those savings bills, that is the problem. For each bill introduced in this House that would reduce Federal spending, and this makes the point, there have been over 20 bills, a 20 to 1 ratio increasing the size and amount of spending in Congress. 
   If you additionally listened to the other side, they will talk about and applaud themselves and pat themselves on the back about PAYGO, which you have already discussed, which is a good term described in a very elementary way to say pay-as-you-go, something that all families have to do in this country, and we wish Congress could live by that as well. 
   Well, there are two aspects to PAYGO. One is the spending side of the  equation. Let's talk about that for a minute. I don't know whether you have this chart up there. I know you have a number of charts. One of the charts is headed ``New Majority's Fiscal Irresponsibility.'' I don't want to make you go through all your charts. 
   One of the ways you can deal with PAYGO is this, and this is exactly what every family does as well. When the family sits down and looks at their budget for that week or that month as far as paying their bills, they have to prioritize and say we may have a new expense here that we would like or need to pay, but we don't have enough money in the checkbook. So what are we going to do, we are going to reduce spending elsewhere. 
   Good idea. American families should do it; Congress should do it. This side tried to reduce spending by 2 percent. That didn't get anywhere. How about 1 percent? Can we agree there is 1 percent of waste, fraud, and abuse in Congress? You would think we could agree to that. 
   But if we could look to the chart right next to you right now, what that chart says is as follows: when that 1 percent reduction legislation was proposed to this House, who voted for it and who was against it.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I will leave you to make that point in greater detail because I think it is a significant point. 
   I will leave you on this note as well, that the other side of the ledger sheet, if you are not going to cut spending, the other side is increased revenue. I believe you will probably show a chart that you will have later on with regard to how they have been doing it. But the American public must know this in a larger sense, that since the Democrats have been in power, they have given us the largest tax increase in America's history. The last time we had such a large tax increase was back when the Democrats were in charge 12 years ago. 
   It was just a week ago, a couple of weeks ago when they wanted to raise taxes by $53 billion with regard to a piece of legislation that they had no offsets for. Additionally, just yesterday, or the day before, they wanted to raise taxes again by another billion dollars on redundant programs. 
   So as you pointed out, there are two ways to do this, either cut spending, which they are not agreeable to do, or raise taxes; and of course we have seen the history over the last month: every time they get a chance, they do that.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, as we come to the floor 9 months into the control of this House and this country by the Democratic majority, we have to ask ourselves, what has it brought? Well, it has brought us expanded government programs outside the area of jurisdiction, increase in Federal spending, and of course efforts to raise taxes on Americans. 
   Just at the very beginning of this year, it was the largest tax increase in U.S. history. A short time ago, it was a $53 billion increase through the SCHIP program. On spending, it was a $1 billion program just yesterday tried to do. And, of course, there is a litany of earmarks that we still don't know where it is going to and who is sponsoring it. 
   It was a Republican majority that forced the Democrats to give us a list of all the earmarks in their spending and have asked for more transparency. But I want to remind the American public, to this day we still do not have a list of all the earmarks, who is sponsoring them, and where the dollars are going to. 
   I encourage the Democrat majority to do as the American public must do, to live within their means, and to be open and honest as to where the American tax dollars are going to.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, I come to the floor tonight to rise in support of the gentleman's amendment. I come to the floor also to indicate my support for what we can do on this floor for labor here in America. And I think that is the optimum word, ``here'' in America. 
   This amendment will do just that. It will protect laborers in this country, and that should be the first priority of this U.S. Congress. We do that first and foremost by protecting the fruits of their labor. Their wages, their income, what they work for, 9 to 5 and longer, Monday through Friday or longer during the course of the week. We do that by ensuring that the money that we spend, their hard-earned tax dollars, is appropriately spent and appropriately prioritized. And I commend the gentleman for doing just that with this amendment. 
   There are many things that we would like to spend our dollars on. But when we are elected to public office, we are to come here and make sure that first and foremost the American citizen, and in this case, the American worker, is protected. 
   As I come to the floor tonight, as I have said in the past, we have now marked about 6 months into Democrat control of this U.S. Congress. And what has it wrought during those 6 months? The largest tax increase in U.S. history. The attempts to change historic rules of this House and in operations. And, finally, attempts to create slush funds in which dollars can be misspent on other inappropriate items, dollars that are earned from the backs and sweat of American labor. And that is why I come strongly to support this amendment by the gentleman from Texas, to make sure that their hard-earned dollars are not misspent. 
   How often have we gone back to our districts and heard the complaint of jobs in this country going overseas? Well, it is one thing to say the jobs are going overseas; it is another thing to ask the laborers in this country to support those jobs overseas. It is one thing to see our jobs flee from this country to go to foreign shores; it is another thing to ask the workers of this country, through their tax dollars, to in essence support the organizations' structure of those jobs overseas. 
   We are elected to public office to protect the workers of this country. This gentleman's proposal does just that, by making sure that their tax dollars are focused first and foremost on workers and their quality of life and their standards here in this country. We will protect American workers. We will protect American jobs. And with this amendment, we will protect the budget of the workers of America as well. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, I rise to support the gentleman's amendment, leaving aside the underlying question of the funding issue of where the dollars come from. I appreciate the ranking member's point with regard to that. 
   I want to go to the point the gentleman raises as far as the necessity and the importance of making sure that we have appropriate dollars spent on nurse education and retention and to have a level of funding for 2007. I come from the great State of New Jersey, and within the Fifth Congressional District, which I represent, I represent several, over five good hospitals and also long-term health care facilities as well. 
   As I travel about the Fifth Congressional District, and I meet with the various hospitals and the administrators from such, and I also meet with the people from the long-term health facilities as well, when I travel down to Trenton, our State capital, to meet with our State hospital associations as well, one of the first issues that always comes up in our discussion is the issue of the availability and quality of nurses in the State of New Jersey, I should say the availability of quality nurses in the State of New Jersey. Every nurse that we have is a quality nurse. We just need more of them in the State. 
   To that end, on a positive note I should add, we have initiated for some facilities in our State where we are providing more nurse training than we ever had before. One of the things, I will just say from a parochial interest, is once we do have that training for the nurses, we are going to do everything we possibly can to make sure that they stay after being trained in the State of New Jersey, but we will, of course, if need be, maybe allow them to go out to some other States as well down South, where I believe they probably have a need as well. 
   But this is a bill from a national perspective. I know the gentleman can speak to this more eloquently than I. This is not simply an issue up in the Northeast, and this is not an issue down South as well. I am sure that I can speak to any Member of this body from any portion of this country, and they will tell me similar stories that I am recounting here right now, that we have a lack of quality, skilled nurses in this country. 
   Maybe there are other underlying reasons for this. One that comes to mind, of course, is the rate of compensation for nurses. When you talk to nurses, when you consider the number of hours they put in as far as the training they have to go through initially, and then the net length of the time they have to get the other skills necessary to become a nurse, and then the amount of pay that they get, it is certainly not commensurate to what they provide to this community and to this country. On top of that, of course, is the long hours that they must struggle with in their jobs, and the conditions that they have to work with and under in certain circumstances as well. 
   So I take my hat off to the nursing establishment, the nurses, the young people, men and women that decide to go into this career. If there is anything we can do as a national body to facilitate that and encourage and foster this, I will support it. 
   So I commend the gentleman for coming up with the idea to make an amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriation bill to double funding for nurse education and retention, as they said, from the $37.2 million that's currently in the bill. 
   I commend his work. If I can work with him on this initiative or other initiatives in the future to address the issue of nurse retention, I am more than happy to do so. 
   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, the amendment that I'm offering tonight is a very simple, straightforward one. As was just read, it would remove $10 million from a program that was in fact zeroed out in the Bush administration's budget request, and then use those dollars, that money to increase the level of funding currently appropriated to the National  Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. 
   Madam Chairman, some time ago President Nixon unofficially declared a war on cancer in his State of the Union Address back in 1971. Since then much progress has been made in the area of cancer research, thankfully. And over the last 3 1/2 decades, science and research has continued to break down barriers in the fight against this dreadful disease. 
   Today, cancer is no longer the mystery disease that it once was, and researchers know infinitely more now today about the prevention, the detection and the treatment of the disease than ever before in history.     
   The results from all of this research is now beginning to bear fruit on people's lives every day. Fewer people are dying from cancer in 2004 than they were in 2003, according to the studies. An American public is witnessing declining rates for most major cases, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer as well. 
   So, Madam Chairman, I think that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee has done a good job for increasing the budget of the National Cancer Institute this year in the bill, and Republicans supported a doubling of the budget at the National Institutes of Health in past sessions. I supported that. But I think we can do just a little bit more. 
   The account that this amendment would take from is the Alaska Native Education Equity program. That is a program, like we hear so often on this floor, that is basically a redundant program that the President has eliminated in his budget request. According to the administration, the Alaska Native students already receive benefits from the department in Indian education programs, which provide more than $118 million in formula grants to school districts and competitive grants for demonstration and professional development programs. 
   Now, Madam Chairman, when we consider how the Federal Government is prioritizing its spending, which really is what it is all about when we come to the floor on each and every one of these amendments, I submit that funding cancer research is more important than spending additional redundant money on a redundant Federal program. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. The objection, if I understand it correctly, is that the assertion is that this increases the total of number of outlays for the bill. That would be the case if we are simply asking for an increase of $10 million for the Cancer Research Institute, but that is not what we are asking to be done. We are simply asking that $10 million in one line, Page 41, line 7, be increased by the $10 million but another line, page 80 line 2, after the first dollar amount insert, ``would be reduced by $10 million.'' So in point of fact, this amendment does not increase the total net dollar output of the underlying bill. It is a balanced amount. No increase, no decrease.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, I rise to support the gentleman from Georgia in his amendment. And the overall focus of his amendment is to do two things, first of which is what Congress should be asked to do by all of our constituents in all our districts from all across this country, and that is to take their hard-earned dollars that they send to us in the form of tax revenue and to prioritize them into the most efficient manner and into the most efficient programs and into the most efficient methodologies in order to get those programs effectuated for the good of the citizens. And that is what this amendment does. 
   In accord with the opinion of the administration, there are a number of programs now in existence essentially attempting to do the same thing. Here with regard to education, essentially trying to lift up the quality of education in this country, a laudable goal obviously; secondly, to lift up the quality of teachers in the classroom, again a laudable goal obviously. But we are asked to prioritize this to make sure that those dollars actually get to those programs and effectively down to the teachers, where it can do the most good. The gentleman from Georgia's amendment would do just that. 
   One of the fundamental flaws in the No Child Left Behind program is to take away the issue of authority and local control from the frontlines, and that is the classroom and that is the teacher, and shift it someplace else. The fundamental flaw with No Child Left Behind is to say that the parents should not be involved in making the decisions or the teachers should not be the ones making the ultimate decisions on how we educate our children, but it should be the bureaucrats down in Washington and unelected at that. 
   We need believe that the focus should be shifted back to the parents, back to the teachers, for those who are the people on the frontlines, those are the people who are having the day-to-day interaction with our children. 
   When you think about it, if you have kids in school or if you have neighbors with kids in school and they have a problem in the classroom, where is the first place that they go to to try to resolve that problem? They go into the schoolhouse and into the classroom and talk to the teacher. They want to get to the bottom of it right then and there. And ultimately it is a matter of making sure that that teacher is the best qualified teacher that you can actually have in that classroom. 
   Parents do not go to Washington, DC, and speak with the U.S. Department of Education to try to resolve some difficulty they have in their classroom. Parents do not come down here to speak with the Secretary of Education to deal with difficulties they have in their classroom. They go to the teacher. And they sit down and work things out to try to get to the heart of it and the root of the cause of the problem. 
   And the gentleman from Georgia realizes this. And he realizes that in order to make a better classroom where more learning can occur, where we can have better schoolhouses and classrooms, where we can raise up the quality of education, it is to raise up the quality of our teachers. The gentleman from Georgia's amendment does just that by ending programs that are ineffective, ineffectual, and don't get the job done, and transfers them over to those programs that do get the job done. In this matter we should all be commending the gentleman and support his amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that mirrors the President's budget request to eliminate funding in the bill for the Alaskan Native Education Equity Program. By so doing this, it will save our Nation's taxpayers $33.9 million. 
   Now, as with many of the programs that you will be hearing us discussing both yesterday and today and in the future, this program does, in fact, support a worthwhile goal, and that is providing additional educational services to Alaskan Natives. The services provided to Alaskan Natives that are students through this program, however, are redundant of many of the other types of programs that are provided through various other agencies, most notably through the Department's other education programs. 
   See, our funding priorities must be exactly that. When we come together as a conference and then as a body to support appropriation bills, we are called upon by the American taxpayers to set those things, priorities, just as the American family budget is created each day, each week, each month in American families across their country and they sit down at their kitchen table to decide what are their priorities when it comes to spending their hard-earned dollars. 
   They have educational interests in mind as well. They may have children that they have to decide whether they're going to be sending them to college this year or next, to a high-priced college or a moderate-priced college, et cetera. They have to set priorities when it comes to how much money will they be able to set aside in their savings account for educational purposes. Or if their kids are in a K-12 system, whether it's public school or private school, likewise, the American public has to set their own priorities, decide how much money they can set aside if they choose to send their kids to a private school. Or if their kids are going to a public school, how much money will they set aside so that they can spend on their children when it comes to educational purposes for extracurricular activities or supplements to the school program. 
   American families are called upon to do this every single day, every single week of the year with their budget. And all we are asking right now is that the U.S. Congress and the Senate do the exact same thing with their hard-earned tax dollars that they've entrusted to us. In this matter, what we are doing is saying we have several programs, the same laudable goals. We are eliminating one and shifting the dollars to the another so that the program gets done. 
   I would now like to bring my colleagues' attention to a recent report by the Nonpartisan Tax Foundation. This report details how much money each State taxpayer contributes in Federal dollars and how much money each State taxpayer receives back. This is very interesting, especially if you come from the State of New Jersey, as I do. 
   According to this report, Alaska, which is the subject of this amendment, ranks second in the Nation, getting $1.80 back for every $1 that the  taxpayers up there pay in Federal taxes. In contrast, my good State of New Jersey ranks dead last. We receive back a paltry 63 cents back for every dollar that a New Jersey taxpayer sends to Washington. What does that mean? That means that New Jersey taxpayers, working just as hard as the taxpayers up in the great State of Alaska are, are sending one dollar in with their paycheck each week, or multiple dollars as it is. But at the end of the day, when they see how Congress appropriates those dollars, New Jerseyans find out that they're only getting back 63 cents on the dollar. 
   Conversely, we look up to Alaska, the subject of this amendment. How much does every taxpayer get back from the dollar that they contribute to the good of the country and the State? They get back $1.80. It's a fairness issue, quite honestly, Madam Chairman. Where are our dollars going? 
   And with the new Democratic majority passing the largest tax increase in American history recently in its budget, the burden on New Jersey taxpayers will only continue to rise. Yet at the same time, we are providing nearly $40 million for redundant services in a State that is already nearly on a 2-1 ratio on every dollar that it sends to Washington.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, and I will be brief, we must remember that every dollar that we send to Washington comes out of that proverbial ``family budget'' that I referenced before. So when duplicate programs like this come before us, we should put ourselves in the shoes of the family in the same situation. 
   So, do you think that families would go out, families from the other side of the aisle would go out and spend their hard-earned tax dollars on a month's worth of groceries and then go out and eat every single night of the week? I don't think so. That would be duplicative. They would be spending money on the exact same thing. American families don't do that; neither should Congress. That doesn't make much sense to me, Madam Chairman, and quite frankly, neither does the funding of multiple Federal programs do the same.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Georgia. 
   And let me just begin to reference the chairman's comment as far as whether we should be excluding one set of children from this. Well, that's exactly the point; I believe that we should not be excluding any children. And the language in the bill that is before us right now excludes the children of 49 other States.     
   As the Representative of the Fifth District of New Jersey, I am concerned. I come to the floor because this underlying bill excludes the children from the State of New Jersey with this special extra funding. Let me assure the gentleman there are children with special needs in the State of New Jersey, and there are children with special needs in the State of Wisconsin as well.  They are excluded from the Alaska Native Education Program. I am trying to bring fairness to the overall program, which is also what the administration is trying to do. 
   Let me make that point by sharing with you this comment. The Alaska Native Education Program is authorized by the ESEA of 1965 and they are subject to the reauthorization. But the administration was not recommending reauthorization and, accordingly, funded it at zero. The administration, as do I, recognizes the importance of ensuring that the Alaska Native students receive appropriate educational services. This request is consistent with the administration policy of increasing resources for high-priority programs by eliminating small categorical programs that have a limited effect, such as this. 
   In addition, the services provided to Alaska Native students through this program are redundant with many of the programs through the Department's Indian Education Program already being funded. 
   School districts that wish to implement programs and services tailored to the educational and cultural needs of the Alaska Native students are able to use funds already provided under other Federal programs in the 2008 budget. That includes $1 billion in direct support for the education of Indians and Alaska Natives in addition to the significant funds that are provided to those students who receive services through broader Federal programs; grant programs such as title I grants to local educational agencies and special grants. 
   Further, let me point this out as well: Alaska Native students will also benefit in addition to $1 billion that I also already referenced. They will also benefit from the Department of Indian Education Programs, which provide more than $118 million, $118 million, in formula grants to school districts and competitive grants for demonstration and professional development programs as well. 
   You see, these programs already serve as the Department's principal vehicle for addressing those unique educational and culture-related needs which the gentleman from Wisconsin is referring to. 
   The bottom line is there are already programs established that address those concerns that the gentleman from Wisconsin raises. The administration recognized this and already requested appropriations of $1 billion overall, plus the $118 million in special formula grants. 
   So it is our position, in line with the administration, that we do need to address those specific needs of those children who are in unique circumstances such as we find with Native American Indians in Alaska. But we do not need to do it in a redundant manner. 
   Finally, I would just conclude by saying the gentleman from Wisconsin is correct. We do not want to have children not being educated, regardless of what State they come from, whether it is from New Jersey, the good State of Georgia, the good State of Wisconsin or Alaska. But we are not doing the children any favor whatsoever if we do not appropriate the dollars in a manner that effectively gets that job done. This amendment works to effectuate and ensure those kids get properly educated.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Georgia, and I would just make reference to the gentleman from Hawaii. I believe he misstates the intent of the legislation here when he says that the intent is to make sure that Alaska or Hawaii, and this bill is only on Alaska, does not get a dime. As my testimony indicated, Alaska will continue to get more than a dime, as the President's budget request included $1 billion in direct support for the education of Indian and Alaskan Natives. That is more than one dime. 
   Native Alaskans will also get $118 million in formula grants to school districts, competitive grants for demonstration and professional development programs. That is more than one dime. 
   Finally, to the gentleman from Hawaii's first point, which he agreed with the previous comment that education is best done locally and that the folks of Alaska know best about how to educate their children and the folks from Hawaii know best how to educate their children, I would presume he would agree the people from New Jersey also know how best to educate their children. 
   I would ask the gentleman from Hawaii, if he truly believes that, would he support our initiatives and my initiative in the LEARN Act to allow States to opt out of the cumbersome regulations of education from the Federal level and keep their dollars in Hawaii and keep their dollars in Alaska so they would be in the best position to educate their children.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding for just a moment. 
   As the Representative from the Fifth District of the State of New Jersey, I remind the gentleman from Alaska that the State of New Jersey has 13 congressional Representatives from both sides of the aisle. And so when the gentleman from Alaska makes reference to our Representatives from the State of New Jersey not doing their job and not appropriately representing the people of the State, I remind him that it is an accusation not against simply this one gentleman who is standing at the microphone right now proposing this one amendment, but it is an entire body of 13 gentlemen from both sides of the aisle who I say, and I commend both Representatives from the Democrat and the Republican side of the aisle, for appropriately and admirably representing the good citizens from the State of New Jersey. 
   My colleagues from the other 12 districts do not need to be defended against these rash accusations by the gentleman from Alaska. But I do come to the floor now to appropriately defend them, nonetheless. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has expired.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   I also take up the comment that the gentleman from Texas was just making reference to which the gentleman from Alaska stated in his statement what was ``my money'' or it is Alaska's money. Well, maybe that is the problem we have had in this Congress for too long, even when Republicans were in the majority and now that the Democrats are the majority, too. Too many Members of Congress see the dollars that we appropriate here not as the taxpayers' dollar, but see it as their very own personal checking account. Maybe that is the fundamental problem that we have with why we spend more and more each year. 
   I remember when the Democrats were running for office this past election. They were railing against the Republican Party, that we were the party out of control, spending more and more and more. If they were elected to office, they would come here and rein things in when it came to spending. And I served on the Budget Committee when the Democrats were in the minority, and how they railed against us from the other side of the aisle. And at times I even agreed with them on some of the charges that they made, that we were spending too much money. 
   And now when the Democrats take control, what do they do? Give us the largest tax increase in U.S. history, and we see spending continue to go through the roof. Where do those dollars come from? They come from American taxpayers, from the family budgets, from men and women in Alaska and New Jersey and across this country, working hard just to get by, and yet they are being forced by the Democrats' tax increases to send more dollars here to Washington. 
   When the gentleman from Alaska comes forth and says it is ``my money,'' maybe that is why in some respects when there are projects that are appropriated such as bridges to nowhere and the like, the American public says that is our dollars going to Washington, and it shouldn't be looked at for just such frivolous things as this.     
   The amendment that's before us right now is an appropriate amendment to say that the hard-earned tax dollars should go to programs that are necessary but be spent in an effective manner. 
   Members from all 50 States see the need to educate our children. Members from all 50 States, including the State of New Jersey, see the need to deal with the issue of Alaska native students, and that is why this administration has already requested appropriations of $1 billion for that, $118 million in other categorical aids such as that. So all we are doing is saying make sure that those dollars that come from New Jersey and elsewhere are spent effectively. 
   Finally, to close on this point of ``my money,'' maybe the gentleman from Alaska was not listening at the opening of my comments when I said that New Jersey taxpayers send a dollar to Washington and only get 63 cents back on the dollar, whereas his constituents, yes, they do much better. They send a dollar to Washington and then they get $1.80 back. 
   I would ask the gentleman from Alaska and other Members from the Democrat side of the aisle, where do they think that other 80 cents on the dollar is coming from? I will tell you it's coming from the good, hardworking taxpayers from the State of New Jersey and Connecticut and New York that are donor States to States like Alaska, that we are subsidizing their programs. 
   I would ask the gentleman from Alaska to refrain from, therefore, referring to it as his money. It is the taxpayers in the Fifth Congressional District and the rest of New Jersey, whether you're in a Democrat district or Republican district, who are helping fund these programs.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I will not use the whole 5 minutes. I just want to make one point. 
   The gentlelady from Minnesota, I believe, who was just speaking, I want to concur with a portion of her remarks with, A, the remarks with regard to the physical problem with childhood obesity in the country, and that is of a concern nationally. And, B, the problem that she set out with regard to NCLB not funding to the level necessary so that school districts across the country are put in what you might call a catch-22 situation. 
   And a catch-22 is, okay, do we, A, comply with NCLB? In which case we spend a lot of our own money on tests, fourth and 8th grade reading and math tests; or, B, if you don't comply with it, then of course you get written up in the local newspaper because your school failed, or your school didn't do very well on the test and you've become an underperforming school. And, instead, provide the funds where you would like to put them, which may well be in physical education programs. 
   So I concur with her comments on that and suggest that the solution to the problem may be multifaceted. Part of it is the gentleman's amendment right here can be one aspect to address it. And I support the gentleman's amendment to make sure that the dollars that are coming from the Federal Government go to those programs that are effectively getting the job done, including the issue of physical education and childhood obesity and what have you. And just like all the other amendments, I'm sure the gentleman will concur that you want to make sure that the money goes to those programs that really accomplish something, and are not duplicative. 
   The other aspect of the problem, however, is with NCLB and the burden that they put on the schools as saying, do I do this or do I do that; do I comply with NCLB, or do I do what I really want to do locally? And I think the answer to that is to say this: NCLB is just too top town, ordering the schools, basically you've got to do this or you've got to do that when, with all due respect to all the educated, I'll say bureaucrats, who are in the U.S. Department of Education and in all due respect to the Secretary of Education, a very nice lady and well-intentioned, the people who really can decide where the dollars can be spent best is the teacher in the classroom, the local school board in conjunction with the parents. They know whether their school has more of a problem in the area of childhood obesity than other schools. I find that, from the studies that I've seen, that it is in certain areas of States and certain demographic regions as opposed to other ones. Those are the people who really know how to decide these things. 
   And so I would concur with the gentlelady from Minnesota and suggest that the solution is, A, put the money where the dollar should go to effectively; and, B, get out from under the rubric of NCLB and just let the schools, the teachers, the parents, the local school boards first and foremost make those decisions, because they know best. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady). 
   The amendment was rejected.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I rise right now to offer what really is a modest amendment with the hopes of returning some degree of discipline to the annual appropriation process. When the President submitted his budget request, he proposed the elimination of a number of programs that were duplicative and unable to demonstrate effectiveness or otherwise not worthy of the priority of spending American taxpayers' money. 
   Generally speaking, with the savings achieved from eliminating ineffective programs, we can use it to do things such as pay off the debt or support programs that have a proven track record of success. I guess that last line I should reiterate: To support programs that already have a track record of success. 
   As I also often do, I will refer this back and make the analogy back to the American families' budget. This is really no different from what American families do every month at the proverbial dinner table. Think, for example, when it comes to TV. If a family is paying for both cable TV and DirecTV, or what I have in my house, Dish TV, chances are that they would probably decide which service suits them best as a family, and then cut one or both of the other services out. You only need one service coming into the house; cable, Direct, Dish or what have you. That is what a family would do; prioritize them. 
   Mr. Chairman, given the content of our spending bills, if the Federal Government were a homeowner and how the Federal Government operates now, well, it would pay for both the cable TV, the Dish and DirecTV, and the cable at the same time, satellite, all three or four coming into the house. 
   If the Federal Government were a family and they continued to operate as they do right now, they would probably decide that they were going to have gas heat in their house and oil heat in their house and electric heat in their house and wood heat as well. It would probably pay to dig for its own water and have a well in the backyard, all the while continuing to pay for city water coming into the house from the front. 
   That, unfortunately, is how the Federal Government operates itself. I think it is time to change. We do a disservice to the American people by not eliminating duplicative and ineffective programs. It proves that the Federal Government is unaccountable. By increasing the size of the U.S. budget, it takes that money, again, out of the family budget by sending it to Washington as tax dollars. 
   So the amendment that I am offering now would only reduce this by $2.3 million, out of a $607 billion appropriation. I used the paper before while I was sitting here trying to figure out how much of a percentage of that is. That is a .0002 percentage point reduction. I think what it does do, more importantly, is to make a statement that there are truly areas within the Federal budget where money can be saved. 
   What my amendment does is restore funding to the level requested in the President's budget. The administration zeroed this account out because it duplicates other Federal programs. The Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers, the MSFW, Program provides discretionary grants to make comprehensive vocational rehabilitation services available to migrant and seasonal farm workers with vocational disabilities. Now, if I ended right there you would think, well, what is wrong with that? 
   Well, according to the OMB, here is the problem: This program serves the exact same population and provides the exact same services as another separate Federal program already is doing, and that is the Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants Program. The acronym is VR. The authorizing legislation for the VR State Grants Program contains provisions in it to ensure that State VR agencies must reach out and serve all individuals with disabilities within the State. That includes minorities and unserved and underserved populations. 
   So what this means is that under the MSFW program, which is what we are talking about here, the Federal Government is in essence micromanaging, if you will, what essentially is a State and local government issue that is provided Federal funds through the VR program. The VR State Grants Program in the bill already is expanded by $36 million on top of the increases that were there before in the fiscal year 2007 levels. 
   So there is little need to be spending an additional $2.3 million on, yet again, a separate program that does essentially the same thing. The government, you see, does not need to buy both cable TV and satellite TV at the same time. The government does not need to  be providing funding for programs that do the exact same thing. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman reserve his point of order?

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding. 
   To answer the question of the gentleman, yes, I have picked vegetables and I have worked on a farm and I have thrown bales of hay and I have worked in the sweltering heat of greenhouses picking vegetables as well. So, yes, I do have that experience. So, yes, I do know of what I speak, to some extent, but never to the extent, I am sure, of the chairman or some of what the people go through in these situations. 
   The chairman also makes reference to words about being stingy. You know, it is awfully easy, it is awfully easy, to be a generous individual if you are using somebody else's money, and basically that is what Congress does every single day of the year. We come to the floor with the appropriation bills railing about how much more we are spending than last year and saying how generous we are, when in fact these are not our dollars. Despite the statement of the gentleman from Alaska at the last debate, these are the taxpayers' dollars coming in. 
   So it is easy to be generous with other people's money. What we here as Members of Congress should therefore do is consider ourselves in a position to be wards of that money, protect it and make sure that it goes to the most effective places. 
   I refer you now to a statement from the administration with reference to this program to point out the necessity of cutting the funding here and making sure there are funds in similar programs. The administration states this: ``This program was established as a demonstration project,'' a demonstration project, ``in the mid-1970s, and it is no longer needed to demonstrate the benefits of these strategies to serve underserved populations such as migrant and seasonal farm workers. Many of the same States have received continued funding over the last 30 years and should be able to effectively serve this population under the VR State Grant Program,'' that program that has continued to be funded in this underlying legislation, that VR program that sees a $36 million or $37 million increase in the funding. 
   The gentleman from Georgia, when he speaks to what his constituents feel, I wonder what his constituents would feel when they are told that we have a demonstration project established back in 1970 and we are still following that demonstration project to see whether or not it is necessary to run the program.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I didn't want to interrupt your comments, so I waited to be yielded time here just to respond to your statements through the Chair. 
   No, I have not ever administered or run a school. For that matter, I imagine that out of the 435 Members of Congress, there are probably one or two or three who have ever run or administered a school. And I would hate that to be the barometer or the test that we would have to take before we could ever propose an amendment, vote on an amendment, or even consider legislation that comes before the House. If that were the case, programs like the VR program would never be established in the first place. If the test is whether a Member of Congress has experience in it to propose a new program or expand a program, there is not enough educators here or people who have run title I schools to get the backing of legislation in the first place. So I would question the gentleman's premise. 
   Now the gentleman on the other hand questions our basic premise for supporting this amendment. Our basic premise is that you don't have to actually run the school to know that perhaps the best way to serve a particular segment of our country is to make sure that the dollars go to programs that are up and running and do serve that program. 
   The administration has looked at this and has seen that the program in place that we are talking about now has been in place since 1970 as a demonstration project. ``Demonstration,'' the word itself connotes the fact that this is temporary in nature. 
   Since that time, we have the VR program, which I pointed out earlier, maybe the gentleman did not hear my testimony, the VR program handles these same services. In fact, it says: ``The activities needed to successfully serve the migrant and seasonal farmwork population do not differ from those that benefit a much wider group of VR consumers.'' For example, the outreach activities in churches and community centers may be effective for identifying farmworkers with disabilities, what this amendment deals with, but they also assist in identifying other persons with disabilities who visit these places. The hiring of bilingual counselors will assist all consumers who are monolingual in a non-English language, whether they are farmworkers or not. And the provisions of the transportation services for rural areas will benefit all rural residents, whether farmworkers or not. 
   The bottom line is, our basic premise is, if you are going to serve a segment of the population, in this case individuals with disabilities and migrant farmworkers, let's do so, but let's do so with programs that are already up and running and have a track record. That is what this underlying bill does. It even does it with spending $36 million more. I think we can make sure that program runs and eliminate the duplicative program.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for coming to the floor this late hour, although on the west coast it is just early evening, and so we welcome all those who partake in these forums that we have that are educational to not only the American public, but also to our colleagues who may be in their chambers learning a little about SCHIP as we go along. 
   I was listening to your opening comments, and you were right on point on this one, as you are always right. I have great respect for your ability to have a strong grasp of the situation on a whole slew of topics. I sort of focus on certain areas like the U.N., which is one of my pet peeves, or financial services, or education and No Child Left Behind. But I know whether on the floor or at home, I can watch and be assured that you are covering thoroughly a topic of importance to the American people. And SCHIP is one of those topics. 
   You were just beginning to address the issue of the number of children that will be on SCHIP and the direction that the government is going in this area. Your chart makes the point abundantly clear. 
   Red is usually a warning sign to people. When the red flashers go off or the red lights flash, you know something is amiss, and I guess you chose the appropriate coloration of your charts that something is amiss. 
   We see back in 1998, less than a decade ago, a little over a quarter of the kids in this country were under a government-run plan, and now we are looking to see almost three-quarters of the children in this country under a government-run plan.     
   That is fine. That would be fine if you thought that the U.S. government, if Washington is in the best position to take care of and administer the health of our children. 
   But you know, you don't have to listen to The Official Truth Squad here on the floor each week to know that things are oftentimes amiss when it comes to the efficiency and the accountability of the Federal Government. 
   Heck, just look a couple of years ago when the whole issue of Katrina was coming on, there was railing from both sides of the aisle, rightfully so, when we realized that the Federal Government couldn't get into an area where it had an obligation to, and that is, to help out people in a tragic situation, whether it's home settings or others or in a health situation. 
   Likewise, I think I recall there was railing again against the Federal Government when, again, in an area that the Federal Government does have a distinct responsibility, and that is taking care of our veterans and our men and women who are in the military or returning back from the military to the facility just down the road a piece from here, and there was a question as to the conditions of those medical facilities and whether we're giving those brave men and women all the facilities and care and comfort and proper medical care that they deserve. 
   Yet, when we know that all those problems exist, there are some, especially from the other side of the aisle in this House and certainly on the other side of the aisle in the Senate, who would say that the solution to the health dilemma in this country is not by turning it back to a patient-doctor relationship, but instead of turning it to a Federal Government/doctor-patient relationship. So we are going in the wrong direction with regard to that. 
   I'd like to come back to that in a moment or two, but at this point I yield back to gentleman if he would like to speak.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. The last point you make as far as the area of intrusiveness of the Federal Government and how they are sometimes basically out of step with what is appropriate between the normal doctor-patient relationship, maybe that's because the Federal Government and all governments in general always lag behind the private sector, whatever field you might consider, as far as innovation and moving ahead and new areas. 
   I mean, think about it. You can go to the store tonight and buy any item that you possibly want, whip out your credit card and slip it through a machine. Within seconds that transaction is created, and they know your credit rating and whether you have money in that bank account to pay for that item. It's all done just in the blink of an eye. 
   Go to your local town hall or go to the IRS or go to anybody else like that and see whether they are up to date with that technology, and you will find out they are not. Those are okay, because that's not a life-and-death situation. But you, as a physician, know that when it comes to a life-and-death situation, or we all know, that we want our children and our spouses to be able to have the most up-to-date, the most innovative, the most advanced technology available to them. 
   I think that is going to be found on the marketplace of ideas that is in the general marketplace, as opposed to the convoluted, Byzantine system that we call this, the Federal Government. 
   Mr. Ryan just stated that what the Federal Government is attempting to do here, with the expansion of this program, as we come to the floor tonight, we mark approximately the sixth month of control of the Federal Government under Democrat leadership. As we mark this sixth month, we have seen the largest expansion in taxes, the largest tax increase in U.S. history. I guess, as we discussed here on the floor tonight about the Democrat plan for the expansion of the SCHIP program, we see the largest expansion intrusion into the family and personal life by the health system, by the expansion of the SCHIP system. 
   The point I just wanted to make, though, is take a look at how the system has worked so far with respect to the system, the distribution of money to the States. If you go back to I guess it was 1968 or 1969, the first couple of years under the Nixon administration, and he came up with a program of distributing money to the States that was called revenue sharing. That was a new idea at the time, and after a time we realized it didn't really work exactly the way Nixon intended it to do. In fact, he tried to do it in certain areas like education and was never able to get it into legislation. Yet the same sort of idea here, in the original version and the version that will be coming out in the Senate as well. 
   In a similar situation that we can all relate to, say you have four kids in your family, and you are going to give them all $40 to spend each week. So you give each one of your children $10 each. So here, Child One, Two, Three, Four, presumably you have better names than that for them, here is $10 each. You each get to spend it on anything you want during the course of this week. But, mind you, when the weekend comes, if you don't spend it, if one of the other ones here happens to go over their budget, and you didn't spend it all, what we are going to do is redistribute those funds to the other child there. 
   What do you think that your kids are going to do? I would imagine that each one of them is probably going to go out as soon as they possibly can, spend that full $10, and maybe even spend $11 just hoping that there will be some money left over from their siblings there to spend it. 
   Well, children, not to make the comparison here to the States, but the States here are a lot like children in  this situation. This system was set up with $40 billion initially spread out to all the States. It was done, you might say, as fair as the Federal Government goes, as far as how many children may be in the program versus how many children are under other programs. But what happened immediately after that, when they told the States, now, look, if you don't spend your money, we are going to take your leftover money and send it to the other States? Well, initially, in the first couple of years, a number of States did not spend all their money. In 2001, only 12 States exhausted their entire allotment. However, once they saw how that all came down, in 2006, 40 States used all available funds. In that same period of time, unused State funds dropped from $2 billion to only $170 million. 
   So, finally, in this past appropriations, we had to step in, because there was too few States not spending all their money, too many States spending it. So we had to come up with spending of an additional $393 million that was recently appropriated to address the 2007 shortfall. That just goes to show you one of the inherent problems in the system and the way it has been administrated in the past and, I believe, will continue under this system as well.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I know that the gentleman from Wisconsin would be able to elaborate on this in much more detail, but in the best case scenario, would that the Federal Government be awash with cash right now, and would that we had no mandatory spending problem going on in the Federal Government right now, maybe some people would want to sit down right now and say, how can we spend our extra dollars around the country? 
   But as the gentleman can elaborate in much detail, and we have seen in the Budget Committee for the first months of this year, testimony after testimony after testimony, expert after expert after expert from all spectrums of authority, we are now in that situation where we find ourselves with the Federal Government and mandatory spending going out of control. There are legitimate groups within that that the American public would agree with, or those that we should be targeting, to make sure that they do. 
   The aged, the poor, the infirm, who desperately need medical care and are not able to cover it by themselves and are not fortunate enough to be able to work any longer, and who are not working now and covered by an employer plan, and did not unfortunately  work for a company that provides for a company-sponsored plan after their termination at work, those are the people that the American public would ask that's where our focus would be. 
   But do we find ourselves in our situation right now where we can say that we have all the other mandatory spending under control that we can address this now?

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. If the gentleman would yield, And lest anyone following this get confused when we talk about the tax increases, the gentleman from Wisconsin set it out and you followed up with quite some detail, as far as the tax increase necessary in order to pay for those entitlement expansions over time. That would be in addition to what we have already seen has occurred during this first 6 months in office. 
   In other words, we have already seen the largest tax increase in U.S. history. And the current tax increase means that 115 million taxpayers are going to see a $1,716 increase in their tax bill in just a couple years; 84 million women would see their taxes go up by $1,970; 42 million families with children, which is what we are down here talking on the floor about right now, those children, trying to be sure they have health insurance. Those 42 million families with children will see an increase of over $2,000 in their taxes already this year because of what the Democrats have done. And what you are speaking of is going to be in addition to and on top of that. 
   In trying to just throw some numbers to the percentages that you were throwing out there before as far as this expansion of children that will come under this program now, those children who may be just living across the street from us who their dads or moms work for a company right now that provides them insurance, all of a sudden those companies don't provide it anymore because now the government, we are going to pay for it. 
   Or those children who have parents who have retiree benefits and are getting insurance for them now, they will no longer have to get it from their retirement pension programs; the government, meaning taxpayers, will pay for it. 
   The CBO just came out with some numbers on this, and real numbers means that for the first, just the expansion of the program as far as additional dollars means 600,000 new children who used to yesterday have coverage under the private sector will now look to the taxpayer to pay for it; and another 600,000 children yesterday who had insurance, whether through pensions or their parents' employers, will now look to the Federal taxpayers. So 1.2 million children. Now, that is under the House version. That number, I haven't gotten a CBO estimate yet, would be even greater under the Senate version as far as children expanded into this program who are 
   already covered.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this harmful legislation and to oppose the Democrats' plan to interfere with and interject themselves in individuals' personal decisions as to where they are going to work. 
   I also stand here, actually, in awe of the omniscient view the other side of the aisle has of themselves, this all-knowing, all-seeing view that they know better than families do as to where they are going to work and micromanage their lives. Regardless of whether it is a kid in Iowa after school working on a farm throwing hay or it is a woman in Chicago working at a high-tech plant on an assembly line or it is a man in New York going back as a second career trying to get a job in the finance industry, the other side of the aisle would tell us that each one of those individuals should be paid exactly the same, regardless of their age, regardless of the work, regardless of their experience, regardless of demographics, and regardless of the cost of living in those areas. I tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is unfair. 
   And, finally, Mr. Speaker, this body, which has been unable to get its finances and house in order for the last 40 years, is in no position to be telling the American public and the families of this country how they should be getting their finances in order.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5, the so-called ``College Student Relief Act.'' Although its supporters would have the public believe that implementation of this bill would be a cure-all to the skyrocketing costs of higher education, the truth is that H.R. 5 does nothing to address tuition costs for students and could actually end up making college even more expensive. 
   In fact, the only students who will be fortunate enough to reap the full benefits of this proposal are those who take out their loans during the small 6-month window from July 1, 2011 to January 1, 2012. Before that date, the promise of halving the interest rates is unfulfilled. And, after that date, the interest rate will again double. 
   While this bill provides great sound bites and interesting political opportunities for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, it also demonstrates that they have no intention of implementing an enduring plan which will address the costs of higher education. And, while this bill purports to help those in financial need, in reality, it only applies to college graduates who have already reaped the financial and other benefits of that education. 
   I am concerned for those students who apply for loans on January 2, 2012 and any date afterwards, for they will not only have missed the boat on a low-interest rate loan, but they will also bear the brunt of having to pay higher tuition costs. The proposal before us will exacerbate perverse incentives already at play with regard to government subsidies for student loans. College tuition costs have skyrocketed by almost 300 percent between 1982 and 2003. The only segment of our economy that comes even close to such growth--where costs have also outpaced inflation by such a dramatic gulf--is health care, which grew by nearly 200 percent. As the Wall Street Journal noted in an editorial today, ``it's no coincidence that third parties foot the bill for big chunks of both higher ed and health care spending.......'' 
   Colleges are serving up these Federal subsidies to education-hungry students knowing full well that those students will not be able to realistically judge the costs of the education they receive. Those students who apply for loans in that first semester of 2012 will be forced to pay for the sound bite we consider today. 
   While cutting the interest rates on students' loans made for an attractive campaign slogan, the new leadership is creating a program which is costly, has negligible effects for those it purports to help, and has retroactive consequences for many aspiring scholars. I challenge my colleagues to evaluate this bill for what it truly is: a political stunt which sorely  lacks an effective plan to cut college costs for future students.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to this, the largest tax increase on the American family in history. The average New Jersey taxpayer under this plan will see their tax increase by over $3,700. That is the second highest increase of any State in the Union under this budget. With property taxes in my State soaring out of control and the high cost of living in New Jersey, the last thing any member from the New Jersey delegation should want to do is to drastically increase the Federal taxes on New Jersey families, as the Democrat budget now does. 
   What about jobs? In an independent analysis by the Heritage Foundation for the Fifth District that I represent, we will lose 2,000 jobs due to this tax increase. 
   So I hope that everyone who is watching this debate will pay attention very closely to see how their Member from their State will vote, because if they vote in favor of this, they will see their taxes go up by around four grand in the future. 
   Last week, the day this budget was passed in committee, we had one of those late nights. It began around 10:30 in the morning; it ended a little after midnight. During that time, almost 30 amendments were tried by our side of the aisle, and almost every one of them was voted ``no'' and defeated by the Democrat side of the aisle. 
   Now, because that debate went so late in the evening, let me recap some of those, which I think was an intriguing debate that we had. I would like to go through and highlight a number of commonsense, good government initiatives that the Democrats voted against on every one. 
   One, Democrats unanimously voted against totally repealing the AMT. 
   Two, Democrats unanimously voted against all attempts to rescue Social Security and Medicare and make these and other programs sustainable for future generations. 
   Third, Democrats unanimously voted against eliminating air-drop earmarks and dedicating $1 billion, that was just indicated, for veterans programs. 
   Democrats also remain committed, apparently, to eliminating the 10 percent bracket for low-income individuals and raising taxes on families by $500 per child and reinstating the marriage penalty and reimposing the death tax. 
   The Democrats also unanimously voted against protecting the Social Security surplus. Instead, what they did, they chose to raid that fund simply to pay for more of their earmarks. 
   Democrats also unanimously voted against strengthening PAYGO. Instead, they preserved gaping holes that allow them to scam the system with the rules that maintain the guise of fiscal responsibility. 
   Democrats also unanimously voted against putting the House Members on record every time they vote to increase the debt. 
   Even more astoundingly, Democrats unanimously voted against their own legislation, a leading Blue Dog reform bill that would have required greater transparency and accountability in the budget process. Instead, what do they do, as with so many other good things, they put this commonsense idea off to another day. 
   Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, I want the American people to realize and understand that the Democrat members of the committee unanimously voted against all the proposals I just mentioned. They had the chance to improve this legislation. They refused to do so. And I encourage all of my colleagues to vote against this terrible budget and the largest tax increase burden on the American family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, as a member of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Affairs, I am proud to congratulate the nation of Greece on the celebration of the 187th anniversary of independence. Ancient Greece is commonly thought of as the foundation for Western civilization. The Roman Empire borrowed much from Greek culture, including politics, philosophy, art, architecture, and language; and subsequently spread these ideas throughout Europe. 
   However, the country often thought of as the ``Cradle of Democracy'' was conquered and governed by various empires for centuries. On March 25, 1821, the Greek people rose up against Ottoman oppression and declared their independence. The Greeks later became the first ethnic group under the Ottoman Empire to gain independent sovereign power. 
   America's early Founding Fathers adopted the concept of federalism, an idea influenced by the ancient Greek ``city-state,'' a small region ruled locally, but within the framework of a larger cultural area. The United States has been proud to stand with the people of Greece as they confronted oppression, solidified their democracy, and became part of the vibrant European economy. 
   Both of our nations understand that even after independence is gained, it must be carefully guarded. Brave citizens must be willing to sacrifice their lives in order to protect liberty. Just as the U.S. and Greece have struggled to survive after the initial moment of independence was earned, we must continue to foster the causes of freedom and democracy. 
   Again, I congratulate the Greek people on this historic celebration. This anniversary is a time to remember the sacrifices of the past, to take pride in your nation, and to look ahead to a future of promise.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the House is considering H. Res. 947 today, congratulating Lee Myung-Bak on his election to the Presidency of the Republic of Korea. I was proud to cosponsor this resolution and I join with my fellow Members in wishing him well during his time of transition this month. 
   When Lee Myung-Bak is inaugurated on February 25, I am confident that he will do much to broaden the longstanding relationship between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America. In the past month, he has already met with President Bush and Vice President CHENEY, as well as several members of the President's Cabinet and Members of Congress. 
   President-elect Myung-Bak is well-qualified to assume his new role. He earned a B.A. in Business Administration at the Korea University and later served as a Visiting Scholar at George Washington University here in Washington, DC before being awarded two Honorary Doctor of Economics degrees. 
   Additionally, President-elect Myung-Bak's past professional experience has honed his vital business, diplomatic, and political skills. For 15 years, he was the CEO of 10 Hyundai Group affiliated companies. He then served as a National Assemblyman from 1992 to 1998 before being elected Mayor of Seoul in 2002. 
   I applaud President-elect Myung-Bak for expressing his commitment to free market policies that encourage both foreign and domestic investors. I look forward to the ratification of the United States-South Korea Free Trade Agreement and I welcome his proposed plans to reduce trade restrictions and lower tax rates. Furthermore, as the Republic of South Korea assists in negotiating Pyongyang's denuclearization, I urge the President-elect to closely integrate U.S. and Japanese initiatives related to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
   Today, I join my colleagues in congratulating President-elect Myung-Bak, and I wish him, his wife and four children success in the years ahead.

That is to say, the press accounts from the Speaker's office, I believe the gentleman from Iowa said that they have not been lobbied at all by the industry from their district. Is that correct?

I believe I am quoting you correctly that the press accounts from the Speaker's office on this is they have not been lobbied whatsoever from the respective industry in their State on this topic. And if that is the case, and it is hard to believe for the reason the gentleman from Iowa states that something that is so fundamentally important to that particular industry, you would think that the Speaker, if she is going to be responsive to their industry, would be hearing from them on these matters. 
   My question is, and perhaps you know the answer, why then does either the chairman or the Speaker say that they put this provision into the particular bill if not to protect those industries?

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate that the gentleman is trying to conjecture what the potential answer is as to why this absurd language was put in the original bill. Neither one of them obviously stands on their own foot. The first one being that we are going to create such an exemption because we realize how dangerous imposing minimum wage on any particular industry can be. Well, if it is going to be dangerous for that particular industry, then the other side of the aisle should realize it can be harmful to others and they should broaden the exemption to others. That was the first explanation. 
   The second explanation you conjectured was because they were doing it as an earmark specifically for one industry, to protect that industry. And in this area of ethics, I am sure that could not be the reason. 
   So as we stand on the floor tonight, I am sure that while we are here to speak on this matter, the Members on the other side of the aisle are back at their offices listening to this debate, the Speaker is probably back in her office right now, the sponsor of the bill is back in their office right now.     
   I would extend an invitation to any or all of them to come and join us to give us a logical explanation. Was it the first reason that they were just creating one exemption because they realized how harmful minimum wage can be, or was it that they were crafting something specifically as an earmark to protect one of their own industries outside of all others?

Was it an issue of them trying to carve out something for one particular industry in their home State, or was this something even less nefarious than that, simply that they realized that raising the minimum wage can have the harmful impacts that it does?

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. I would like to just step back for just a moment from this overall issue that we are narrowly focussing on, this exemption, perhaps nefarious, that was in the legislation, and commend the gentleman from Iowa for your comments just yesterday when the overall bill of minimum wage was being discussed and you waxed eloquent as to the problems that the legislation that the other side of the aisle presented as far as what a raise in the minimum wage can do to the people that they suggest that they are going to help. And I commend the gentleman for the comments that you make on that. 
   And if I could just maybe elaborate and give one other example. Perhaps the most difficult part of understanding from whence they come on this issue of raising the minimum wage in the manner that they did is that they, in fact, hurt the very same people that they claim they are going to try to help by raising the minimum wage. That is, they are going to hurt the very people who are low skilled and lack experience because, generally speaking, it is the low skilled and the people lacking experience who are entering into the entry level type jobs out there. And it does a disservice to them for them to report a bill such as we had yesterday of raising the minimum wage, which we know statistically will shut out so many people who are seeking to enter the workforce. 
   Just as we did a moment ago where we asked others to take a look at this issue that we were speaking about a moment ago and come down here to explain themselves, perhaps, if they are not going to come down here, the constituents at home can call the Members and ask, can they explain themselves on the exemption of the bill? But also maybe people listening to this program at home right now can also call the Members on the other side of the aisle who purported to support this raise in the minimum wage and ask this: Have any of them on the other side of the aisle ever while a Member of Congress had people working for them right down here on Capitol Hill, working for them in a legislative capacity basically, alongside other members of their staff, and not paid them the full minimum wage? That would be a curious question.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Sure. I appreciate that. Have any of them had anyone working on their staffs and not paid the full current minimum wage? That is an interesting question. I bet the answer to that question would be yes. And we know those people in those offices are entry level people, many of them in college right now, who come to Washington to try to get their first job. 
   Now, the Members on the other side of the aisle will say, wait a minute, the reason we are not paying them the full minimum wage right now and we have done so for the last several years despite the Federal minimum wage is because these are entry level people. They are young people. They don't have a full education yet. They don't have all the experience they need as other people on the staff. And yet the people sitting right next to them on the staff are being paid the minimum wage, and you have to ask them, why are they doing that? The other reason they would give to you, and they do it in perhaps a dismissive sort of way, is to say these people whom we are not paying minimum wage to are interns. 
   Wait a minute now. This young person sitting over here doing the exact same thing as this person sitting over here, the exact same sort of job; this person is being paid a full salary, and this one is not getting a full minimum wage salary doing the exact same thing. Is it right that they do not meet that level? And yet they were the ones who sponsored this legislation to raise the overall standard of pay for everyone else in this country. So I think it is important that we ask them why, on the one hand, they speak out of the mouth of raising the standards for everyone, but at the same time, in their own offices, they have people working for them who are not making the full minimum wage.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, one other point that the gentleman from Iowa did not raise but I think would concur with is what is the underpinning of this Nation. The other side of the aisle would probably agree with this if we were speaking on another topic, that led to the great formation of the wealth and the value of this Nation, from our moral upbringing as well as the development of this Nation, is in fact the diversity of this Nation. The fact that living in New England is different demographically than living in the far west. That living in New Jersey where I come from is different from where the gentleman from Iowa lives. Whether we are talking about the weather or the price of housing or the energy costs that we may have in New England and New Jersey as far as heating versus the energy costs in the southern portions of the country, and the transportation costs, and the educational level. 
   New Jersey is proud of the fact that we are a highly educated State, and for that reason we have a number of biotech firms and pharmaceutical firms in our area. Other portions of the country may have more farming. Or in the New York area where it is the financial services mecca for this country. Or western portions where it is high tech on the West Coast. That is where we are today, but that is also where we came from. We were a diverse Nation. It was because of that diversity and the freedoms and liberties that we had at that time that this Nation was able to grow economically, as the gentleman said. 
   The problem with the legislation that we passed yesterday, however, it does not realize nor appreciate nor value that diversity of this Nation that we have. What that legislation says is that we are going to treat everyone alike uniformly. When you do that, you treat certain people unfairly. 
   How does that come about? In the examples I gave yesterday, you can come up with a list of these things. If you treat an individual who is a teenager who is in school right now and trying to get a job after school and make some money, maybe he wants to work in the fields bringing in hay in the Midwest, we are going to treat him the same as we might treat the parent of some children who has some experience in the tech field and has an entry-level position in the Northeast where they have high-tech industry. We are going to treat that person the same as perhaps a second-career individual, perhaps in the financial service markets just over the river, the Hudson River in New York City. 
   Perhaps we are going to treat them the same as someone in Florida in the citrus crop industry. So whether it is the fields of Iowa or Florida, the high-tech industries on the west coast or the financial industry on the east coast, the legislation we had yesterday setting a uniform minimum wage says they are all going to be treated exactly the right, regardless of the person's age, experience, regardless of the person's skills, regardless of their attributes that they bring to that employer who is looking for somebody to add to the value of the product that they are producing, and regardless of the demography of the particular area, traveling costs, housing costs, or the cost of living. 
   Coming down to Washington, D.C., we realize this is an extremely expensive place to live versus other places in the country where you can buy a house for maybe $100,000. Regardless of all those variables, they are going to mandate and say we are going to treat everybody in all of these situations the same. That is unfair because the demographics and the situations differ. 
   The result is this: those individual in these other high-cost areas are going to be put at a greater disadvantage in certain circumstances. In other circumstances, that individual in Iowa trying to get a job after school, they are going to be put at a disadvantage because the employer is not going to see the value added to the product exactly the same. And so some of those individuals who may need those jobs will not be able to get the jobs that they actually have to have to support their family.

   As we conclude this hour worth of discussion and debate on this very important topic, I would just remind the gentleman that it has been an hour that we have been debating and discussing this issue. We have extended our hand to the other side of the aisle. We have extended our hand to the Speaker and to the sponsor of the legislation to come forward and to engage with us here on the floor and with the American public, as well, to explain whether there is a nefarious reason behind this inexplicable reason for treating certain people in the country different than other people in the country. 
   We will welcome an opportunity in future times for them to join us to explain themselves.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (THE BUDGET -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for yielding, and I also very much thank her for organizing this Special Order, to be able to have the opportunity to come to the floor tonight. 
   As we have said, the bottom line up front, how much we take in and how much we spend. The American public must sit home and wat ch this and read the papers and live in a frustrated state, realizing that so much of their hard-earned money comes to Washington, and what we have here is a Byzantine system of archaic rules and what-have-you wrapped around policy statements, what-have-you, that the American public doesn't oftentimes get a clear picture to understand just where their dollars go. 
   And that's what the purpose is here tonight and in subsequent weeks I believe as well, to try to remove that shroud of mystery behind the syst em that we have here, to shine the light of day, as we are oftentimes saying, on the budgetary process, to give the American public a clear picture of exactly where their dollars go to. And we do this with not just an educational point in mind or a goal but to also allow the American public and the voter and the taxpayer to be in a better posture to decide among themselves just where they want their Government to go in this election and future elections and of course over their lifetime as well. 
   It was just this past week when we were back at home in the district work period and I was able to sit at my dining room table. Around this time of year, April 15 is coming up, tax time, and my wife said now is the time to start getting the paperwork out, Scott, and begin to look at it and getting all the stuff you need to send to the accountant to do our taxes, because I had given up, quite candidly, years ago trying to figure out myself, as I imagine most Members of Congress have, to try to figure out the Byzant ine Tax Code that we have created for the American public as well. 
   So I began the process of collecting all my documents. And, of course, some of those are some of the basic ones, like your W-2 to show you how much you've earned over the last 12 months, over the last year. And then there's one of those little boxes, I think box 8 or 9 on there, that also begins to show you just how much money has been taken out of your paycheck week after week. You don't see it so much, especially nowadays because so many people have direct deposit and it goes right into their checking account or bank account. You don't see how much is actually taken out. 
   But at the end of the year you sure do. At the end of the year you get that W-2 and you look at that box, and I say, oh, my gosh, that's how much  money. In payroll taxes and income taxes, you put them out all together, and it's in the five digits for a lot of middle-class Americans. 
   I come from the great State of New Jersey where middle-class America l ives and works hard to make a paycheck and pay their bills. They would be astounded if they looked at their W-2s, as I did and maybe you should as well, to see how much taxes are taken out and sent down here to Washington. 
   The Government took in $21,992, almost $22,000, in household taxes. Now, mind you, those $22,000 are all household taxes. I believe that also includes payroll taxes alike. So your income taxes and payroll taxes, $22,000. The government spends $24,000 per household. So that's very ea sy math, and it's basically telling us that we are engaged in deficit spending. But look at that number: $22,000 taken out of the average middle-class American's paycheck. 
   When the average household income in some parts of the country is around 40-some-odd-thousand dollars, half of that money, figuratively speaking, is going in taxes. I know it doesn't come out of that tax rate for that particular family, but that's enough for some Americans to live on entirely in certain parts of this country with a li ttle bit of assistance on the side. And that's how much is being paid per household in U.S. taxes. 
   For some of us, we think that's just too much. The numbers have been projected with a little bit of varying degree of certainty on this, but on average the American household, the American family, a middle-class American works starting on January 1, just a month or so ago, and works all the way to sometime in mid-May just to pay their Federal taxes, State and local taxes as well. And then if you want to ad d onto that all the burden and the costs of all the Federal regulations and everything that also is a burden on us as well, you have to work almost all the way until sometime in the summertime, the beginning of July. So think about that. You're working almost the entire half of the year just to pay your taxes and the burden of the Federal, State, and local Governments. 
   And where do those dollars go? Well, that's something that we're talking about here. On average, first of all, the burden falls around 1 8.3 percent of GDP. What does that mean? The historical average of all the revenue coming into the Federal Government from the 1960s all the way up until the present time varies up and down, some years more, some years less. But on average as a percentage of GDP, it's around 18.3 percent. 
   Now, what this means is that at certain times the tax rates and the burden on the American family is greater than others; sometimes it's less than others. But we're here to point out where those dollars go and what can we do to make sure that that tax burden does not continue to creep up higher and higher and higher so that the American family sees even more of their tax dollars go to that level and to purposes that they can only fathom a guess at. 
   If you have listened to the debate on this floor in past times, you've heard talk about earmarks and waste, fraud, and abuse. Earmarks are part of the problem, but they are only a small, small percentage of where our tax dollars go. The gentleman who was just speaking befo re spoke a little bit about the entitlements, Medicare and Medicaid, a much larger percentage. Let me fall someplace in between. As I sat there at my dining room table looking at the double-digit numbers as far as what my family has to pay in Federal taxes, I realize, as most Americans do, that we have an obligation to pay taxes into our Federal Government to provide for such things as national defense and homeland security, and we don't begrudge the Federal Government for any of those things. But as I also sat back, being a Member of Congress, knowing about the waste, fraud, and abuse and the unnecessary expenditures, that's when I and middle-class America begin to be concerned. 
   For example, nobody has to think back too far about all the dollars that we spent mistakenly in the area of Hurricane Katrina and the waste in portions of that spending. I had folks sitting in my office who did independent investigations on Katrina to see where those dollars were going to. Granted, there was a lot of necessary co st down there. But the waste, fraud, and abuse down there is telling. Fraud related to Hurricane Katrina spending is estimated to top $2 billion. One of 
   the areas that the investigators who spoke to me were talking about was the debit cards, debit cards that were issued repeatedly to the same people. That means over and over again, even though they should hav e applied and qualified for one, in some cases debit cards and checks were being sent out to people regardless of need. In other cases, cards being sent out to people even though they did not live in the area, to be used for all sorts of things, from a Caribbean vacation to NFL tickets and so on and so forth. 
   Likewise, auditors discovered that 900,000 of the 2.5 million recipients of emergency Katrina assistance provided false or duplicate names, addresses, and Social Security numbers. And the interesti ng thing there, and I will make this last point on Katrina, is that even though the fraud investigators found out about this and they told FEMA about it, FEMA continued to issue those cards. 
   The other side of the aisle sometimes makes the case with regard to corporate welfare, and I agree with them. The Federal Government spends too much of wasteful money with regard to corporate welfare as well. According to some statistics, Washington spends $60 billion annually on corporate welfare versus $43 billion on homeland security. So note that we are spending more money on corporate welfare to some of the largest corporations in this country and the world than we are on homeland security. Likewise on corporate welfare, the Advanced Technology Program, which sounds like an admirable program, spends $150 million annually subsidizing private businesses, and 40 percent of that money goes to Fortune 500 companies. 
   So as middle-class America sits at home saying, where are my tax dollars going, that's some of the places where it's going. 
   I will yield back and maybe speak again in a moment on some other points. But let me just close on this: I have the honor and privilege of serving on the Budget Committee, the committee in which we have the opportunity to sit back and look at the entire Federal budget, the big picture overview, and I have had the opportunity to do this now for 5 years. And during that time, many of these examples come before us; and during that time we have, let's call it, partisan differences f rom the other side of the aisle and ours on what we should be doing about it. 
   But mind you, in the 5 years that I have served on this committee, the 5 years that I have served in this House, not one time do I recall anyone from the other side of the aisle suggesting that the solution to taking the burden off middle-class America is to reduce their tax rate and to do so by actually reducing tax expenditures. On the contrary, everything I have seen over the past 5 years, and as has been pointed out by the gentleman from California right now, has been in the opposite direction, an increase in Federal spending and, as we have seen now with the mother of all tax increases, an increase of the tax burden on middle-class America as well. 
   Those are the points that I believe the American public has got to understand. As they pay their taxes April 15, where are their tax dollars going? It's going to, if the other side has its way, increased Federal spending on programs like these and other programs as well and a n increased burden on middle-class America, things that those on this side of the aisle vehemently oppose and are doing our best to rein in.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman. 
   I rise today to voice my opposition to the underlying bill, as well as the underlying unfairness that's contained in it. But before I speak about Title I, which does contain the opportunity to use taxpayers' dollars to insure up to $300 billion worth of new mortgages to bail out the Nation's banking industry and homeowners, those who made irresponsible decisions, I want to briefly discuss other parts of the bill. 
   The chairman has been routinely criticizing the administration for failing to do anything, he says, to address the current housing problems facing the Nation, but you know, this administration has been calling for the last couple of years for FHA reform and new regulations for the GSEs. However, the new Democrat majority in the House and the Senate has been unable to pass these important measures. 
   You know, when you think about it, who knows how many people we could have already helped to stay in their homes and keep out of foreclosure if the Democrat leadership would have only forged an agreement already and passed those previous bills. 
   It is unfortunate that due to the refusal of the distinguished chairman and others in the majority to temporarily forego some of their pet projects, such as the housing slush fund for ACORN and La Raza and others, that these two important reforms have been held up now for the last year-and-a-half. 
   And now, with this new housing omnibus bill before us, the chairman has once again refused to compromise, I say, in good faith with the administration or the minority side and has included such pet projects once again.  And as an indication of the majority's unwillingness to substantively compromise, the administration has issued a veto threat to this bill. 
   Over the last 6 months, the administration and HUD have been working on a program, the FHA Secure. It's to try to help American families who are in the right house but maybe not in the right mortgage to stay in the house. And this program has recently been expanded upon and has to date helped thousands of Americans to be able to stay in their homes. 
   But now our distinguished chairman and Democrat leadership are proposing a plan that is really financially risky. It rewards irresponsible behavior and it mandates a loosing of FHA underwriting standards, and this is important, that would put taxpayers on the hook. 
   So, when the chairman put together what I say is an ill-conceived plan, he noted originally that it would help up to 2 million homeowners. Well, unfortunately when CBO scored the bill, they determined it would only help 500,000, and that's the same amount they have oft criticized the administration plan is projected to help. So you'll excuse me if I find it a little hypocritical here that those who believe that the administration's plan isn't going to provide adequate help to struggling homeowners but that this new plan, which is forecasted to help the exact same number of people, is somehow the perfect cure-all. 
   Now, the bill before us for consideration goes much further than this. This bill actually pays people to stay in their houses. It would give every homeowner who was in trouble and participates in this program a 10 percent equity stake in their home. Normally, depending on the specifics of your loan, it could take you or I 3 or 4 years for a homeowner to make enough payments for you to get a 10 percent equity stake. Now under this bill, we're just going to give those people who are having trouble making their payments. You know, I know things are bad in the mortgage markets right now, but are things so bad that we actually have to pay people to stay in the houses? 
   Where is the fairness in that proposal? The distinguished chairman acknowledged during the committee consideration that maybe this bill isn't fair in that sense. What about the person who has been patiently sitting on the sidelines over the last several years, saving up, waiting for these unsustainable high housing prices to come down to reality, come down to earth? They've been paying their rent every month, building up no equity whatsoever. What about those people? We're now rewarding someone else who has undertaken an irresponsible loan and bought something, frankly, they just couldn't afford. 
   What about the person who took out a loan 3 years ago and he's been scraping by, struggling just to get enough money from every paycheck to paycheck to afford their mortgage and, I say, attain their 10 percent equity over 3 years? Now, again, with this bill, we're just giving that equity away to people who didn't save, didn't decide they would live within their means. 
   Some say the reason this provision is needed is that it will encourage people to stay in the houses. I believe, quite frankly, the possibility of being kicked out of your house is incentive enough to try to stay in your house. I don't have a problem with trying to help people, and this side of the aisle is trying to do it as well, to stay in their homes, but I do have a problem with facilitating arrangements in which they are given a 10 percent equity in their home with a mortgage that is insured by the Federal Government, and that means the American taxpayer. 
   Our distinguished chairman was quoted in the paper the other day, ``We have done as much as possible to respond responsibly with the public policy.''  
   However, the legislation before us completely disregards borrowers' payment histories and credit scores when considering eligibility for this program. Borrowers could have missed the majority of their monthly payments over the life of the loan, yet these borrowers would still be eligible for a government-backed mortgage--and taxpayers would be on the hook. An amendment was offered during the committee process to rectify this and it was soundly defeated by the Democrat majority party. 
   I have also heard a number of members on the other side of the aisle mention today their concerns about the Federal Reserve bailing out Bear Stearns to the tune of $29 billion. However, none of the members complaining or any democrats for that matter choose to sign onto any of three letters I and a number of my Republican colleagues sent to Chairman Frank, Secretary Paulson, and Chairman Bernanke noting our strong concern. 
   For the last 17 months that the Democrat majority has been in charge, the Administration has been asking for a number of housing reforms from Congress, none of which have been delivered. Now, they want to say the Administration has idly sat by and watched as the housing turmoil has continued to increase, while it is actually the Democrat congress that has yet to pass significant housing reforms that could have provided the Administration with the much needed tools to begin easing us out of this housing downturn. 
   The Chairman states that this a grand compromise between the different groups involved in the discussion, but the only compromise I can see is the one between he and his party, the big banks who made unsound loans, and the special interests and trial lawyers that stand to benefit.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer this straightforward and commonsense amendment today to provide shareholders and companies better guidance on what constitutes an excessive executive compensation package that this interventionist, otherwise, legislation before us does. 
   But before I do that, I commend the distinguished chair of the committee for his hard work on this legislation, but I would like to point out an inconsistency in his approach to this legislation. 
   We now have before us new SEC guidelines on executive compensation transparency. These new rules, unfortunately, have not even been given a chance, not an opportunity to bear any results or any fruit whatsoever. So without giving time to see if these new SEC rules will work, the chairman and this House are rushing ahead to consider legislation to address the issue. 
   But on the other hand, Mr. Chairman, in regards to Sarbanes-Oxley reform, the SEC is also considering new guidelines to address numerous concerns, and in that case, the chairman believes that Members need to be patient and let the SEC do its job. In fact, we have not even had a single hearing on that topic. We are told we need to wait and see if the new regulations will fix the current problems in the corporate sector. 
   But after listening to numerous arguments by the chairman about inconsistency, and even tonight as well, I thought it important to point this out, that we should be consistent on these two matters and to give both avenues an appropriate time to work things through. But if we are not going to do that, that is why I propose this amendment. 
   This commonsense amendment I have offered today attempts to keep us focused on the perceived problems of excessive compensation. This amendment would establish a trigger that would have to be met before shareholders vote on executive compensation packages. The trigger would require that executive compensation exceed by 10 percent or more the average compensation for comparable industries in that particular sector and would require that the executive compensation question exceed by 10 percent or more the average compensation for comparable positions among companies with comparable total market capitalization. In essence, the SEC is being tasked with deciding which companies fit into these two categories for the purposes of determining these two percentages. 
   So, it is simple. Essentially my amendment seeks to limit the required votes to instances where the disclosed excessive compensation in question grossly exceeds the norm and provides a quantitative guideline for what constitutes the norm and what constitutes gross excess. If the underlying bill were to pass as it is currently drafted, we will be forcing literally thousands of public companies across this country to conduct shareholder votes on every single pay package for every single CEO of every single public company all the time. 
   Now, while the courts have said before ``we know it when we see it'' can be a useful test in certain circumstances, if we have the ability to provide better guidelines to American businesses and consumers, then we should do so in this legislation. 
   We all know of the large compensation packages that have been given over the last several years. The media has ensured that those that receive extraordinary pensions make it to the media, but you know, for every one of those huge packages, there are literally hundreds, maybe thousands, of other compensation packages that are far more standard. They are within the norm, and we really should not be requiring a vote on each and every one of those that are falling into that category and failing to give the shareholders in those cases the proper information. 
   So, by adopting this amendment, we will allow thousands of hardworking public companies to continue their day-to-day work without interruption, and we will be better able to focus on the new executive compensation packages that are outside of the comparative norm and may not be in the best interests of the shareholders.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, the amendment before us, in fact, is intended to strengthen the bill and not, as the gentleman says, to gut the bill. 
   How does it strengthen the bill? It does so by addressing the exact problem that the gentleman just set forth as what they were intending to do with the legislation in the first place. 
   The gentleman, and also in committee, went on and all the testimony was about excessive compensation packages and how this is an egregious situation for this country and for the investors. I do not think we had one person who came before the committee, nor has anyone from the other side of the aisle made an example of saying that we should be doing something about fair compensation packages or compensation packages that only went up a small percentage. 
   All the testimony, all the argument before, all the argument we have heard tonight is about excessive compensation packages, and that is what my amendment does. It says, look to, how do we focus this thing on really where the problem is, excessive compensation packages, and we do that by specifically delineating it, by saying that it is 10 percent or more of the above averages for the industry's norm. 
   Secondly, the gentleman from the other side points out that the investor does not have any input. Of course, he does, and when the case is involving an excessive compensation package, then he will have the input to make his voice heard. 
   Thirdly and finally, I think we see the difference of approach as to where the burden in these situations should apply. Should it apply to honest, law-abiding, good, hardworking citizens and businesses in this country, or should the burden be placed on government? My amendment would say that the burden is put on the SEC to make the determination to make those findings, and yes, it will be some burden to do so, but it is on the SEC to make those findings. We should not be placing these excessive burdens on the business sector. If they are doing what their stockholders want them to do, growing and expanding their businesses, hiring CEOs that are making salaries that are fair for them and are within the norm, we should not be placing an additional burden on them.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Rutgers University women's basketball team on their outstanding 2006-2007 season. 
   As highlighted in this resolution, the Lady Knights sacrificed their own personal vacations over winter break to stay at school and train for their well-deserved victories in 2007. 
   It is this dedication that gained them the Big East Championship title and a spot in the women's NCAA final four. It also made them the very first athletic team from Rutgers to earn a spot playing in a national championship. Their hard work, perseverance, and extraordinary skill have set an excellent example for athletes everywhere: women and men alike. And, as the national media spotlight turned on them in the wake of the ugly remarks by radio shock jock Don Imus, they maintained the same poise and grace under pressure that they exhibited on the court. 
   I would especially like to extend my congratulations to sophomore, Heather Zurich of Montvale, New Jersey. Her performance with the Lady Knights as forward was an integral component to the team's success this season. 
   The Rutgers University women's basketball team is a great source of pride to their campus and all of us New Jerseyans. I applaud their accomplishments and look forward to hearing of their future successes.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I come here tonight, as we do every month or so, to begin another session of the Constitution hour. Members of the Congressional Constitution Caucus basically use these opportunities to emphasize to our colleagues and people across the Nation the necessity of ensuring that our government is operating under the intent of our Founding Fathers. Specifically, we look at the 10th amendment which affirms that the authority over most domestic issues belongs to the States, either directly or through their political subdivisions, and to the people therefore themselves. Actually, the exact wording of it is that all powers not specifically delegated to the United States Government is retained by the people or the States respectively. 
   So we come to the floor as we do every month or so to bring this point home, to educate the Members of Congress, and to have a discussion on the constitutional merits of what we are debating here in the week before and after. In a little while we will look at a piece of pending legislation, a sunset bill, as it were. But before I do that, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland).

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for raising these points. He takes the lead from the gentleman from Maine from the other side of the aisle who had just previously done 5 minutes talking about the energy situation. Let me follow up along those lines before we talk about the sunset bill we want to talk about tonight. 
   I agree with the gentleman from Georgia that our Founding Fathers would be rolling their eyes and turning over to the proverbial grave if they were ever to look to see the size and scope and depth of regulation of the Federal Government, a far cry from what the Founders ever intended as the appropriate role of government in people's lives. 
   They did, as the gentleman from Georgia said, put a significant weight and value to that of private property rights, and they did believe that private property was just that, something to be held by the private citizen and not by the government, whether it is the State or Federal, but specifically here on the Federal level. 
   The gentleman from Maine was making the observation that something needs to be done with regard to the fact that our citizens back home, our constituents back home are aggrieved by the high price of oil, whether it is the gasoline for your car or for the diesel for your truck, or home heating fuel if you are in the northern States such as myself. The gentleman from the other side of the aisle on the majority party would suggest that the answer comes from the Federal Government. 
   I would suggest that the answer, as far as the Founding Fathers would believe, the answer comes from the private sector, would that the private sector have a free hand and free rein in order to address the problem. 
   But as we stand here right now, 85 percent of our natural resources in this area of energy offshore of this country are tied up, locked up, if you will, unobtainable for all of us to use as was intended; 85 percent locked up, unavailable for us to be going to get, either oil or natural gas. So we are paying the price for that. 
   So when the gentleman from Maine from the majority party says that the administration is at fault here, I had to sit and scratch my head and try to remember who is running this House, and which party is running the Senate as well. And of course we know the answer, it is the Democrat Party. 
   This is not a partisan issue I'm raising here. I think everyone from this side of the aisle would like to extend a hand to the other side of the aisle to try to work together and come to a resolution on this issue. 
   But if the way that they take is to point blame and blame the President and the Bush administration and the like, that's not going to bring us to closure. That is not going to bring us to a solution satisfactory to the American public.     
   We need to work together on this. 
   Likewise, we are not going to get to that solution if all we have is empty promises. I remember all too well a little over 2 years ago, in the 2006 elections, when the, then they were the minority party, but the Democrat Party was saying that they had the solution. They had the answer to the oil problem and the oil crisis and the price of gas at the pump, and if they were elected, they said, and they were put into the majority power, they would be able to give us that solution and that plan and bring us to a better day. 
   And if you think back to where it was and what they were saying was so terrible at that time, well, gas at that time was like $1.90 or something like that. It was just approaching, it hadn't quite gone over $2 a gallon at the pump. But they said elect them and they'd have a solution. 
   Well, here it is in April, 16 months after they've been in office, and we are still waiting for that solution. We are still waiting for that answer to come down the road, to be handed to us so  that we can all get behind it in a bipartisan manner and answer that the challenge that the American public gave to us, how can we solve this problem. Because the American public, I think, would be more akin and in tune with what the founders would say. 
   The American public would say, to solve this problem you must release the abilities and the entrepreneurial spirit and the great ideas of the business person and the landowner and the private property owner and those who own renewable and other energy sources to be able to develop those and allow them to come into the marketplace. 
   But that is not happening yet, so long as the other side of the aisle refuses to give us whatever their solution or their plan is that they told us about some time ago, nor is that about to come about so long as the other side of the aisle simply comes to the floor and casts aspersion on the Bush administration or whoever's in the White House at the time and says it's all somebody else's fault, rather than really grappling with the issue and trying to come to a solution to it. 
   There are solutions to it. There are free market principles. They are principles that our founding fathers would have enjoyed and appreciated and applauded as they crafted the U.S. Constitution, and that's what we should be embracing today, so that we can go home to our constituents, so the gentleman from Georgia, who said he's somewhat embarrassed to go back to his constituents and say this is what is happening now in Congress as Congress fails to deliver on its promises. 
   We should be able to deliver, if not on our promises, then on the promises on the other side of the aisle and to address this solution in a bipartisan manner and get the job done in the manner that their founders would have intended. 
   Now, I believe that the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) had another point on a different issue. The gentleman, I am pleased, has just joined us, from Utah. And before we get to the topic that we came here tonight, which was to discuss the issue of the Brady bill, which is the bill dealing with the Sunset Commission and how the Constitution ties into that topic and why the founding fathers would applaud the ideas that Mr. Brady has given us as far as addressing the over-running government that we have, the gentleman from Utah has joined us, Mr. Bishop, to fill us in on the issue dealing with NASA.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Utah. And the gentleman makes an interesting point when he says to educate takes only to excite the mind and the imaginations and, of course, that is what happened some 200-plus years ago in this country when our founding fathers came to this land and excited the imagination that a new form of government never conceived by any human in any portion of the world ever before, and that was, we've seen today, in the U.S. Constitution. 
   You know, that document today, for a lot of people is just a historical document and nothing more than that. And to many citizens the Federal Government is nothing more than a problem solving institution of government. 
   However, the founding fathers delegated only a few specific powers to us here in Washington, to the House and the Senate and the White House, few specific powers, and they are in numerated in the Constitution. The remaining political powers were reserved for the States and the local governments and the people specifically. 
   So tonight, I'm joined by my colleagues, Mr. Bishop who will speak again in a few moments, and Mr. Brady from Texas who'll try to focus on one aspect of trying to revert the government to what the founders intended in the first place by focusing on the inefficiencies and the waste that occurs when the Federal Government oversteps its bounds that were set forth in the Constitution. 
   And we come here not simply to complain about the situation. No, and that's why I'm pleased that I'm joined by Mr. Brady, because Mr. Brady comes here with a solution to the problem as well, and he does so in the form of the Federal Sunset Act, which would help our country, in essence, return to the limits originally intended by our founding fathers. 
   So with that I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady).

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for taking the lead on this issue, not only in this session of Congress, but in the past session of Congress as well where I have been a proud cosponsor of your legislation because it goes a long ways to, what was that phrase that Barry Goldwater used when he came to Washington the first time? He said, I did not come to Washington to streamline government or make it more efficient. I came to Washington to eliminate it. And that's what you're trying to do as well with the intent of the legislation is define those areas of government that are extra-Constitutional, outside of the bounds of the Constitution, find those portions of government that are wasteful, duplicative and the like and to basically eliminate those so that the Federal Government can appropriately focus its attention on those areas that it's supposed to and then get that job done so that you and I can go back to our constituents and say that we are fulfilling the role of the Constitution and we are doing it in a Constitutional manner. 
   I will yield.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate your hard work on this initiative so that, as I say, when we go back to our constituents and one of those bills comes up in the future, and it will come up, when it's laden with additional spending, I'm not talking about earmarks or proverbial pork barrel spending, I'm talking about just legislation, that appropriation for dollars going to some other duplicative-type programs that you mention out there that we, you and I and the rest of us who are in agreement on this issue, can go back to our constituents and say, I voted the right way. I voted to eliminate those programs. I voted to downsize those programs. I voted to make sure that all we have left standing are those things that the Founders would agree with and that the programs and the agencies and the services that the public desires and demands and it's within the confines of the Constitution, and they're getting it done in an effective and efficient manner. 
   So I appreciate your taking the bold step to accomplish that, and we're behind you on that. Now, if we can get the support on the other side of the aisle and move this legislation, we will be even further down the field than that. 
   We're joined again by the gentleman from Utah to join us in this discussion on the Constitution and more 
   specifically, on the Brady bill with regard to the sunsetting these wasteful, duplicative unconstitutional initiatives that the Federal Government is wanting and ripe to continue but for the fact that we have legislation like this. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Utah.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) for being on the floor tonight and also for the subject, for introducing this Federal Sunset Act, an act which would, as he said, return our country and our government to the intent as set forth by our Founding Fathers. 
   And when you think about it, in light of the extremely high taxes and even higher deficit, the time for greater efficiency in government couldn't be any greater than it is today. The American worker is handing far too much of his or her hard-earned money, his paycheck each week over to the Federal Government only to see it wasted in layers of bureaucracy, red tape and so on. I think you quoted Ronald Reagan before when you said that a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal thing that we'll ever see on Earth, but regrettably, longevity truly has nothing to do whatsoever with a program's effectiveness or efficiency or usefulness to the American people. Just because it's been around a long time doesn't mean that it's good. 
   Now, the background for the idea of a sunset, as the gentleman from Utah said, comes from the States, who are usually on the cutting edge because they are the laboratory of experimentation. And the sunset takes its name from the sunset laws used by many States to provide for a periodic review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency operations and their policies. It was back in 1976 that Colorado was the first State to implement a sunset. And at the State level this process has saved the taxpayer hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. And it has also reduced the size of government at the same time. And simply how it works is that each and every Federal agency must justify its own existence, and not its existence from the time that it was created, which may have been 100 years ago or 80 years or 60 or 40 or even 10 years ago, but its existence today to the consumer, which is the taxpayer, constituent. And then after a thorough evaluation, the commission recommends to Congress that  an agency be reauthorized, streamlined, consolidated, or in some cases, maybe even eliminated. 
   So why is that a great idea? It's a great idea because, as we said before, the Federal Government is just far too big, too fat, too wasteful. And especially now, in a time of war, in a time of deficit, don't we need every single dollar to really count, to be accounted for and to go for what is necessary? And a Federal sunset law is truly a proven way to abolish those obsolete Federal programs, eliminate duplication, and hold every agency accountable to the taxpayer. 
   You know, it's no secret that there are many Federal programs that are simply not serving the American public. And these are the programs that have outlived their purpose, duplicated other programs, simply waste taxpayer dollars by diverting dollars away from real priorities and into what you might want to say is a black hole of ineffectiveness, which is what we see in Washington. And I think Mr. Brady said it, a taxpayer now works up to 113 days out of a year just to pay for his share of the Federal Government's spending of ineffectiveness. 
   Unfortunately, these programs survive anyway. And they survive because of special interests, these cottage industries that grow down here that live off the taxpayer earnings. But you know, Madam Speaker, we're not here to represent any of those special interests. We are here to represent the mothers and fathers who could be at home with their children instead of working an extra shift so that they can make their contribution to this bloated bureaucracy that we call Washington. With a Federal deficit in the billions of dollars and with taxes that are too high and too unfair, we must do everything we can to ensure that our Federal spending is as limited as possible and most efficient as possible. 
   And with that, let me just make one additional point. The idea and why we come to the floor now and why I commend Mr. Brady so much for his work on this is that the Federal Government was intended to be limited by the Founding Fathers, and this Sunset Commission would give us the opportunity to revisit that issue. 
   I often say that when we vote on a bill, specifically on appropriation bills or authorization bills, and as we take out of our pocket the little card, which is our voting right, we should ask ourselves whether or not we have the constitutional authority to be voting yes on that spending or authorization bill. And in order to know whether we have that authority, we should be looking to the U.S. Constitution. 
   Now, what this Sunset bill would basically force us to do is to look to see whether we actually have that authority and make each one of those Federal bureaus and agencies and departments and so on and so forth, whether they have that specific authority to do what they have been doing for 20 or 40 or more years, and whether, therefore, they should be eliminated or continued, or not. 
   There have been different perspectives on whether or not these agencies should have the authority. And what we would have to do in this instance is take a look at what the Constitution says. One area we look to is article I, section 8, which basically would set out for the Congress, as they review these agencies and as we should really be looking at any time we look at any piece of legislation that comes before us, and this sets forth the enumerated powers of the Constitution and the powers here in Congress. 
   There are a couple of views on how this is interpreted, but both of them are basically a limitation. Enumerated powers means that if it's listed in the Constitution, they are enumerating, they are listing certain powers that we have the right of. And therefore, the converse of that is if they are not enumerated, if they are not listed, then, therefore, we do not have the power to do so. And therefore, if there is an agency that does not have the specific powers to conduct its activity, that program should be eliminated. 
   Now, the one view most strict on this, of course, was James Madison, who repeatedly argued that the power to tax and spend, which is what we're talking about when we're talking about appropriations or authorizations, did not confer upon the Congress the right to do whatever it thought was best in the interest of the Nation, but only to further the ends specifically enumerated elsewhere in the Constitution. So you have to look either there or someplace else in the Constitution. 
   The second view on this, of course, is a little bit broader, but still pretty limited, and would still fall under this bill as far as a review under this bill as to what we should be doing here. And that simply says, does the agency, the bureau's activities, does it contain its own limitation, namely, that spending under this law be for general use, that is, national welfare, not purely for local or regional benefit. And so here what the founders were intending to say is if it's general use, general welfare, does it apply across the board to the benefit of everyone? Now, when we do this, and if this legislation were to become law and we are able to systematically look at each and every agency, I think we would find that much of what we appropriate our dollars for, the taxpayers dollars for does not meet either one of these tests. It is not simply a power that is being enumerated elsewhere in the Constitution, nor is it for the general use of the entire country. And when you look for the definition of the general use of the entire country, we can look again to see how the founders interpreted that when they passed in the First and the Second, Third or Fourth Congress as to how they interpreted it. 
   You know, in the very First Congress of the United States, they looked at an example to make an appropriation for a loan to a glass manufacturer. That piece of legislation failed in Congress after Members expressed the view that such an appropriation would be unconstitutional under article I, section 8. Likewise, under the Fourth Congress, they did not believe the power to provide relief for citizens of Savannah, Georgia after a devastating fire destroyed the entire city; likewise, outside the purview of the Constitution. 
   Whether we are talking about restrictions under this provision or otherwise, the sunset provision would give Congress in the future the opportunity to review each and every agency to make sure that it is operating within the confines of the Constitution as intended by the Founding Fathers, and that it can only be a good thing at the end of the day for the U.S. citizen. 
   With that, I yield the remaining time to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. America, your freedom of speech was trampled on yesterday. This new Democratic leadership quashed any semblance of free speech here on this House floor. This is not just a procedural matter, mind you. This is a matter for all Americans. 
   You see, each Member of Congress represents 600,000 constituents. That is 600,000 American voices that were quashed yesterday. As I say, this is not just a Republican issue, for their voices were quashed, but so were Democrat and Independent voices as well. 
   But in fact, this is nothing new for the new Democrat leadership. Just a week ago we had to come to this floor to make sure we could fight to keep the radio waves and the media opening dealing with the Fairness Doctrine. Prior to this, we had to fight to make sure that the centuries-old tradition of bipartisanship would not be broken. Prior to that, we had to fight to make sure that there would be transparency in earmarks, and all the Republicans fought on the side of openness and freedom of speech.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, throughout this debate, we have heard a vote against this bill is a vote against the children, a vote against the poor, a vote against those who need the help most; and had this legislation merely reauthorized the current law, the arguments might have had an element of truth to them. But with this unconstrained growth in a welfare entitlement bill that this expansion has become, what we do know is that this bill now undermines the health care of millions of uninsured children and insured children and does so at the expense of American seniors. 
   Supporters of this bill would say that by no means is this a back door to a mandatory, socialized, government-run health care system. I say, not the back door, but, as PAUL RYAN might say, it's a front-door approach to a socialized, government-run health care system. Also, it opens the windows and the garage door as well. 
   This bill does not set a cap on the annual income levels of the families it covers, it does not include an asset test to ensure that millionaires are not eligible, and it expands the program to cover childless adults. 
   It is entirely conceivable, and, actually, it probably will occur, that the States can enroll as many people in this program as local politics will make expedient. A benchmark figure that has been bandied about is 300 percent. They want to enroll families up to 300 percent above the poverty level. 
   Just what would that system look like? According to the Census Bureau, and I just got these numbers a little while ago, of the 300 million or so people in this country, 48.3 percent, or roughly 145 million people, live at or below the 300 percent of the Federal poverty level. So we're now considering a new entitlement program for nearly half of the entire population of this country. And if you add to that number the 44 million people who are currently enrolled in Medicare, what does that mean? That means, with this bill, almost two-thirds of the entire population of this country will be on a government-run, socialized health care system, two-thirds paid for by one-third. 
   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it. This proposal is a large step towards a single-payer, Washington-run State health care system.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, this amendment seeks to refocus the GSEs on what is their congressionally mandated responsibility, and that is, providing for and promoting affordable housing. 
   The amendment would direct the new regulator to require the enterprises to only hold mortgages and mortgage-backed securities that exclusively support affordable housing. That is, those mortgages that are extended to households falling below the area's median income in their retained portfolios. 
   Mr. Chairman, the GSEs were created by Congress to do a couple of things. First of all, to create liquidity in the secondary market, and, very importantly here, to provide affordable housing for low and moderate families. Now, to effect this worthy goal, Congress granted these enterprises a number of advantages over private firms, including exemptions from State and local taxation, and also the ability to borrow at lower rates. In fact, Mr. Chairman, Fannie and Freddie used these advantages to borrow at interest rates barely above the Treasury rate. They then buy mortgages from originators and do one of two things; either they package these securities into MBSs, that's mortgage-backed securities, and securitize them, or they retain the purchased mortgages on their own portfolio. 
   Interesting, the combined GSE portfolios have increased from $130 billion in the early 1990s, today it is over $1.5 trillion. The current practice of the GSEs buying derivatives to hedge against the interest rate risks created by these huge portfolios creates an enormous risk for us. And there should be some commensurate level of return on that risk to the taxpayer in the form of lower housing prices for low and moderate homeowners. 
   Federal Reserve studies, however, and those conducted by other organizations, have concluded, and this is important, that consumers receive no direct benefit from the GSE's expansive portfolio holding. Although GSEs as business enterprises should return a profit to their investors, they really can't lose sight of the purpose for which they were created and the additional people to whom they answer, given their special status. They are not simply another business entity. 
   Currently, GSE shareholders receive all of the benefits for the portfolios and none of the risk. In contrast, low and moderate income families bear all the risk and receive few of the benefits. By buying mortgages from banks that are part of the CRA requirement or holding more low income mortgages on their portfolios that might be difficult to securitize, this amendment will help the low and middle income American buyer buy their home and give low and middle income homeowners the benefits comparable to the risk. 
   Let me just end with this quote. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, ``Tying portfolios to a purpose that provides measurable benefits to the public would help ensure that society in general, and not just the shareholders, receive a meaningful return in exchange for accepting the risk inherent in the portfolios. Moreover, defining the scope and purpose of the portfolios in this way would reduce the potential for unbridled growth in those portfolios, while avoiding the imposition of arbitrary caps.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense, good government amendment that will provide the taxpayers, particularly low and middle income taxpayers, more benefits for the risks they bear by helping Fannie and Freddie refocus their job, which is affordable housing. 
   I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense amendment.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. As many Members have said when they have come to this microphone in the past, that when you come to the floor, we can all have our own opinion on these matters, but we can't have all our own facts. To use the gentleman from Georgia and also Florida, too, I think said when it comes to the expression of squeezing all the juice out, that's maybe an appropriate expression, but then the question is where did that juice go to and what should it be used for? 
   Well, my suggestion is that the juice should not necessarily always be used for the benefit of the stockholders, but the juice should be basically used for, what was the intent here, to provide for affordable housing for low and moderate income. And as the gentleman from Louisiana just indicated, as we've heard from all the testimony in the committees, the GSEs have not been doing the job that we wanted them to do. And one of the reasons I believe that we now see a bill before us to put on this new housing fund is in part because they have not been doing their job. Had they been doing their job as Congress directed them to some time ago, we may not have come to this position today where we have to be debating the issue of the housing fund, which is a separate issue. 
   The point, though, as far as where the juice goes to and what the real facts are, we also heard testimony of Chairman Bernanke when he came to the floor, and there are also GAO studies that have looked at this as well, and what do they say? Where does the juice really go to when the portfolios expand to this level? And they include not just the low and moderate income, but the higher ones, since the low moderate income is so small. Where does the juice go to now? The juice goes to the stockholders. That is not what I am interested in making sure happens. I am interested in making sure that the juice ends up with affordable housing.

But your argument before, if I heard you correctly, when we had a little dialogue before, was that it is your intent with the overall housing fund and where the money would come from is not from the homeowners. Your intention, if I understood correctly, was from the stockholders, from the investors.     
   My bill would do the exact same thing and say that it would not be coming from the homeowner or the investor as far as any burden on them.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. 
   To the point of the chairman, I am a little bit confused. He said that I have repeated his position four times differently. I have only been on the microphone three times now. But I am also confused on his position as to whether or not there really is an MTI, a mortgage tax increase, because initially he said it is going to be on the homeowners and it is not going to be on the stockholders. Now he says that money is fungible so it really can come from either place. 
   So, at the end of the day, I guess my original assertion was that there is an MTI, there is a mortgage tax increase, because they can come from the homeowners. 
   From the gentleman from Georgia, when he says there is a cross-subsidization from the larger portfolio, I would like to see the evidence of that. The evidence that we heard in committee on that point was from Chairman Bernanke and from the studies was there was not that cross-subsidization, and that in fact all the benefit comes not to the homeowners, the benefit comes to who? It comes to the shareholders. 
   In fact, under Chairman Bernanke's testimony, it would be better if the portfolios would be limited to this. Why? Because then they would do better than what the gentleman from Louisiana said, there is a fractional amount of work they are doing as far as helping the low income homeowners, and instead they would be holding those in their portfolios, those mortgages, as he said ``difficult to securitize.'' That would help out. That is giving real juice to the low and moderate income homeowner. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Chair would remind Members that under the 5-minute rule, the Members recognized may not yield specific amounts of time to be enforced by the Chair, but rather must reclaim their time as they see fit.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Well, it is a good question, but it was a question that was essentially raised during the committee and answered by Chairman Bernanke at the time. 
   If Chairman Bernanke said, yes, there was with regard to the portfolios held by the GSEs a cross-subsidization of the market and therefore a benefit to the low and moderate income mortgages that they have, then the chairman's argument would be a correct one. But Chairman Bernanke did not say that.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. The gentleman, first of all, misstates the actual language of the underlying bill when he says that the housing fund is a tax on profits of the GSEs. It is not a tax simply on the profits of the GSEs. It is a tax of the overall activity.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Just one final point, and I do believe that the gentleman was saying that it was a tax on the profits of the GSEs as opposed to that. But be that as it may, remember, to the point the gentleman from Georgia made, the GSEs, even with this amendment, would still be allowed to securitize those larger loans. 
   This doesn't preclude them from doing that. It simply says that they should not be holding them in their portfolios, whereas the gentleman from Texas reiterated the point of Chairman Bernanke, that raises the overall risk to the overall functioning of the GSEs. 
   Finally, since they are able to continue to issue those large loans and therefore securitize those loans, the overall market of the GSEs is not hurt in one sense, and the profitability at the end of the day, as far as the money going to the low and moderate incomes, is not impacted. 
   Low and moderate income families are benefited by this bill. Taxpayers are benefited by this bill inasmuch as we reduce the risk of the GSEs on the one hand and we address and make sure that the GSEs return to their basic function of providing liquidity to the marketplace and providing access for low and moderate income housing in this country.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from Mississippi, although I cringe when Members on the  other side of the aisle characterize what our motivation is and our interest in these things. 
   I wonder whether the gentleman from Mississippi heard the gentleman from Louisiana speak about the dismal job that the GSEs have done so far with regard to what I believe both of us agree should be their intention which is to provide for low and moderate-income housing, such as the gentleman from Mississippi was talking about. A dismal job. 
   Part of the reason they do that dismal job, their explanation is, these loans, some of these loans are difficult to securitize. If you can't securitize the loans, they are not going to take them. That is their record. The numbers were given before that they hold in their portfolio. A very small percentage of these type of loans, which is the type of loans that the gentleman from Mississippi was talking about holding. 
   All this amendment does is this. It says GSEs, you are supposed to be doing everything the gentleman from Mississippi says we should be doing, and that is providing for housing for low and moderate-income individuals. You are not doing a good job right now. We are going to focus your attention on it. If you are having a problem securitizing these lower loans, fine, don't securitize them, but hold them in your portfolio and make that the crux of your business. Your business should not be, as it has been in the past, simply making larger profits than normal, the raises and salaries given to the top executives. Your business is helping the people in Mississippi and Louisiana. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor at this late evening time now to offer this amendment and, in essence, what we're trying too do here is to, bottom line is to help protect middle class American home owners as we move forward with this legislation with the housing fund in it, with the world class regulator, and to protect the American taxpayer from what we heard not only on the floor tonight, but going all the way back to testimony when this bill was being first considered from Chairman Bernanke, the potential for an MTI, a mortgage tax increase. 
   We know how the underlying bill works. H.R. 1427 takes 1.2 basis points of the GSE's total annual business, not their profit, but the total annual business and directs those funds to help in an appropriate manner, some would say, to provide for low income housing. 
   What this amendment does not do, and I know we have heard from the other side every time we tried to make any improvement to this legislation, that we characterize our efforts to improve the legislation to try to kill the underlying fund in this bill. Anyone making a clear reading of this amendment would realize this amendment does not do that in any way shape or form. This does not kill the fund. It improves the fund and it does so in a manner consistent with what the chairman said he has intended for the underlying bill in the first place, and that is to say that the increased tax would not hit those who we're trying to help, the low and moderate income earners. 
   How does it do that? Well, if you just look to the text of the amendment, section 4, prohibits pass through of costs of allocation. The director shall by regulation prohibit such enterprises, the GSEs from treating the cost of enterprises of making allocation required under paragraph 1 as regular business expenses. In essence, what the amendment does is says it cannot pass those costs down the line to the originator and to the home owners. It has to be just where the chairman has said he intended it to be all along, on the stockholders and the investors in the GSEs. 
   So I would hope that this commonsense amendment which basically effectuates what the Chairman said he intended for this legislation would seek unanimous support.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   First of all, let me commend the chairman on his work on this legislation with regard to the underlying and the basic principle where this whole legislation came from; and that is, to create a world class regulator, I think was the buzz word when we first started working on this, with regard to the GSEs. And when the night is done and we vote on final passage of this, I hope that the language in the bill, I see the chairman is leaving. But I hope that the chairman will stick to his promise and the assertions that what we have in this is a good regulator, and it will not have any amendments that will water that down. 
   But to the point of the ranking member's amendment, I stand in support of the amendment. We should look at this and realize that what we have in this housing fund is an MTI, a mortgage tax increase. After this bill becomes law and a prospective homeowner goes to buy his next house and he sits there at the lawyer's office with the stack of papers this high that they have to fill out, somewhere in those documents buried in all the fine print and other costs that always are found in a home purchase at the last minute will be increased costs to them, an MTI, a mortgage tax increase. 
   Why is that? Because, as the ranking member indicates, you can't pull money out of thin air. We are not creating perpetual motion by this bill. They are trying to set with the housing fund a new flow of money to go into this. But where does it come from? 
   Now, the chairman of the committee constantly retorts that it is not coming from the perspective home buyer, it is not coming from the low and moderate income individual, who is just getting enough money together to buy that first house. And yet the door is slammed shut on them because one more tax, an MTI, a mortgage tax increase, is coming through this bill. 
   The chairman would suggest that it is coming exclusively from the stockholders. I don't see the chairman on floor at this time, but I would offer and entertain from the chairman whether he would accept an amendment to the bill right now that would specifically say that: That no increase in fees can be charged; that we cannot raise any taxes on the individual; and that all the money has to come from the stockholders.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Reclaiming my time. Because I have heard the gentleman make that charge with regard to my amendment, which has not come to the floor yet and I will be glad to get into a debate on my amendment later on. But the amendment that is before us right now addresses the issue as far as this MTI, mortgage tax increase. 
   And I appreciate the chairman now coming to the floor and saying specifically that his comments earlier was not absolutely correct when he said it would all come from the stockholders. Before he said it would come from the stockholders and not from the home buyers. Now he just indicated that you can't put that in language because you cannot actually prove that is going to occur. And that is my point, that at the end of the day the GSEs are in control of this. They will have the tax on them; they will have to decide where this tax is going to be placed. Is it on the poor, low income family, who has no bargaining rights with the GSEs at all; or will be with their stockholders, which the chairman just admitted that we as a legislative body cannot control.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. And I am not naive in my politics or on economics at all. Because we know that, in business, at the end of the day the cost of anything that we buy is eventually paid for by whom? By the consumer. 
   You can say that you are pushing it off onto the stockholders or the investors of the company, but at that point in time you realize that if it raises the price too much for the stockholders or investors to invest in that company, what will they do? They will step back and they will not invest in that entity anymore, they will not invest in that company anymore, which raises the overall cost for investment for that entity. In this situation, then where does the cost go to? It goes to the consumer. 
   Mr. Chairman, we should be opposed to this mortgage tax increase.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman. 
   As I so often say when I come to the floor, in looking back 16 months, this country has been under the control of the Democrat-led Congress. What has those 16 months wrought? We have higher food prices, a recession now in the economy with which almost everyone agrees, even former Chairman Greenspan, housing prices basically in a free fall down and, of course, energy prices going through the roof. 
   You made a comment about gasoline prices being up to almost $4 a gallon by the summer. Of course, diesel fuel already, in my neck of the woods, the great State of New Jersey, is at $4 a gallon. 
   It amazes me each time I drive past the pump. I don't use diesel. Truckers most often do. Farming equipment on the farms do. Of course, I am amazed that people are still able to make a living. 
   But 16 months under a Democrat-controlled rule here in the House of Representatives, what has it wrought? We have higher food prices, a recession in the economy, free fall of the housing prices and energy prices through the roof, causing hardships for all Americans. 
   I come from the State of New Jersey. When I go home, I just went home for the weekend, and I talked to my friends and constituents back home. They are paying the price, at the pump, at the food store, everywhere, and it's creating a real hardship for the American family. 
   When the American family sits down each week and pays their bills, gets out their checkbook, and say how are we going to pay this month's mortgage payment, this month's rent payment, first they have to pay all of these other expenses. 
   At the end of the week, they realize the money is just not in the checkbook anymore. One of the root causes is the price of fuel. They are probably scratching their heads saying what is the Democrat-led majority in the House doing about it? Where is that plan that you were referring to that the Democrats campaigned on 18 months ago before they took over the majority? Where is that plan during these last 16 months now that they have been in the majority? 
   My constituents wait. You and I wait. 
   In the meantime, let's take a look at the facts. Democrats make all sorts of claims about the price of energy, about the price of gasoline prices. I would like to address just three or four of them. 
   First of all, one of the most frequent things, and you see hearings on this over and over, Democrats will say, well, it's because of America, it's because of those American oil companies that we have skyrocketing prices. Let's get into the facts a little bit about that, though. U.S. energy companies are not even in the top 10 when you look at total proven oil reserves and gas reserves in the entire world.  
   For example, ExxonMobil has less than 5 percent of the stock held by Saudi Aramco. A full 53 percent of the price we pay for gasoline when we go to the pump is related to the price of the crude oil that goes into it, a world commodity. 
   Can Democrats really accuse American oil companies of so influencing prices when they own such a marginally small amount of the total world supply? When we think about it, this is a part and parcel of the Democrat blame America first doctrine here too in energy. 
   Secondly, Democrats say that the U.S. needs to decrease demand for oil. We have to live more modestly, I guess, is what that really translates out to be. 
   It turns out the facts are this, in recent years U.S. American families' demand for oil and all its uses has actually begun to stabilize, and we have seen over a period of time an actual decrease in the amount of use. Meanwhile, world demand for oil has actually increased to 84 million barrels a year. That's an increase of 16 million barrels just over the last decade. 
   While we are willing and able and want to work with the other side of the aisle to come up with ways to conserve fuel, the facts point to the fact that we should not be blaming America first with regard to increased use of oil. But it's the rest of the world that is just increasing their consumption, which is a supply and demand factor. 
   Thirdly, Democrats are off to say that the Americans already have reliable access to energy supplies. Well, when we get into the facts, it refutes what the Democrats are saying.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Just a couple of points and then I will yield. 
   I agree with the gentleman that in some respects, perhaps, this body should not be engaged in micromanaging various aspects of the Federal Government where we do not have expertise. 
   Earlier today, and in just the past week, we had a complete debate on that subject of whether this body, all 535 Members, were in appropriate position to micromanage the war, and I think some of us thought that we were not in the best position but that we should have, just as you are suggesting here, the trained professionals, the experts, the people on the field who are engaged in this activity on a daily basis make those decisions. 
   So I would agree with the gentleman there. And if we were to have consistency, then we should not be engaged in that matter and we should not be engaged in this case. 
   Let me make my second point and that is this: It is not incumbent upon the gentleman from California to be the expert in these areas that he is raising questions about. The underlying bill is not the gentleman from California's bill. It is the majority party's bill. It is your bill. You are coming to the floor making the case, or I should say the other side of the aisle, as I am speaking to the Chair, making the case that we should be spending all this money on these programs. So it is incumbent upon the offerer of the underlying legislation to make the case why we should be doing it and have the information why each one of these is justified so that when either the gentleman from California or Georgia raises the legitimate question, the same question that we are going to get when we go back to our constituents and are asked why did we vote on it, he should be making the justification for that. 
   With that, I will yield to the gentleman from Georgia.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I, too, echo the words of my colleagues who are in support of the overall funding of the National Science Foundation, and I offer this amendment to H.R. 1867, which I hope will provide incentives for the NSF to identify waste and any abuse within the Agency, but also, very importantly, to help identify those programs which are either underperforming or simply just not working. 
   I believe this legislation will help be a model of fiscal responsibility. It is similar to the legislation we just heard from in two respects. H.R. 1867 authorizes the National Science Foundation to increase their spending, which goes to the point of the gentleman from Michigan was saying before, by 7 percent, and again in 2009 and 2010. 
   The point we must make here, though, is inflation has remained constant during this same time period at around 3 percent. So when we purport to be so concerned about the taxpayers' dollars and the debt we are leaving our children, which I just heard from the gentleman from the other side of the aisle previously, how can we justify programmic increases for research that are actually more than twice the rate of inflation? 
   As I referenced before, when I go back to my constituents back at home in town hall meetings and the like, they are not seeing 7 percent increases in their wages and salaries. They are not seeing a doubling of their incomes and their family household incomes. They may be seeing that as far as their expenses are concerned. They are seeing all other sorts of increases in spending, such as gasoline prices and the like that they have to put up with, but they are not seeing the increases in income and expenditures that we are seeing in this bill. 
   I will comment on one comment that the gentleman from the other side of the aisle made before as far as being consistent. I think we heard the American public on this past election day. The American public is concerned about overspending by Congress. They want us to prioritize where our dollars go. They want to make sure that we are spending every dime efficiently and appropriately. 
   I have yet, however, to hear one suggestion from the other side of the aisle, either here on the floor or on the Budget Committee, on which I serve with some of the gentleman on the other side of the aisle, as to where we with can make some of those cuts. Instead, what we are seeing is a continual increase in spending. 
   Another point to make as well: Time after time our constituents come to our office quoting the discrepancy between authorization levels and appropriation levels. It is my hope that instead of having to disappoint them once again, that we set realistic authorization levels that may actually be realistic to the appropriation levels that come down the line. Let's be realistic, both on what we can do for our constituents and also what the appropriators may be doing with this bill later on. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, because it is our duty simply as stewards of our constituents' money, the taxpayers' dollars, as we step forward to make an honest assessment of what we can afford and should afford the American taxpayer.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe the other side of the aisle has mischaracterized what this amendment does when they speak of cuts and pullbacks from science and the Foundation. Nothing of the kind is in this amendment. Instead, we will still be increasing spending this year and next year and next year and next year up to $20.87 billion for these appropriated expenditures on the National Science Foundation, instead of $20.97 billion. 
   I am very much concerned about education and science and our research. Let me just add, I am also concerned about the education of our youth. My constituents are just as concerned about educating their kids and being able to afford to send their kids to college and how do they pay for that? My constituents are concerned about the health care and the medical expenditures for their families and how do they pay for that? My constituents are concerned about the housing for their family and loved ones, and how do they pay for that? 
   They are not seeing a 7 percent increase in their wages and salaries, even though each and every one of those things are just as vitally important to them as it is that we spend money on overall Science Foundation research in the United States of America.     
   This amendment would not cut spending by a dime. This amendment would simply limit the growth rate from 7 percent down to 6.5 percent. The last amendment was seeing it go down from 7 percent to 6 percent. This would be even less, from 7 to 6.5 percent. You would still be seeing a growth year after year after year. The NSF would still be allowed to expend their dollars on those critical areas that my friend from Georgia and the Members on the other side of the aisle are so concerned about for the betterment of this country. 
   I would implore the Members on the other side of the aisle that if we are to be consistent when we talk about the overall spending and revenue side for this Congress, that we stop doing what the other side of the aisle has done. They have only looked at the revenue side of the equation so far in the last 3 or 4 months, giving us the largest tax increase in America's history on the other hand, but have done absolutely nothing for the American public when it says how are we going to set priorities for the American public and what we spend money on, and how are we going to try to rein in spending for the American public as well. I think we need to do it on both sides. 
   Finally, regarding what the gentleman from Michigan said, I agree with him. If we can do it across the board for all of the other programs, I am right in line with him, and I support him on that endeavor as well. Let's start here, and I will be the first one to cosponsor any of his amendments to do likewise, decreasing the overall increases of spending that this government has.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, just beginning where the last comment on the last bill ended up, I appreciate the gentleman pointing out that this side did support a doubling of the NSF, and I was probably one of those who was there to support the increase; so no one, I think, can take the position that we are not uniformly as a body or as a party opposed to the general notion of increasing, making significant increases to applied research or general research, I should say, by the NSF. 
   What we can ask, though, is after the last election, has the American voter spoken with regard to the overall growth in Federal spending in all areas, whether it is in science and health care, whether it is in the war, for veterans or other areas; should we not look at each one individually and decide some should go up, some should remain the same, and some should go up at a slightly different way? That is what we are suggesting in the last amendment, simply that they should go up at a slightly different arc than they are in the underlying bill, 6.5 percent instead of 7 percent. 
   In the amendment before us right now, we look to see what is the underlying mission of the NSF. If we look at their mission statement, we see it is: ``To promote the progress of science, advance the national health, prosperity and welfare and secure the national defense.'' 
   But during these tough fiscal times, both at the Federal level and at the family level, as I pointed out before, Congress must exercise good stewardship over every penny of taxpayers' dollars. This includes helping the NSF to focus on its priority projects. 
   Just as the gentleman from Georgia indicated, he has been visited by a number of people from various groups dealing with health issues, so have I; people with serious health issues like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and diabetes. They come and ask what are we doing and how are we prioritizing for their concerns within the NSF. 
   The amendment before you simply says can we find more than a quarter million dollars to fund research on such programs as reproductive aging symptoms of midlife Bangladeshi immigrants, but not more funding for research projects which might bring progress and eventually cures for some of the serious illnesses we have already heard about on the floor? 
   In addition, how can we justify research like the diet and social stratification of ancient cultures when here at home current medical research is so desperately needed? 
   Now, I understand that the point has been already made that we do not specifically itemize in the authorization bills each one of these specific programs, but these are, as the gentleman knows, programs which have already been authorized in the past and are continuing under the law right now into 2007 and 2008. 
   So doesn't it behoove us here in Congress to make a statement, to make a stand and say that at least in several of these areas we can make a position that our limited dollars should not be going to those areas, but instead we would make the position that they should be going for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes and cancer research and some other areas that we have previously spoken about? 
   So I encourage my colleagues, do not only exercise good stewardship over the taxpayers' dollars, but in essence to also ensure that worthy projects receive the funding they deserve within that noble mission that I set forth at the beginning, ``To promote the progress of science, advance the national health, prosperity and welfare and secure the national defense.''

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, again, I thank the gentleman for yielding. The gentleman is a doctor and I am not going to ask him for his medical expertise because, as you say, that is not our role here to delve into these things but to simply raise the questions. 
   I will tell you this, that when I come back to my constituents and they tell me about their health concerns, whether it is menopause or cancer or otherwise, their first concern is how are they going to address their own health needs, how are they going to address their health care costs and what are we doing here about it. Their second question is what research are we doing here at home for these areas. 
   The study that you reference, reproductive aging and symptoms experienced at midlife among Bangladeshi immigrants, sedentees, and white London neighbors does not, of course, as the gentleman knows, look to those issues here at home, but rather elsewhere. 
   My constituents will raise the question, is that the first priority or should that be the first priority of the NSF. I am not an expert, I am not a doctor like the gentleman, so I cannot suggest that that is the most important one, but my constituents will certainly raise that question for me, and my constituents will certainly be consistent, as the gentleman from Georgia says, and that we should make sure that those dollars are spent here on their own health concerns first.

   I'm honored to be the sponsor of this resolution, which recognizes those 39 extremely brave men who gave all they had in signing our Nation's founding document. Too often, we forget not only the names of these men but the challenges that they faced and what they put at risk when they came together to do this. 
   For example, our Founding Fathers originally met in Philadelphia to rework the Articles of Confederation. That was the document, you see, which had governed the country after the time of the War of Independence, and really, no one was expecting them to draft an entirely new system of government. And yet, that's what they did, and none of them were certain at that time that this new document would be ratified at all, and I doubt they even recognized the ingenuity of their final product. 
   Yet today, here we are over 200 years later. I think we really take our system for granted and I hope this resolution in some small way will help remind us that the Constitution is a profound document. Our prosperity today and over the 200-some-odd years is built upon the stability of the Constitution. And our posterity to the future has to thank the liberties and freedoms that are set forth and guaranteed in this document. 
   We see other nations around the world have followed in our footsteps by promoting the principles found in our U.S. Constitution, and although it's already been pointed out the U.S. Constitution is a relatively short document, the Founders really get too little credit for their clear and clever direction in it. They intended to set up a Republic of essentially sovereign, self-governing States, with a very small and central but limited government, operating under clearly defined, and as they say, limited powers. 
   It was James Madison who wrote in the Federalist Papers at No. 45 that: ``The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.'' 
   Every time any Member of Congress comes to the floor and they take out their card, about to vote on a particular piece of legislation, they should do what we're doing right now, and that is to reflect upon the U.S. Constitution. And they should be asking themselves is what they're about to vote on constitutional. 
   The gentleman from New Jersey--I'm pleased to see him on the floor with me tonight--raised some of those very same questions. And in light of his comments, I guess we should all have raised those questions last night, as well, as we dealt with the energy package in legislation that came through this House, because, as I indicated a moment before and as, actually, the gentleman from New Jersey already indicated, we were breaking away from Britain at that time to provide the liberties and the freedoms here for the respective States in this country through the War of Independence and then established here in the Constitution. So, too, did our Founding Fathers intend those rights would, as they indicated with Federalist No. 45, remain with those States. 
   What we did last night was abrogated those rights, took away those rights from them, from the respective States, to a very basic source of income and power to those States, to direct what should become of their futures with regard to an important issue such as energy. Legislation that we did last night put on severe restrictions as to the 50 States, at least our coastal States, as to what they can do and what remuneration they might see if they did take particular action with the developing resources, in this case, energy resources, within their States. 
   And so although a lot of the discussion yesterday was on the political ramifications and some of the discussion was on the environmental ramifications, I'm not sure that there was any discussion on the constitutional implications of what was done yesterday and whether we, as Members of Congress, as we took our card and put it in there voting ``yes'' or ``no,'' were considering whether we had the constitutional authority actually to take those rights away from the people that we represent back at home in our respective States, whether we had the constitutional authority to say to those States, no, we're prescribing, no, we're placing limits on your ability to have freedom and prosperity for this generation and future generations, as well, by the limits Congress is placing on them. 
   As the founder and chairman of the Constitution Caucus, I urge my fellow Members here in Congress today going forward then to renew our dedication to faithfully fulfilling our responsibility to the U.S. Constitution. Likewise, I encourage all Americans to take the time today and throughout the rest of the year to reflect upon this important doctrine, to reflect upon the U.S. Constitution, to ensure that freedoms set forth in it, the rights that are set forth in it, are preserved today and for our posterity.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (EARMARK REFORM -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, the majority party ascended to power with a promise that they would make this Congress the most open and ethical Congress ever. Most open and ethical indeed. 
   Perhaps the majority party should have said something like, We will be open and ethical when it suits our purpose. That wouldn't have been a catchy phrase maybe on the campaign trail, but at least it would have been honest. 
   For instance, the majority promised to clean up the earmarking process, but so far that, too, has been a hollow promise. 
   Recently, we had the SCHIP and it was riddled with hidden earmarks. And yet not one sponsor of these provisions has ever been identified, and they have denied that there's any earmarks in them whatsoever. 
   Now the Republican Party has now offered a simple resolution to clean up the process of earmarks, but not a single Democrat has signed on to this resolution. 
   I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in the majority, to allow for a real debate on ethics and earmarks. Let the House debate H.R. 479 so that we can have an open and honest discussion and we can truly get to what you promised, an open and ethical Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (REAUTHORIZATION OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, with all the various important issues that we have been debating on the floor, we should remember one very important issue dealing with education of our children that will be considered here in the House very soon, and, most specifically, that deals with the reauthorization of NCLB, No Child Left Behind. 
   So I come to the floor tonight to address some of the concerns and problems with NCLB and offer a possible solution. That solution, by the way, is the legislation I have submitted, H.R. 3177, the LEARN Act, the Local Education Authority Returns Now, allowing States and parents and local communities to regain control of their education and not have it be here in Washington, DC. 
   As we're all aware, NCLB is really simply a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Act, that's ESEA, from the 1960s. What I've done is I've looked back over the past reauthorizations of ESEA, and I've noticed a very troubling trend. With every single reauthorization, new problems are always found for America's schools, and with every new problem, the solution is always more Federal involvement. 
   You know, all the way back in 1983, almost a quarter of a century ago, a famous report came out. It was called, ``A Nation at Risk,'' and it said that America had fallen dangerously behind the rest of the world in education; but, today, new studies are saying much the same thing. 
   According to the National Center for Education Science, in 2003 U.S. fourth graders were outperformed by their peers in eleven other countries, including four Asian countries and seven European countries. U.S. eighth graders were outperformed by their peers in nine countries, including five Asian and four European. 
   Yet, today, as a percentage of GDP after NCLB, we are still spending more money on education now than at any time in U.S. history. We have increased the paperwork, the requirements for the teachers, more taxpayer dollars, increased administration's burden; but we've decreased the flexibility for the teachers and the power in the classroom. 
   So let me just present two charts, and I would like to thank the work of Dr. Anthony Davies of the Donahue Graduate School of Business of Duquesne University, to make this point. If we look at this chart, the chart shows noninstructional spending and instructional spending in our schools. The top is eighth graders. The bottom is fourth graders.  
   The first chart is noninstructional spending. That is the spending that we use for the buildings, the transportation and the like. You would think that with all these reforms that we have done, that with the increase in spending, you would see an increase in performance. Well, what does the chart actually show? Well, the top chart, again, is eighth graders, and what it's showing is, as you see at the left-hand side of the chart, $3,000 per pupil; on the far side of the chart, $6,500 per pupil. But the performance of the students stays basically the same, regardless of how the dollars coming from Washington are spent. 
   The next color, the red dots, are fourth graders, exactly the same thing. Regardless of whether we're spending around $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 or $6,000, the instructional value of those dollars coming out of these programs, the numbers stay essentially the same. 
   The next chart you look at confirms the same point. This is instructional spending. These are the dollars that actually make their way into the classroom. This is for the books. This is for the teachers. This is what you really think of when you think of education. Same thing: top is eighth graders, bottom is fourth graders. It starts at $2,500 and goes up to $7,500. You would think that with these reforms of NCLB, you would think that with additional dollars going into the classrooms you would see an increase actually in the performance for these grades. But what do we actually see on the chart? 
   Well, for the top, the eighth graders, starting at $2,500, up to $5,000, up to $7,500, the numbers for them for the performance on these scores, under the NAEP score standards, and that's the national standards of assessments for kids, the numbers are even right across the chart. Likewise, on the bottom part of this chart, that's the fourth graders, the red little squares. Again, we're looking in the same dollar values, $2,500 up to $7,500, middle it's around $5,000. How do we look at the NAEP scores? How do they change? Basically, not at all. It's in a range here of between 420 and 480 for all those students regardless of the spending of the dollars. 
   So the point of these two charts, and, again, I appreciate the work of Anthony Davies for compiling this information, is to show that throughout history the Federal Government looks to say that there's a problem with Americans' education. We say we're going to be the solution for our children in this country, and the solution is going to be what? Well, last time it was NCLB, No Child Left Behind, and now it's going to potentially be a reauthorization of that. I suggest no. 
   And I would conclude by saying that the solution is not more work on the Federal level, but more control by the parent and the local school board for the raising of their own children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House today is considering H. Res. 121 which rightly recognizes the plight of Korean comfort women during the 1930s and WorId War II. I was proud to cosponsor this resolution which calls on the nation of Japan to formally recognize and apologize for these crimes. 
   After the Japanese occupation of Korea in the 1930s, the army forced young women to work in brothels. In some cases kidnapped women were transported overseas for sexual servitude. At the end of WorId War II, these women were left scarred and in many cases far from home with no resources. 
   Sadly, there are some in Japan who still insist that the army was not formally involved with these crimes or that the women chose to become involved in prostitution. The evidence clearly demonstrates that this was not the case. It is far past time for the Japanese government to recognize the role the army played in these crimes. 
   Today, we call on them to apologize to the few women who continue to live with the shame of the crimes committed against them. While the relationship between Korea and Japan has improved as both countries turned into thriving democracies, the issue of the comfort women continues to come between them. I hope that this resolution will promote reconciliation so that both countries can move together into a future of cooperation and friendship.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (DARFUR ACCOUNTABILITY AND DIVESTMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to join with the chairman in support of H.R. 180, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act. 
   I'm increasingly concerned, I'm outraged in a sense, about the continuing atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan. Without question, the horrific actions of the janjaweed militia and the Sudanese Government must immediately end. And the nations of the world must speak in unison against this genocide, and that is what it is, a genocide. 
   Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed, many of them in particularly brutal ways. Another estimated 2 million in Darfur have been displaced refugees, plus hundreds of thousands in Chad. This is a crisis that must be addressed now and must be addressed on each and every front. 
   Unfortunately, the international community, specifically in the United Nations, the U.N. has consistently failed in efforts to bring peace to this region. U.N. resolutions have lacked the teeth or failed to be implemented, and that is because of the Security Council members such as China and Russia as they continue to stall the progress. 
   So as the U.N. slowly moves towards a real peacekeeping force, other groups are being forced to pull out because of violence in the region. Thus, recently, OxFam announced in June that they will have to pull out of the largest camp in Darfur, where more than 130,000 people have found shelter; and without a way to protect humanitarian aid flowing into the area, thousands more will face starvation. 
   That is why I'm pleased we are bringing this important legislation to the floor today, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act. 
   It requires the Secretary of the Treasury to create a list of companies that have a direct investment in or are conducting businesses operations in Sudan's power, mineral, oil or military equipment industries. 
   It authorizes States and local municipalities to divest based on the Treasury list or other lists to protect them from lawsuits. 
   It amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to protect mutual funds and pension funds from lawsuits if they choose to divest from companies on the Treasury list. 
   And finally, fourthly, it prohibits the U.S. Government from entering into or renewing contracts with companies on that list. 
   I was very pleased, as I say, Mr. Speaker, with the chairman working in a bipartisan manner with myself and Ranking Member Bachus on the committee, and we agreed to make a number of changes to the bill to address some of the concerns made from our side of the aisle. One of the specific changes that was made was calls on countries around the world to take similar steps with regard to the situation. 
   The section states: ``It is the sense of the Congress that the governments of all other countries should adopt measures, similar to those contained in this act, to publicize the activities of all persons that, through their financial dealings, knowingly or unknowingly enable the Government of Sudan to continue to oppress and commit genocide against people in the Darfur region and other regions of Sudan, and to  authorize divestment from, and the avoidance of further investment in, the persons.'' 
   As the distinguished ranking member of the committee, Mr. Bachus, has noted, ``Economic and financial considerations are important, but in a loving Nation can never be as justification for complicity in genocide. Closing our financial markets to those who participate directly or indirectly in the slaughter of innocent human beings is well within our ability and ought to be a bedrock principle. America is a loving Nation, and allowing our financial markets to be utilized by an evil regime which conducts religious and racial genocide is inconsistent with our values and principles.'' 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I begin by saying that over the last couple of years there have been multiple genocides that occurred under the U.N.'s watch. There was Bosnia, Rwanda and now Darfur. Each time the U.N. has failed to take appropriate action. Each time it is because of political and economic pressure. 
   When the current situation arose in Darfur, the best that we could get out of the U.N. and then-Secretary General Kofi Annan was, at the anniversary of Rwanda, simply a statement on the floor of that anniversary and a moment of silence and the pledge this shall never happen again. Unfortunately, it has happened again. That is why we are here today.

   It was just last year when U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Mark Malloch Brown said with regard to Darfur on this point: ``And yet what can the U.S. do alone in the heart of Africa in a region the size of France? In essence, the U.S. is stymied before it even passes Go. It needs a multilateral means to address the Sudan's concerns.'' I believe that is true, but this is the first step in that direction. 
   With that, I once again thank the gentlelady from California and the chairman as well for their work together in a bipartisan manner on this legislation

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (IRAN SANCTIONS ENABLING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I also thank again the distinguished chairman of the committee for bringing this important legislation to the floor. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 2347, the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act. The radical hard-line Islamic leadership of Iran presents one of the most serious threats today to peace and stability throughout the world. First, their quest to acquire nuclear weapons technology, when you combine that with comments by the Iranian President such that the Nation of Israel should be ``wiped off the map,'' make it clear that the Iranian leadership is unpredictable and dangerous. 
   The Iranian President has gone even farther by speculating that the collateral damage of attacking Israel with nuclear weapons would be worth the cost to the Muslim world. So for a regime that is developing nuclear capabilities, these are truly extraordinary words, and the world must take notice. 
   The Iranian President and the Ayatollah's supreme wish is the destruction of Israel and all of her people. They have not tried to mask their goal. They doubt that the Holocaust ever occurred in the past, and now they're making plans for the Holocaust of the future. And there is no doubt about it. Their fresh Holocaust will stretch far beyond the borders of Israel. They will encompass all whom they consider a threat to their values and to their plans. So to confront Iran now is not only in the national interest, it is also in our interest because the U.S. will surely sometime be a target itself. 
   There is much talk at the U.N. about preventing wars and genocide, but, unfortunately, there is so too little action. The world should not ignore these words now of aggression. Because of the lack of success the U.N. has had in keeping the nuclear technology out of the hands of these radicals, the United States must now take the appropriate measures and work directly with all of our allies to do everything in our power to prevent Iran from obtaining those weapons. 
   And so that is why I'm here today. I am pleased with H.R. 2347, for this act will do several important measures. First, as indicated, it permits, permits, not mandates, the divestiture from companies with investments of $20 million or more in Iran's energy sector. 
   Secondly, it directs the Federal Government to produce a list of such companies that qualify for such investment. 
   Thirdly, it authorizes State governments, local governments and public educational institutions to divest even their pension fund assets from companies on that list. 
   Fourthly, it permits private investment and pension plan managers to divest from companies listed, as the chairman states, without breaching their fiduciary responsibilities. 
   As the committee report herein notes, companies based in the U.S. are already barred from doing business with Iran. But these trade investment sanctions do not extend to foreign companies which operate legally. Foreign persons that invested in Iran's energy sector, despite Iran's support of international terrorism and its nuclear program, have provided additional financial means for Iran's activities in these areas, and many United States persons have unknowingly invested in those same persons. 
   So Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, it is my hope that by allowing U.S. companies to divest their financial interests from any foreign-owned companies doing business with Iran, we will continue to put that pressure on that radical Iranian leadership to end their stated goals of acquiring nuclear weapons and encourage other countries to bolster their trade and economic restrictions on Iran as well. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this small but very important step in reining in this extremist regime. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I want to stand and say I am pleased today that the rule will provide one amendment that CHRIS SHAYS from Connecticut and myself also brought to the committee yesterday, but I also want to take this 1 minute to say that I had been hopeful that we could have had a vote on another amendment which would have delayed the FAA's New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia airspace redesign until a further study could have concluded. 
   You see, Mr. Chairman, the air routes, in an attempt to cut delays, means that thousands of residents will be exposed to new levels of aircraft noise and pollution. There is great concern in townships throughout my district that these new routes will negatively impact upon the quality of life. 
   The FAA claims to have looked into alternative options to decrease airline delays, but all those options dealt with changing the design of the airspace and reroutes over quiet neighborhoods; yet the FAA has admitted that many of the frustrating delays are caused not by airplane congestion but by airline overscheduling. The amendment that unfortunately did not come out of Rules would have required that the FAA look into those matters before  proceeding. But, again, I am appreciative of the fact that what did come out of Rules, an amendment that we will be discussing a little later on to allow for further studies by the GAO.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chair and I thank the ranking member and I thank the chairman as well for this opportunity to engage in this colloquy. I'd like to thank my friend from Florida for your advice and your assistance on this matter with regard to the New Jersey and New York airspace redesign. 
   The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) knows the issue firsthand because he has traveled up to New Jersey last year and knows of its importance as a top concern for the residents of north Jersey. 
   I need to reiterate my concerns with the FAA's record of decision-making regarding this design plan. The alternative chosen by the FAA will reroute planes over areas that used to be quiet communities in an effort to reduce delays and air congestion. But because of this, thousands of residents in north Jersey will soon have planes flying over their homes for the first time ever. And these citizens are justifiably concerned that the increase in noise and pollution and affecting their quality of life will be negative. 
   Just recently, over 1,400 of these concerned citizens showed up at an FAA meeting to make their concerns known to the design plan. Unfortunately, the FAA did not listen to their concerns and they published their record anyway earlier this month. The FAA chose this plan because they believe it will achieve their goal of reducing delays. Despite all attempts by myself, other colleagues, local officials, there was no attempt at all to balance this goal with the needs of the citizens of the area. There was also no attempt to consider other factors such as airline overscheduling and the size of the planes flying in and out of the area.     
   Only air routes were studied. 
   I understand that the legislation we have before us today attempts to deal with the problem of overscheduling, and it would be my hope that the FAA will continue to review the New Jersey airspace issues with an eye towards these less-intrusive solutions to the delay problems. 
   I would appreciate, then, the support and assistance of the chairman and the ranking member to determine if there are other practical steps that can be taken to decrease the noise and, therefore, to increase the quality of life that this will incur. 
   I yield now to the gentleman from Florida.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to offer this amendment with my colleague from Connecticut. The FAA recently released their Record of Decision regarding the New York/New Jersey/Philadelphia Airspace Redesign and it simply fails to achieve a livable balance for tens of thousands of citizens living in north Jersey. 
   The State goal of the redesign was to reduce delays and airspace congestion: the FAA met this goal by flying planes over communities that up till now have not had to deal with the noise and pollution generated by overhead air routes. The FAA's study failed to look into any strategies other than airspace redesign to reduce delays and congestion. 
   Our amendment will ask the GAO to evaluate how other strategies could reduce delay. I have asked the FAA to review alternative strategies and politely been rebuffed. Perhaps when we compare the results of this study with the FAA's claims perhaps we can have a clear view of whether rerouting planes over our communities is really called for. 
   While the Record of Decision has been issued, the plans contained in it will be implemented over a course of years. I am hopeful that this will give the FAA time to reconsider and to reconstruct their plans to accommodate the concerns of citizens below the flight paths.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I often come to the floor, and I often preface my remarks when I have an amendment, saying that I come to the floor tonight with a commonsense amendment. Quite candidly, I think that is more than apropos when I speak about what I'm here to speak about tonight. 
   My amendment simply does this: It seeks to increase the funds for State veterans homes, and it does so in the amount of $18 million. From where does it get the money? Well, it does so by reducing the administrative expenses by a mere less than 1 percent, and that's a critical number, less than 1 percent. We believe that within that over billion dollar line that there is more than enough aptitude for going in and for finding less than 1 percent of additional funds that we could take out and put to a worthy cause such as toward our State veterans homes. 
   Today, there are 126 State extended care facilities. They're extended across all 50 States and in Puerto Rico as well. These veterans homes care for nearly 30,000 of our Nation's heroes. The number of veterans requiring care will continue to increase as servicemembers return from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Currently, there is a backlog, a huge, extensive backlog of projects waiting for funds. Now, many of these projects on this waiting list are critical for providing veterans with a healthy and secure environment. In fact, of the almost 200 projects waiting for Federal funds, nearly half of them are classified as priority 1.  
   I believe it is our duty to see that these facilities are able to provide the highest quality of care for the lives of those who have made the sacrifices for our Nation. After all, you can't really just call these things ``institutions'' anymore. These really are the homes where our veterans will spend out the days of their lives. 
   The staffs of these homes work hard to honor our veterans and to ensure that their last years are spent in comfort. I've had the pleasure now of working with folks back at the Paramus Veterans Home in my district in Bergen County, New Jersey. I've frequently visited with them and with their relatives who would come and visit, and local veterans organizations around the area would also come in, and they would work with them. These service organizations have worked hard to raise matching funds for these types of essential projects at these facilities. Likewise, they do across the Nation and, I'm sure, in each of your districts as well. 
   I would also like to make one other point. That is, in the Senate bill, in the Senate MilCon-VA Appropriations bill, they designate $1.779 billion for general operating expenses while the House version designates $1.801 billion. So we appropriate a little bit more than the Senate does. So that 1 percent cut from the appropriations line for the general operating expenses would still leave more money in the final version of the bill than the Senate version currently has. We know we have different numbers here so that, when it gets to conference, those numbers have to come into an equilibrium of some sense. We're up here. The Senate is over here. This will bring us closer to that equilibrium. 
   In addition, our colleagues over on the Senate Appropriations Committee have approved $250 million for the State veterans homes while the House budget only puts in $165 million. So my amendment would simply reduce this discrepancy by increasing the funding for State veterans homes by $18 million. In other words, we're in the House at $165 million. The Senate is at $250 million. We're just trying to bring the House number up a little bit closer to where the Senate is, which probably will happen once it gets into conference committee, because those numbers have to work together. 
   So I'm just suggesting that a tiny, less than 1 percent cut in the administrative operations would allow us to provide our country's heroes with a better quality of life, and I think that's what we owe all of them.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   It appears that we're on the same page on this, but let me just make this one suggestion: 
   While the 250 positions are out there and while there's a waiting list out there for that group, there's also, as I've suggested, around 200-some-odd projects or more, actually, over half of which are on a critical category 1 list. So we have two important lists that have long waiting lists that have to be addressed. 
   My suggestion is that, if this were to pass and if we were to reduce the funds by $18 million, there's nothing in the amendment that says to the administration take the $18 million out of this over $1.4 billion line and take it from the 250. You and I would have to agree that they must be able to find some other area to take it from than these 250.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, ``I forbid,'' the Speaker, Democrat Speaker of the House, came to the floor and gave a translation of the Latin ``veto'' and explained to us that it means ``I forbid.'' 
   Well, I can tell you the only veto that is occurring with regard to children's health care and care for the indigent poor is occurring here tonight at the hands of the Democrat majority. 
   The Democrat majority is vetoing. They are saying I forbid to move forward on this legislation. Republicans have expressed the desire to move forward and reached out and said in willingness to work together. 
   Just a moment ago, a freshman of the Democrat side of the aisle came to that podium and cited a figure that 80 percent of the American public, as he said, quote, wishes to advance children's health care for indigent poor children. The word ``advance'' means to move forward. 
   But Speaker Pelosi came to the floor and said, I forbid. I will veto moving forward tonight. Instead, put it on abeyance, put it on hold and say we have to put it off for another month. 
   What are they putting off? Well, they are trying to move forward later on on a bill that brings us socialized health care for illegal aliens, for adults, for children, for adults. No one has denied  that it's for adults. It is for childless couples and, by definition, is not for the poor. It is for middle class because, as we know, the median income in this country is $42,000. This bill will allow people upwards to $62,000 or $70,000 to be eligible for this program. By definition, therefore, it will provide for a middle-class program for universal health care. 
   Now, in conclusion, the Democrat conference leader explains why they are saying that they are forbidding moving forward and is very clear. He said, I enjoy politics, and that's what this bill is all about. It is about politics. 
   So to those who come to the floor tonight from the other side of the aisle and with a heartfelt passion that I believe is in their heart that they wish to move forward on moving advanced care for our children, I would ask your rank-and-file Members of that side of the aisle to talk to your leadership and say, Do not veto this effort. Do not say I forbid moving forward, and allow us to move forward on providing health care for indigent, poor children in this country tonight and vote ``no'' on this motion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Thank you, and I shall be brief. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I sit here and read the bill, I consider it a riddle: When is a tax cut not a tax cut? When it really raises your taxes in the end? 
   This legislation, as many tax bills, is masquerading as a tax cut, when at the end of the day citizens of this country will see their taxes rise. 
   The tax cuts in this bill are temporary. The tax increases in this bill are permanent. There are good parts in the bill. Section 179, expensing, is a good part; the tip credit, which was mentioned earlier, a good part. 
   Portions were left out, as we discussed during the rule, such as deductions for State and local tax deductions should have been in here. But even beyond that, even if they were, it is a bad bill, because it raises your taxes. Business lobby may be out there protecting the tax businesses, who is protecting the individual taxpayer? 
   Earlier today, we received a flier from NTU, National Taxpayer Union, which said, according to the CBO, H.R. 976 would increase net taxes by providing only temporary tax cuts in exchange for permanent tax hikes. 
   Furthermore, a memo from RSE indicates similarly. H.R. 976 would permanently increase taxes on some taxpayers, while others would see them go down. 
   This bill was also scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation. So it is not just my word on it. It is not the word of NTU or RSE. The Joint Committee  on Taxation also concludes this bill would yield a net tax increase over 6 years. 
   How does this bill hurt the American taxpayer? It hurts the young, and it hurts the small business. It hurts the young who are between the age of 19 and 24, those individuals who are just getting out in the world, starting their own businesses. It hurts the young and the college student, who may not have lobbyists down here in Washington. It hurts them. Small businesses, it hurts them as well because they now have an acceleration in their taxes. 
   In conclusion, so you can get your flights and what have you to go back to your taxpayers and explain to them why you raised their taxes, since 2003, the gentleman, the ranking member, could probably explain better than I, the tax cuts we have put in place have spurred on the economy, have spurred on the revenue. 
   Since October of last year to this year, you have seen a 9.7 percent increase in revenue because of true tax cuts. What America's taxpayers need is permanent tax cuts. We do not need permanent tax increases, which this bill will provide. 
   I encourage a ``no'' vote on the tax increase bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the resolution condemning Hezbollah's frequent use of civilians to protect their military forces and cache of weapons. All too often we hear claims that Hezbollah and the Israeli Defense Forces are moral equivalents. But when we look at the facts, we see that Hezbollah constantly demonstrates that it is a force that does not operate under the international treaties that attempt to govern warfare. 
   Hezbollah has set up shop in southern Lebanon and, while they attempt to participate in the legal process of that nation, they are not under the control of any government. They use the funds of Iran and Syria to act as their proxies in the fight against Israel. There is little dispute that they store much of their military equipment below civilian houses and during the most recent conflict their military leadership holed up in bunkers filled with non-combatants. 
   Hezbollah fights their wars in the international press as much as they fight them in the battlefield. Sadly, civilian deaths are seen as a victory since they can use the cry of war atrocities to keep the Israelis from engaging their forces. 
   On the other side we see Israeli forces who clearly identify their military personnel by uniform and delineate their military installations from civilian. Yet, Hezbollah still chooses to indiscriminately shoot their rockets into principally civilian areas. 
   Hezbollah operates far outside the bounds of international law, something we must not forget as we seek to control them through international bodies such as the United Nations. With no regard for the lives of their own nationals, can we expect them to hold up their end of Security Council resolutions? We must stand with the legitimate government of Israel, a shining light of democracy and freedom besieged by those with no respect for law or life.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 240, the resolution  calling on our colleagues in other nations to ratify the agreement opening the Bad Arolsen archives. I was proud to cosponsor this resolution but I am saddened that it is necessary to remind some of our closest allies what is at stake here. 
   The Bad Arolsen archives represent over 17 million people records related to the Holocaust and post-World War II displacement. Survivors of this tumultuous time want nothing more than to find evidence of what happened to their loved ones. We are all too aware that members of this generation are dying each day and that time is of the essence. 
   While survivors are able to make a request for records, the current system is both backlogged and poorly managed. Over 500,000 requests are unfulfilled and there are demonstrated cases where survivors have been incorrectly advised that there are no records concerning them. 
   Today, we call on the legislatures of the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Greece, and France to live up to their promises to swiftly approve the changes necessary to open the archive. How many more survivors need to pass away before the bureaucratic red tape is cleared away? 
   Now is the time to provide answers that survivors have been seeking for over 60 years. Now is the time to provide some measure of comfort to those who were terrorized by the systematic violence of the Nazis and the chaos of the war to end their reign.

   You know, I came to this floor last night, and I spoke to the American public. I said last night that you should be concerned this morning, that you should be very much alarmed by what is going on here. Obviously, Washington is not hearing from you and is not abiding by your wishes. Yes, there is a problem, and yes, also there are solutions, and yes, there is a way to deal with this problem but not by putting the American taxpayer on the hook. 
   In order to get those solutions, we should not go to those very same people who brought us this problem in the first place--those people who tried to block reform in the past. 
   I hear in the news today that there was a deal, that Speaker Pelosi has basically adopted the Paulson plan. Well, I don't know what all of the ramifications of the deal are and who is involved, but I can say this: 
   Those who support and those who used to work for Goldman Sachs will support this deal. Those who have gotten contributions from Countrywide will support this deal. Those who have gotten substantial contributions will support this deal. Most importantly, those who have blocked reform in the past will support this deal. 
   I will not support this deal as it has been laid out so far. If you want to know how to find out more about how we got here, just simply go to YouTube, and put in ``burning down the house,'' and you will get a better understanding of exactly how we got here and why we should not be going back to the very same parties who brought us here with this solution.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, nearly nine years ago, the people of Northern Ireland took a great step forward into building a lasting peace. The Good Friday Agreement, signed in 1998, set forth a plan for establishing a peaceful civil government for both Catholics and Protestants. 
   Today, we are close to ending an enmity that stretches back across centuries. With the establishment of an assembly there will be a substantial forum for the people of Northern Ireland to sort through their difference peacefully. 
   The years of calm since the signing of the agreement have seen developments that seemed nearly impossible decades ago. The acceptance of the Police Service of Northern Ireland by Sinn Fein in January of this year marked one ofthe last hurdles to the full implementation of the agreement. With one neutral force to fairly administer the law, the people of Northern Ireland can stop seeing the police as adversaries and instead see them as guardians of the peace, as it should be. 
   It is now critical that a final agreement be put in place so that the assembly can continue to meet and lead the people of Northern Ireland. Now that the IRA, as confirmed by third-party observers, has decommissioned its weapons, it is time for the Democratic Unionists to come together to rule in cooperation with Sinn Fein. 
   With so much progress made it would be a great shame to see the dissolution of a body freely elected by the people of Northern Ireland. This Congress supports blueprint for peace signed nearly a decade ago and wishes to see last democracy and tranquility in Ireland.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Affairs, I am proud to congratulate the nation of Greece on the 186th anniversy of independence. Though it began the cradle of Democracy and formed the foundation of Western thought, Greece was ruled over by various empires until 1821 when the people of Greece threw off Ottoman oppression and set about founding a government that would be ruled by Greeks and for Greeks. 
   The ancient Greek city-states provided young American with a strong foundation of government and philosophy to build our democracies. In both our nations, the Golden Age of Greece continues to be a guiding light. 
   During the last 50 years, the United States has been proud to stand with the Greek people as they confronted communist oppression, solidified their democracy, and became part of the vibrant European economy. 
   Independence, once achieved, is not guaranteed for all time. We know that at all times there must be those who are willing to sacrifice to retain liberty. Both of our nations have faced struggles for survival since the initial moment of independence. We must continue to support each other in the causes of freedom and democracy. 
   Again, I congratulate the Greek people on this historic day. It is a day to remember the sacrifices of the past, to take pride in your nation, and to look forward to a bright future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, it's been more than seven months now and many have forgotten about the three Israeli soldiers kidnapped by Hamas and Hezbollah: Ehud Goldwasser, Eldad Regev, and Gilad Shalit. Hezbollah seems to have forgotten that last year's hostilities ended only after there were promises regarding the return of the Israeli men. This just goes to reinforce the fact that terrorist organizations cannot be negotiated with. 
   In 2004, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 called for Hezbollah in Lebanon to disband. Despite a half-dozen statements from the Secretary-General, they continued to occupy the border region as UN observers looked on. We don't know for sure, but these very observers may have watched Hezbollah cross the border and kidnap Goldwasser and Regev. 
   Security Council Resolution 170, which ended the most recent conflict, again called for Hezbollah to disarm and return of the soldiers. They remain in Lebanon and Gaza and not even international organizations such as the Red Cross have been able to see them and be assured of their fair treatment. 
   Israel has demonstrated its commitment to the Resolution by ceasing hostilities and pulling back its soldiers, but yet again they are dealing with opponents who show disrespect to all and whose word cannot be trusted. 
   We stand together with Israel to call again for the unconditional release of these three men. We pray for their safe return and for peace between Israel and its neighbors. They will not be forgotten by their families, by their nation, or by this body.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (CONGRESSIONAL CONSTITUTION CAUCUS' WEEKLY ``CONSTITUTION HALF HOUR'' -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to announce our support of the A-PLUS Act authored by my good friend from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra). I stand here as the founder and chairman of the Congressional Constitution Caucus, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. 
   Normally, when I begin my weekly floor speeches, I quote the relevant portion of the Constitution that corresponds with the evening's topic. Yet today I have difficulty choosing a coinciding article and section from our founding document. You see, the Constitution does not contain the word ``school'' or even ``education.'' Contrary to common modern misconceptions, there is no constitutional right guaranteeing each citizen an education. 
   Now, this does not mean education is unimportant or that the Constitution is silent on the issue. The 10th amendment unambiguously states, ``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.'' 
   Historically, in the United States, education has not fallen under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. Parents, local schools and the States were responsible for children's academic training. It has only been in the last 50 years or so has the Federal Government begun overstepping its constitutional boundaries by parading the increasing bureaucracies of the Department of Education. 
   Mr. Hoekstra's bill seeks to correct many of the problems associated with a Federal bureaucracy by putting control over education money back into the hands of the taxpayers and, most importantly, the parents. 
   Under the current system, the Federal Government essentially bribes States into complying with the burdensome No Child Left Behind program. Yes, States can opt out of these regulations, but doing so would mean losing millions of dollars in aid every year. 
   Under its bill, first it will free States from following needless Federal regulations and mandates. Currently, the No Child Left Behind program restricts academic innovation and ignores the diversity present in each State, region and school district. 
   Secondly, A-PLUS Act will reduce the amount of time and money that school officials currently devote to complying with these mandates. Each  hour and dollar spent in administering No Child Left Behind could be funneled instead into improving our schools. 
   Thirdly, A-PLUS Act will ensure that parents, schools and the States are held accountable for the education process. Rather than allowing oversight to rest in some far-flung bureaucracies here in Washington, it will be right at home here in your local school district. But most importantly, giving States the freedom to keep their education dollars in oversight within their own State is exactly what our Founding Fathers originally intended. 
   James Madison, often considered the father of the Constitution, will be remembered this coming Friday, March 16, on the 250th anniversary of his birth. 
   In a way, Madison predicted this situation we now find ourselves in, when he wrote, ``In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.'' 
   It is time for us to explain why we are not controlling ourselves. Our Founding Fathers deliberately wrote a Constitution of enumerated specific powers. While some countries have attempted to limit government by writing Constitutions that specify every single thing and every single line, our government Constitution does not do that. Therefore, in Article I, Section 8, the founders specifically listed congressional powers, and in the 10th amendment grants that all other legislative powers are in the hands of States or the people respectively. 
   So, in essence, it makes sense that Congress should perform duties only prescribed by the Constitution. When you think about it, the United States has thrived as a nation precisely because the freedom of the people has been protected by a limited government. The Constitution is the anchor that protects American citizens from the storms of a controlling central government. 
   James Madison wrote also in The Federalist No. 45, ``The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government are few and defined.'' He would add, probably, that education is not one of them. So Mr. Hoekstra's common-sense legislation follows Madison's insights by ensuring that the States have the opportunity to retain control over their own education dollars. Doing so will not only improve the quality of the education system, but will help return our Nation to the principles of limited government, federalism, and the 10th amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Well, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for giving me the opportunity to address the House. 
   First, before I begin, let me just say this. I commend the gentleman for your being down here on the floor to, first and foremost, refute the arguments that had been made initially, in your opening statements, refuting the arguments made by the other side of the aisle, where I believe you were getting into the issues 
   of the debt and what have you, and some of the other points you made with regard to our spending levels, and finally on SCHIP. 
   If I may, I want to address a couple of those. First of all, here we are at the end of October, 10 months into the rule under the new Democrat majority, and we have to ask, what has their leadership wrought? They have brought us the largest tax increase in U.S. history, the creation of slush funds, where a lot that money is going to go to, and the end to the transparency that they promised in the last election that they would bring to this House. 
   On the first point, as far as the largest tax increase in history, that began initially as soon as the Democrats took control with their budget, a $387 billion tax increase, which basically is too large of a number for any of us to get our hands around. But what it really translates down to is, on average, around a $2,500 to $2,700 increase that every individual in this country will have to take out of their pockets, from the hard-earned money they make, and send down here to Washington so Congress can spend it instead on who knows what it may be. That is where they began. 
   We know just this past week the chairman of Ways and Means has come out with the ``mother of all tax increases.'' That ``mother of all tax increases,'' of course, basically begs the question of what happens to all the orphaned taxpayers then in this country, those who are now left having to foot the bill for that tax increase. 
   So I raise these points only because it is truly ironic that the other side of the aisle would come to the floor and raise the issue of the debt level and the spending of Congress, because, when you think about it, they ran on a platform that the Republicans were spending too much, but what was the first thing they did when they came here? They decided that they would spend even more. They ran on the platform that we were taxing too much. And what was the first thing they did once they got here? They raised our taxes. And they have done so repeatedly. They have about half a dozen times now had legislation, just about every single major piece of legislation that has come to the floor so far, that has included some form of tax increase in it. 
   Now, the gentleman from Iowa raises the point now near the end of his discussion with regard to SCHIP, and I always appreciate his explaining to the American public what the acronym SCHIP really does stand for. SCHIP stands for ``Socialized Clinton-Style Hillarycare for Illegals and Their Parents.'' I will get to that point of illegals in a minute, but let's look at  the overall focus and what the intention is here. 
   I think it begs the question to ask, is anyone from either side of the aisle not intending working towards making sure all Americans can have the health care that they need? I think we all agree on that. 
   The next question is, do we not want to make sure then that all American citizens' indigent children get the health care that they need? I think, generally speaking, except for the partisanship and the politicking on the other side of the aisle, I would have to say that all of us agree on that as well. 
   Then we have to ask ourselves, what is the best mechanism to get there? Is SCHIP and the expansion that the Democrats want to foist on the American public the best way to get there? I would answer that question by saying, no, it is not. 
   Going in reverse order, the gentleman from Iowa raises the point with regard to illegals, an important point. The Democrats will tell you, don't worry about it. The bill already says in plain language that illegals are not allowed to get these benefits, as if all you need to do is put those words into a bill and that makes it so. 
   I see on the table over there, I think that looks like your demonstration for the wall. Is that what that is?

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. You know, we would not need that wall under the Democrat philosophy, because we already have a law that says no illegals may come into this country illegally. If that is all it takes is just to say they can't do it and it won't happen, you don't need that wall. You don't need any surveillance. We don't need any border security guards, because we have a law that says they are not allowed to come into this country illegally. But we know that that is not the way it works. What works is you need enforcement. You suggest enforcement in the form of a wall, and I agree with you on that. 
   In the area of SCHIP, enforcement means that we need to have a way of verification for an individual when they come to claim American taxpayers' dollars for their own benefit for them to verify that they are legal American citizens entitled to it. And that is all that the Republicans were asking for, some sort of process to make sure that was done. 
   Now, the Democrats also argue, look, they put in a penalty provision for the States. The Democrats were not willing to actually put an enforcement mechanism in themselves to say how they want to verify the illegals. But the Democrats will say, well, we are going to leave that little question to the States instead and have the States cleverly come up with it. Of course, you and I are all supportive of States being the laboratory of experimentation.     
   The Democrats then say that is all we need to do. I would suggest that is not all you need to do. The enforcement there is not to say to the States if you mess this up, if you don't enforce the law and allow illegals to get American taxpayer dollars under this program, and therefore potentially deprive other American children of their benefits, it does not say that those States will not receive any Medicaid benefits whatsoever. It does not say that they will not receive SCHIP benefits as well. It just holds the additional funding that goes to those States. 
   Under the original DRA law that was signed in 2005 and went into effect in July of 2006, for those States under Medicaid where it applied to, we saw a decrease because of the Republican enforcement mechanisms of illegals actually getting those benefits. What the Republicans have simply asked the Democrat majority to allow us to do is to allow those systems that are working to apply to the entire SCHIP process. 
   So on the point of trying to make sure that only U.S. American citizens get the benefits, Republicans have a plan and it has been working in other aspects of Medicaid, and we wish to expand it. 
   I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I will make this last point if the gentleman permits. The definition of a middle-class benefit or entitlement is one that goes to the middle class of America. 
   The definition, I guess, of a program for the indigent would be a program that is aimed for those who are making less than the average, less than middle-class America. 
   I wanted to give a couple of numbers. The median, middle, middle income in this country is around $46,000 for a family of four essentially. That is the middle. That would be how we define middle class across the board. Some higher, some lower. That is the middle. 
   The bill, SCHIP, as it was created initially was for 200 percent of poverty. That would be around $42,000 for a family of four, so less than the middle. 
   There are some discussions going on literally as we speak right now in what the Senate is looking at to bring this program up to around 275 percent of poverty. That would be $58,000 for a family of four. So if middle, middle-class America is around $46,000, and some are suggesting we should be bringing the coverage up to $58,000, by definition it is a middle-class entitlement. Actually above middle class. Slightly above middle-class entitlement, as a matter of fact. It begs the question if you are trying to set up a program to address the problems of the indigent Americans in this country, why are you bringing the number up so high we are going over the median income in this country. 
   That is a rhetorical question. I don't think the other side can answer it unless they simply want to be honest with us and tell us they are trying to do what Bill Clinton said back when he was President that he wants universal coverage where the government has socialized medicine, and you will start with indigent children, you will go to all children and eventually you will go to all adults in the entire country. One-fifth of this economy will be encompassed by a government-run health care system, something you and I definitely oppose.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. SCHIP. It has another meaning as Republicans initially created it, but we see what the Democrats have morphed it into. SCHIP now stands for Socialized Clinton-style Hillarycare for Illegals and their Parents. That wraps it all right up there. They are willing to go back to what Hillary and Bill Clinton wanted to do, and that was to have a universal, socialized plan that the government would control, literally one-fifth of the economy, health care economy, the same government that gave us FEMA and the way they handled Hurricane Katrina and the same aftermath of Katrina, the same government that gives so many other problems of waste, fraud and abuse, and the same government that gave us the proverbial bridge to nowhere. That Clinton-style type of government, Hillarycare for illegals. As the gentleman from Iowa just pointed out, it is not for American citizens. It is for anyone who simply wants to walk across the border and take the benefits of the hardworking American taxpayers.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me, and also appreciate the gentleman for heading up this special order tonight to once again point a finger and a focus on the importance of the discussion of energy. And more important than that, to actually move some legislation through this House before we go into a recess during the August break. 
   I will be brief because other colleagues would like to speak. 
   I come, as I said, from the State of New Jersey. This past week I had an opportunity to be on some forums with some of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle where this was an issue that was discussed. One of the points that I made, coming from the State of New Jersey, is just how important it really is that Congress do something with regard to energy and the high price of energy production and supply in this country. 
   Let me give you a few statistics from an independent source describing the State of New Jersey and our costs of energy. New Jersey consumes 3.4 percent of the Nation's energy. That is 13 percent greater than what the State's share should be based on the State's share of the Nation's population and employment. And that is possibly because New Jersey is one of the most densely populated States. It has been a manufacturing State and otherwise, and for that reason we do draw a high amount of energy for our State. 
   Currently the State of New Jersey spends nearly $130 million annually on energy for its various State facilities alone, not talking about private and everything else out there. 
   Furthermore, an economic survey points out that New Jersey business owners reported that many are concerned, and this is obvious, over rising energy prices. Forty percent of business owners state that over the next 6 months, higher energy costs will have the greatest impact on their business, up sharply from around 20 percent last fall. And because of the higher cost of energy, 43 percent of New Jersey business owners plan to pass along that portion of the cost in the form of higher selling prices to their customers, up from around 30 percent last fall. 
   So that means on top of the fact that we in New Jersey are paying more at the pump, and on top of the fact that home heating costs will go up dramatically in the area of fuel oil. As a matter of fact, the statistics on that are that New Jersey relies more heavily on petroleum and natural gas for home heating, with 86 percent of single-family homes heated by natural gas and oil compared to the national average of 68 percent. 
   I raise that point to point out that in my little forums that I was on with other Members from the other side of the aisle, they said, look, we really can't drill our way out of this. Petroleum is not the solution. Natural gas is not the solution. Conservation and alternative fuels are the solution. Well, I half agree with them. I half agree with them because yes, conservation is certainly one of the solutions; and alternative fuels is certainly the other solution. But it is really a three-legged stool as opposed to a two-legged stool, and that third leg of the stool is additional production of energy here at home in America. 
   Why this is a controversial topic in the State of New Jersey is because we are a coastal State. I enjoy the New Jersey shore as much as the next guy from New Jersey; and hopefully I will have some time to enjoy the Jersey shore sometime during this August break. But while you sit on the Jersey shore, and this is something that the gentleman from the other side of the aisle whose name shall remain nameless at this point, was factually incorrect about. 
   As you sit on the Jersey shore, if we are successful as Republicans in this House, and that is to pass legislation as the President has just lifted his executive order just 48 hours ago to allow for drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, which means deep-sea exploration, and I always say offshore is a misnomer 
   because offshore means you are sitting on the shore and actually seeing it. And that is what my colleague on the other side of the aisle said. He said if we build these rigs, you will be sitting on the shore enjoying your pretzel and your soda and seeing them. That is factually incorrect. 
   Every piece of legislation that I have supported, and I know the gentleman from Georgia has also supported, has said that we will be doing deep sea exploration, using 21st century technology in the most prudent and environmentally sensitive manner as you can possibly do, and they will be, at the minimum 50 miles, and a maximum up to 200 miles offshore. We all know that if you sit on the Jersey shore, you can't see any further than 20 miles out to sea because of the curvature of the earth. The bottom line is whatever we pass here, it will not be seeable from the Jersey shore. It will not have that detrimental effect on the shore nor on one of our biggest industries, which is tourism in the State of New Jersey. 
   So I am proud to be one of the few Members of this House from the New Jersey delegation to say that we must do everything possible to bring down the cost of energy for our small businesses, our industry, and our homeowners, for the price of gas in the summer and home heating fuel in the winter, and we must do that by conservation, alternative fuels, and more production of American energy here at home as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (PERMITTING DELEGATES AND THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER TO CAST VOTES IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I rise, too, in strong opposition to this resolution which violates the Constitution and the fundamental intent of the Framers of the Constitution as well, and it does so in four ways. 
   First, it would allow Delegates to vote, even though our Founding Fathers intended that this legislative body represent the people of the States. The Constitution, Article I, section 2, clause 1, states, ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen by the people of the several States.'' By definition, Delegates do not represent States. 
   Secondly, this resolution violates the principle of one person, one vote. 
   The average congressional district represents approximately 650,000 people, but three of these areas have populations of less than 160,000 people, and American Samoa has residents of less than 57,000 people. 
   The Supreme Court has already spoken on this. In 1964, the decision of Wesberry v. Sanders, the Supreme Court said, ``To say a vote is worth more in one district than in another would run not only counter to our fundamental ideas of a democrat government, but it would also cast aside the principles of the House of Representatives elected by the people. That was a principle tenaciously fought for and established at the Constitutional Convention.'' 
   Thirdly, the qualifications for these Delegates are not the same as all the  other Members of the House. Neither Puerto Rico, American Samoa nor the District of Columbia requires that their Delegates be a citizen of the United States for 7 years, as all other Members have to be. 
   Fourthly, the Constitution requires that all Members be elected and ``chosen every second year.'' Puerto Rico Delegates, however, hold 4-year terms. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, it was a former Democrat Speaker of the House who said, ``It is very clear that a constitutional amendment would be required to give Delegates a vote in the Committee of the Whole or in the House.'' H. Res. 78 does not do this. 
   H. Res. 78 obviously is not a constitutional amendment; it is, instead, an attempt to resurrect a shameful move done back in the 103rd Congress, back in 1993. 
   I do not support, nor should the Members of this side of the aisle nor any Members of this Congress, an assault on the Constitution of the United States nor an assault on the people of this country as well. 
   Vote ``no'' on this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (HONORING UNITED PARCEL SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 375, which honors the United Parcel Service, UPS, and its 100 years of commitment and leadership in the United States. Of the 425,000 jobs that UPS provides to hard-working people across the globe, 16,000 of them are in my home State of New Jersey. Included in that number are the employees that work at the Ramapo Ridge Data Center in Mahwah, NJ, in my District, one of two data centers supporting UPS worldwide computer operations. 
   UPS has made it a priority to integrate itself into the local community and has been a magnet for jobs in a variety of positions; from the high-tech workers at the Mahwah Data Center to the uniformed delivery people we meet on a daily basis in offices across the country. UPS continues to actively recruit from the local colleges and universities in my district, with internship and co-op opportunities for students who are studying Computer Science, Information Systems, Industrial Engineering, and Mathematics. 
   UPS has also been recognized for its commitment to diversity. Twenty-nine percent of UPS's IT population is female, far higher than the IT population as a whole. In 2006, UPS was recognized as one of America's most supportive companies of both black and Hispanic engineering students by two independent surveys. Truly this is a company that has made a commitment to reach out to populations traditionally underrepresented in high-tech fields, and has continued to excel while doing so. 
   With more and more American jobs being created in the services industry, it is companies such as UPS that serve as a great example of how U.S. businesses are adapting to our changing economy. When the American Messenger Company acquired its first delivery car, a Ford Model T, in 1913, perhaps the founders could have envisioned the nearly 100,000 cars, vans, trucks, and motorcycles that today comprise the delivery fleet of UPS. But surely they could not have envisioned the 14.5 million page views that www.ups.com averages per day or the nearly 5,500 technology employees currently employed by UPS. As companies continue to adapt to the changing global economy, it is entirely appropriate that this House of Representatives recognize one such company that has not only adapted, but also stayed ahead of the curve for 100 years, while at the same time staying true to its original mission of delivering parcels from one to another.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (93RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, today we mark the 93rd anniversary of the onset of the Armenian genocide. It is on this date that the Ottoman officials captured more than 200 Armenian intellectual leaders and placed them in prison. Unfortunately, these actions were only the beginning of the Ottoman-led atrocities against the Armenians. 
   During the following years, at least 1.5 million Armenians were arrested and compelled to march hundreds of miles to what is today the Syrian desert. And along the way, prisoners of all ages endured hunger, thirst, rape, sexual abuse, and other forms of torture. 
   While it is difficult for us to commemorate these terrible acts each year, we must continue to remember those horrors that can occur when governments persecute citizens based on ethnicity or religious affiliation. 
   We often hear those words of George Santayana's famous quote that, ``Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' And these words are ringing true today as well. Already, there are those who deny that the Armenian genocide occurred despite the vast evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, our generation has seen its own mass murders occur in Rwanda and Sudan. 
   So, I urge my colleagues in the majority to bring House Resolution 106, which commemorates these atrocities that occurred only a few generations ago, to the House Floor for a vote. Now is the time for America to officially ensure that U.S. foreign policy reflects sensitivity concerning human rights issues. 
   Just yesterday, I had the privilege of meeting Alice Khachadoorian-Shnorhokian. Alice is a resident of Mahwah, New Jersey, which is a town in my district. Alice was born in Turkey in 1912 to a successful, respected Armenian family of eight. And when Turkish officials ordered Armenians to denounce their faith and nationality, she and her parents refused. As a result, her family was rounded up and ordered to march into the desert. Alice and her brother were too young, of course, at that age to walk, so her parents had to put them in boxes on either side of a donkey and march into the desert. 
   When they arrived in Aintab, her mother befriended their Turkish neighbors, and these neighbors ultimately enabled them to get a permit which allowed Alice and her family to escape. Alice moved to the United States in 1980, and became a citizen of the U.S. just 5 years later. And, as a survivor, she says she wants to, ``see justice so that the words `never again' become a reality.'' 
   So, while I am a Member of Congress, I will always remember Alice's words and her wish. We must fully recognize the friendship with our allies in Turkey today, but we cannot change nor should we forget the past. I hope that there can be some reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia, and that a proper acknowledgement of the crimes of the past can now allow them to move forward into a future of peace and also of mutual understanding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the bipartisan Congressional Prayer Caucus, as we do each week, to formally acknowledge the importance of prayer in American life and history. Today I remind my colleagues, constituents and country of our need for prayer by reading a portion of a proclamation by John Hancock 220 years ago in 1783 while he was Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
   He said, ``It has been the laudable Practice of this Country, to open the Business of the Year, by setting apart a Day for Religious Exercise, thereby to implore the Blessing of God upon all the Undertakings of his People. 
   ``He hath been graciously pleased to hear our Prayers. At such a Time then, it is peculiarly fit and becoming for us as a People, while we express our Gratitude to Almighty God for his numerous and unmerited Favors, to humble ourselves before Him for our manifold Sins, and to profess our entire Dependence upon his paternal Care, beseeching Him to give us his Grace that we may be able to improve his Mercies to his Honor and Glory.''

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I am greatly pleased that the first priority of this legislation is to continue the efforts of the 109th Congress to fundamentally change the way in which Homeland Security grants are dispersed. By current formulae, only 60 percent of grants are assigned on the basis of risk, meaning that we are spending hundreds of millions of dollars that should be protecting our most vulnerable citizens and infrastructure on political priorities. 
   Restructuring this grant program to better protect the regions at highest risk of terrorist threat has been amongst my highest priorities since coming to Congress. North Jersey, which I represent, lost many residents and family members in the 9/11 attacks and, in fact, sent many of its own first responders over the Hudson River to respond to those attacks. While those same brave New Jersey first responders have struggled to purchase the communications and safety equipment that are necessary to deal with any future attacks, operating with outdated air packs and obsolete radio equipment, other areas of the country with less risk of terrorist attack have had the luxury of using these funds for far less necessary purchases. 
   Three times the 109th Congress passed legislation to fix this gross oversight. I hope that the current leadership will stand strong and insist that their colleagues in the Senate take the appropriate steps to better prioritize our limited funds and make our people safer. 
   I am further concerned that this large and expensive bill has come to floor outside of any normal procedure. There are a number of new programs, panels, reports, and procedures contained in the bill that have never come before the Committee on Homeland Security. Some of these programs may be effective in enhancing our security, but without expert testimony or any comment from the department officials who will carry out these directives, we can have no confidence in their value. 
   In fact, there is no real way to even determine what all these provisions will cost since the bill fails to appropriate or authorize specific sums. Given the claims of our new leadership that they are retaking the mantle of fiscal responsibility, it is disturbing to see that their first piece of legislation, H.R. 1, comes to the floor without any plan for how much is to be spent and where all this new funding is supposed to come from. 
   Security for the American people should be our number one priority, but we absolve ourselves of our responsibility as legislators by writing a blank check. I hope that in the coming months we can work together to bring real solutions to the House floor and work with the Senate to send strong legislation to the President.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (CONGRESSIONAL CONSTITUTION CAUCUS -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce and renew our hope to be a regular occurrence on the House floor for the 110th Congress. The members of the Congressional Constitution Caucus will use this opportunity to emphasize for our colleagues and for the Nation as well the necessity of ensuring that our government is operating according to the intent of the our Founding Fathers. As the 10th amendment affirms, the authority over most domestic issues belong to the States and local governments and the people themselves. 
   But before I begin, let me express my sincere gratitude to my friend Utah who has led this important education effort in the past and this year as well. He has faithfully championed the notion of a limited, effective and efficient Federal Government, and continues to fight for the authority granted to his home State and the other 49 states as well when each was admitted into this most cherished Nation. 
   I look forward to working with other like-minded Members of this Congress who share the sentiment that our Federal Government has seized control of programs that State governments have traditionally been much more effective in administering. I invite my colleagues to consider joining this important effort regularly as well. 
   This Congressional Caucus, I strongly believe that this body must begin to focus on the principles delineated in the 10th amendment. Our Founders were precise when they established our system of government. They intended to set up a republic of sovereign, self-governing States with a small central  government operating under clearly defined, limited powers. 
   Dividing sovereignty between the Federal Government and those of the States prevents an unhealthy concentration of powers at any one level of government. As James Madison in the Federalist Number 51 said, this arrangement is a double security in protecting the rights of the people. 
   Throughout the last few generations in particular, the intent of the 10th amendment, that of a limited and efficient central government, has been fading away. There are those I know who support a bigger, more centralized government. They believe a central government run bureaucracy can make the best decisions for the American people. 
   They believe in the public good of higher taxes. But on that I strongly disagree. As a member of the House Committee on the Budget, I am very much aware of where such faulty reasoning leads our Nation. It leads to our current situation, a bloated Federal Government consumed by a deficit upwards of $400 billion, which, in turn, delivers sub par public services. 
   Now then, to be fair, much of the spending that recently caused this deficit to increase is temporary relief on the gulf coast region and the global war on terror. It may not show up on the bottom line. And while this eases the short-term picture, the bigger problem is still one that must be addressed. And if we do not curb this foolish Federal spending habit now, our children will have to pay the price. 
   Congress, you see, on almost a daily basis allows, our government to grow, pushing it is further into deficit. And we are swiftly drifting away from the limits set by our Founding Fathers. 
   Each time a Member slides his card to cast a vote, he needs to ask himself this one question: Does the bill that I am voting for violate the Constitution? Does it take away rights promised to our constituents and put them in the hands of a bureaucracy in Washington instead? 
   I remind this body that the Constitution does not only protect the rights of the people though. It also protects the rights of the states. In Federalist number 45, James Madison wrote, ``The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government are few and defined. Those which will remain in the states governments are numerous and indefinite.'' 
   I have long served in this House long enough to know that it makes our lives easier at home when we come to D.C. and support increased funding for every conceivable type of program. Yet James Madison and his colleagues were less concerned about their ability to write glittering press releases than they were in developing an efficient system of government, one that would operate at the lowest cost to the people paying it, the people at home. 
   That is what this caucus is all about and what these weekly information sessions are about as well. We must turn a critical eye on the Federal Government. This is how we will lower the deficit, grow the economy and assure that America remains that beacon on a hill. 
   Aside from being informational, this Caucus also seeks to make specific legislative gains in the name of governmental efficiency and Constitutional adherence. So we will support legislation that seeks to return power and authority back where it belongs, to the States, local governments and to the people. 
   And so tonight, I specifically ask all Members to consider supporting the Reaffirmation of American Independence resolution that will soon be reintroduced by Congressmen FEENEY and GOODLATTE. This is a resolution I know our Founding Fathers would be original cosponsors of, were they able. Article VI of the U.S. Constitution states, ``This Constitution and the laws of the U.S. shall be made in pursuance thereof; shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws or any state or the country notwithstanding.'' 
   This legislation goes in the direction to ensure that all such laws abide with our Constitution and not by foreign governments.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE ACT OF 1968 AMENDMENTS -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I begin by saying thanks to the chairman of the committee for his help in working through this piece of legislation, and also for the ranking member for her working alongside the Chair as to facilitate the moving along of this legislation to the floor today. As the chairman indicates, we had the opportunity to discuss it in committee, which is, I think, and I think he will concur with me, is always the best way to deal with all legislation as opposed to bringing them up later on. It's best to get out there so we can have full and adequate disclosure and discussion on the issues. We were able to do that; we just weren't able to get it through the next hoop. But now we're able to jump through that hoop today, and, again, I appreciate the chairman's work on that. 
   What this is all about, very simply, is this. Back in 1968, that is when NFIP was created, the National Flood Insurance Program, and that was done, as the chairman indicated, way back then three or four decades ago, as I guess more and more people were building homes in places maybe they shouldn't be, along coastal lines and what have you, it was just next to impossible to buy flood insurance.     
   So Congress stepped in and created NFIP, and that allowed folks the opportunity to buy flood insurance for the first time. When they did that, however, they realized that here again we're talking about two sets of houses, those that were already in existence at the time and those that would come afterwards, called pre-FIRM and post-FIRM homes. They thought Congress back then, probably in its wisdom, realized that it wouldn't be right to tell those folks who were already in the floodplains that this new program was going to come along, that they were going to impose upon them a mandate of buying flood insurance when they bought and sold their houses; so what they did was instead to provide a subsidy for those pre-FIRM homes, and that subsidy has existed up until today. Unfortunately, we know that the flood program has had some problems in the last couple of years, most notably because of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. All the money that they have had to borrow to pay out for those huge flood losses, they are now $18 billion in debt. And that's the reason why the committee is now coming back to relook at the flood program, and that's why we have done that. 
   The legislation that the chairman talks about that we have already done I appreciate that we've moved through the House. I am a little bit disappointed, though, in that legislation in one regard, in that it increased the exposure to wind damage in the flood program. But despite that what I call an error in direction on that legislation, the underlying bill did make some substantial improvements to the overlying program. It updated the flood maps, increased the phase-in of actuarial rates on vacation homes and also second homes and on nonresidential properties that have been subsidized by the program since its inception. 
   The one area, though, that was not addressed was these pre-FIRM homes and the fact that the subsidies continue to exist. So to that effort, we have tried to get a compromise between those who said let's not do anything and those who said let's have those pre-FIRM homes immediately put in on the higher rates that would occur without the subsidization. Through the committee efforts, through the work with the ranking member and the chairman, we were able to come through with a compromise. In essence it says this: If you're a pre-FIRM home, your rates will still be subsidized until that home is basically phased in, sold and phased in on the same rate schedule as the underlying bill, and only for those homes that are sold for over $600,000. A movement in the right direction with regard to the subsidization, the problems of the underlying program, and for that reason I think we are moving appropriately, and I look forward to those deliberations that we may have sometime with the Senate on this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Before I begin, let me just recognize and appreciate the work by the ranking member of the committee with regard to this overall underlying piece of legislation for his work to try to improve the legislation. I believe his actions have been done in view of his constituents and their concerns with the primary lending market as we see it today. 
   Getting to the amendment that is before us, Mr. Chairman, the amendment would simply strike the rebuttable presumption paragraph under section 203 of the manager's amendment text. As currently drafted, section 203 of the bill specifically lists several criteria that lenders must meet when they originate a loan and that loan to be considered a qualified safe harbor mortgage. Qualified safe harbor mortgages are loans that: one, document consumer income; two, an underwriting process based on fully indexed rate; three, a debt-to-income ratio not greater than 50 percent; four, no negative amortization; and five, six payments for at least 7 years an adjustable rate loan with an APR that varies less than 3 percent over indexed rate. 
   Now after meeting this prescriptive list of requirements, the loan can be considered a qualified safe harbor mortgage. It is presumed that the mortgage is an appropriate loan. However, section 203 also contains a provision that, even when all these provisions are met, would allow a borrower to rebut this presumption in a court of law and claim that the creditor has made a loan to them in bad faith anyway. 
   You see, by allowing lenders to still be held legally liable for a loan even after all these conditions have been met, we are creating even more uncertainty for loan originators. This will in turn lead to further tightening of the credit market and keep more people from getting loans. 
   Mr. Chairman, if a creditor goes through all these requirements as listed, I do not believe that they should still have to worry about being held legally liable if the borrower cannot make their payments. Such a provision undermines the very nature of a safe harbor vision. It undermines the presumption of good faith that the law itself establishes. How can we on one hand tell the lender that they are providing them with a safe harbor from suit and then turn right around and say that safe harbor can be rebutted? I am afraid this will, at the very least, raise the cost of loans, at the worst, keep the loans from being made at all. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask you to help the providers, lenders make some sense of the legal clarity and to make this a safe harbor, a true safe harbor. I would ask every Member to support this important amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

But when these five criteria are met, you have a safe harbor. That is the language of the bill. What is a safe harbor for, if not for giving protection to those who are meeting the requirements. 
   With that, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker).

Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that this amendment is supported by the Mortgage Bankers Association, the American Financial Services Association, and Financial Services Roundtable. I believe they do that because they realize when a bill sets up the language of presumption of ability to repay and net tangible benefits, as it has done on line 1, page 52, and then defines that as a safe harbor, with the one hand, but then immediately takes it away with the other hand by saying that you can still go into court after the lender has met all the requirements as we defined as what is an ability to repay and tangible benefits, we are creating more uncertainty in the market, as the gentleman from Louisiana indicated, one that will hurt the overall economy and the ability to secure loans. 
   I ask for a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.

   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate that and thank the gentleman from Texas for your work on this issue. 
   I also commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania because I know he has been championing this issue and cause for a number of years. And I believe during his remarks he mentioned the piece of legislation he has had in this House for some time as well. 
   In his usual, understated way, the gentleman from Pennsylvania ended his remarks by saying this will begin a philosophical discussion, and the gentleman from Texas picked up on that as well. Indeed it is a great philosophical discussion to point out the disparity between the two parties. The Democrat Party, which is now in control of the House and the Senate, we can see from their actions during the past 11 months that they have been in control that families should be compelled to keep their house in order but Congress does not have to be forced to live within its means. They do that every time they come to the floor with another tax increase, which we will see shortly when their AMT bill comes, that Congress does not have to live within their means. The focus should be, instead, on the family budget, as we have always said on this floor in the past. 
   Before I came to the floor, I want to do a little aside, I was reading this current issue of Human Events, the week of November 5. It is a front-page story by Andrew Boylan: ``Rangel tax reform riddled with tax hikes.'' He has an expression in here, and I think it points out what Charlie Rangel and the Democrat majority are trying to do in the House. It says, ``Chairman Rangel's plan isn't just robbing Peter to pay Paul; it is robbing Peter and Paul while convincing both of them that the other guy is the one paying the higher taxes.'' That really puts it in a nutshell. 
   What you will hear from the other side of the aisle when they begin to explain this is no, we are just trying to set things straight. We are just trying to rectify a problem from the old AMT. But at the same time they really, in reality, are shifting it. No, they are robbing from all of us, the entire American population, and they will be trying to convince all of us through the spin and the rhetoric that we hear that the other guy is paying it. That is not the case at all. 
   You know, the word ``AMT,'' for those who don't follow this issue very closely, has a good name, alternative minimum tax. At first blush that sounds like something that you would want to pay instead of what you are currently paying. 
   ``Alternative'' makes it sound like it is voluntary. ``Minimum''; I, too, would like to pay the minimum amount of taxes. But those words are deceiving just as the Democrat plan is deceiving. It is not alternative in the sense that it is voluntary. It is mandatory. You are compelled to pay the higher of the tax. And it is not minimum in any sense of the word. It is a maximum tax. That will be exactly what we get when the Democrats give us Charlie Rangel's bill of an alternative minimum tax fix. 
   Now the gentleman from Pennsylvania talked about a piece of legislation that he has worked on, which I have cosponsored as well, that tries to address this by simply repealing the entire AMT. It repeals the entire alternative minimum tax so that citizens of this country will not have to pay that higher tax.     
   I've cosponsored that legislation, and I support it, but let me just digress for 30 seconds here and just say that I also have sponsored a piece of legislation to address the AMT in this session of Congress. It does not go so far as to totally repeal the bill, but what it does is to try to do, let's say, a compromise measure, if you will, if we can't get that far because the other side of the aisle will not go so far as to giving American taxpayers that total relief. And what it does is it meets it halfway. 
   From my perspective, it gets halfway and says let's put a COLA in that bill, a cost of living adjustment into it, so that the AMT could do what it was actually intended to do several decades ago, target those very, very, very, very few. Back then, there were was only 150 of those taxpayers out of 200 million people, those taxpayers who were not paying any taxes, and put a COLA into it so that it would be just adjusted just as the rest of the tax breaks. So when your income goes up each year due to inflation and what have you, you would not find yourself falling into it. 
   So if the Democrats can't go so far as some of us, as Congressman English and others of us believe that we would like to see here, and that is to totally repeal, take away that burden on all American taxpayers, I would hope that they would see instead some sense to reaching halfway at the very least and saying let's make sure that it does not swallow up so many of the individuals in this country. If we don't do anything shortly, 22 million Americans will see their taxes go up dramatically. 
   Now, I come to the floor, as the gentleman from Texas says, from the great State of New Jersey, and I speak with some experience as to the fact that sometimes the other side of the aisle, both on a Federal level and on a State level, will try to deceive us on some of these things as to who they're really going after. 
   Here, if you read and listen to the rhetoric from the Democrats on this issue, they're saying, well, we're just trying to go after the rich people in this country. In New Jersey, a few years ago, there was Governor McGreevey at the time. They said the same thing. They said we're going to go with a millionaire's tax, and of course, the average citizen said, hey, that's fine, they're not coming after me; they're going after the other guy; in effect robbing Peter to pay Paul and convince them it's the other taxpayer that's going to pay the bill. 
   But you know what happened there. That millionaire's tax in New Jersey started at $1 million, and then suddenly it went down to $900,000, then $800,000, $700,000, and it kept on going down lower and lower and lower until eventually it covered just about everybody. Anybody who had a household where the husband and wife worked, you had a husband maybe a policeman and the wife might be a school teacher or a nurse or something like that, they became covered by that so-called millionaire tax in New Jersey. 
   It was the so-called tax that started out as a rifle shot at just a select few and instead turned into a shotgun approach and encompassed everyone. Same thing that's happening right here with the AMT so-called relief that we're getting from the Democrats, so-called going after the millionaires; but it's going to cover all of us with higher taxes. 
   When I say higher taxes, one of the things I say on the floor just about every time I come to the floor, I say this. We are now in November, the eleventh month of the year, which means we're on the eleventh of Democrat control of this House, and we should always ask ourselves, what has 11 months of control by the Democrats wrought for this House and the country. 
   It has initially brought us the largest tax increase in U.S. history. It has brought us the creation of slush funds in the various appropriation and budget bills that they gave us at the beginning of the year, and it has gotten rid of any hint of transparency in the earmark rules of this House, some things that they campaigned on. 
   The issue of tax increases continues here tonight, and if I have just another minute, they gave us the largest tax  increase initially when they gave us the budget at the very beginning of the year. Since that time, in just about every piece of major legislation that the Democrats have brought before this House, you have seen a tax increase. In bills that you would never even imagine would have tax increases, they have it. And let me just take a moment just to run through a list, and I don't have a chart to put up behind me so I'll have to give it to you this way. 
   The CLEAN Energy Act, we're all in favor of clean energy, I suppose, but it includes a $7.7 billion tax increase over 10 years. The Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act, $1.38 billion. Katrina Housing Tax Relief, tax relief, it sounds as though they're giving us tax relief. No, it's raising taxes by $241 million. Taxpayer Protection Act, $23 million increase. To amend the Internal Revenue Code, well, we all want to do that, but who knows. When they did it, they raised taxes by $14 million. 
   U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act. Gosh, by the name of that, they're all great things, U.S. troop readiness, Katrina recovery, but you know what, they tucked in a tax increase there. How much? $4.4 billion. Second bill, same name, H.R. 2206, $4.8 billion. 
   The Andean Trade Preferences Act, $105 million tax increase. Farm Nutrition and Bioenergy Act, $7.4 billion Democrat tax increase. The Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act, get this one, $54.8 billion Democrat tax increase. 
   Just three more. The Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Act, what does that have to do with taxes? Well, for the Democrats, it's $15 billion in tax increases. 
   The Airport and Airway Trust Fund Financing Act, trying to make our airports better. Well, how do they do it? They do it by raising our taxes by $1.8 billion. 
   And, finally, the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. Who could be against mortgage forgiveness and debt relief? Well, the debt is going to be on our shoulders because they're raising taxes by $2.005 billion. 
   You add up that whole list, and this is even before we come to the bill that's before us tomorrow, that comes to $106 billion tax increase over 10 years, on top of the largest tax increase as I mentioned in the budget at the beginning of the year. 
   Let me just conclude. I see our time is coming down. These numbers are for me, and I think most Americans, hard to put your arms around when you are talking about such high tax increases. The bottom line, though, is put them in large absolute numbers when you're talking about $106 billion or the $70 billion in permanent tax increases as the gentleman talked about, or as a Member from the other side of the aisle admitted, 130 percent tax increase, whether it's percentages or absolute numbers, put them down in day-to-day numbers. It's around $2,400 on the largest tax increase to the average American household that you will be seeing. 
   The question we have to ask is the one I started with and the one that the gentleman from Pennsylvania ended with. It's a philosophical discussion. Are we going to put the focus on the American budget or the family budget? I suggest, and this side of the aisle suggests, the focus should be on the American family's budget to allow the American taxpayer to keep as much of his money as possible and not see another tax increase on that family budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I have stood on this floor several times now speaking about the negative impact that NCLB, No Child Left Behind, has had on our children's education and, consequently, on our children's future as well. 
   Tonight I will speak continuously about that as well and the problems until NCLB are fixed. I will continue to speak out against NCLB until parents and educators are empowered to make the changes that will ensure an environment in which schools can teach and children can learn. 
   More and more information is coming to light attracting more and more supporters to the belief that not only should No Child Left Behind not be reauthorized at this time, but, actually, it should be completely scrapped. 
   Yesterday, in the New York Times, Diane Ravitch, a professor of education at NYU and a former assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, wrote, and I quote, ``the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 is fundamentally flawed,'' and that it should be ``overhauled, not just tweaked.'' 
   She continued, ``The latest national tests, released last week, show that academic gains since 2003 have been modest, less even than those posted in the years before the law was put in place. In eighth-grade reading, there have been no gains at all since 1998. The main goal of the law--that all children in the United States will be proficient in reading and mathematics by 2014--is simply unattainable. The primary strategy--to test all children in those subjects in grades three through eight every year--has unleashed an unhealthy obsession with standardized testing that has reduced the time available for teaching other important subjects. Furthermore, the law completely fractures the traditional limits on federal interference in the operation of local schools.'' 
   Let me repeat that last point, because I believe that it is a missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle. NCLB ``completely fractures the traditional limits on Federal interference in the operation of local schools.'' 
   Many times I have referenced the work of Neil McCluskey of Cato Institute, a scholar who shares my concerns about educational policy. He did a study in 2007 entitled, ``End It, Don't Mend It,'' and he concluded that ``NCLB has been ineffective in achieving its intended goals, has had negative, unintended consequences, is incompatible with policies that do work, is at the mercy of a political process that can only worsen its prospects, and is based on the premises that are fundamentally flawed.'' 
   Using several shocking statistics, McCluskey points out how States are lowering, not raising, their educational standards. They are creating a race to the bottom to ensure that their schools will not be denied Federal funding. 
   Let me give you just a couple. In 2003, the State of Texas decreased the number of questions on their test in order for it to be approved, from 24 to 20. In Michigan, when 1,500 schools were placed on the NCLB need improvement list, the State lowered the percentage of students required to pass the test in English from 75 down to 42 percent. 
   The State of Ohio backloaded its adequate yearly progress goals, aiming to increase proficiency by a mere 3 percent, 3.3 percent for the first 6 years, but then said they're going to do a 40  percent increase in the last 6 years. They did this of course in hopes of meeting NCLB's unrealistic goal of having 100 percent proficiency in math and reading in all schools. And there are other studies as well with similar conclusions. 
   In 2005 the Fordham Foundation compared the State proficiency scores to NAEP scores, with striking results. The NAEP tests have generally been maintained at standards over the year, and so it's a good barometer. 
   In the Fordham study, of the 20 States that have reported gains on their tests in 8th grade reading proficiency, mark this, only three showed any progress at even the basic level for NAEP. That means 20 States are saying that since No Child Left Behind things are going better. But if you compare it to NAEP, really not. Only three. 
   Furthermore, in a new study released today by the foundation, researchers note that in at least two grades, twice as many States in the U.S. have seen their tests become easier, not harder, since NCLB was put into effect. And that's my point here. All the studies are showing that since NCLB went on the books, States are racing to the bottom when it comes to trying to establish their tests, the exact opposite of what this administration tried to do. 
   I think all of us should be startled, at the very least, by this. Appropriately, we should be outraged. You know, if Washington is forcing our schools to basically lower their standards, putting our children's education at risk, we must act now in this House to reverse the trend. And with NCLB reauthorization coming up now, now's the time to do it. 
   To that end I've submitted a bill, the LEARN Act, Local Education Authority Returns Now. It's H.R. 3177. And what it will do is very simply, it would allow States to opt out of the Federal NCLB system completely, and, at the same time, allow the States to retain their funding. 
   I think, to me, it's very obvious that States have grown tired of Washington dangling money over their heads and holding them accountable. And I thank the Speaker for allowing us to address the issue of the reform that is needed in the area of NCLB and talking about the LEARN Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I just walked in a moment ago. I was on the streets of Washington, D.C. where the heat is truly on this Nation's Capital in the high nineties and the humidity is also in the high nineties, and here we come to the inside of Chambers, where the heat is being put on, on the American taxpayer and the American family; but this time it is being placed on them by the Democrats and majority party. 
   Six months into control by the Democrats, and what have they wrought for this Nation? The largest tax increase in U.S. history; an attempt to change the rules on the American public going back to 1820; and last week, of course, we saw as well the idea by the Democrats that they should have some sort of slush fund where your tax dollars go unequated for. 
   When you look at the basic math I was trying to do here, look at the equation, what they give us is this: a tax increase plus a spending increase leads to an answer of an increased burden on the American taxpayer. 
   I have had the opportunity now to serve on the Budget Committee for 4 years; and during that time the Democrats, when they were in the minority, railed against us time after time saying we were spending too much. I thought that railing would stop once they were in the majority and they had the opportunity to go in the other direction. But as we have seen here, the railing has not stopped. They continue to point to the past about increased spending, but they then at the same token, out of their same mouths, what do they do? They increase spending on the American public again. 
   If the problem in the past was that the U.S. Government was spending too much, you would think that the simple solution to that, the simple answer to that math equation, would be spend less. But this budget does not do that. This spending bill does not do that. That is why I support the gentleman from Georgia's amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the gentleman from Washington resumes control of the time. 
   There was no objection.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, as a Member of Congress who supports the protection of our national parks and as an individual from the very crowded State of New Jersey who is seeking to make sure that we preserve the open space of this country as best we can, I rise in support of the gentlelady from Colorado's amendment which would increase spending on these worthwhile causes by 4 percent. 
   You know, the American public who watches this debate right now might wonder sometimes, do we have a schizophrenic state of mind by the majority party in control today? Out of their mouths come one thing now and something else later on. What is white is black, what is day is night. One moment we are railing against and saying spending, spending, spending is the problem and it's been the problem of the Republican Party for years and years and it still is their problem. Just a moment later, we hear that spending is not the problem from the other side. The problem all these years has been cuts, cuts, cuts. The problem that we have now is that we've been cutting too much in the past. Which is it? 
   The American public must do as I do sometimes when they hear the debate from the other side of the aisle and scratch their head. Which are the facts that they want to go by today? Is it the problem that we've been spending too much, as the other side of the aisle says? Or is the problem, as the gentleman just recently said, that we were cutting too much? 
   I would argue that the problem has been that we've been spending too much of the taxpayers' dollars in an unaccountable manner. And the budget that has come before us would give the American taxpayer the largest tax increase in U.S. history. 
   The amendment from the gentlelady from Colorado would try to do things on an even and moderate manner. It would still increase spending by 4 percent so that all the worthwhile programs in the bill that's before us would be able to be continued to be fully funded at the necessary levels. But at the same time, the gentlelady from Colorado takes in mind the efforts of the American taxpayers to make sure that we will not have the largest tax increase in American history on that family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that will positively affect thousands of small businesses across the country. I would like to thank my good friend from Florida, Congressman Tom Feeney, for sponsoring this amendment with me and for all of his hard work on pushing for much-needed Sarbanes-Oxley reform. 
   Mr. Chairman, the 5-year anniversary of the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley is almost upon us, and there are many of us who believe, myself included, that SO  
   X used a sledgehammer where a simple tap would do. The accountability and transparency goals that were so laudable in developing SO 
   X could have been met, at least in part, through a competitive market where empowered investigators have a real role.
   One thing is for certain, however, and that is the regulatory scheme and structure that SO  
   X established has created more problems than it resolved. You see, we are in a global economy, and our financial markets must be able to be competitive. But when going public in an American market means added out-of-pocket expenses of $4 million to $6 million per accelerated filer, that is more than 50 times the original SEC estimate, it begs the question why any company rising through the ranks would go public and be subject to those requirements. Worse yet, it begs the question of why that successful company would go public in the U.S. at all.
   In fact, there have been very many credible reports pointing to a loss in the supremacy of the American financial market as a direct result of the SO  
   X implementation. Only one of 24 listings with over $1 billion in capital raised has listed in the U.S. as opposed to London, according to the New York Stock Exchange. And there is also evidence that some U.S. companies have even returned to being privately held because of their inability to meet the costs and extensive accounting requirements of SO 
   X.
   We have seen this directly with our Nation's two largest financial markets, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, both looking to expand into a less regulated, less litigated environment in Europe. 
   One segment of the U.S. economy that will bear a disproportionate brunt of SO  
   X is the American small business. Because the SEC expected small businesses to have difficulty meeting all of  these costs and filing requirements, they were temporarily exempted from the regulatory burdens of section 404 to give them time to prepare. This exemption was last extended now through 2007 so that the SEC and the PCAOB could finalize their revised guidelines to management and new standards to the auditors. So while I am commend the SEC and the PCAOB in trying to improve the implementation of 404, it still remains unclear whether these revisions make it possible for small businesses to comply without suffering dire economic consequences.
   Furthermore, it is unfair to make our small businesses comply with new regulations that are being finalized and adopted halfway through this year for which these small businesses are supposed to report. 
   So I offer this amendment today to extend the exemption for small businesses to comply with section 404. The amendment will prohibit the SEC from forcing small businesses to comply with section 404(a)for fiscal year 2008. 
   There is just too much evidence out there that small companies are not going public or are doing so overseas because of the onerous burdens of section 404, and this amendment will address that. It is essential that we do not add to the overly burdensome new costs on our Nation's small businesses, especially while new auditing standards are still being revised and finalized. 
   So by delaying the requirements for 1 year, and that is all, we are giving our small businesses more time to ensure that they are not unfairly hurt, without jeopardizing the accountability goals of the original SO  
   X legislation.
   Mr. Chairman, I include for the Record The National Taxpayer Unions Vote Alert in support of this amendment that is on the floor today, along with a letter from the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, just a reflection on the comments by the chairman. I appreciate the chairman wishing to defer to the expertise of the SEC. Would the chairman and the committee defer in the same manner to the SEC with regard to the issue of executive compensation as he does to the area of SOX. 
   The problem with the testimony that we heard in committee the other day is that after repeated questioning from both sides of the aisle as to exactly what the cost will be on business in America through the SOX reform that they are proposing right now out of the SEC on both large and small businesses, their answer was basically ``we don't know.'' 
   They have had 2 years to look at it at the SEC, to come up with new rules and regulations, to try to bring down the complexity and the burden on businesses large and small. And after 2 years, they don't know. 
   Congress has directed them and the message has been made clear to the SEC that the burden, as the gentleman from Florida has already pointed out, is excessive and we asked them repeatedly, can you categorize this? Can you pinpoint how much, if any, savings there will be for businesses? And they say they don't know. 
   So until they do know, all we are asking for is a 1-year extension so that small businesses can have an opportune time to learn the new regulations that are basically being promulgated as we speak before they have to implement them.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, we come to the floor tonight to speak about an issue that has eclipsed all other issues, that has been in the media and on the public's minds of recent date, and that, of course, is the financial situation that the United States currently finds itself in. 
   As we go through this evening, we will talk about deals or no deals, the underlying fundamental problems that the situation has brought us to this point, who and how we got here, what was the makeup of the market and the Fed and the Treasury that may have helped to facilitate the problems that we face today.     
   And, finally, what are some of the solutions that are potentially out there that can move us from where we are today to a more stronger and safe economy? 
   I'll just start for a moment, before I yield to some of my colleagues who have joined me, to suggest to the American public that tonight they should be concerned, not just about what is occurring on Wall Street, but what is occurring right here in Washington, D.C. as well. 
   With regard to the situation on Wall Street, although as difficult as it may be, I have, deep down inside of me, the utmost faith in the American people and the American worker and the America businessman that, when faced with this challenge, that they will be able to overcome it and to strive and make a stronger economy tomorrow that will be beneficial for our farmers, for our families, for our manufacturers, for our economy throughout the United States. 
   And yes, there may be some need, as we will discuss, for the intervention by Washington, but the reason why I say that the American citizen should be concerned tonight--not so much about Wall Street, but about Washington--is what may come out in the form of legislation tonight--or in the next day or the day after that. Because, you see, we are being asked to sort of rush through this process, where as normally we would come to this body and maybe spend hours upon hours debating whether we should spend a million dollars on this bridge over in this State or a million dollars in this program in that State. 
   And we will go through committee hearings and markups and subcommittees and the like and then finally get to the floor of the House and pass it here. And then it will go over to the Senate, and it will go through the same arduous process of subcommittees and full committees and markups, and then to the Senate floor, where they will have debate on it infinitum. And maybe even then we'll go to conference committee and come back here to the House where we will have to discuss the issue all over again. And that may be only for a matter of only a million dollars or two. 
   But what we are talking about here is potentially spending $700 billion, and we're being asked to basically decide that issue in a matter of hours. Mind you, we may, hopefully--as the optimist as I always am--get just the right answer. But the reason I say the American citizen should be warned is that history does not indicate that. And many times, in the rush to judgment, when we are pushed to make a decision at the end of the day, at the end of the week, at the end of a session when a crisis is looming over our heads, we are sometimes pushed in the wrong direction. 
   And I would also ask the American citizen to consider this; you know, the overwhelming calls to our offices I think across the board, across both Democrats and Republicans as well, would say that they have been opposed to spending $700 billion of the American taxpayers' dollars to bail out, if you will, Wall Street. I would just advise the American public, as a plan finally does come through the process and is passed through this House and the Senate, I would advise them to look over it very, very carefully when they are told that this is not the same Paulson proposal, that the American taxpayer is not going to be on the hook. I don't know what that proposal will be--as negotiations are going on literally as we speak--but look at it very carefully to see that the proverbial wool is not being pulled over all of our eyes, and that we ultimately, and our future generations, our children and our grandchildren, will be held responsible for paying the debt. I hope that's not the case. 
   I remain optimistic that we can work out a solution. And the House Republicans have actually proposed such a solution that would not put the American taxpayer on the hook. And we are willing to work with our Democrat colleagues across the aisle to make any changes or additions or alterations to that so that it can be palatable to all parties in both Houses to get through the process, but let's see how the final end result is. 
   And with that, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman. And hopefully, Members on both sides of the aisle will be keeping their heads as we go through the debate and the seeking of a deal on this, and a deal that, at the end of the day, is a benefit to the taxpayers of this country. 
   While we try to seek out that debate and try to seek out the solution, one axiom that we should probably go by is ``Do not go back to the same people who brought you this problem in the first place.'' And I will speak on that in a little more detail to take a look at who it was actually that brought us to this problem. I know some people are pointing their fingers exclusively at Wall Street on this, and clearly they have some blame to lay there because, for various reasons, executives and otherwise made truly imprudent decision making, maybe it's in part because they really did not have the information on hand, maybe it's because of lawsuits in the pasts when analysts were pushed out of the Wall Street, out of the cell side of the equation, or maybe it's because with all the Ph.D.s and what have you brought in and brought in all the new modeling on Wall Street and what have you, that made it almost impossible for the CEOs  of these investment firms and otherwise to really know what it was exactly that they were buying down below. 
   Whatever the excuse, whatever the reason, there is some blame to be laid at Wall Street, to be clear, but we also have to look to see where some of that blame lays here in Washington, D.C. And that's why I said, do not return to those who brought us here. 
   And if you want to look to a place where you can get a little bit of information about how we got here, as we're all done here listening to this program right now, our speakers here on the floor, I went to a place earlier today--or somebody sent this to me as an e-mail, and it was an e-mail for a YouTube site, and it's called ``Burning Down the House.'' And it's a 9 1/2 minute YouTube presentation done with music and what have you that gives you a nutshell explanation of exactly how did we get to where we are in the first place.     
   So I recommend people to go to YouTube's ``Burning Down the House'' and they will be educated on it. 
   But right now we're going to be additionally educated by the young lady from Minnesota. 
   I yield such time as she may consume to Mrs. Bachmann.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentlelady for your comments. And your opening comments were quite instructive. 
   You say we have a problem today. That we all agree on. But we should not be moving forward expeditiously without all the evidence before us so we can make the right decision. It was just the other day that during the course of this week I was in contact with a notable economist who made that point to me as well, that we should have all the data before us so that we can make a correct determination as to what is the right reform in Washington to address the problem on Wall Street. And he referred me to some data. And the data is not mine. It is not his. It is published data from the Federal Reserve. I will just spend 30 seconds on it to put it in perspective. We do know we have a problem. If you talk to most people on Wall Street, they will tell you there is a problem in the credit markets. 
   You have to put things in perspective with respect to where we stood before. If you look at commercial and industrial loans, seasonally adjusted, it goes from July of last year to September of this year, and you will see that leading into this week, actually commercial and industrial loans were at historic highs. And yes, on the other end of the chart it just begins to tip down, the chart shows it goes down just a little bit. And the latest data we have is from I think just 1 week ago. The next data for this week will be coming out. 
   It's probably telling that we can't get this information, quite honestly. I believe maybe only the Federal Reserve may have this information. But for Congress really to act intelligently, it needs information like this. This is why I threw the chart up, because the gentlelady from Minnesota said we should have information. 
   Here is another chart. And I will end on this because charts are hard to follow here. This is commercial paper here of nonfinancial companies, again seasonally adjusted, again from the same time frame, July of last year to September of this year. And you will see where we are, on average at the 190 level, we were peaking just going into this. Now it went down. But you see those spikes going down all the time. 
   On the very end of the chart, pointing over here, there is a little bit of an uptick. I can't tell you what the actual data is conclusively, whether that little uptick then goes up. I doubt it. It probably begins to spike downwards again. It is that sort of information that we would like to have specifically before us so we are not relying on anecdotal evidence. And I don't discount that, or the phone calls we receive from the street or the articles that we receive as well. We do know there is a problem out there. 
   I'm just pointing out, as the gentlelady from Minnesota has said, it would be a lot more beneficial before we start spending $700 billion, or for that matter even $100 billion. Because we may see a so-called ``compromise'' piece of legislation come out that says, American taxpayer, don't worry. We're not going to spend $700 billion to bail out Wall Street. We are only going to spend $100 billion. And now you should thank Washington for only spending $100 billion. So come on board with that. Some of us still have a problem with spending $100 billion on a problem that is part Wall Street's but also part Washington's. 
   If it were ever to again regain credibility with the American people, Congress really has to address a fundamental problem and a fundamental question, and that is to answer to the American public how come it was that for so many years, when the evidence, true evidence, data evidence, coming into Congress was showing us that this housing growth model could not sustain itself, why Congress did not pass legislation to rein it in, to reform the system, and to put into checks and balances in the past? 
   Well again we can go into the details why Congress didn't do that. But to get the credibility back before we move forward on new legislation involving tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, we need to answer that question.     
   With that, I would like to yield the floor to the gentleman from Michigan.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman. We hopefully will learn from our history that there are no necessary evils in government. And it may well be if the unfortunate compromise comes about, that that is the arguments that will be made by those who propose that, that you just have to suffer a little bit in government expenditures on that; that is a necessary evil. 
   That is when the actual question will come about probably, is when is $700 billion not $700 billion. And the answer that may well be given, well, it is not $700 billion when we pay it out over time; $100 billion this month, $150 billion a couple months from now, $150 billion in January, $200 billion after that; and as the numbers go up, eventually to $700 billion, and maybe even more. Because that is where we stand right now with the administration and the Democrat majority essentially having originally said that there was a deal, and that means the Democrats having signed on to or basically accepted the outline of the original Paulson plan, the Bush administration plan, saying we should spend $700 billion. Anything less than that from their perspective, which we don't just do it at one time but do it over time, to the American taxpayer should be seen as the exact same thing.  
   That is why I said in my opening comments, don't let anyone pull the proverbial wool over your eyes by saying we have ratcheted this down somehow by making a compromise that they are going to spend it in a different manner, because to you and I it is the same thing. Also to our children and our children's children, it will be the same thing, inasmuch as the devastating impact it will have on future economies with regard to inflation, inflation, one of the most onerous taxes of all, as it steals from us without us even seeing it, as the value of our dollar goes down and down and down as the American government prints more and more money to do a bailout. 
   With that, once again I am pleased to be joined now by another leader on this issue, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for joining us and also for your leadership on this crucial issue, perhaps as others have said, one of the most crucial issues we in Congress will ever vote on. 
   As the lady as said, as the speakers before have as well, we recognize the severity of the problem on the U.S. economy, and the global economy as well. We recognize that some action by Congress is necessary, but we suggest that the proposal that has been proposed by Secretary Paulson and ostensibly supported by the Democrat majority is the wrong proposal. Therefore, we have stepped up to the plate and suggested a House Republican proposal. 
   It is not simply us, we here in the House Republicans that suggest that the Paulson-Pelosi proposal is not the way to go. In my hand here is a list of, I think, several hundred economists, 192 economists from around the country, who reviewed it and expressed their view and, very briefly, they say  we want to express to Congress our great concern for the plan proposed by Treasury Secretary Paulson to deal with the financial crisis. 
   ``We see three fatal pitfalls in the current proposed plan. One, its fairness, the plan is a subsidy to investors at taxpayer expense. Two, its ambiguity, neither the mission of the new agency, nor its oversight are clear; and, three, perhaps most important, it's long-term effects, if the plan is enacted, its effects will be with us for a generation.'' 
   I know the President heard those remarks, it was reported on ABC. When he saw this, he said, ``I don't care what someone on some college campus says,'' ABC reports. Instead he says he trusts his Treasury secretary. 
   Well, quite candidly, as a representative of Congress, I trust what my constituents are saying about this situation. They realize it's an important matter. They realize it's a tightening of the credit markets. They realize that something must be done, but they also realize, as the economists do, that we should not be putting this on the backs of the taxpayers, but, rather takes gentlelady from North Carolina suggests, come up with an alternative proposal where the Wall Street players would actually be underwriting the cost of the proposal. 
   As the gentlelady has put into the record and outlined it, in essence what we are doing there is setting up a guaranteed fund, if you will, or backing for those mortgage-backed securities. 
   I will just digress on how that would work for 30 seconds, think of it this way. If you are confident in the way that Washington handles your tax dollars today, if you are confident that the way the American government, Washington, handled your tax dollars when it came to Katrina, if you are confident with the way that Congress handles your tax dollars when, year after year, we can't balance our budget like the American family has to balance their budget. If you are confident in the way that the American government in Washington handles your tax dollars when we run deficits of $100 billion, $150 billion, then $200 billion and $300 billion, now over $400 billion. With this, of course, on top of it, would be over a trillion dollars. 
   If you were confident with the management of the assets of the American government over the past years, then you should be absolutely confident that we would be able to set up an agency, either external to the Treasury or within the Treasury, to be able to handle $700 billion of mortgage-backed security, and that would mean, on the back side of those, all the assets of those foreclosed properties that would possibly come from that as well. 
   Somebody on a TV show earlier said well we did it with the RTC, and Secretary of the Treasury Paulson said, well, this is not like the RTC. But in a the way it is. We were handling those assets. At some point along the line I had to remind the commentator on the program with the RTC, it ended up costing the taxpayer around 127 to 147 billion dollars, which in today's dollars is around $220 billion. Here we are talking about $700 billion. 
   If you are confident the American government can do this better than anyone else, then support either the initial Paulson-Pelosi proposal or any hybrid or compromise from that that still involves that. 
   But if you are not so confident, if you have a question of the ability of Washington adequately handling those dollars, and if you have a question on how this may impact upon the economy and the monetization of that debt and the rise in inflation that may have followed it this year. But next year, if the production in this country does not increase, then you should be looking for an alternative, and that alternative is just what the lady from North Carolina has raised. 
   As I started my comment, I said, let us therefore not look to those who have brought us to this point in the first place, whether it be the Federal Reserve, with the loose lending policies that they have had for years, or the Congress who refused to step in, as I said, when evidence indicated that had there was a problem in the housing market, that a bubble was coming, that there was a problem with the GSEs, that's Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but Congress refused to act. 
   Let's not go back to those individuals who brought us to that particular point for a solution, let's maybe think out of the box and look for a solution. 
   Another economist recently was published on this matter, to address more of the global issue, the larger issue. I will read from this, he is Chicago economist Robert Schimer from the University of Chicago. He States, as follows, ``Let me mention one other issue that I take very seriously. I recognize that this might not matter much to my Congressman, but in my view it may be the most important issue for global welfare. The U.S. has long been a beacon of free markets. When economic conditions turn sour in Argentina or Indonesia, we give very clear instructions on what to do: balance the budget, cut government employment, maintain free trade and the rule of law, and do not prop up failing enterprises. Opponents of free markets argue that this advice benefits international financiers, not the domestic market. I have always believed (at least since I began to understand economics) that the U.S. approach was correct. But when the U.S. ignores its own advice in this situation, it reduces the credibility of this stance. Rewriting the rules of the game at this stage will therefore have serious ramifications not only for people in this country but for future of global capitalism. The social cost of that is far, far greater than $700 billion. 
   So I end where I began, the social cost of our adopting a program, on this country, and our children and our future generation will be far, far greater than anything we can imagine if we do not do it right.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (THE IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER IN AMERICAN LIFE AND HISTORY -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I rise today as a member of the bipartisan Congressional Prayer Caucus to formally acknowledge the importance of prayer in American life and American history. 
   Today I am honored to launch the first of what I hope will be weekly reminders of our country's need for prayer. I do so by reading a proclamation given by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 when he said, ``From the birth of our Republic, prayer has been vital to the whole fabric of American life.'' 
   As we crossed and settled the continent, built a Nation in freedom, endured war and critical struggles to become a sentinel of liberty, we repeatedly turned to our Maker for strength and guidance in achieving the awesome tasks before us. 
   Whether at the ordeal of the Revolutionary War, the stormy days of binding the 13 colonies into one country, the Civil War, or other moments of trial over the years, we have turned to God for His help. As we are told in II Chronicles 7:14: ``If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.''

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, I come to the floor in appreciation of the underlying intent of both the amendment and the underlying bill as well. 
   But I am mindful of the fact, as I come from the great State of New Jersey and as we think about the issue at hand, and that is our beaches and the shores generally, I was just talking with someone recently that due to the high cost of energy and the high cost of  gasoline, a lot of my constituents, quite honestly, won't be able to even enjoy the Jersey shore this summer, to ``go down below,'' as we call it, down to the Jersey shore to enjoy it and enjoy whatever improvements that this amendment, which I support, and the underlying bill, which I support, would bring to us. 
   So the point I just want to spend a moment on is the fact that while we debate these tertiary issues, the fundamental issue that folks back in my district are concerned about is how are we going to afford in the first place to get about our State of New Jersey, to get to the shore, to enjoy our vacation, to enjoy the beaches if Congress is not doing anything whatsoever to address the high cost of gasoline and to address the high cost of energy in the State of New Jersey and the rest of the country as well.     
   Here we are now in the ides of April, the middle of April. This is about, let's see, 12, 13, 14, 15, the 16th month now into this, the 110th Congress under the Democrat leadership. And we have to ask ourselves one seminal question, one basic question: What has the 16th month of Democrat leadership brought us in a whole host of areas? And I will get to the energy issue in a minute. 
   Well, we see in the area of food prices, my constituents also tell me that the price of food, when they go to the A&P or the grocery stores every day, whatever the store is, are going through the roof. The housing crisis. We will go to any committee here. I serve on the Financial Services Committee. We know we are in a terrible housing crisis right now, a subprime crisis affecting credit markets across the country. Fuel costs I have already mentioned. A recession. You know, for the first time in years, we're talking about an economic recession. For all the time that the Republicans were in control of this House and in control of this government, we saw that they were in booming economic times. Sixteen months now into the 110th Congress in a Democrat leadership, off the map on food costs, housing costs, into recession. If that has happened in 16 months, we wonder what will happen if they have another 16 months. 
   So I would ask whether this Congress could do what my constituents are asking us to do. Maybe address these issues such as beach issues and where we can go on vacation, but can we do those after we get to the more seminal issues, the more fundamental issues, issues that strike at the heart of where America is living right now, issues that strike at, well, their pocketbook and where their money is really going to right now, and that is energy costs. 
   The other day I just drove out in my driveway of my house. I went down to the main road. And there at the gas station, the price of a gallon of diesel fuel was $4 a gallon. Amazing. $4 a gallon. That means that truckers--those same truckers who have to get down to the Jersey Shore to bring supplies and what have you for vacationers who want to enjoy the beaches and what have you--truckers, I am told, have to spend upwards of $1,000 to fill up their diesel tanks in their trucks to get about our State. 
   New Jersey is a commuter State. New Jersey is a hub State, a transportation State. Unless Congress is ready to commit itself to really fundamentally look at the underlying causes of the high cost of energy, of the high cost of gasoline, of the high cost of diesel fuel, unless we are ready to work across both sides of the aisle on these issues, these other issues will come to naught, will be of little importance to my constituents if they are stranded at home, if their husbands or their wives don't have jobs because they can't afford to put gas into the car or diesel into the trucks. 
   So I just come to the floor to raise these issues now and ask that, as important as these beach issues are, can we not really begin to address what the constituents are addressing? 
   Later on in the evening, I would like to say that there are some solutions, there are some solutions that the American public would like us to begin to address. There are some answers to the fundamental reasons of why the price of gasoline and diesel fuel is going through the roof. There are some basic changes that Congress, this Congress, could be making right now to the energy supply in this country that would help to drive down the cost of energy in this country so that Americans, families in my district and in yours, will be able to address this problem and not have a problem of high energy cost anymore.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the comments by the sponsor, and I support the commonsense approach to this amendment as well. 
   Coming from the great State of New Jersey, who has had when it comes to beach issues over the last 20-some odd years, during which time I had the privilege of serving in the State legislature and had to deal with some of the same issues that are being dealt with right here and now, I appreciate what is being done this evening with regard to realtime recovering and realtime information coming in. New Jersey, I think, is literally on the cutting edge of this information right now. New Jersey is on the cutting edge, having addressed these issues over the last decade, and I appreciate what is being attempted to be done for the rest of the country as well. 
   That being said, I just want to reiterate my point that I made earlier this evening that here we are back in Congress again this week, and a lot of people are asking me back in the district, what are some of the major issues that you will be working on when you return to Washington this week? 
   At a town hall meeting and discussions back over the weekend, I gave them a breakdown, this being one of them. And they asked me, wait, you are going to be talking about beach issues? You are going to be talking about some of these other suspension bills we had earlier in the week and I anticipate having later on in the week? 
   But each time, no matter where I was, my constituents asked me the same question: Well, when is Congress going to begin the debate, when is Congress going to begin the discussion, whether it is in committees or on the floor or elsewhere, to try to address the problem that is really hitting us the hardest here back at home in the Fifth Congressional District, that is the top of the State of New Jersey, the issue that is hitting us the most in the pocketbook here in the great State of New Jersey? And, of course, what they were referring to is the price of energy. 
   We have just gone through a little bit of a cold snap in the State of New Jersey, as other parts of the country have as well, so for that reason we have seen the use of home fuel oil go up, naturally. It is a scary thing now when you see the delivery truck come to your house to deliver oil to fill up your oil tank, because you know as soon as that man is done delivering that 100 gallons or 250 gallons to your tank in your basement or in the ground or what have you, he is going to hand you a bill at the end of that delivery, and that bill can wipe out your savings for the week, wipe out the dollars that you may have planned to set aside to buy food, to buy medicine, to pay other expenses you were looking forward to have to spend that week. 
   So the people are asking, when are we going to be doing something? Unfortunately, we are still not doing it right now. Here we are, 16 months into a Democrat-controlled Congress, and still nothing has been done about it. 
   I refer back, just to give a little element of time to all this, to the chart I have right up here in front of us, to the fact that we do not have a Democrat energy policy to try to address these seminal issues, major issues that are affecting us. Take a look at what the prices are and the result of not having an energy policy to address this. 
   As this chart shows, the price of a barrel of crude oil when the Democrats came to power just 16 months ago was $58.31 cents a barrel. Fifty-eight bucks a barrel. Here we are less than 2 years later, a year-and-a-half later, and the price of a barrel of crude oil today is $113 a barrel. It is because of that huge increase in the price of the barrel that you and I have to pay so much when that man comes to deliver the fuel oil for our house or when we go down to the gas station as well. 
   Fifty-three cents on the dollar when you buy gas at the gas station or are buying fuel oil for your house is the price of crude oil. So when you wonder why it is that you are paying so much at the pump or you are paying so much for delivery to your house, it is because it has gone from 58 bucks to 113 bucks. Not over the last 10 years. Not over the last 6 years, or something like that. Not over the period of time when the Republicans were in control. No, not over that entire span of time. But just in the last 16 months under Democrat control we have seen the price of fuel oil spike and go through the roof. 
   The result of that has been what? The result has been, besides the fact that you now have to spend most of your money going to your fuel costs, the price also has translated into a ripple effect on the price of food, so when you go to the food store, those are through the roof. It has a ripple effect with regard to the overall economy, and so that is why Alan Greenspan was on TV just about 2 weeks ago now saying that he too is agreeing with other economists in this country saying we have entered into a recession. 
   So if you remember back how strong the economy was, how strong Wall Street was just about 18 months ago, now we see under the Pelosi premium of no energy policy, the result is what you see today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, the previous gentleman was most accurate in his portrayal of what the problem is. Let me just dig into it a little bit more. 
   Again, as I said before, I support the ideas of the amendment that we are discussing right now in the underlying legislation. My heart just goes out for my constituents at home who may not be able to enjoy the benefits of such, the beaches of the great State of New Jersey and others along the eastern seaboard, simply because, a very practical matter with the high price of energy, the high price of gas, they simply may not be able to afford to get there. 
   I think I saw it in some news report the other day, how it was characterized, the point that I made earlier and the previous gentleman just made, as the chart just shows, the lack of a plan to deal with the energy problem in this country by the Democrat majority has brought us in this 110th Congress, this huge spike, this huge increase in the price of oil. 
   As the gentleman explained, it went from $58 per barrel of oil now up to $113, almost $114 per barrel of oil. The paper I think I was reading the other day, I heard it someplace, was this can most appropriately be called, not a Democrat problem, a premium that we are paying for the price of oil. Perhaps, appropriately, the paper called it the Pelosi premium because it comes during the time of this Congress headed by the Democrats. 
   The previous gentleman from Georgia was saying that, and he laid out very eloquently, that the other side of the aisle had campaigned on, and the Speaker said frequently they had a plan. Well, would that it be that they actually had a plan and began to implement that was beneficial, that would be beneficial, but they have had some sort of a plan. 
   I have to point this out to the gentleman from Georgia. They have had some suggestions as to what we can be doing with the price of gasoline. Let me just run through a couple of them. One of their suggestions to deal with the price of gasoline was a 50-cent increase per gallon Federal gas tax, which was proposed by the Energy and Commerce chairman. 
   So we are already paying $3.50 or so for a gallon of gasoline at the pump. The Energy and Commerce chairman said how do we deal with that issue? Let's add a 50-cent increase per gallon Federal gas tax on top of that. That's one part of their plan. 
   The second plan the other side of the aisle, the Democrat majority proposed to deal with the high price of energy, was a $150 million war surtax. That was under a plan proposed by the Appropriations chairman, DAVID OBEY. We are already paying a high price for gasoline, we are already paying a high price for diesel, home heating fuel. Let's add insult to injury and add a $150 billion war surtax on top of that that you and I would have to pay. 
   Was that the end of their plan? No, they had a couple of other ideas. Defense Appropriations Chairman JOHN MURTHA and Representative JIM MCGOVERN said low- and middle-income taxpayers should have to pay 2 percent added to their tax bill while higher income taxpayers would take an additional 12 to 15 percent added tax as well. There again, how do you deal with this problem, higher taxes. 
   Finally, a final proposal to deal with this situation from the Democrat majority, a 5-cent increase per gallon gasoline gas tax was proposed by Representative JAMES OBERSTAR to pay for infrastructure. This proposal, as you may recall, would raise the Federal gas tax to 23.4 cents a gallon from the current 18.4 cents. This was made last summer.  
   So every proposal that they have had suggested, every proposal that we have heard from the Democrat side of the aisle to deal with the energy crisis in this country, to deal with the fact that energy costs for a barrel of oil going $58 up to $114, their solution to the fact that we are paying $3.25, $3.50, $4 for diesel, their solution so far has done nothing to lower the price. It has done everything to raise the price. 
   To add insult to injury, their proposal is to add even more by adding additional taxes and surtaxes on top of that. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the Chair. And I appreciate the gentleman from Tennessee having come to the floor a moment ago to address this energy and the like. To be honest, that's the only way that we are going to be able to find solutions to these major issues that we need to address, whether it is the Iraq war situation, or this major issue of energy costs in this country. 
   Obviously, we have been able to find common ground when it comes to, I would catch it, slightly less significant issues dealing with beach quality and what have you. Now if we can find that same comity when it comes to the Iraq war and energy, then we'll be moving in the right direction. 
   That being said, the gentleman can't disagree with some of the facts that have been set out here for the last evening, and this will probably be my last comment for the night; and that is that the Democrat majority, prior to becoming the majority, did point out some problems with regard to energy prices prior to coming into the majority. 
   And the gentleman from Georgia went through a litany of quotes from Democrat leadership citing the problem, and making a promise that the Democrat majority had a solution to those problems. I'm eager to see what those solutions are. I would like to extend a hand across the other side of the aisle to work with them, if those solutions were ever forthcoming. 
   As I indicated in my last comments, the only proposals that I've seen so far from the other side of the aisle have been restrictive or increasing to the cost of energy. They were the two or three tax increases that I ran through before, the 50 cent increase per gallon gasoline Federal gas hike proposed, the $150 billion war surtax or the 5 cent increase per gallon tax hike, all proposals from the other side of the aisle. None of those things will lower the cost of energy. All of those things will raise the price that you and I and everyone else have to pay at the pump. 
   What we may want to do is look to see what other countries are doing with regard to energy costs in general. Let me just run down real quickly some of these. 
   Over in China, three or four things. One, China has expanded its natural gas infrastructure by constructing pipe lines. Unfortunately, the Democrats have opposed natural gas production in this country and natural gas infrastructure improvements in the country in general. And the chart that we had up previously showed that as far as offshore. 
   Secondly, China is rapidly expanding its refining capacity. Unfortunately, Democrats have repeatedly voted against expanding America's refinery capacity. I don't think we've had any new refineries built in some several decades. 
   Thirdly, China is ambitiously developing its nuclear power energy which plans to spend $50 billion on 30 additional nuclear reactors within the next 15 years. Again, unfortunately, Democrats consider the notion of increasing nuclear power generation in the U.S. basically as off the table. 
   And finally, China's planning on constructing many new large scale hydro electric projects over the forecasted period, including an 18.2 gigawatt Three Gorges dam project which is expected to come in in 2009. Again, unfortunately, Democrats have actively opposed new hydro electric power plants here in the United States. 
   So I will end where I began. The gentleman said that we should be concerned about how much money is going to Saudi Arabia and Dubai and all of the things that they're able to build with that oil. I agree. 
   I wish all of our American tax dollars and American gasoline dollars that we pay at the pump weren't going overseas. But right now, 63 percent of our energy sources are dependent on foreign sources of energy and growing more every year. 
   What we need to do is make America more self-reliant when it comes to energy. You do that by what we've talked about all evening. Don't tax it, don't raise the cost of production, don't restrict the production here in the United States, don't restrict the ideas of new efficient energy alternatives and the like, but allow it to grow using ingenuity of Americans insight and entrepreneurs, so that we do not have to be more dependent every day on foreign, unreliable sources that are a threat to this country, are a threat to our national security, and put our young men and women in harm's way on the points with regard to war, as the gentleman from Tennessee was pointing out. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), as modified. 
   The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. I thank the gentleman also for bringing this issue once again to the floor. I was in my office earlier this evening when you began your remarks, and I have heard you on the floor on numerous occasions speaking to medical topics.     
   We appreciate very much your background, the expertise that you bring. 
   And on that point, I should just say that on my 3-hour trip from New Jersey traveling on good, old reliable, semi-reliable, slow Amtrak, I had the opportunity to read a number of your articles that you have written. I would commend anyone who is listening to us here tonight. I should ask the gentleman, is much of this material I read, one a position paper, another is called Addressing America's Health Care Challenge: A Solution, are these articles by any chance up on your Web site? Can I commend the audience here that listens to us tonight to go to your Web site and look to find these things?

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate that, and just a couple of them, Addressing America's Health Care Challenge, with that and what you've talked about here, as I put the expression, you step back for a moment and look at the bigger picture, which is what I'm going to talk about in a moment. So I think this is a good one. 
   Another one is the cure to the physician crisis, and I'm not going to get into it here. This article gets into it pretty well to say, you can do all that you want to do when it comes to the issue of health insurance, but if we don't have enough docs out there such as yourself and other docs out there, physicians that are out there taking care of the patients, it's not going to mean anything. 
   When I'm back in my district and I tour my hospitals, what is one of the first complaints or concerns that I have, and I bet it's the first complaints and concerns that you hear from your hospitals, is a shortage of nurses. And whether it's long-term care facilities, hospitals or clinics, they say we just can't get enough visiting nurses, we just can't get enough trained nurses as well. 
   If we don't get that aspect of the problem solved, everything else that you and I and the rest of Congress talks here tonight and in the future will mean nothing because we're not getting the providers to the patients. 
   So, again, I just wanted to start where I should probably end, and I think I will in a little bit, thank you for your work in this area. 
   Where you left off and some of the points you were touching about goes along this line, and that is, that you have to look at some of the bigger picture. 
   In my office, I was looking at some data, and one of them is on data from the World Health Organization, and I think this is interesting. Again, regardless of what we do on health insurance and regardless of what we do in the government, whether it's in the Federal level, the State level or anything else, here's what they tell us. Here's what the World Health Organization tells us. That if Americans, and I guess the world community as well, but Americans in particular, would address three areas, smoking, eating disorders and eating, what your diet is, and exercise, if you address those in a logical coherent manner, presumably after consultation with your physician, 80 percent, an amazing number when I read it, 80 percent of Type 2 diabetes could be addressed and resolved. Eighty percent of heart disease could be resolved. Forty percent of cancer issues could be resolved. 
   Nothing about buying insurance. Nothing about spending more money. Matter of fact, you'd probably end up spending less money if you ate right and didn't go to McDonald's as much as I do. Those three areas. 
   The one on diabetes, I just had the opportunity in the last week to 10 days to have folks from that organization come and speak to me back in the district, and they pointed out a statistic. Approximately a little less than one-third of the dollars that we spend on Medicare goes to diabetes or diabetes-related injuries or other illnesses that are related to it. 
   So can you imagine, if we were able to resolve that issue, how we would be able to address our health care costs in this country. Costs being one factor, but obviously, the bigger factor is improving the quality of life. 
   So you're right on the target when you say how do we improve the health quality of individuals in this country first and foremost; and secondly, how do you do that through a proper physician relationship. 
   As I come to the floor this night, and I always make reference to this mark, here we are in November, the 11th month of the year, and we have to ask ourselves what has now under the new Democrat leadership wrought when it comes to the issue of health care in this country. 
   Somebody else pointed out some numbers to me the other day. I think it was this past week. So far the ledger is 106 bills have made its way to the President's desk. Forty-six of those bills have been to do with the naming of post offices and Federal buildings. Forty-four just have to do with Special Orders and special days and the like. That's almost two-thirds. Ninety bills out of 106 of no real major significance, and here we are at the floor tonight I think addressing something that is of major significance, second perhaps only to what our colleague Tim Walberg and others were talking about as far as their faith issues, and that is the quality of life and the health of the citizens. 
   This, though, is not a new issue. President Clinton, when he was President of the United States, said that he had an answer to this problem, and it goes in a totally different direction that you were addressing before. His solution was larger Federal Government intrusions into this part of the economy. It's approximately what, one-fifth of the overall spending of the GDP on health care. He wanted it to be even larger and more of a centralized control, government-controlled health care, if you will, socialized health care. 
   And he told us back at that time how he intended to bring this country, that he realized after Hillary's failure to address the issue through her secretive meetings that we heard about later on, he said how can we get there. He said we can get there through a centralized, government-run health care system incrementally. First, we'll insure and control the health care for indigent children, then all children and for indigent adults, and then for all adults. So all of us eventually will come under the control of the Federal Government. 
   That means we were basically putting that very personal, that you referred to before, and you know as well from the doctor side, we all know from the patient side, the placing of doctor-patient relationship under the control of the Federal Government, bureaucrats, faceless, nameless, maybe very nice people and well-intended, but bureaucrats. 
   I scratch my head to think when people actually advocate such a government control. This is the same Federal Government that we saw handle the Katrina situation and FEMA terribly, loss of life, loss of homes 
   and what have you, that Federal Government. This is the same Federal Government during this past summer when families were trying to go on vacation and asked the Federal Government to do one of its basic functions, issue visas so families could go on family vacations. The government couldn't get the visas out the door. This is the same Federal Government that to this day we're still arguing and debating on this floor how do we close and secure our country's borders so that illegals and terrorists and drug traffickers can't come into this country. That same Federal Government can't control this, but they want to control our health care delivery system. 
   So he told us how he was going to do it, and one of the charts up that you have, I have a variation of it, but if I could just ask the gentleman from Texas to put that one chart back up with regard to the coverage. It tells us how he was going to do it, and they're now trying to do it through SCHIP. 
   By very definition, a middle-class entitlement means that you are going to be providing an entitlement, in this case, health care, for people who are making over or at the middle-class level of income and above. Well, we know that the poverty level is, for a family of four is around $42,000. I'm not sure if that's showing that on that chart, for a family of four is around $42,000. We also know that the median or the middle range of income in this country, again for a family of four in this country, is around $48,000. 
   So, by definition, if you're going to be providing a benefit to people over that level, over $48,000, then you're providing a middle-class entitlement. It's no longer talking about poor children first. I know there was another chart, benefits should go to poor children first. We're no longer talking about the indigent. We're now talking about just about everyone. 
   A family of four making over 300 percent makes around $62,000. So by definition we're saying, under the proposal that came before the House with regard to SCHIP, we want to provide benefits to a larger group of people, to a middle-class entitlement. And who is going to pay for that is the next question that should come to mind.  
   Well, the plan that is in place to pay for those various ranges, and without my far glasses it's hard to see them, says that that is going to come out of various sources, but one of the biggest sources will be smokers. And the interesting thing about this is that in order to get enough money to provide for that level of coverage, not just for the indigent anymore, but people above the 200 level of poverty, 300. As you know, in the State of New York they tried to go up to the 400 level of poverty, which means around $84,000 a year. In order to do that, they will have to look to smokers, which is fine on the one hand until you get into the weeds a little bit on this issue. And the Heritage Foundation did a little bit of study and said how many people do we have to actually have start smoking in this country in order to come up with that money, and they found out at the end of the day that we will actually be looking to find 22,000 more smokers in this country in order to fund this program. 
   Now, you are a physician and you could probably speak ad nauseam that smoking is harmful for your health, and actually it's most harmful probably for little kids more than anybody else. But in order to fund this program for the indigent poor and also for a middle-class entitlement, a government-controlled health care system, they will be looking to say we need 22,000 more children in this country in order to start smoking tomorrow so that we will have funding for this program down the road for the next few years. 
   It's an absurd situation, and it's even a little more absurd when you think about who actually does smoke in this country. This is a little bit of a sad situation. Lower income individuals smoke to a higher percentage than upper income individuals. And in fact, if you look at the numbers, it's something like this. People who make under $10,000 a year, so very low-income people, pay twice as much in taxes from smoking than people who make over $50,000 a year. 
   So what are we really saying? We're saying that we need 22,000 more kids to start smoking to pay for this program. And who are those people that are actually going to pay for it? The lowest of the low-income people who are smoking are going to pay the biggest percentage of their income towards this program. 
   It's an absurd situation to fund it, and it goes back then to the final point, and I'll close and I'll yield back to the gentleman, as I think our time is coming to a close. It's an absurd funding formula to come up with for a government-run program. And unfortunately for the advocates of the program, the money runs out. The money runs out. 
   You see on our little chart here, starting, if this program, as proposed by the other side of the aisle, Democrat side of the aisle, it would start in 2008, and there's little kids being encouraged to sign up. Indigent children are being encouraged to sign up for this program. I notice this picture does not have the children smoking. So, to be actually correct, we should have the children smoking, because they're encouraging them to smoke in order to pay for this program, but it would only last for 5 years. Then, after the 5 years, the funding is cut off almost entirely, 80 percent. That's why we have the chart go demographically down, and the kids are left hanging, in this case parachuting. 
   Why this is bad is twofold. One is because we're leading people to believe that we're actually setting up a program that's going to be paid for perpetually for the children. And two, who is this child that's now left jumping off of this cliff here? As your previous chart showed, he may very well have been a child who was already covered by your insurance. And your chart shows 55, 75, 80, 90 percent of the children had insurance prior to this program coming along, but now they were encouraged to join into this program and go into it, give up their prepaid plans under their father's programs, mother's programs, company plans, what have you. Five years from now under this program, it's designed to fail. They will jump off. They will not have anymore government program, and they also will no longer have any private insurance. 
   So we are setting up a system, encouraging kids to smoke in order to pay for it, and leading them to have to basically fall off the cliff in 5 years without having any health insurance at all. 
   At the end of the day, and I'll close on this, I commend the gentleman for leading us to look at this issue from a larger perspective, to ask a basic question. It's not so much about health insurance; it's about health care. And it's not so much of whether you have the coverage to provide you with insurance; it's whether or not you're actually going to have a doctor or a nurse out there to provide those services for you. And it's not so much as whether the government is supposedly going to do it, because we know at the end of the day they can't, by the numbers; it's whether or not at the end of the day we can come up with something to actually make sure that the patient is in control with his doctor of the delivery system and that it's the best care in order to provide the services to them, and at the end of the day the quality of life of those individuals as well. 
   I commend the gentleman from Texas for bringing this to the American public's attention tonight, and I look forward to reading more of his material, as well both on-line and in person.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. You make a perfect point. Again, it goes to what we were saying before. It doesn't matter whether you have insurance or not. It matters whether or not there is actually a doctor who will be there to take the insurance. 
   How many individuals that you know, senior citizens that you know right now that are Medicare or Medicaid, and they went out to find a doctor to treat them for their ailment, and they found out there are no longer doctors in their community who are taking Medicare or Medicaid patients. They had all the great socialized programs, coverage, that they needed. They just didn't have any doctors who would pick it up. 
   You are explaining the same thing very eloquently. The same thing will happen to these poor indigent children. We lead them down the road to believe that they actually are going to have coverage now, that think that there is going to be a doctor there to take care of them. If their reimbursement rates are anything like they are for Medicaid, there may not be a doctor there to deliver the services.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate the chairman's acceptance of the amendment. I will just spend 30 seconds just for the edification of the membership of the conference as well what the amendment does. 
   This amendment harkens back to the days when, not too long ago actually, the various Federal Government agencies, when taking part in international conferences overseas, would send upwards of 70, 80, 90, 100, over 100 members of their Departments or agencies to these various conferences, spending, obviously, an excessive amount of taxpayers' dollars. And as we've heard from both sides of the aisle in an appropriate manner, we are here to set priorities. And I agree with the effort on both sides of the aisle, and that's exactly what this amendment does. It says let's pick a reasonable number, in this case it's 50, a limitation as to the number of members of any agency to go on these international conferences. 
   This amendment has been accepted in the past, and once again I appreciate the chairman accepting this amendment. I'm not sure whether the ranking member is also in agreement with it as well. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Arizona. I support his amendment because it does bring both fairness to the American farmer and also to the American taxpayer, and it does so by dispelling certain myths that are out there. 
   This program started in 1933 as an emergency program that was supposed to be temporary. Well, 70, 80 years later and this temporary program is still with us. It started out as a program that was supposed to be for the small farmers, like we have in the State of New Jersey still, actually, and yet we find that three-quarters of the farmers are getting 10 percent of the program. The small farmers are just getting a slice of it. It is supposed to be going out for the small farmers and the farmers who are only making a small income, to help the family farm, yet we see that the average income of these farmers for the large sales are making $199,000. 
   This amendment helps to dispel the myth to make sure that we get a program that actually helps the family farmer and helps the American taxpayer at the same time. I support the amendment of the gentleman from Arizona.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate that. I will shorten my remarks to approximately 30 seconds to say, I thank the chairman for accepting the amendment. I thank the previous subcommittee chairmen as well for accepting similar which we have done in the past, which simply says to set priorities. When we have Federal agencies send Federal employees overseas for conferences, we should put a realistic limitation on it, and this one, I think, does, at 50 employees of any Federal Department or agency for any single conference occurring outside the United States. 
   Again, I appreciate the chairman's acceptance of the amendment.  
   While this is an amendment that I have proposed to other appropriations bills, I believe it is especially important that it be included on this bill. 
   Since 2000, HHS has spent over $435 million on conferences and spent $88 million just last year. Government-wide spending in those same years was over $1.5 billion. 
   In 2002 HHS spent $3.6 million to send 236 persons to the AIDS conference in Barcelona. 
   In 2004 HHS spent $500,000 to send 140 persons to the AIDS conference in Bangkok. 
   In 2005 HHS sent 300 employees to a dioxin conference in Toronto. 
   Last year the agency sent delegations of 200 or more to 54 separate conferences. 
   Many of these conferences are now covered online, allowing interested parties to attend without expensive plane tickets, meals, and hotel rooms. 
   An identical amendment was included in the House-passed version of the FY05 appropriations bill but removed in conference. I cannot help but think of the possibly tens of millions of taxpayer money that could have been saved in the past few years had this language become standard. 
   I trust that the new chairman will work to include the amendment in the conference agreement--we must inject some sense into HHS. This amendment will only limit international conferences, just a small step in reigning in an agency that seems to think its job is to talk about problems instead of working to solve them.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I will. I will just extend that 30 seconds to approximately 1 minute, though, because I just want to make a point on this amendment. 
   I very much appreciate the chairman for accepting this amendment. What this amendment does, as we have said all along, is it sets priorities, and it does on two areas that are extremely important to the Fifth Congressional District and the State of New Jersey and the entire Nation as well. And that is that we set priorities by increasing funding in two very important areas. 
   One is to the National Cancer Institute for additional cancer research by $10 million. And another area of extreme importance to the State of New Jersey for the rising number of children being born with autism, to direct an additional $10 million for research in that area as well. 
   I will just give a couple of statistics: one in 150 children, and it used to be one in around 10,000, is now diagnosed with autism. Every day 67 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which translates into a new case almost every 20 minutes. Autism is becoming the fastest-growing serious developmental disability in the United States. That was the purpose for putting that in these amendments, and I thank the chairman for agreeing with us to the importance and seeing that additional funds go to these very worthy causes.  
   Mr. Chairman, I am offering an amendment that would take $49 million from an account that was zeroed out in the President's budget request, and transfer it to two Institutes at the National Institutes of Health that I believe need additional funding--one working to fight cancer, and one working to fight autism. 
   Since President Nixon unofficially declared war on cancer in his State of the Union Address of 1971, much progress has been made in the area of cancer research. Over the past three and one-half decades, science has continued to break down barriers in the fight against this disease. Today, cancer is no longer the mystery disease that it once was, and researchers know infinitely more about the prevention, detection, and treatment of the disease than ever before. 
   All this research is beginning to bear fruit. Fewer people died from cancer in 2004 than in 2003 and the American public is witnessing declining rates for most major cancer types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. But there's much more work to be done. 
   I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for increasing the budget of the  National Cancer Institute in this year's bill. I just think that we can do a little more. And this is an obviously higher priority with far broader application to the American people. 
   We can also do a little more to fund research for a serious problem facing the country: autism. 
   According to Autism Now, the largest autism foundation in the country: 1 in 150 children is diagnosed with autism; every day 67 children are diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, which translates into a new case almost every 20 minutes; and autism is the fastest-growing serious developmental disability in the United States. 
   According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in my home State of New Jersey, the rate of new autism spectrum disorder cases is the highest in the country. One in sixty boys in New Jersey is affected. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment would also increase the budget of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke by $10 million. This Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, is the organization within the Federal Government that is primarily responsible for organizing the research into autism. 
   The account that this amendment would take from was proposed to be eliminated entirely by the administration, as it has demonstrated to be duplicative and ineffective. My amendment retains some funding in that account, but reduces it. If these appropriations bills are about priorities, I ask that we make research on cancer and autism a priority, above duplicative and ineffective programs.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (THE STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Iowa for coming to the floor and speaking on SCHIP. I was on the floor earlier this evening, as you may know, with Dr. Gingrey. We were speaking about earmarks. After us, the other side of the aisle began their talk about SCHIP. I was hoping to interject when they were on the floor but that was not possible. So I'm glad you 
   bring this issue up. 
   Let me touch on one point you are talking about. That is the cigarette tax. You made a generalized statement. Let me give you an actual number here. The SCHIP program, of course, is intended to benefit the low-income and the indigent children. The question is how is this being funded? You had correctly stated it is going to be funded by a cigarette tax. You generalized the statement that the cigarette tax generally falls disproportionately on the poor. And that actually is correct. 
   A study was done in 1990. It said that people who made under $10,000 per year paid almost twice as much in cigarette taxes as those who made $50,000 and above. So there is the irony. We are trying to provide a health care program for the poor. And on whose back is it going to be placed? It is going to be placed and paid for by those very same poor people who are paying a substantially higher cigarette tax. 
   The study goes on to say that there are other adverse impacts to raising the cigarette tax. One of them you wouldn't necessarily think of. But when you raise the taxes that high, much higher, a higher Federal cigarette tax, the study says, will lead to more violent crime. The foundation's chief economist has documented that higher cigarette taxes fuel black-market activity, including truck hijackings and other armed robberies. In 2003 he said, for example, 200 cases of cigarettes in a modest-sized transport truck would have a retail value in New York City of around $1 million and  would be a tempting market for thieves. So these are the side issues you don't hear about when you hear the bumper sticker rhetoric from the other side. 
   The other thing that you don't hear from, and I will yield back at any moment if the gentleman has a point to make here I see with his signs or charts. Another interesting point is the need for the overall program. I don't want to get bogged down in numbers and you are better facilitated with the charts there. But let's take a look at where we have been over the last 20 years when we talk about children in need. In 1987, now look at 1997 and 2002. In 1987, child poverty rate in this country was 18.7 percent. The eligible children who were eligible for programs, at that time, 20.3 percent. So just about the same numbers who were eligible for some sort of a government program such as Medicaid were at the same approximate number who were in the child poverty rate. In 1996, you go ahead about 10 years, those numbers now are about 20 percent in the poverty level, 28 percent eligibility, that means we have now reached a point where more kids were eligible for government assistance than were actually classified as childhood poverty. Flash ahead now to 2002, the rate now of overall childhood poverty rate, 16.7 percent, eligibility though for government assistance and Medicaid and the like, government health insurance, 47.1 percent. We have gotten to the point where almost half of the kids in this country are now entitled to welfare payments. 
   You had on your other chart when I came in here a neat little acronym for what SCHIP was. We have to call it what it really is. H.R. 976, SCHIP expansion, Socialized Clinton-style Hillary-care for Illegals and Their Parents, SCHIP. Well, that's true. And another way of calling it is welfare. We have gotten to the point where almost half the kids in this country are now eligible for Hillary-care, welfare, whereas the poverty rate for these children has actually decreased during that period of time to around 16.7 percent. 
   We have gone in the right direction in this country as far as reducing the number of all kids who are in poverty, but we have vastly exceeded what the actual need is.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. That is absolutely consistent with my recollection. 
   Another aspect of it was at the time that the master plan as you described it at that time was to be more, was to be broader than what eventually transpired, and that was to include the block grant type arrangement for Medicaid, as well. Had we done that, we would not be in this budgetary crisis that we find right now where Medicaid has continued to have gone up, and the States actually would have been in a better situation than they are right now. Just as with Medicare, just as with the welfare reform movement, when the States were issued a block grant and given the significant flexibility that they had with the set dollar amount, the States were able to use the ingenuity of their States to actually decrease the enrollment of their welfare recipients and at the same time actually since the dollar limit remained the same, the per capita number per recipient actually went up. So those individuals who had the most need, if you will, had the most difficulty climbing out of their condition and their plight that they were in, you had a larger dollar value that you are able to apply to their particular condition.     
   Had we done the same thing as this Republican Congress at the time intended to, but we were stopped, as you recall; President Clinton put up the roadblock to it. We could have done the exact same thing with Medicaid, done it in a flexible block grant arrangement to the 50 States. The Governors of those States would have no strings attached to it whatsoever. They could have decided who and how they were going to get into it. You could have had an SCHIP-type arrangement where you allowed them to go into privatized health insurance programs. The benefit there would of course be, just as a side issue, that you would not be squeezing out the private sector marketplace. You would be opening up and creating greater competition and you would not be having this dilemma that we are facing right now. That was all the possibilities we had back in 1996. We lost it at that time because of President Clinton and what he was trying to do.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Well, New Jersey, as you may know, has not gone up to the 400. New York is, I think, the only State that as of current law, not the bill just approved by the House, under current law, New York has attempted to go up to 400 percent. New Jersey is at 350 percent, which puts us at around, for a family of four, $72,000. Now the median income is around $61,000 or $62,000 for the State of New Jersey, which means you're at the average.  
   Mr. Speaker, so what are we saying here? We are saying that even those who are above average in income are now going to eligible for socialized welfare payments. Once a month they will get a welfare payment. It won't be in the form of a check, like a normal welfare payment coming to you to cash. Instead, it will be delivered directly to the insurance company, or other method. 
   What that means is this. For every ten people that you wish to enroll under the plan under the Pelosi method, approximately six those people will already have insurance. So in that last chart you would say up in the $103,000 range. Every ten new children that you bring into the program, these six over here already had insurance. You're only adding these four children over here. But you're doing it at a tremendous cost. You're using taxpayers' dollars now to pay for those children who maybe their parents are making $103,000. 
   Wouldn't it be so much better if those tax dollars were going to try to find a way to make sure that these four kids had all the, not only insurance, but also the actual health care, which is a question that I think you were bringing up before, because at the end of the day that is really what we should be focused on, making sure those kids have health care. Because it does those four kid absolutely no good just to make sure that they have insurance if they can't find a doctor to treat them. 
   How many people do you know of, senior citizens who have Medicare and go out and try to find a doctor to accept their Medicare payments, and they find out there's no Medicare doctors receiving Medicare recipients. How many people do you know that are on Medicaid right now, which is an insurance policy, and try to go out and find a doctor who says they are still taking Medicaid patients, and they are not taking them. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have done nothing if we simply have insured four new children under this SCHIP program if it's set up in such a manner that there is nothing else to facilitate more doctors to be out there to actually get care. We have done nothing to improve the health care coverage, all we've done is a sound bite for the Democrats, saying we improved insurance coverage.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Just one point on this issue of freedom and the opportunities that come from it and therefore the incentives that also lead to it. 
   We spoke just a moment ago with regard to the 1996 welfare reform package. Back when that was done, one thing that did impact the Medicaid program was a change to who was entitled to benefits. So in the 1996 Medicaid reform, they eliminated Medicaid benefits for noncitizen immigrants. Noncitizen immigrants. That means someone in the country legally, not illegal immigrants, but people in this country legally, so they are non-citizens and immigrants, they were eliminated from getting Medicaid coverage. 
   Now, the critics of the proposal you may recall at that time said wait, wait, wait. If we are going to take this class of people who are otherwise eligible economically income-wise out of the pool that are eligible for Medicaid, we know what is going to happen. Their health condition is going to deteriorate, and, as importantly, their coverage level is going to go down. 
   But you know what? For just the point you were saying, the increase in freedom, that did not occur. There was now a new incentive. Since they were not eligible to get Medicaid anymore, there was an incentive to do just what you say, to go out work, either get a job that had health insurance provided for it, or, if not, get a job that paid enough that they were able to buy insurance or do something to the health insurance. 
   So the result of that group being excluded from Medicaid coverage at that time, from 1996 forward, was an increase in insurance coverage for that class of individuals. 
   That is what we learned from expanding freedom, expanding opportunity, providing an incentive, as opposed to what is in the socialized Clinton-style health care for illegals and their parents SCHIP plan, is a disincentive and  a phasing out and pushing out for the opportunities for individuals.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I should point out that the dependency and the loss of freedom is not only for the individual, it is for the State, too. What CHIP does is create an incentive for States to add more people onto the program since there is a 3 to 1 ratio as far as the dollars. The State spends $1, and they get basically a 3 to 1 ratio in dollars from the Federal Government. 
   That means that the State is no longer incentivized to do other creative things to actually improve the health of the kids in the State, just so they can turn around and say we are getting Federal dollars to put the kids on health insurance. So not only do we disincentivize or take away incentives from individuals, we take away incentives from the States to do the right things for themselves. We see it in New Jersey. I am sure you see it in your State.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   I want to begin by just complimenting one, two, three people. First of all, compliment Dr. Gingrey for having this session here on the floor tonight to bring this very important subject once again to the well so that we can have this debate, have this dialogue to address an issue that the American public is rightfully concerned about. 
   Secondly, and I'm sure Dr. Gingrey will agree with this, we should always applaud the gentleman from Arizona, Jeff Flake, who has been, let us say, the ``voice in the wilderness,'' if you will, for a number of years when it came to earmarks coming to the floor, repeatedly, time and time again, before you and I were even in Congress, bringing this to the attention of the Members from both sides of the aisle, trying to shine that light of day. Unfortunately, the process was not such that the information was going out. He did it sporadically, at best, because he had to literally go through the bills page by page to try to gather the information. And when he did, he would gather those infamous examples that he would then bring to the floor, outrageous examples, and try to get a majority of Members of either side of the House to support him in deleting those egregious earmarks. Unfortunately, in nine out of 10, actually, it's probably more like 99 out of 100 examples, he didn't get the support that he deserved. 
   And the third group of individuals that I think we should applaud is the American public, because they have been rightfully outraged from the very start, as soon as the information began to come out of this House, as to where their tax dollars are going. The American public saw that their hard-earned tax dollars that they work every week and send in their taxes to the Federal Government, to Washington, D.C., are going to absurd things: the rain forest in the central United States or ``bridges to nowhere'' and that sort of thing. It is only, I think, because their outrage has gotten to such an extent that Congress, especially from the other side of the aisle, the Democrat majority, is finally beginning to listen. And you and I also agree that they have not quite listened well enough because they have not brought through the sunshine and the adequacy of information that you and I would like to see and that the American public would like to see. 
   So I just want to start off by saying, let's applaud those and give credit, yourself and Jeff Flake and the American public, where credit is due. 
   I know you're about to talk about your proposal, so maybe I will cut my comments to a couple here because I would like to maybe discuss your proposal in detail so we can flush it out. But let me just raise this one point, and I think this is probably a good segue for where you're going to go into this. 
   When it comes to earmarks, when you think about earmarks, it is right to say that they are really a very small part of the overall expenditure of the  Federal Government. Unfortunately, I think some Members and lobbyists also spend, unfortunately, a disproportionate amount of their energy and time attaining those earmarks. I don't think that's why they sent us to Washington, to spend so much of our time trying to slice out a small percentage of the budget to bring back home. 
   We know that some Members probably spend more of their time than others. We also know that some Members have been more successful than others in bringing home those earmark dollars in perhaps a way that some would argue is not the most equitable and fair way. And I think that's what your bill will get to, to provide a more equitable and fair distribution of dollars.     
   How is the money being spent right now? Well, I understand that the average House Republican receives approximately $8.7 million on average in earmarks. I think that is an average as far as described as being a mean, or median, as opposed to a mode, when it comes to averages because some of them are considerably less and some of them have considerably more. The average Democrat, though, remember the Republican is $8.7 million, the average Democrat receives $10.3 million in earmark funds. And you have to scratch your head and think, where is the fairness there? Just because someone lives in a Democrat district, he may be a Democrat himself or he may be a Republican, is he more worthy? Did he pay more taxes that he is going to get more dollars coming into his district? Conversely, just because someone lives in a Republican district and he may well be a Democrat, as well, why is he being shortchanged? He is receiving on average a couple million dollars less. 
   Now, I said a moment ago those are averages. Some are lower. I don't know where you or I stand on those numbers. But some are considerably higher than that. The Speaker received some $67 million in earmarks in the last go around, and then there, of course, is the very cream of the crop, the very top, appropriations cardinal, Congressman Murtha, topped the list at over $179 million in earmarks to his district. $166 million were in defense earmarks. Someone suggested that when you are collecting and spending $166 million, you are no longer just a congressman, you are now a CEO of a mid-sized company at that point. Of course, the interesting thing there is you are a CEO of a mid-sized company that has been bankrolled by the taxpayers of the country. That is something that we should focus the light of day on: Why are some people being treated better than others just by who they are, what positions they hold and what ranking positions they have in various committees. 
   I think your legislation will possibly try to address those issues. And if it does, and as I understand it does adequately, it will go a long way to providing the equity and fairness that the American public has been seeking and has been outraged that we have not been providing them in the past. 
   I would like to touch on some other points as far as really the scope of where earmarks go and some of the other things we may need to do, but I think this is a great segue into what your bill is able to address, and I yield back to gentleman at this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I sit here, and here we are in October, the question that always first comes to my mind is 10 months into the 110th Congress under now the new Democratic control, and what has that 10 months wrought: the largest tax increase in U.S. history, the creation of a budget by them with slush funds where there's no accountability; and, finally, the lack of transparency that was promised to us. That last point I think is what Dr. Gingrey is talking about here this evening. I am glad to join him to illuminate that issue a little bit more, the lack of transparency. 
   The Democrats ran the election of last year saying that there was not enough transparency and openness in the prior Congresses and that if they were elected and put in a position of power, they would bring that transparency, the openness, the sunshine, if  you will, to this floor. That is what they campaigned on. That is even, as Dr. Gingrey says here with the charts, the quotes from Speaker Pelosi, what they promised even after they came into a position of power. Of course that has not occurred. 
   Mr. Speaker, some who may be listening to us here right now say why didn't the Republicans do this when they were in charge? The fact of the matter is, as you may recall, we did. We did pass legislation in the 109th Congress to bring transparency to reform the earmark process. Unfortunately, not all those reforms were carried over with us into the new 110th Congress, and, I should add, some of the changes that have occurred in the 110th Congress only came about because of people like Dr. Gingrey, Jeff Flake, and other people, Jeb Hensarling from the RNC, coming to the floor and compelling and forcing the additional reforms that we have seen so far in this 110th Congress. 
   Let me just make this point. In earmarks right now, and it only applies basically to appropriation bills, which of course you have already spoken as far as the discharge petition, but in the rules of the House right now you would think that the American public would have the information now at hand that they have been asking for all along: Who's sponsoring the earmark, what the earmark is for, and how much money that earmark is allocating. You would think that is the case because that is the reform we compel the other side of the aisle to implement. 
   Well, they passed the rule, but they are not implementing the rule. What they did was quite clever. You take a piece of legislation that can be literally this thick, as far as a bill is concerned, an appropriation bill, or even thicker than this as well, and that information is in here, who sponsored it, how much it's for, and what the project is, but it's not in one place. Instead what they did was put it in two places. So you go to one page where it has the sponsor's name and the project, then you go 100 pages later on and there will be the project and the amount. 
   Now you have to search through literally thousands of pages, thousands of lines, and to put the two together to find out that, well, Congressman Murtha, for example, had this particular project in his district. You have to spend literally hours and hours and days and days to put it together to get that number that we gave before, $166 million in Defense Appropriations. 
   I commend ``Congressional Quarterly'', because that magazine did spend the time to put together that data and has published the report, and it was an outside organization that actually did much of the spreadsheets on that. Finally, the American taxpayer has that information, no thanks to the other side of the aisle, because they put it together in a convoluted and basically in an orchestrated manner to make sure that the information they were required to reveal to the American public was presented in a way that you could not see it. 
   The proposal that you are presenting to us tonight is a good one. I believe it is a step in the right direction, and I think the gentleman from Georgia would agree that it is a step in the right direction, and that we can even eventually, if we can get this step done, we can go even further, as you illustrated, to get even more information and to rein this in even further.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Just a point that comes to mind. One of the issues that we will be dealing with this week is SCHIP. There is a piece of legislation you wouldn't think would be prone to earmarks. If you listen to the other side, they would tell you, hey, there are no earmarks in there. 
   That is one of the peculiarities of the rule, the way the Democrats have written it as far as providing transparency. All you have to do is take your bill, that could be chockfull with all of your favorite pet earmarks from the cardinals and the chairmen of your committees and all your other friends, and the ones requested by lobbyists and what have you, and all the Democratic majority has to do is say, we hereby say there are no earmarks in here, and that is it. You and I can come to the floor and rail about it all we want and say, yes, there are. Look at page 72, line B. Here is an earmark. 
   That is exactly what happened with the SCHIP legislation. They said there are no earmarks here. Lo and behold, there are. There are literally billions of dollars in earmarks in that going to special projects and special hospitals across the country, and you and I would not know about it if we were just to trust them and take them at their word.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. None of these things, as good as all these ideas are, are going to happen unless the majority party, the Democrat Party, Speaker Pelosi agrees they are actually the right thing to do and are willing to move the legislation. 
   Your bill that would move in the direction that the American public wants us to move, to rein in excessive spending, to rein in earmarks, to put a clamp or a lid on them, to move in the direction of moving them out entirely  or at least scaling them down, will not move unless the Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, says that is a good idea and she will post the bill. 
   The legislation that you spoke about at the top of hour regarding the discharge petition that the Republican leader has that would expand earmark information to not just appropriation bills but also to authorizing legislation, to clean up some of the areas that have given them the latitude to actually continue to hide this information from the American public. That piece of legislation will not move unless the Democrat Party and Speaker Pelosi finally hear from the American public and realize this is what the American public wants us to do and wants us to move that legislation. 
   It is still early in the evening. It is only a quarter of 9. I am sure Speaker Pelosi is in her office or somewhere in the Capitol as we speak. I would invite her to come to the floor right now and join us with either one of those pieces of legislation. Maybe you could recite the words right back to her that she said some time ago, and remind her of what she said when it comes to the issue of giving transparency and openness. I would invite her to come to the floor and join us in this debate this evening, to say she will move these, will move these things in the next days, weeks. Just before the winter holiday so when we leave here in the next several weeks or months, they, we can say in the first session of the 110th Congress we finally gave the American public what they were promised when the Democrat majority came into Congress. I will eagerly await her arrival here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman. 
   I, too, rise today in support of H.R. 323, the Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act of 2007, legislation which seeks to reduce the regulatory burden caused by the previous Bank Secrecy Act and does so by simplifying exemptions for financial institutions, banks, for example, in their currency transaction reports, their CTRs, on seasoned customers. 
   You know, while well-intentioned CTRs have imposed a tremendous regulatory burden on financial institutions without a corresponding increase in benefit to our efforts to thwart terrorist attacks, for the most part law enforcement agencies have found these reports to be largely useless in the prevention of crimes and terrorist attacks, while banks have found the filing costs and regulatory burden they create enormous. 
   Currency transaction reports were created to follow any large transaction through the banking industry to catch money laundering before it became a fait accompli, but the provision that created them is now outdated. What was considered a large amount of money back in 1970 is hardly so today; in fact, the threshold for filing a CTR is $10,000, which in today's term is close to $50,000. 
   So with the provisions caught in time, banks are now locked in a situation by which they are filing CTRs for many everyday transactions; and because of the frequency of these filings, paper overflows and the actual tracking of criminal activity is severely hampered. Potentially criminal transactions that should be setting all alarms with the banks and law enforcement agencies are drowned out in a sea of paperwork. 
   This legislation then is a good start towards helping reduce regulatory burdens on our Nation's banks and financial institutions, and I therefore encourage all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, before I begin to set forth my opposition to this piece of legislation, let me refer back to the comments made by the previous speaker, which looked back over 150 years to try to find a case to provide some substantiation for their argument, and they did so by finding a case with regard to judicial intervention. 
   In that case they cited that the Supreme Court held that this Congress could allow or broaden the judicial authority, if you will, of the Federal courts. I think their example, in essence, proves too much. You cannot simply take one sentence or two sentences out of the U.S. Constitution and draw a conclusion from that. What you have to do is read the entirety of the Constitution. 
   If you had done that, you would realize that the courts have always held, and the Founders' intent always was, that this body, this House, and this Congress has broad latitude when it comes to judicial issues and reining in the Federal courts or expanding their authority of jurisdiction. And that is all that that Supreme Court case was doing. It was not addressing the issue of infringing upon the rights of other citizens by what is occurring here today by granting more authority to other States as far as voting is concerned. 
   More to the point on this legislation. As I said before, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation because it is, A, unconstitutional, and, B, unfair. It violates the Constitution and the very fundamental intent of the Founding Fathers of this country and the Framers of the Constitution. It would give the District, which is by no definition a State, a vote in this House and simultaneously the citizens of another State two Representatives, which is unfair to the State of New Jersey and all States in this country. 
   Furthermore, by allowing, unfairly, the District of Columbia to have their  own Representative and also a Delegate, they will have unfair representation. 
   Our Founding Fathers understood and deliberately set aside a non-State section of land for our Federal Government and granted voting rights only, only, to State residents. They did this for a simple reason: They wanted to ensure that each State had equal representation, and they realized that putting the Federal Government in a State would have given that State unfair representation, an unfair advantage. H.R. 1905 does not line up with the Founders' intent. 
   If the supporters of H.R. 1905 wanted the people of D.C. to be represented in Congress, they simply could have solved that problem by retroceding, by giving back part of the District of Columbia to Maryland. 
   There is precedent for this, as stated. In 1846, Congress took that perfectly legal step of returning present-day Arlington to the State of Virginia. Couldn't we pass similar legislation like that right now and solve this problem? 
   Unfortunately, the majority, who claimed just a few months ago that they would have an open process for amendment legislation, has left us with only two choices, an unfair and unconstitutional choice before this House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor having always had an open mind with regard to this whole auto situation, and how we make sure the United States stays strong as a manufacturing country. 
   The chairman of the Financial Service Committee talks about having to move this along very quickly. But oddly enough, it was just last week, I believe, when he was asked by reporters on this and he said, you know, these deadlines that are being imposed are really artificial deadlines. And referring back to the TARP situation, he said, in that situation, even though the deadlines may pass, the sun still did come up the next day. And yet these are deadlines we're facing. And I think what we would ask to look at is how is Congress operating. 
   Let me give you a couple of examples. In July of this year, I think it was, we passed several hundred billion dollars for a housing bailout, and then, after that, we had some hearings on it on how we're going to spend the money. 
   This fall we passed a $700 billion TARP program to bail out the financial industry. That started out as two or three pages. It grew to several hundred pages. It was only today that we finally had a hearing on the oversight, again, on seeing how that money was about to be spent, lambasting the administration for not doing enough. 
   It was just yesterday, for the first time, that we basically had hearings on the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Again, the government bailed them out to the tune of several hundred billion dollars. Months later we had hearings on it. 
   What is the trend here? The way the Federal Government seems to operate is we appropriate, we spend hundreds of billions of dollars, then after the fact we come back and say, gee, what exactly did we do? 
   I think our side of the aisle is saying, let's take it down a little bit, work a little bit slower, and make sure what we do is appropriate. 
   You know, Steve Moore from the Wall Street Journal did an unscientific little survey. He walked around the Hill and the parking lots in the Hill, and he looked at the cars that the Members of Congress operate. You know what he found out? Two-thirds of those cars are foreign cars, not American cars. So it's interesting that we come to the floor here today and we ask to spend taxpayers' dollars on these cars when the members of their own party----

It doesn't matter which line you take it out of the Federal budget, at the end of the day it all comes out of the taxpayers' pockets. And I encourage us to take a moment to make sure that we do it in an effective way that actually gets the job done, gets the restructuring of the industry and does not put the American taxpayer on the hook.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, earlier we heard from the other side of the aisle that President Kennedy once said: ``To govern is to choose.'' Well, so it is, and we have seen how the Democrat majority of this House has decided to choose when it comes to the issue of tax and spend. They always choose tax. 
   In the very opening comments from the Democrat chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he said that one of the options they could have considered was cutting spending in the United States Government for once, but they immediately dismissed that, saying that that was simply politically undoable for the Democrat Caucus. 
   So instead what they do they do? They raise taxes. Their proposal, they say, is to tax the rich. But really what they are saying is try to rob Peter to pay Paul and then go and try to convince Paul that Peter is paying and convince Peter that Paul is paying. But the American taxpayer knows that all of middle-class America will be paying for this tax increase. 
   This tax increase, a $76 billion tax increase over 10 years, follows a litany of other tax increases. I was on the floor last night and I went through about a dozen Democrat bills which, combined, totaled about $110 billion in tax increases on top of the largest tax increase in their budget. Vote ``no'' on this.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I have heard someone say, appropriately so, once they saw the Democrats' budget plan, ``Be afraid. Be very much afraid.'' And the reason they said that was because they were looking at one of the points that have already been raised here, and that is the Democrats' largest tax increase in U.S. history. As people have already noted, a $392 billion increase in taxes on American families. That certainly is reason alone to be afraid of this budget and what it will mean to the American taxpayer. 
   But mind you, the Democrats don't stop there. After they raise your taxes once, they are going to be coming after you a second time. And they do that in the form of trying to fill the so-called ``tax gap.'' 
   What is the tax gap? The tax gap is their position of how they fill up any shortage in their funding by going after people who are not adequately paying their current tax amount. 
   I think the average American would say that we are already paying far too much in taxes. I think if you ask the average American, they would tell you that they are already paying their fair share. But the Democrats are saying that in addition to the $392 billion in additional taxes that American families are going to pay, they are going to go after you one more time. 
   Right now, 86 percent of Americans, according to the IRS, are paying their fair share and paying at the respective time. The Democrats are saying that they are going to go for another around $300 billion from Americans. Now, in committee, what they said they were going to do is go after those egregious loopholes in corporations and the like. I think Members on both sides of the aisle would agree that we should try to close those loopholes and go after corporations who are not paying their taxes.     
   But do you know what? In the testimony before our committee, the IRS Commissioner told us that when he goes after corporations, that is only about 10 percent of all the outstanding taxes that are out there. That means one thin dime on the dollar is maybe available. 
   I pointed out to you already that they want to get another $300 billion from you and I from this so-called tax gap. What does the IRS say about that? They say the most realistic figure they could come up with is around $20 billion. And not just in one year. It would take about 5 years in order to achieve that $20 billion. 
   So what does it come down to? It comes down to that the Democrats are raising your taxes on one hand and going with the other hand one more time at you to try to fill that tax gap. What does that mean to the average family, you and I? 
   Well, yes, they will tell you they are going to go after the bad guy out there who is not paying his taxes, but, in order to do it, they are going to have to change the Tax Code, strengthen the IRS, put more agents out there. 
   As a matter of fact, again, the IRS Commissioner came and testified before the committee. He said, in order to achieve even a part of what the Democrats want to do, they are going to have to impose draconian changes to the Tax Code. That means you put in a 1099 to pay your niece when she babysits or pay your neighbor when he mows the law. Draconian effects, added to this tax increase is what the Democrats would cost the American family.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (RETURN SOVEREIGNTY BACK TO THE STATES, THE SCHOOL BOARD, AND THE PARENTS -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, with the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind before us this  year, we all have an obligation to consider reforms that both further education policy, and also maintain consistency with our constitutional duties. 
   The Federal Government began its interference, if you will, in education through land grants, and over time has transformed into a bureaucracy that we see today. I would like to highlight some of the serious flaws in this tangled web we have weaved and pose a question to my colleagues and our constituents as well. Are we better off today with the Federal Government's involvement in education as it has been over the years? 
   Since 1965, American taxpayers have invested more than $778 billion on Federal programs for elementary and secondary education. The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, reported in 1994 that 13,400 Federally funded full-time employees in State education agencies work to implement Federal education programs. That is three times the number then working at the Department of Education. 
   The same report found that state education agencies are forced to reserve a far greater share of Federal and State funds for State-level use by a ratio of 4-1, due to the administrative and regulatory burden of Federal programs. And because it cost so much to allocate a Federal dollar than a State dollar, 41 percent of financial support and staffing of State education agencies was a product of Federal dollars and regulations. In other words, the Federal Government was the cause of 41 percent of the administrative burden at the State level, despite providing just 7 percent of overall education funding. 
   Again, according to the GAO, the testing requirements alone for No Child Left Behind will cost the States about $1.9 billion between 2002 and 2008. And that is if the State uses only multiple choice questions that can be scored in machines, as opposed to essays and what have you. 
   According to the Office of Management and Budget, No Child Left Behind increased State and local governments' annual paperwork burden by 6,680,334 hours at an estimated cost of $141 million. So while No Child Left Behind advertises that it helps to attract and maintain highly qualified teachers, some States, in fact, have now responded to it by actually lowering their testing requirements for new teachers. 
   Since the law enactment, Pennsylvania has dropped its testing after finding that too many middle school teachers had failed the test. In Maryland, New Hampshire and Virginia, they have made their basic skills test for teachers easier to pass now than before we had No Child Left Behind. 
   In Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Nevada and West Virginia, they, too, have lowered their requirements for teachers trained out of state. So what is happening is as State officials become more familiar with the No Child Left Behind statute and with U.S. Department of Education's interpretation of it, more States have rushed to lower their own standards. So by September 2004, 47 States had filed requests with the U.S. Department of Education to approve changes to their No Child Left Behind plans that would, in many cases, make it easier for them to show adequate yearly progress than before. 
   Now, to address all this, in the near future, I will come back to the floor as I will be introducing legislation that will immediately cut both the financial and the regulatory strings between the Federal Government and the States that choose to opt out and relieve the Federal education system. 
   How it will work is this: Under my proposal, States that elect to opt out of the Federal education funding system would be eligible to keep their own money, keep it in their own States through a mechanism, a Federal tax credit. It would be a refundable Federal tax credit, and it would be available to all the residents in that State that chose to opt out. Therefore, what we have here is not only would that State free itself up from the education regulations and all the costs I have just laid out here, but by taking this deduction, those residents in those States won't have to be taking money out of their pocket, sending it to Washington, Washington handling it for a while, and some of it coming back to their States. In effect, what will happen is you will not have to send your money to Washington at all. 
   But the bottom line is this: We should not waste this unique opportunity that we have now, now that No Child Left Behind is coming up for reauthorization. We should use this as an opportunity to return sovereignty back to the States, and most importantly, back to the parents themselves. 
   So Mr. Speaker, I will close on this to say I look forward to the time when all education decisions are returned back to the States, to the legislatures, to the local school board, and most importantly, to the parents themselves.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (BUDGET SCHOOL -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. And I thank the gentlelady from Tennessee for all of your work on this matter and others as well, shining the light of day on the budget process here in the House under Democrat control of this legislature. 
   That last point, under Democrat control, here we find ourselves 15 months into the 110th Congress under a new Democrat majority in this House, and we have to ask that basic question, What has that Democrat control of 15 months brought? Well, in outside groups in the media, it has been reported this has been one of the most inefficient and ineffective Congresses in passing legislation out of the House and making it to the President's desk and getting it signed, in most people's memory. And that is a bad thing when it comes to trying to solve the problems that are addressing America's families and America's pocketbook as well. 
   I would like to spend my couple of minutes personalizing this budget process from the great State of New Jersey and other residents of my State as well and how it impacts upon them. 
   New Jerseyans are already overtaxed. Just recently, the legislature in Trenton, the State capital, raised taxes. They raised the sales tax, they raised corporate taxes, they raised user fees and what have you. And now there is talk about, in our State, maybe doubling or tripling the tolls on the road, and not to speak, of course, about property taxes which are going through the roof in our State. So New Jersey families are already taxed. 
   What do we see here in the Congress under Democrat control with the budget that they have passed through this House? Well, for New Jerseyans it would amount to around $3,700 increase, a $3,700 increase in taxes on the American family or the New Jersey family. More of their hard-earned money being taken from them and sent to Washington. 
   And what else? Well, another independent analysis, this one done by the Heritage Foundation, shows that folks in my district, the Fifth District in New Jersey, which my district represents, they would lose upwards to 2,000 jobs. So mind you, the budget that the Democrats have passed would do two things: raise our taxes in my State by around $3,700 for the average family, and we would lose 2,000 jobs. All a bad thing now under the Democrat's Congress. 
   So while it may have been one of the most ineffective and inefficient Congresses under the Democrat leadership, they are doing some things all bad. 
   Let me take a moment, if I may, to address three points that went through the budgetary process when the bills came through the committee. 
   If you hadn't been turned on C-SPAN from 10:30 in the morning when the bills came through with the Budget Committee initially until around 1 o'clock the next morning when the bill finally came out, you may have missed exactly what the Budget Committee did under the leadership of the Democrat Conference. 
   Let me touch upon three of them. Democrats proposed their budget. Republicans tried to take a bad bill and tried to make it better with a number of amendments, and I will go through very quickly, if I may, three of those amendments. In each instance, when we took our amendments and said, Here is an idea that maybe would make your bill a little bit better, they voted  unanimously, and it shows the bipartisanship is not there in that committee, unanimously against our ideas. 
   First idea. AMT, alternative minimum tax. We suggested that this very harsh tax should be repealed. Remember, it was the AMT started under 1969 under a Democrat Congress, in the 1990s under a Democrat President, Bill Clinton. We Republicans tried to repeal it. He said no. Now we said we have to get rid of this unfair tax that in just a couple of years from now, around 34 million American families would see their taxes go up incredibly. They said ``no'' to our amendment. 
   Secondly, again, Democrats unanimously voted against another amendment that we suggested to their bill with regard to earmarks. We all have problems with earmarks. It made the news heavily in the last months, what have you. We see the waste, fraud, and abuse there. We suggested we could save a billion dollars in earmarks and let's appropriate it over to veterans and for their good causes. That was our amendment. They voted unanimously to oppose it. 
   And finally in the area of Social Security. You would think here is one area that there would be bipartisanship, that they would reach across the aisle and try to get something done. Again, no go. Earmarks, again, was the basis of our areas that we thought we could save some money. There was so much waste, fraud, and abuse with their earmarks. We said, Let's save some of the money there. Let's make sure that Social Security is here for seniors today and for the next generation and next generation. Let's stop robbing from the Social Security trust fund. We put in an amendment to do that. What do the Democrats do once again? Unanimously they voted against that amendment as well. 
   The amendments all went down. The bill passed as the Democrats initially proposed it, in essence, and that bill, of course, is bad for my constituents, bad for New Jerseyans as we will be losing jobs, seeing our taxes go up. 
   So, again, I close where I began, commending the lady for bringing this information to the American public as we work together to make it a better situation. 
   Thank you.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (CALLING ON UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL TO CHARGE IRANIAN PRESIDENT WITH CERTAIN VIOLATIONS BECAUSE OF HIS CALLS FOR DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of to day's resolution which calls for the United Nations to take action to uphold one of its most important conventions--the Convention of Genocide. With the violence of the Holocaust just a few years behind them, the members of the United Nations in 1948 established a convention to prevent such atrocities from ever happening again. 
   There is much talk at the UN about preventing war and genocide but unfortunately there is little action. The Iranian President has called for a UN member nation to be ``wiped off the map.'' Do we have any doubt that the UN would sanction the Israeli Prime Minister if the positions were reversed? 
   The Iranian president and the Ayatollahs' supreme wish is the destruction of Israel and all her people. They have not tried to mask this goal--they doubt the holocaust of the past and make plans for a holocaust of the future. 
   Ahmadinejad has even gone as far as speculating that the collateral damage of attacking Israel with nuclear weapons would be worth the cost to the Muslim world. For a regime that is developing nuclear capabilities, these are truly dangerous words. In the 1930's fascist dictators made bold claims of impending violence and we ignored them to our own peril. 
   The world should not ignore these words of aggression. Today, we call on UN member nations to call out Ahmadinejad, to condemn these statements, and to work together to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply disappointed in today's rule that barred the House from considering a common-sense amendment that I brought to the committee. 
   The text of my amendment was substantially from H.R. 1544, the Faster and Smarter Funding for First Responders Act of 2005, which passed the House by an overwhelming, bipartisan majority in the 109th Congress. 
   One of the 9/11 Commission's primary recommendations was to ensure that all federal government grants for homeland security be allotted by risk and need. To this day, however, nearly 40 percent of all grants are handed out merely by virtue of their location. The House has time and time again passed legislation to streamline the grant process and reduce the mandatory minimum percentage given to each state. 
   While the House did pass such language in H.R. 1, the Senate had yet to take up this legislation. Until the President signs into law legislation correcting this oversight, we should not pass up an opportunity to make our nation more secure. But that is what the Democrats are doing today. We must reiterate this critical policy change at each and every opportunity. 
   The constituents of the fifth district of New Jersey know too well the repercussions of failing to provide for strong homeland security. Many of them lost loved ones on 9/11 and they expect our country to prepare for any such future disaster. As long as grants continue to go to low-priority wasteful projects, our most at-risk citizens will be vulnerable.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, the authors of this resolution say that we should provide our troops with all the resources they need, whether it be armor, bullets and Humvees. That is, all the resources they need, except two; and I would argue they are the two most critically important ones: manpower and the support of our national leaders. 
   This Democratic resolution can be summed up in three simple words, to ``stay the course.'' The irony here is inescapable. Just months ago the very same supporters of this resolution derided the Pentagon and the White House for proposing to stay the course, but today they bring exactly that same strategy to life in their resolution. 
   This resolution doesn't propose a new course of action. It doesn't have the courage of its author's rhetoric, convictions, to change the course of the war. It simply states that this Congress will not support the new approach proposed by our new commander and the Iraq Study Group. 
   General Petraeus, the chief architect of this new plan, was confirmed unanimously by the Senate, and yet many in that body and this body are adamantly opposed to this very strategy he now seeks to implement. So it begs the question: If the general is the right man for the job, then why is his plan now not appropriate? 
   They claim to support the troops but seek to undercut their new leader's strategy. How can we support the troops when we insist that their orders are faulty? We cannot praise the general out of one side of our mouth while mocking him out of the other. 
   We have heard it said that this resolution calls for a new direction in Iraq. But I defy those who say this, to say what that new direction is. It is certainly not apparent in this resolution. This resolution is only an empty opposition to the Commander in Chief's plan to deploy the Armed Forces as the generals on the field see fit. 
   This two-sentence resolution, sense of Congress, is not a new plan for victory. In fact, it is not even a new plan for bringing the troops home now, but to leave them in the field with under-manpower. It is little more than a gift to our enemies who have been patiently awaiting the American naysayers to erode the American confidence in our mission. 
   Our enemies do not lack morale, and we fuel their exuberance with this drive for success every time they hear us speculate on withdrawal. Our enemies are fighting us, against us and our servicemen and our allies, with the belief that each headline brings them closer to victory. 
   Our brave men and women in uniform are up to the task. But they need our support, not empty proposals that doubt their ability to secure the peace. 
   Millions of peaceful Iraqis are struggling to rebuild their Nation after the cruel reign of Saddam. They want an opportunity to build a better future for their children, and they ask for our help to secure that peace. 
   Will we now stand aside while al Qaeda and Iran support factions that would enslave them once again? You know, it was Franklin Delano Roosevelt who knew the repercussions of failing to support those nations that are struggling for liberty, when he said, and I quote: ``Enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people's freedom.'' 
   FDR also declared that we are committed to full support of all those resolute people everywhere who are resisting aggression and are thereby keeping war away from our hemisphere. We cannot have peace in Iraq by handing over those who have worked to build a Nation based on freedom and justice and peace, turn it over to those violent brethren who seek only destruction of those principles. Make no mistake about it: If we stay the course, as this resolution would have us do, it will not be long before this war returns to our shores  
   I would like to end with the words of two individuals. The paths they have traveled to now and the paths they desire to take in the future could not be any more different. But, they are equally strong in the passion they bring to their beliefs. And, their words should be instructive to us in this debate. 
   First are the words of Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. He says: ``We have drunk blood in the past, and we find no blood sweeter than that of the Christians. Know that offense is the best form of defense, and be careful not to lay down your weapons before the war is over.'' While we quibble over words here on the floor of the House of Representatives, our enemies speak  with frightening clarity of conviction. Can there be any doubt that this resolution solidifies the resolve of the jihadists he leads and inspires? 
   In stark contrast are the words of one of my constituents, Ron Griffin, who 45 months ago lost his son, Kyle, an Airborne Infantryman serving in Iraq. ``We never felt lost or alone for we were literally carried through our sorrow by the resolute, soothing and comforting hands of countless human beings whom I only hope can truly understand how they made life worth living. . . . What I see [now] is a people pummeled into acquiescence. The loss of these wondrous warriors is of itself a weight that is almost unbearable to struggle under, but when accompanied by the din of negativity it becomes to most people a burden.'' 
   Can there be any doubt that this resolution does nothing more than add to the din of negativity of which Mr. Griffin speaks? 
   I have faith that we can stand strong. I oppose this empty resolution to stay the course. I stand up for an America that is just and free and a friend to those who seek liberty and peace.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (RIGHT TO LIFE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for managing this hour as Members come to the floor to speak about this extremely important topic. 
   I must begin my remarks by thanking everyone who took part earlier today, all those folks who traveled down here to Washington to participate in the annual Right to Life March from all over the country, in bad bus rides and distant flight delays and bumpy car rides. I am grateful to all the marchers who came from the great State of New Jersey. Particularly, I would like to recognize the students from Pope John High School and also the kids from Veritas Christian Academy located in Sparta, as well as some of the parishioners who came down from Our Lady of Fatima in Vernon, St. Jude's Church in Blairstown, Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Stillwater, and the folks from Lafayette Federated Church from Lafayette. 
   I didn't include everyone, but the list would go on and on with all of the people from the great State of New Jersey, people concerned and taking part to make sure that their voice was heard. 
   Earlier today I had the opportunity, and I would say the honor of speaking to the thousands of marchers who came out. They braved the freezing wind and the rain that was coming on as well. As I had a chance to talk to them, I told them that they, along with Members of Congress, were probably experiencing mixed emotions at the time, similar to the emotions I was experiencing. 
   Think about it, on the one hand, we are immensely encouraged by what we see. We are encouraged that so many people have gathered here in Washington, DC to mark the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. We draw comfort from that fact. We are encouraged that our Nation has not forgotten that tragic death even 35 years later. We are encouraged that we can stand firm in reminding our fellow citizens that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. And most importantly of all, is the right to life. 
   Finally, we are encouraged that in many cases, our efforts have been rewarded. For instance, the number of abortions that are performed annually has actually dropped down back to levels not seen since the 1970s. Still, despite those signs of encouragement, our hearts are still heavy with sadness and that is because we mourn the millions of babies who have been mercilessly killed before they can even take their first single breath. And we grieve for the mothers and fathers who suffer from the emotional pain of having to have gone through an abortion. 
   We lament the fact of a continuing decline of morality, civility, and respect for human dignity and worth. For me and my constituents in New Jersey, I am particularly disheartened by a study that was released just last week that showed that our home State, the so-called Garden State, has the second highest abortion rate in the Nation. 
   It is in moments like these that we must turn our gaze upward and remember the One, the One who created life is also the One who governs the universe. He commands us to ``run and not be weary, to walk and not faint.'' 
   And so today, we ultimately find encouragement in knowing that the battle is not over. The battle is not ours alone, and the might of right is on our side. 
   So we will keep working to increase the number of States that have substantive parental involvement laws, thereby protecting teens from the abortion propaganda. We will continue to prohibit partial-birth abortions and fight that in other States as well. And we will show by example how to value life. 
   Finally, some day I pray that we will experience a January 22 free of these mixed emotions. And instead, we will be able to celebrate a renewed culture of life in this entire Nation. 
   We elected officials come to the floor to remember the weakest among us. Yet I know we will succeed not because of who we are, but because of what Americans all across this great Nation are doing on behalf of life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman. 
   I rise to the floor to oppose this rule and to also oppose the underlying bill, a bill that would, as the hurricanes that are going across this country, devastate this country financially and put the American taxpayer on the hook, not for $10 billion, not for $20 million, we're upwards to $5 trillion. 
   I commend the hearing that we had last night on this bill, which was over 1 hour. That's an hour more than we've had any discussion whatsoever on this potential of putting the American taxpayer on the hook for $5 trillion. Chairman Frank did not hold one single hearing to discuss how this would impact the American public nor the American financial system; hearing after hearing that we held on all sorts of other things, but never could we get to this topic. 
   In fact, the chairman last night called ``nonsensical'' the idea that the American public could be put on the hook for upwards to $300 billion. Well, remember this; that was the same chairman, unfortunately, who told us 5 years ago and 3 years ago and 1 year ago, nonsensical was the idea that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could ever fail. In fact, that's the same chairman who told us that he would never support the bailing out of the GSEs. In fact, if I looked into the transcripts of our past hearings where the gentleman from Massachusetts spoke, he said repeatedly, ``I would never support the bailout of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or the GSEs.'' Well, sir, here we are today, upwards to a $5 trillion bailout for the GSEs. In fact, this will make the savings and loan scandals of a few years ago pale by comparison. 
   And I remind the American public, how did that unfold? First, it was a $10 billion request to the American taxpayer that they used to bail out the savings and loan. Then it was $50, $70--finally, $200 billion plus was asked for the American taxpayer to bail out the American savings and loans in this country. That's the exact same thing that's potentially going to occur here today as we bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for their exclusively bad decisionmaking.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, the American taxpayer today should be alarmed. No, he should be outraged. The taxpayer is being asked to be put on the hook for $5 trillion, the largest increase ever in U.S. history. 
   A blank check is being given to be written by this administration. $800 billion is being asked for an increase in our debt limit. The CBO even says $25 billion potentially on the hook just to the year 2009. 
   Experts have pointed out what this all means to you and I, the taxpayer, higher costs, higher inflation, and, of course, the prospects of ever higher taxes as well. We here today are crossing the Rubicon. Just as Caesar crossed into Rome, so too are Secretary Paulson and Chairman Frank, locked arms together, to cross the Rubicon and into that uncharted morass of socializing the loss and privatizing the profits. As the people yelled back then in those days, there is no turning back. So here we are today. 
   Are we to stand here today and listen to those same people who brought us to this precipice and now ask us to join with them as we jump off? Yes, that's what we are being asked to do. 
   I would note today in the Wall Street Journal, Paul Gigot writes that back in 2003 that the head of Countrywide was yelling at him and others as well, saying that we don't understand the markets and mortgages and whatnot, and there is no systemic risk with the GSEs. 
   Well, Chairman Frank and others said the same thing, that we just don't understand and not to worry. There are only a few people in those years that stood up, people like former Congressman Richard Baker who said that there would be a problem down the road. 
   I joined Richard Baker and others saying we must be doing something back then, sever the link to the Federal Government, end the $2.5 billion credit line, end the influence of buying, $200 million by lobbyists, by these entities, using their influence to make sure  that no reform could get done. We tried to pass legislation that would give us just basic reform, but all those initiatives were stopped at the very brink. 
   Also during that time, Chairman Frank told us that this would not happen.

   As we come to the floor now and the Democrats talk about beaches, my constituents in the great State of New Jersey suffer. They are suffering from unrelenting increases in the price of gas, up almost a dollar now since the Democrats took control of this House. So as my constituents suffer from higher food costs, all related energy costs; as my constituents suffer from higher heating costs, all related to energy costs; as my constituents suffer from the higher cost of living in general, again, related to energy costs, all of them should be asking what is it that the Democrat Congress is doing to address this problem? 
   Well, the short answer is nothing really helpful. And the long answer is really potentially driving up the costs even higher. 
   Let me give you two quick points. First, the Democrats have voted four times now, four times, to raise taxes so to make sure the discovering and making sure that America's energy independence is that much harder. Secondly, they have voted now to lock up almost 85 percent of known specific energy resources in this country. What does that mean? What does that translate to the consumer? Again, the Democrats are making it harder for America to become energy independent from foreign oil. 
   Now is the time for all Americans everywhere across this country to ask what is its Democrat Congress doing. The short answer is nothing much. The long answer is potentially driving up the cost for fuel for all of them. Now is, therefore, the time for all of us to come to the floor to work together for a change and to make sure that America can, in fact, become energy independent. Now is the time for Democrats to be working not against the American consumer, but for him instead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Madam Chairman, I come to the floor also to speak in support of the Flake amendment. I was in my office almost a half-hour ago now when I saw the debate on the floor and my friend and colleague Mr. Flake was here speaking about his amendment, and I thought I would come down to hear his closing remarks and hear the other side then say that they agreed to the amendment, because I thought, in essence, this was an amendment that both sides of the aisle could reach across and find unanimity and agreement with, if we believed the rhetoric that we heard last year and if we believe the rhetoric we hear oftentimes from the other side of the aisle about their desires to rein in spending, to address the earmark situation problem and to work with Republicans to try to deal with it, as we heard during their campaign to come to the majority, as they have, and now on the floor as well. 
   To my surprise, and perhaps I should not be surprised to find that as of this time, a half-hour later into the debate on a simple amendment to say that we should not be having earmarks in this bill, a bill that never had earmarks before, the other side of the aisle, the Democrat side of the aisle, cannot agree to it. 
   Earlier, when the general debate on this bill was on the floor, I came to the floor and said that in light of all the issues that we are discussing right now, it is amazing we are about to go into the weekend break discussing beaches as opposed to some other fundamentally important issue striking at the hearts and the wallets of the American taxpayers and the citizens of the State of New Jersey as well, one principally which was the high cost of oil. 
   The Democrats have been in charge of this House now for almost a year and a quarter, and during that time we have seen the price of gas at the local gasoline stations go up by almost a buck. You would think that would be something first and foremost that they would be addressing. But, no, they are addressing a spending bill and beaches, as we have before us. Again, maybe I should not be surprised, because wasn't it Hillary Clinton who said that she has more ideas on spending than there are dollars in D.C.? 
   Well, in light of the fact that the other side of the aisle, the Democrat majority, will not even consider to support the Flake amendment, which would try to rein in some of that wasteful, wanton abuse that we see in earmarks here, apparently the Democrat House leadership is taking a page from Hillary Clinton's playbook. They too have more ideas on spending than there are dollars in D.C. to spend. 
   It was just indicated a moment ago, well, this is not the purpose of the bill, to do earmarks. Well, if it is not the purpose of the bill, then it should be an easy lift to support this amendment to eliminate earmarks from the bill. 
   Secondly, someone suggested from the other side, well, if we are going to do it in this one, we should do it in all other bills like this. I agree, and I am sure Mr. Flake would come to the floor as well and say he would put this in any bill coming to the floor, to say we should not have earmarks, and I think he just rose to that point. 
   Finally, the point was made, I think from this side of the aisle, well, it hasn't been done in bills like this before. What a better time than right now? And I commend the gentleman, Mr. Flake for bringing it to the floor. If not now, then when? If both sides of the aisle are as adamantly opposed to abuses of earmarks as both sides of the aisle say they are, why shouldn't they support the amendment by Mr. Flake? 
   Madam Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (EDUCATION -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to come to the floor this evening to speak on a topic that I, quite honestly, am quite passionate about, and that is the education of our children, of my children, of the children in our communities and the children of all the parents across this great country. It's an issue that I have been involved with for some time, first and foremost as a father with my own children at home, obviously from the very beginning days as educating them as a parent before they went off to school, and then later as they are in school now, both at home and off in college as well. Obviously, as a parent, we are all intimately involved with those issues. But in another sense as well, in a public official capacity. Before coming to Congress, I had the opportunity to work with the issues of education and public education, serving for 12 years, as I did, in the State government and serving on the Education Committee there. 
   I come to the floor now tonight to talk about an issue, education, and specifically some legislation that will be coming before this House, and eventually the Senate as well, and perhaps to the President's desk, and that is something called NCLB, No Child Left Behind. Now, as I say, there are numerous issues, and we just heard the other side of the aisle talk about the issue of war, which is often making the press and making the media and is talked about on talk radio quite continuously, as it should be. And the issue of education, public education is perhaps down there on some of the polls and down there as far as talk radio and the media as well. And I have noticed that the issue of the reauthorization of NCLB, No Child Left Behind, also has not been out there in the forefront of people's debate. But rest assured, it shall be in the days and weeks ahead, as first the full committee in this House will consider legislation and has already drafted legislation, which I will talk about shortly, as the committee begins to consider that and hopefully have a number of public hearings on that and eventually come before this entire House for discussion. 
   So I think it's important that we get out in front of it, if you will, to talk about NCLB, and maybe a little bit about the history of where we are on public education in this country, how did we get to the point we are right now; NCLB, and what it has wrought to this country over the last half a dozen years that it has been the law of this land, and what could occur if it does get reauthorized. 
   And finally, at the end, of course, I would like to talk a little bit about what I see as the solution to the problems of public education and their impact upon NCLB. And I will just give you a tad bit of a look at that right now, and that is, I have dropped in some legislation, H.R. 3177, and what H.R. 3177 is is a bill. I call it the LEARN Act, ``Local Education Authority Returns Now.'' And what that acronym simply means is that we really should take a look at education, see where we came from, and realize that in the earliest days of education in this country the idea was that having the parents involved first and foremost, having the teachers, the local principals involved first and foremost, and then the school board or community boards that run education is really the best way to ensure that our young kids will have the best education in their community, that the standards will be the highest possible and obtainable for all the children in their school, that the teachers will be the best and the brightest, that the methodology that we will use in those schools will be the best, and the school books and the programs and what have you will all be as best that we can in our local communities.     
   That has been the history of public education. That has been the history of private education, as well, and that is really what is at the heart of my piece of legislation, H.R. 3177, to say, can't we return, or can't we move forward, if  you will, to that, once again, to put the control, to put the decision-making, to put the accountability and to put the promise of better education right at home with the parents, the teachers, the principals and the like. That is what H.R. 3177 really does. 
   But I get ahead of myself here when I talk about what the solution to the problem is before we even spend a little bit of time about looking at what the problem was. Now, NCLB was signed into law, as I said, just a little less than a half a dozen years ago. It is up for reauthorization right now. When the President signed the law into effect, he hailed it as ``an historic new law that will change the culture of American schools.'' 
   Now, at the heart of this change were mandatory new testing, reporting, and accountability requirements. You see, the theory went that schools would raise their standards and strive to make improvements, and then this eventually you might say trickle down and assist the underperforming students that needed the help the most. 
   But as we now reconsider the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, I submit that many of the changes brought about by this law were certainly unintended, maybe not unforeseen if they had merely taken the time to try to consider what some of the consequences would be, but they were truly burdensome and unintended consequences that were brought about by it. You see, instead of giving the local school districts the flexibility that they really need to develop their own curriculum to the very best limits that they can, they are instead hampered by NCLB's testing requirements, and they must basically now tailor their classrooms around this standardization to, what is in a way, a schizophrenic standardization, if you will. 
   I will explain that. On the one hand, the advocates of NCLB and those who you will hear who advocate its reauthorization will say, well, look, NCLB actually gives flexibility to the classroom and to the States inasmuch as they have the ability to set their standards and they have the ability to set their proficiency. Now, that is the one argument that the proponents of NCLB will make. Flip it around, though, and the same proponents will say, well, wait a minute, at the same time we are doing that, we are going to be requiring accountability at that level and a standardization across the board to an extent on this, as well. Obviously, that is a schizophrenic talking out of both sides of your mouth on a point, because, of course, you can't have both. 
   To the first point of essentially allowing the States the opportunity to set their own standards, well, there is a nod, if you will, to federalism, which is the appropriate way to handle education, that is, at the local level; but think about what has actually occurred. This is it: if you are going to tell the States that you are able to set your own standards, but then, at the same time, tell the States that we are going to tie your funding to your meeting those standards, or exceeding those standards, what is going to be the result? Well, I can tell you what the result has been, and that is the proverbial race to the bottom. 
   It makes logical sense. If a State were to set the standards to where the parents would like them, perhaps the community would like them, perhaps the business interests and the community interest and everyone else in the State would like them, at a high level in the State, what is potentially going to occur in that State? Well, potentially, what is going to occur is they are not going to achieve what the law requires, which is 100 percent proficiency. 
   Think about that last term just for a moment. One hundred percent proficiency is being demanded by the Federal Government. I would like to hear from the Department of Education about any of their programs that are being run 100 percent proficiently. For that matter, I would like to hear from any agency of the Federal Government that their agency is being run 100 percent proficiently. Yet, even though the Federal Government can't achieve it, they are going to say that the States have to achieve that 100 percent proficiency level, because that is the requirement of NCLB. 
   The result is that those bureaucrats in the State who realize that their dollars are going to be tied to whether or not they meet the bar that they themselves have set, they are going to race to the bottom, lowering the standards. 
   This is just not a hypothetical that I am suggesting. This has been the actual result. This has been the actual result of State after State as they realized during the course of the implementation of NCLB that they have not been able to meet the proficiency standards that they had previously, and so they have lowered them. I believe I have examples of that. One example, of course, was in Michigan where prior to the law they had various standards within their schools as far as math and reading and what have you. Those standards were fairly high. You and I might agree they are appropriate levels for the schools. But they realized that they were not going to be able to meet those standards on a 100 percent proficiency level. So what did they do? They did really the logical thing for the best interests, I guess, for the people who run the schools, the bureaucrats and what have you in the State, but certainly not necessarily in the best interests of the students. They lowered the standards. 
   Now, by lowering the standards, suddenly, magically, if you will, they have now met their new lowered standards and they are in compliance with NCLB. There are obviously, not obviously, but there are clearly additional examples of this. I can give you some additional examples. 
   But I see I have been joined by several of my colleagues here on the floor, and I will turn the floor over now to Ms. Foxx who is quite equally interested, and I would say concerned, and dare I say equally passionate about the issue of education for our children and making 
   sure that the standards are as high as completely possible and that the area of control remains appropriately where it should be, and that is with the parents and the local school community.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for your commitment to this issue, your commitment to our children and their education now and in the future, and for your past work as far as you set out as far as your experience in the area of education. 
   I was listening closely to the points you made, and you made a number of good ones. You started off, of course, this being Constitution Day, talking about the Constitution. You are correct. We ignore the Constitution at our peril, and those who would be willing to give greater power over education to the Federal bureaucracy are, in essence, sowing the seeds of freedom's destruction here in this country. 
   Madison in the Federalist Papers, No. 47, said ``the accumulation of power in a small number of hands,'' in this case by Federal bureaucrats, ``the accumulation of power in a small number of hands is the very definition of tyranny.'' 
   That is really what we are leading to here when we take away the parents' rights to control their child's upbringing and education and we take away the local community's rights of dictating how their schools should be run. 
   One of your last points, it is interesting that you bring it up, you were citing the fact that there are other factors that go into the performance of children on tests and on schools and the like. I was sitting back in the cloakroom just before coming on here tonight and talking about education. I would commend you to take a look at this article in the Weekly Standard. The headline is ``No Child Left Alone.'' By that, they mean the fact that the Federal Government is coming around, and the little poor child is looking at adults on either side of him. 
   In the article, it raises an element of the point you have, that we would like to think when we are elected officials that we are in control of the situation; that if there is a problem on the nightly news or the front page of the newspaper, just come to us, whether in State government or in the Federal Government, and we will drop a bill in and that will solve it. 
   When it comes to education we would like to think all we need to do is spend a little more money, which was the last plan I was going to get to that you raised, spend a little more money, tweak the system here or there, and we are going to increase the output, if you will, of the school, as if we are producing widgets in those schools, that there is no difference than the factory or what have you. But different from the factory, these are human beings. These are little lives that are coming from an environment that the schoolhouse has absolutely no control over. 
   These are the other factors I think you are alluding to; the fact that this youngster over here might come from the traditional nuclear family of a loving mom and dad, where only one of the parents works outside of the home and the other parent stays inside the home and takes care and is watching over the child all the time and educating, making sure that that child is doing their homework, following up on  activities, going out to museums and the like. 
   In another family, in another environment, you may have different demographics. You may have a single parent, or no parent whatsoever. You may have a crime-ridden area. You may have no one watching over that child after school. There may be no after-school activities whatsoever. There may be no museums or what have you for that child to go to. On and on the list goes. Those are all factors that the school, and things like NCLB and all that the Federal Government does with regard to education, are not going to be impacting upon directly. Yet we like to think that just by changing an education law, we are going to fix it. 
   Which brings me to one of your middle points which I think really needs to have the point reemphasized, and that is the spending issue. I brought a couple of charts to illustrate this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Sure. I appreciate that. Before I get to the gentleman from Georgia, let me just bring back to the point of spending in our schools and where it goes to. 
   When you are talking about spending in schools, there are two elements to it. There is instructional spending and noninstructional spending. Instructional spending is what you and I would normally think about as far as spending for schools. That is paying for the teachers' salary, that is for paying for the books, the papers and pencils that they may have in the classrooms and that sort of thing. The other is noninstructional. That would include the items such as the building itself, maybe the school bus and bussing the kids into there, and other things outside of the classroom. 
   The numbers that we have here, and, by the way, you have to give credit for being able to bring this tonight to Dr. Anthony Davies of the Donahue Graduate School of Business at Duquesne University, who collected a lot of this data. 
   What we see is on these two charts, sort of interesting, the little blue dots and the red dots. The blue dots on the top portion of the chart are eighth graders. The red ones are the fourth graders. The first chart I will look at is instructional. The next chart makes a similar point with noninstructional spending per pupil. 
   Across the bottom of the chart is how much we are spending on these kids, and it goes from $2,500 up to $7,500. That is the x-axis. The y-axis, you have the NAEP scores. These are basically educational scores, actually started during the Reagan Administration, actually trying to come up with a uniform testing of all schools in the country. These are NAEP scores. 
   So let's take a look at eighth graders for instructional spending. You would think when you move from left to right, from the $2,500 per child over to $7,500 over on the far right, that you would see an increase of performance by the students. 
   What do we see? All of the little dots representing the students are in the same band here, from the 520 to 560 band all the way across. The same thing with the fourth graders. You would think intuitively, or at least by the propaganda of the education establishment, that the more money on instructional spending we would spend for the fourth graders on their NAEP scores, on the testing scores, would increase. But what do we see instead? They are all again right in the same bandwidth, meaning that as you spend more dollars, we are not seeing an improvement in test scores. 
   Let's take a look at the next chart. Very briefly, this confirms what we were talking about with noninstructional, things outside of the classroom. It is slightly different numbers because the dollars you spend on that is sometimes greater. From $3,000 on the left to $6,500 all the way to the right. Again, the blue is the eighth-grader kids and the red are the fourth grade children. Again this is the NAEP scores. 
   Again, what do we see? There are no increases, as you would intuitively think there should be, at least by the propaganda you would think there should be. For the eighth graders, it stays constant. On the fourth graders, it equally stays constant. 
   So, both charts make the point of Ms. Foxx that what we do on the Federal level with regard to saying we are going to provide funding for these specific programs or what have you, whether it is through NCLB or otherwise, really doesn't hit the point. The point really is to make sure that the curriculum and the teachers and the school and everything else is the best that they can possibly have, and making sure that the accountability for those are by those people who have the most interest in it, and that, of course, is the parents and the local community. 
   I am very pleased that I am joined here this evening by a good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Georgia, to speak on these topics as well. 
   Mr. Price.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield on that point, we can break this down into two elements: first, what has happened since NCLB has been passed; and, secondly, over the longer haul. Before you came to the floor, I was giving a little brief history of where we came from on the whole area of education. As you know, this country started with the idea that education was first and foremost with the family, and after that the local schools and normal schools developed and what have you, and then the education bureaucracy developed on the State level, and a progressive education format began to grow with more rules and regulations. Finally, in the last century, and more specifically you cited it in the 1960s, with Lyndon Johnson with his growth of education. 
   Prior to that time, you really had very little education laws passed on the Federal level. For the first 176 years of this country, there were only 41 laws in total, total laws passed in the Federal Government for education. Since LBJ passed the legislation, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 40 years ago, 117 more laws have been added to the books just on the Federal level. So since LBJ came in, there was the idea that the Federal Government is going to have a role. As the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) said, an unconstitutional role in education, but be that as it may. Since that time, the Federal Government has been doing two things: funding and setting down requirements and regulations. 
   So you would think that if this is a good Federal program or agency, we would have something to show for it as far as where our dollars go. I have a couple of charts. This first chart here is labeled Federal Education Spending and Reading Scores. Again, as I referenced before, these are NAEP scores and they are green, yellow and red. Green is the top, 17-year-olds, and the yellow is 13-year-olds, and red is the 9-year-olds. The middle one is how much money we are spending on the Federal level. 
   Watch what happens here. This starts in 1970. Going across here to 2005, Federal spending starts and flattens out and goes down in the 1980s. The Reagan administration, when they thought they were going to turn control over to the States, began to create block grants; but the Congress, even though it was a Republican Congress, had a different idea. Spending immediately went up dramatically. And this administration brags about the fact that they have seen a 40 percent increase in spending at the end of the chart here. 
   So what happened with that spending? Look at the lines. Perfectly flat. The scores here, these are the NAEP scores on both sides. Perfectly flat. From 1970 to 2005, the 17-years-old NAEP scores flat; 13- and 9-year-olds, the same thing. This is sort of documenting it. 
   This presents in a different graphic percentage change from baseline over here. The red this time is our Federal spending on education which starts over here in 1980 to 2004. Look at how it just takes off over here. You would think with all of these extra dollars, the scores on the bottom, these are math scores again for those same age groups, what do they do, perfectly flat all of the way across the bottom. No changes whatsoever as the dollars go up. 
   That makes the point graphically that throwing the money at it from the Federal level has had no result.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for the points you make and for joining me on the floor this evening and joining with me and other Members of Congress who are supporters of the LEARN Act, and who in general believe that we must do all we possibly can to help elevate and raise up the standards and the quality of education in this country. 
   Sometimes the best way to do that is to allow those people closest to it and those people with the most interest in it, and that is the parents and local school and the teachers, to become involved with it. 
   The gentleman from Georgia raised a couple of interesting points, and I want to go back and highlight some of them. One is what has been the result so far since No Child Left Behind has been on the books. Now my charts over here have shown that ever since President Lyndon Johnson came into office and made it one of his major legacies, and that is what he said it was going to be, the authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which has now been on the books for 40 years, we have seen the result in test scores over the last some-40 years of Federal control and involvement in education, and those results are pretty dismal. 
   If this was something in business or anywhere else and you saw a flat, no increase with additional spending year after year and additional regulation and modification on the Federal level, you would say something is wrong here. Well, there is because the Federal Government has become involved and has taken away some of the accountability and authority that should rest back at home with the local community. 
   Since No Child Left Behind passed the first time, the first report came out I believe in the beginning of 2006 with regard to No Child Left Behind and the results from that. In essence, the proponents of NCLB jumped and said it is working. We are seeing a slight improvement, and they said that is all because of NCLB. Then you have to sit back and think: NCLB was passed in 2002 with an effective date of 2003. Portions as far as the implementations didn't begin until 2004 and 2005. Here this report was coming out in the beginning of 2006. So you realize at the end of the day that NCLB wasn't having any of those positive impacts. These were things that were just long in the books already, long in the course of things already that the States had already taken upon.     
   For example, in certain reading areas, almost two or three dozen States had already instituted a reading program that NCLB later on would say this would be the reading program that they would encourage States to employ. Of course those States that are already doing it were ahead of the game and they skewed the numbers upwards. 
   So the reports that you read in some of the press reports coming back from NCLB, they say NCLB is working. You have to look--at was it NCLB or something the teachers and parents had already instituted by themselves? 
   Now, I can speak from personal experience on some of these topics because, as I indicated before, I used to be in State government before I came to Washington. I served on an education committee there. One of the things that we did in the great State of New Jersey was to come up with what we called the CCC, that is the ``core curriculum content'' standards. 
   So we had already in our State realized that we needed to address some deficiencies in public education in the State, and one of the ways you can do that is by coming up with an entire spectrum, if you will, of topics that we want our kids in our schools to learn, and learn at a good level. So that was the core curriculum content standard. 
   So we were going to say that all public schools would have this in the great State of New Jersey. They ran the gamut. They were not just math and reading, which is what NCLB is about, but other topics as well. History classes and social studies classes, literature and arts and art classes and technical classes as well. And on and on the list went. Foreign languages and the like. They were things that the people of the State of New Jersey said was important for our kids and our State in a way that we wanted them to be educated in it. 
   After NCLB came into place, our State had to do what a lot of other States had to do as well, and that is turn from what we said, what our parents, what our community said was important for our children, to what Washington was now saying was important. Washington said that math and reading are important, and they are. You will get no debate with me on that. But when you make just two items the premier and the only topics that you are going to be judged on, and if you only make two areas the only area that you are going to be potentially funded or defunded on, what is the natural inclination of administrators and the like? It is to shift local resources away from these other programs like physical education, health, arts, sciences, history, shift your dollars away from those things, things that the local community might feel are very important and shift them over to what now the bureaucrats in Washington say are the only things that are important. 
   When you think about it, there is another consequence to it as well. When you make that shift, you do a disservice to some of the children in your school or who are perhaps doing well or just getting by at certain levels as you focus exclusively on one area. 
   Let me give you a classic example of that. We had a school in our district which was an exceptional school. It has been considered that by the State of New Jersey for many years; it has been considered that by the parents of the children who go to that school. It is a school that all the kids do well on their SATs. I think it has like nearly a 100 percent graduation rate, just about an equal percentage of children going from high school on to college. By anyone's classification, almost anyone's classification, an exceptional school. 
   NCLB comes along, and because of some difficulties in just a very small area with just a very small select group of children in that school, it rated as not performing as NCLB wanted them to perform. That, therefore, made a problem for the administrators in the school, that they would have to now shift their focus and shift their attention and shift their resources from what had been a successful school in the past to address some of these concerns on the Federal level. 
   So now what do you do? You leave behind the whole idea of NCLB, No Child Left Behind, and now you are leaving behind the vast majority of children in that school 
   Let me just take a moment then first to finish on a point I raised earlier, the problem of the race to the bottom that NCLB is causing and then what some of the solutions are. I think I mentioned earlier one example, which was Michigan. Michigan, like New Jersey, had prior to NCLB raised its standards because that is what the parents and the community and teachers all said was appropriate and what they wanted for their children in their school. 
   Then NCLB came along with their new rubric of how things are going to run. What happened? By the beginning of the 2002-2003 school year, Michigan found itself with more failing schools than any other State. Obviously, if you  have the bar of your standards way up here and all the other States are down here in the middle someplace, you are not going to have 100 percent efficiency up here. So they had more failing schools than any other State. 
   So NCLB in essence was making Michigan look worse than any other State that had set the bar lower. How did Michigan respond to this embarrassment? By lowering the passing rate on its high school English test from 75 percent to 42 percent, which helped reduce its reported number of failing school from 1,500 schools to 216. 
   So instead of getting the 75 that is usually like a C average in a school, instead of saying you needed a C in order to be passing in English, they say all you need is a 42 percent. When did you ever go to school and say a 42, which would be a D or E or something like that in school, was passing. That is what Michigan did in response to NCLB. 
   What did other schools do? They lowered their bars as well. One of them did it in a more clever way. They changed what they call the ``confidence intervals.'' That is when you take a poll. They have a confidence factor or margin of error of 3 or 4 percent. If you raise that percentage point all the way up to the point so the confidence factor is very small, then you can say in essence that you are changing the facts by statistics. 
   That is what a number of schools did. Kentucky did that. By choosing 99.5 percent confidence, they made it a very narrow range as far as what was within the failing range, and, therefore, all of a sudden their grades as far as NCLB was concerned went up. On the list goes. 
   How about average yearly progress? I will talk about where that came from in a moment. Some of the schools have decided in order to do average yearly progress, they will treat it like balloon mortgages, something that we know about in the press right now. What that means is instead of saying we will do so much each year, we will only do a little tiny bit the first several years and really do a whole lot at the end. Of course you never get to the end. 
   So some of those are just some of the classic examples of what are some of the problems with NCLB and the race to the bottom, basically saying that we are not doing what everybody wants. Everyone's high standards, whether you want to call it a national standard, world-class standards in the schools, everybody wants what is the best for their child. But when you have a system in place where the Federal Government is going to 
   be sending out the money in relationship to their standards and allowing the flexibility for the States to have it set those standards, you are, as I said at the very beginning, speaking out of both sides of your mouth with regard to this, and you are going to have a failing system. That is what we have with the Federal Government's involvement here 
   So what is the solution? Well, one of the solutions is simply this: do whatever you will with NCLB, and you will see a host, probably a hundred bills, right now in Congress to try to tweak it here or tweak it there, increase spending even more, as this chart shows, or take away the accountability here. On and on the list goes. You will see all that come down. 
   I suggest, however, in addition to whatever Congress throws out on the table as far as their solution to the problem, I suggest this as well: allow the States, if they want to, voluntarily, so that means they are not forced to, to opt out of No Child Left Behind. So if your State says thank you very much, Washington, thank you very much, bureaucrats in Washington and the Department of Education, bureaucrats who have never seen my school building, never saw my child, never saw my county or town, or what have you, we do not need your assistance on how to hire our teachers, buy our books, develop our curriculum, teach our kids. We can do it ourselves. We have the competence as parent, teachers, administrators in the community to do it. 
   We would have the ability then, if that State so desired, to opt out of No Child Left Behind and keep our own money here in our own State and not send it to Washington any more. 
   That last point is an important one. Right now, if a State wanted to, it could opt out of No Child Left Behind, as I just described it, and say that we don't need your rules and regulations, thank you very much, Washington. But all the money would still go to Washington and that State would never get any money back. 
   That is obviously inherently unfair to that State. Why should the taxpayers be sending money to Washington and see absolutely zero benefit from it? It makes no sense. 
   So what the LEARN Act does, 3177 that I spoke to at the very beginning, simply says this: not only would a State, if it so desired, opt out of NCLB and all the vast red tape and rigamarole that comes with it and all the burdens that comes on the teachers and administrators and the burdens that it places on the kids who are no longer going to have high standards to live up to, not only would be able to opt out, but those taxpayers in that State would be able to in essence keep their money in their own pocket and not send it to Washington any more; keep the money in that State, in the taxpayers' pocket where it belongs so they can decide how that dollar should be spent on the public education in their own respective State. 
   Now, mind you, some, maybe the vast majority of the States would not want to opt out of No Child Left Behind. Maybe you all live in one of those States that feels that you need Washington and the bureaucrats down in Washington to assist or to tell you how your local schools should be run. Maybe there are States, maybe there are Congress people who represent districts and those districts feel that they are just not able to decide how to run their schools, they are not able to decide what a quality teacher is, they are not able to decide what a violent school is. 
   Maybe there is some school districts or some congressional district that just can't make a determination of how to set up a curriculum or set testing standards or set levels of accountability. For those congressional districts, they would be able to stay in the system and not opt out. That is the inherent benefit of a voluntary system. 
   Again, I appreciate my colleagues from the various States who have already signed onto this and my colleagues who joined me on the floor this evening for discussion of NCLB and its reauthorization

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, my amendment will increase our funding of international counterterrorist programs, while also calling out the United Nations for its continued reluctance to recognize and fight international terrorism. 
   We are at war with an enemy whose tactics not only involve the destruction of non-com batants, women, little children, people just trying to work or buying something at the market; their tactics depend on such destruction.     
   Terrorists disregard the rules of warfare and strike at pure innocents. They wear no uniform and often do not even care about saving their own lives. Despite the fact that the wor ld is in the throes of the violence of terrorism, the U.N. has done so very little to fight this threat on humanity.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, hopefully that redesignation is a clarification. 
   What we are trying to do is not, as in a subsequent amendment where we will be taking funds from the peacekeeping mission, which is what the gentlelady was referring to here, instead is to take money from the U.N. international organization line and redesignate those $20 million to join us in the fight against terrorism. 
   As my openi ng comments to the Chair stated, the U.N. has done a woefully poor job when it comes to fighting terrorism around the world. We only have to look at the situation in the Sudan and Darfur, where they are not even able at this late date to define and tell us a genocide is going on. My goodness, the U.N. has not been able to grapple with the definition of what a genocide is, let alone take responsive action to try to bring it to an end. 
   Likewise in the area of terrorism, the U.N. has again willfully and wo efully failed to step up to the plate and be an instrument in fighting terrorism with so many of the world nations, the United States obviously taking a lead in that course. 
   If the U.N. is not going to be the international body to step up and take affirmative action in these areas, I think it is incumbent upon us here in this House to make sure that our dollars, our limited American taxpayer dollars, do not go to an organization, the U.N., an international body that is not getting the job done; but inst ead, to reallocate those dollars, to reallocate $20 million. That is only 3 percent of the U.S. contributions to the U.N. to antiterrorism assistance. 
   Homeland security, fighting terrorism, is one of the hallmark principles that I came to Congress to work on and to achieve end results on, and this amendment to this legislation will go to that end. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. F irst of all, I want to begin by saying that I am pleased that the committee has taken steps to see that the United Nations peacekeeping forces are not or will not be engaged in human trafficking or other sex crimes. But I am concerned that the language in the bill, quite frankly, does not go quite far enough. 
   The facts are that between 2004 and 2006, 179 peacekeepers from the U.N., under their charge, under their control, were dismissed or repatriated following investigations for sex crimes. Yet only a very few of these have been successfully prosecuted for their crimes. 
   Earlier this year, The Daily Telegraph newspaper revealed that members of the U.N. force in southern Sudan had abused children as young as 12. Just last year, the U.N. had tried to claim that these reports were just unfounded rumors, but only after these reports did the U.N. admit to repatriating four of these individuals for these crimes. Yet none of these four have ever been prosecuted in their home country of Bangladesh. 
   Just t his week, the Government of Sudan agreed to a substantial peacekeeping force in Darfur. We must ensure the people of Darfur, who have been subject to a systemic rape and violence constituting genocide, do not suffer further at the hands of the people who are there to protect them. 
   I am concerned that the language in the present bill that the U.N. ``hold accountable'' these individuals will mean that the U.N. peacekeepers will continue to get away scot-free. All national armed forces have processes for c ourt martial and punishing crimes committed by their personnel. The U.N. must see to it that these countries offering peacekeepers actually apply their system of justice when a crime is committed.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, here we are tonight, 6 months under control of the Democrat majority, and what has that majority wrought? The largest tax increase in U.S. history, an attempt in the past to change the rules of the House that have been in place since the times of Jefferson. And, of course, last week we saw the creation or attempted creation of slush funds to conceal where they wish to spend their increase of dollars. 
   The gentleman from New Jersey who just spoke a moment ago said, quite candidly, that there is no tax increase this year or next year. What he didn't finish in his statement, of course, was, Mr. Chairman, that there will be a tax increase within the budget cycle that is before us. 
   And these are not just my words, Mr. Chairman. I quote from the New York Times, who has looked at the budget that the Democrats have given us, and they have looked at that budget increase and the spending increase, and they too have said and agree with us that there is a tax increase coming on the American public and they even gave us numbers. If you are an average family in the State of New Jersey, a family of four making $70,000, you will see a tax increase of upwards to $1,500 on you because of the budget of Democrats who are now in charge. 
   In the bill before us, I come to the floor right now to commend the gentleman for his modest proposal to simply reduce the increase by the Democrats of 1 percent, a mere, in terms of Washington, $342 million. 
   Mr. Chairman, we are still looking at an increase in spending for foreign aid of almost 10 percent, around an 8.5 percent increase for foreign aid. Quite honestly, when I go back to my districts and talk to my constituents, their interest is in their families here at home, in Sussex County, Bergen County, Passaic County and Warren County in the good State of New Jersey. They are asking, why are we increasing to such a dramatic extent for all this money on foreign aid when we have problems right here at home? 
   Mr. Chairman, how many times have you heard from the other side of the aisle when they rail against spending for our brave men and women overseas on our military aid, when they say we should be spending those dollars here at home? We concur when it comes to foreign aid, we should direct those funds here at home. 
   I support the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I appreciate that. 
   And I will just conclude then, Mr. Chairman, by pointing out what the purpose of the amendment was. And that is there have been certain cases where upwards of 150 employees of single government agencies have attended international conferences such as in Africa and other places, and we are just simply saying that it is not wrong for U.S. Government agencies to send their valuable employees over to these international conferences, but we should put some limit on them. Just as small businesses and families have to rein in their budgets and decide what is appropriate as far as their staff going to conferences and the like, so should the Federal Government. 
   And I appreciate the gentlewoman for accepting the amendment. 
   I will conclude by saying that perhaps, maybe not in this session but in future sessions, that these amendments may not be necessary on the floor; and I will be glad to work with the gentlewoman in the future to incorporate such language similar to this in the actual underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor now for the next 60 minutes to address an issue that is of utmost importance to all Americans, and it is a very simple one: Where do my tax dollars go and why do I pay so much in taxes? We will see over the course of the next hour where some of the dollars go, and we will also see the fact that, quite honestly, it is hard to determine where some of those dollars go and what the Republican conference has tried to do to address that issue, to try to nail down some of what the facts are. I am referring, of course, to earmarks and transparency in the budget process because, as we all know for all too long, it has been a difficult issue to try just to figure out, when you send your taxes every April 15 to Washington, DC, where some of those hard-earned dollars go to. 
   These are important issues, as I said at the very beginning, to the American family because, as I have always said, I believe, as Members of Congress, that our focus should be on the family budget as opposed to focusing on the Federal budget, because when we focus on the family budget, the American family from the east coast to the west, the fact that they have to spend day after day working hard for their money, for their income, to pay for their expenses, when we focus on those facts and when we focus on the fact that the American family has to pay for their housing, their rent or their mortgage, the education of their children, their food and their clothing and other expenses and health care and the like, if we keep our mind focused on that, maybe we in this Congress and the administration will not be amiss as to where those dollars go in the long term.     
   If you may recall, it was just a week ago this Monday that we celebrated the 220th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution. The Founding Fathers, brilliant men all, had wisdom probably beyond their years and beyond their ages when they crafted, in 1787, that document that lives with us today. It is our job, as Members of Congress, to read that document, to understand that document from an original intent point of view, and by that, I mean to understand what the Founders intended at that time for generations to come. 
   One of the hallmarks of that document was to understand a federalist system of government. And within that, the States were sovereign in the sense that they were to take care of many factors; people were supposed to have utmost responsibility for themselves and their family, and the Federal Government was to have very limited powers. And in that Constitution it specifically set out, article I, section 8 sets out much of the limitations on the powers that Congress has. 
   Just shortly after the enactment of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights was created and added a portion of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. And the 10th Amendment to the Constitution says something that I think is important to our fiscal spending, and that is, ``All rights not specifically delegated to the Federal Government are retained by the States and the people, respectively.'' Those powers that are retained by the people, all other ones are by the people and the States. 
   So the Constitution, if you would look at it, basically just lists what the Federal Government is supposed to do. Everything else is in the hands of the people or the States. Now, over the generations, unfortunately, especially in the last 40 or 50-some-odd years, the Federal Government has grown expansively. And because of that, so, too, has the budget, and so, too, has the burden on the American family. 
   We come tonight to point out that the budget we have seen crafted by the other side of the aisle continues to grow out of control without constraint and, therefore, puts an additional burden in the form of higher taxes. Here we stand 9 months into this 110th Congress, and what have we seen as far as the budget is concerned? What has this 110th Democrat-controlled Congress wrought? Most specifically, the largest tax increase in U.S. history. Let me repeat that, and I will probably say that later on, the largest tax increase in U.S. history. And why is that? Well, for a couple of reasons. 
   One, you have continued to see excesses in spending out of the budget coming from the other side of the aisle. That, in and of itself, is bad for the American economy and for the American taxpayer. And secondly, those higher taxes are part and parcel of the Democrat plan. Why do I say that? Well, because part of their plan when they came in here, and this is something that they championed and they said was to be good, was something called PAYGO, pay-as-you-go. Now, in the heart of things you would think that that is not a bad idea to pay as you go. When you think about it, that's how every family in America really should be operating on their budget each week or each month when they pay their bills, figure out how much is in the checkbook, and before they can go on any further they have to make sure they have enough income. 
   But when the American family needs additional income to pay for additional expenses, where do they get it from? Well, they have to earn it through additional work, or that American family has another alternative, just don't spend the money in the first place. Unfortunately, the other side of the aisle doesn't ever seem to want to choose that second option of decreasing spending or holding spending flat, and that's why we see spending continuing to grow out of control. And as that spending continues to grow out of control, how do they make up for it? Well, they, unlike the American family, are not out there earning those dollars for those PAYGOs. They do it the old-fashioned way; they tax it. And they take it out of my pocket and out of your pocket, out of the American taxpayers' pocket. 
   So we're here to discuss those dilemmas that are facing the American family. And I'm pleased to be joined this evening by a gentleman who has been fighting on this floor those very issues, fighting on the floor for the American family to make sure that the American family can retain as much of their hard-earned dollars as possible, and to address these issues that we've begun to address so far as far as spending and trying to constrain it. So right now I would like to yield the floor to the good gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Because I think that's an important one. 
   Someone in my district, years ago when I first went into politics, said to me, Scott, when you deal with all these complicated issues that you will deal with, at that time on the State level, or now that I'm here in Washington, you have to translate it into, well, how does this impact upon me? And I remember that and try to bring it back home. 
   The point that you're raising here with regard to these Federal programs, SCHIP and what have you, providing benefits to illegal aliens, people coming into this country, breaking the law, and now looking to the American taxpayer to pay for their services I think is a critically important one. I think we're all too aware of the fact that there are a number of services that we would like to provide for our constituents at home, especially the low-income individuals, especially when it's something as critical as food, and many times, I'm sure you hear in your district that there's just not enough program to go around for your constituents as you would like to have them. 
   So when the Republican Conference said, as you suggested, that we should simply limit this program and limit American taxpayers' dollars to go to American citizens and not to illegals, that, to me, hits home as, how does that impact upon me? It means that those dollars will be going to Americans and to those who are most needy. Is that your understanding as well?

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. On just your last point, you raised this a moment ago, and before I say this, happy birthday to your 4-year-old. But maybe if your 4-year-old knew exactly what the debt that he has is, he would not have been so happy at his birthday party.     
   You raised the point that the next generation for the first time in American history is not going to be as well  off as the previous generation. Before you came here, I said one of the things that I learned early on in politics from a Member from the other side of the aisle back in my county was: What does this do for me? Or in this case: What does this do to me? 
   In this case it really hits home for someone such as yourself or someone else who has a little one back at home. What does it do for my children? What does it do for my grandchildren? Or in this case, what does it do to them? Of course, in this case, it saddles them with a debt, an obligation, for something that they are not gaining any benefit from; but you and I and others in this generation may be gaining benefit from. But who is paying for it, your 4-year-old. And that, of course, is not fair. 
   So many times, so many times we hear Members come to the floor and say: here is my program. Here is my earmark. Fill in the blank for whatever it is. It is the compassionate thing to do, to spend this money on this program. 
   Well, I guess it might be compassionate if they were reaching into their pocket and pulling out their own money to pay for that particular program. But, gosh, in the 5 years I have been here, I have not seen any Member of Congress when they came with their program say they are going to spend for it. No, they are just going to saddle it onto America's debt. 
   As you said, if you have little ones out there, that debt is not necessarily paid for by you and I, the current American taxpayers. It is going to be passed on the next generation. 
   The question we should be asking the other side of the aisle, after they railed against the Republicans for spending so much, now they are spending even more. Now they are going to have to raise taxes under their PAYGO rules. We will get to that in a little bit. How compassionate are they when they transfer that burden, when they transfer that debt on to future generations? 
   Keeping to this issue of how to fix the problem, the gentleman from Texas, you might want to comment on the petition that is currently being circulated, a discharge petition which I explained earlier, and how that will address the issue of authorization language as well. 
   But before you do that, let me share with you a quote or two with regards to what the other side of the aisle said about this process last year when they were in the minority. This is actually something I had put forward last year to say when it comes to earmark reform, you can't just look at appropriation bills; you have to look at the authorization language. And as mentioned before with the earmark from the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha), the $400 million earmark, that was in essence done through authorization language. You have to do both of these. 
   The other side of the aisle agreed with us at that time. They said, ``You can't just have earmarks viewed as appropriation bills unless you take up earmarks in tax bills and earmarks in authorization bills. But if you are going to have earmarks and you are going to have transparencies, you have to do it in the appropriation bills and in the tax bills and in the authorization bills. I would put it in writing.'' Who said that? Representative Nancy Pelosi, California. 
   Likewise, ``To not do something about Authorizing Committee earmarks in the process is a joke, in my view.'' Who said that? DAVID OBEY. 
   So we knew where they stood last year when they had their positions on transparency. Now that they are in the majority, we wonder exactly where they stand this year, when they have the ability to do something about it. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, you raise a point: this is what they were saying last year but they are not doing it this year. We are hopeful that at least now that we have discussed this on the floor, the information is out there, the discharge petition is going forward, although that has not been a secret because there is a line every day that we are in session here of Republican Members standing down in the well signing the discharge petition, so they know it is coming. 
   But let me give you two other quotes of what folks from the other side of the aisle were saying last year about this. When they were talking about the measure that would only provide for appropriations and not authorizations last year, they said: ``It is a half measure at best that would do nothing to stop wasteful and unnecessary projects like the bridge to nowhere.'' That was the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt). 
   Finally, ``My proposal requires the public disclosure of all earmarks, not just those of the Appropriations Committee, but authorizing and tax bills and much, much more.'' Who said that? Representative Slaughter from New York, now head of the Rules Committee. 
   So we seem to have some very important people here last year from the other side of the aisle starting with Nancy Pelosi, Speaker, to head of the Rules Committee saying they agree with our ideas as far as broadening earmark reform and transparency. 
   So maybe tonight, and I think we only have a couple more minutes, I would be willing to stay with you here on the floor if you would join me, if anyone from the other side of the aisle, leadership from Nancy Pelosi's office or the Rules Committee, to come and join me and say they will sign on to our petition, or if the Speaker would agree to move that piece of legislation since that is what they wanted to do last year when they were in the minority, and if they will do it now that they are in the 
   majority. Will you wait with me if they indicate they will come to the floor?

<DOCNO>Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. (THE FEDERAL BUDGET AND OUR TAX DOLLARS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. I think our time is just about up, and I appreciate your efforts not only tonight, but throughout your entire time here. It has been a pleasure working with you in the House while you stand beside the American family and the American family budget. 
   Americans place much responsibility in the hands of their Representatives in Congress. The American public deserves to know where their hard-earned tax dollars go. They have a right to this information. If the Democrat majority is not going to literally open the books in a clear and concise manner so the American public and Members of Congress know where the dollars go, if the Democrat majority is not going to give us the transparency that the American public deserves when it comes to where their dollars go, then the Republican Party and the Republican minority will see to it that the job is done on behalf of the American public.
