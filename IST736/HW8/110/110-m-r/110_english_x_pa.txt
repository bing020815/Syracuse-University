<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman. 
   Over the last couple of months I have watched with growing trepidation as the economic news turned worse and increasingly in the market there were uncertainties about the large tax increases being threatened from the other side of the aisle, and generally a sense of pessimism about the economy. I came to the conclusion we needed to consider moving forward with a stimulus package. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say our Chamber has an opportunity to find common ground and rally, despite our ideological differences, behind a short-term stimulus package that will have limited utility but will provide the ailing American economy with the right incentives at exactly the right time. 
   Through bipartisan dialogue and agreement, we have been able to settle on a plan that will benefit both wage earners and job creators, encourage investment, and put more money back in the pockets of America's hardworking middle-class families. As a result of this plan, working Americans will have access to extra cash to cushion increased costs in food and energy; families, in fear of losing their homes, will have new opportunity to refinance their mortgages and retain homeownership; and businesses will be rewarded for making capital investments here in the domestic economy, which, in turn, will jump-start spending and create more good-paying jobs. 
   This compromise was negotiated as a simple, clean, and targeted bill. It is the best that we can do that we can pass quickly and accomplish our goal of stimulating the economy in the near term. I urge my colleagues to join me to vote for jobs, to vote for American workers, and to vote for economic growth.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3087, the Tanner-Abercrombie-English Iraq planning bill. And I want to thank my two colleagues at the front end of that title, particularly, for their extraordinary efforts to move this bill forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is important that Congress speak with a clear voice on Iraq. The American people need to know that their representatives are trying to seek out the best policy to protect American interests overseas and reduce our footprint in that troubled country. 
   The Iraqi Government needs to know that the U.S. Congress is not prepared for our Nation to carry the burden of defending Iraq's security indefinitely and that that must become an Iraqi undertaking. 
   Our allies need to know that we remain committed to the war on terror, and that although Congress may be deeply divided on the means to pursuing our goal, that ultimately, politics ends at the water's edge. 
   This bill sends important signals. It sends a signal to our troops that their deployment is purposeful and that we're prepared to respond to changing conditions. 
   It sends a strong bipartisan message that Congress is ready to respond to changing circumstances on the ground and recognizing the coming and necessary transition of our role in Iraq from combat operations to strategic support. 
   Secretary Gates has already acknowledged that DOD would have little difficulty complying with the terms of this bill, so this legislation simply calls on the administration to make transparent the planning processes that prudent military leaders would undertake normally as a matter of course. 
   Our legislation is a very simple bill, but it is still significant. H.R. 3087 has gained support from a broad spectrum of Members of this body, Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives. It cleared the Armed Services Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   I encourage my colleagues to use this important bill as a launching pad for a new debate in the House on how we may find a new way forward in Iraq, while keeping faith with our troops, with our constituents, with our allies, with the Iraq nation and with all who stand for order and democracy in the face of the creeping menace of terrorism. 
   The message we send today will be heard in our hometowns, on the battlefields of Iraq, and all around the world. That message is that we in this Chamber are prepared to stand together to do what it takes to forge a strong, sustainable and bipartisan U.S. policy in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for those who question the role of religious expression and religious faith in our national history and in our public square, I rise tonight to read a nationally broadcast prayer that was read on D-Day, June 6, 1944, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as our troops landed at Normandy. I am reading this prayer in the House tonight to both commemorate this event and to honor the men and women of our Armed Forces. 
   ``Almighty God, our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity. 
   ``Lead them straight and true. Give strength to their arms, stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith. 
   ``They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return again and again; and we know that by Thy grace and by the righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph. 
   ``They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without rest until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the violences of war. 
   ``For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice arise and tolerance and good will among all Thy people. They yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the haven of home.     
   ``Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom. 
   ``And for us at home, fathers, mothers, children, wives, sisters and brothers of brave men overseas, whose thoughts and prayers are ever with them, help us, Almighty God, to rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of great sacrifice. 
   ``Many people have urged that I call the Nation into a single day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips, invoking Thy help to our efforts. 
   ``Give us strength, too, strength in our daily tasks, to redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the material support of our Armed Forces. 
   ``And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our sons wheresoever they may be. 
   ``And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in thee; faith in our sons, faith in each other, faith in our united crusade. Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but fleeting moment, let not these deter us in our unconquerable purpose. 
   ``With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and racial arrogancies. Lead us to the saving of our country, and with our sister nations into a world unity that will spell a sure peace, a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy men, and a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, reaping the just rewards of their honest toil. 
   ``Thy will be done, Almighty God. Amen.''

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (MICHAEL A. MARZANO DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINIC -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, and I particularly want to thank the chairman and my good friend and colleague, Mr. Altmire, for making the timely consideration of this legislation possible on the floor today. 
   I arise to ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1594. It does something that I think every veterans' organization in Mercer County has asked us to do, which is to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Hermitage, Pennsylvania, as the Michael A. Marzano Outpatient Clinic. 
   Marine Sergeant Michael Marzano, as you have heard, was killed on Saturday, the 7th of May, 2005, while on assignment in Iraq. I arise here to ask you to support this legislation with a great deal of emotion because this man was the first soldier from Mercer County to give his life in the global war on terror. 
   I can't express myself on this as well as his commanding officer expressed it in a letter which I was given and which I would like to read a portion of. 
   ``On 08 May 2005, enemy insurgents fired from positions within the local hospital attacking U.S. Marines in the city of Haditha, al Anbar province, Iraq. Patients and the medical staff were forced to remain in the hospital while enemy forces triggered this attack that included a Suicide Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device. The SVBIED exploded approximately 30 feet from the hospital patient ward, killing four Marines from 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines and igniting a fire within the hospital. 
   ``Lance Corporal Lance Graham watched his platoon from above as he always did above his machine gun. Sergeant Michael Marzano's leadership and humor rubbed off on everyone round him. Sergeant Aaron Cepeda always welcomed new members to his platoon like they were part of his family. Finally, one Sailor who we will always call 'Marine' because he continuously acted like one, Petty Officer 3rd Class Jeffrey Wiener, all gave their lives that day. They had the job of protecting the force as the Quick Reaction Force and many more lives were saved due to their sacrifice. All four gave the rest of the platoon precious minutes that allowed the Marines to return fire immediately, resulting in the insurgents going on the defensive. 
   ``Because the bravery of the men of Mobile Assault Platoon 7, the remainder of the force of over 70 Marines and Sailors sustained the attack and protected the hospital. The members of the 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines, will always honor and remember what they did. We remember our friends fondly. The memory of their leadership, courage, and sacrifice live on in the Marines and Sailors who served with them. Even in passing, they still continued to protect their brothers.'' 
   Signed, Captain John A. Kasparian. 
   Mr. Speaker, on October 16th, 2006, after a lot of work by several of us in the delegation, the veterans hospital in Butler, Pennsylvania, opened a Mercer County Outpatient Clinic in Hermitage. Almost immediately, veterans from Mercer County contacted me asking to have the new clinic named for Sergeant Marzano. 
   My staff confirmed their tales of Sergeant Marzano's heroism, and I requested input from my veterans' advisory panel to determine if there were  other candidates for this honor. All of the respondents, including the families of other fallen soldiers, universally agreed that Michael Marzano deserved this honor. He was the first to die in Iraq from Mercer County. He epitomizes the bravery and the dedication of all of our country's best. He deserves to be remembered, as does everyone who has given their lives in that conflict. 
   Sergeant Marzano's friends and family have already mourned his death. But with this legislation, we will honor his courage and present his life as a worthy example for future generations of young men and women. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in this worthy honor to this remarkable soldier.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering today would redirect a very modest amount of funds from NOAA to the United States International Trade Commission, we hope to good effect. 
   The ITC serves on the frontline in the trade war against unfair and illegal imports. The Commission, an independent, quasi-judicial Federal agency, is part of America's critical network of ``trade cops.'' 
   The Commission investigates the effects of dumped and subsidized imports on domestic employers and American workers, and conducts global safeguard investigations on import surges. The Commission also adjudicates cases involving infringement by imports of intellectual property rights. 
   Very simply, this amendment presents a clear choice and a simple one: Jobs for constituents in industries threatened by illegal and predatory trade practices, or more money for administration and bureaucracy. 
   Whatever an individual Member's views on international trade, no one can disagree with the notion that the United States is becoming more and more integrated into the global marketplace. U.S. exports are increasing; and, perhaps unfortunately, so are imports. 
   Unfortunately, all too often countries do not fulfill their promises to stay within the rules of the global trading system. These rulebreakers do not only cheat the system at our expense, but their action has the effect of costing America jobs. It is precisely for these reasons that we have laws on the books to police our markets, to combat illegal trade practices like dumping, subsidies and intellectual property theft. These laws, however, are only as good as the enforcement mechanism that sustains them. 
   There are countless examples of employers in congressional districts across the country that are being adversely affected by illegal trade practices. Everything from Channellock pliers in my district, or the Club in your car, to Zippo lighters are under assault by intellectual pirates. Everything from tires to lemon juice to honey to live swine to furniture to computer chips is under assault by illegal subsidies or dumping. And everything from steel pipe, hangers and brake drums and rotors are under assault from Chinese import surges. These industries illustrate the range of American employers that turn to the Commission to hear their case when our trading partners run afoul of their obligations. 
   And because of the volume of cases before the Commission, which is exploding, it is incumbent upon us to provide the necessary resources to our trade cops. 
   Intellectual property cases before the Commission have more than tripled since fiscal year 2000. The Commission expects an increase in dumping and antisubsidy investigations for the fiscal year 2008 compared to a relative decline in 2005 and 2006. 
   Also, the Commission will be tasked with examining the economywide economic impact that pending FTAs will have on our country. 
   All of these facets of the Commission are far too important not to put the necessary resources into the Commission to allow it to complete its mission. If we are concerned about the effects that illegal and unfair trade is having on the average working American, this amendment is the very least we can do. 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, this amendment presents a simple choice, jobs for constituents in industries threatened by illegal and predatory trade practices, or more money for administration and bureaucracy. I choose American jobs, and I hope my colleagues join me in passing this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, our friends on the other side of the aisle have proposed a so-called energy bill that they claim will promote America's energy independence. In reality, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats have presented the House Chamber with a placebo that will ultimately reduce domestic energy production, give American energy companies less of a reason to invest in exploration here at home, encourage greater dependence on foreign oil, and damage America's manufacturing base. 
   H.R. 6 has become another political football for the Democratic Party. And, frankly, Mr. Speaker, as The Washington Post rightfully editorialized yesterday, energy policy deserves more serious treatment. 
   The Democrats' solution to America's energy crisis is to single out oil and gas producers for a tax increase. The fact is, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is not likely to impact oil producers' profits in any way, shape, or form. This is energy policy by focus group, not a serious prescription for achieving America's energy future. 
   The one thing that we can be assured that this bill will do is raise prices at the pump for America's consumers. Furthermore, it creates disincentives that will decrease the supply of domestic natural gas and oil and increase our country's energy imports. 
   While H.R. 6 not only forces our country to become more dependent on foreign oil, it will also force America's working families to bear the brunt of increased energy costs. 
   The $6.6 billion tax increase embedded in this bill will inevitably be borne entirely by consumers in the form of higher gasoline and home energy prices. The effects of high gas prices will ripple throughout the economy, increasing prices on everything from electronics to school supplies. Like the Keystone Kops, the House leadership aims at one target but ends up hitting the American public.     
   In addition, the Democrats have yet to detail what exactly they will do with an additional $14 billion in revenue. In my view, such excess revenue will provide the Democratic leadership with a liberal slush fund to curry favor with one industry over another. 
   If Democrats want to invest in new energy technologies, they should debate and define their priorities openly. This, Mr. Speaker, is political pork barrel at its worst. 
   Finally, H.R. 6 is an assault against America's manufacturing base. Using nearly one-third of the Nation's energy, both as fuel and feed stock, energy production is the very heart of American manufacturing. With such an energy-intensive industry, raising energy prices will make domestic manufacturers less competitive in the world market. This is one reason why the National Association of Manufacturers has firmly opposed this bill. 
   By making the oil and gas industries ineligible for the section 199 deduction for domestic manufacturing activities and changing current amortization rates for the geological and geophysical costs incurred in energy exploration, H.R. 6 will further erode the U.S. comparative advantage, forcing more and more of our good-paying manufacturing jobs overseas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have long advocated for a comprehensive energy policy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and increase America's access to clean, affordable and dependable energy for their cars, homes and businesses. H.R. 6 is simply not the answer. 
   This legislation is bad energy policy and bad tax policy which explains why the Democratic leadership shoehorned it through the process without a committee markup or even a single public hearing. 
   We must stand up for American manufacturers, stand up for American consumers, and preserve our domestic energy supply. So I urge my colleagues to join me today in opposing H.R. 6 and supporting the Republican alternative. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, in response may I yield myself 15 seconds, simply to point out to the majority leader that he is terribly mistaken if he thinks he is repealing a special tax break. In fact, oil and other energy production was treated the same way under the tax bill that was passed as all other manufacturers, and this differential treatment is one of the reasons why the National Association of Manufacturers so strongly opposes this bill. This does not fulfill any of their commitments on energy any more than the underlying rule fulfills their commitment to an open process.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about the tax increase that's coming. Now, we know that in the budget that the Democratic majority put together in the House, they posited the largest tax increase in American history. But that's not the tax increase that I have been referring to. The tax increase I am talking about is something that had its genesis in the 1960s, was renewed in the 1980s, was never insulated against inflation and has been allowed to run riot across the American Tax Code. 
   The tax increase I am talking about is the alternative minimum tax. In the late 1960s, the alternative minimum tax was created to deal with, at most, several hundred dread taxpayers. They were the people at the very pinnacle of the American economy who somehow were able to position themselves using a hyper-complicated Tax Code, using it to free themselves almost completely or, in some cases, completely, of tax liability. 
   In the late 1960s, correctly, Congress, looking at the complexity of the Tax Code and looking at this outcome, thought that isn't fair. So they created an alternative calculation that would provide that everyone pay at least a certain tax liability. That policy was renewed and actually expanded in the late 1980s when Democrats controlled the House of Representatives. 
   In the process, this alternative minimum tax was applied to what was then very high-income thresholds. Lo and behold, it was never indexed to inflation. Accordingly, more and more people have fallen under this alternative unfavorable tax calculation, which I am going to talk about in this hour, and more and more people that we would consider to be middle class have found themselves under the alternative minimum tax. 
   More and more small business owners have seen the incentives that they expected to get for making investments in the economy stripped away. More and more families have seen pro-family tax policies taken away from them by the alternative minimum tax. 
   Far from applying to a few hundred taxpayers, today the alternative minimum tax is applied to nearly 3 million taxpayers. But in past Congresses, quietly, we have moved to at least protect the people who would have been hit in recent years with additional tax liabilities from being covered. We have put in place a series of patches, patches that would protect taxpayers that we wanted to give tax relief from being hit with the AMT. 
   Those patches have become more expensive. To apply the annual patch next year, we would have to, in effect, set aside $47 billion to do it. But if we don't do it, not a few hundred taxpayers, not 3 million taxpayers, but 23 million taxpayers in America, including a significant part of the middle class, would have to pay the AMT. 
   That, frankly, is flat-out unfair and unsustainable. It's a tax increase that Congress had never intended and that the last few Congresses have acted to protect the middle class against. 
   Yet what has happened here, we find that the majority, the House Democrats, particularly, and their budget, haven't set aside a dime for a patch to deal with the AMT. They want to spend the money, even as they want to spend the money from the lapsing of some of the tax policies that we put in place at the beginning of the decade. They don't call it a tax increase, but they take the money and run. 
   By not fixing, by not patching the AMT, implicit in their budget is a major tax increase on top of that, on a major part of the middle class. Yet it's far worse than that, because we have been hearing recently in the committee that I serve on, the Ways and  Means committee, that some in the majority want to make changes in the AMT, supposedly to reform it. But they do it by raising taxes elsewhere, and that's what I am here tonight to argue against. 
   If we deal with the AMT, not by controlling spending and by putting in place a long-term fix, but by simply raising taxes, we run the risk of having a dramatic impact on the economy. I have some numbers here that I think put this into a fairly dramatic perspective. As we have looked at the bracket creep, we have seen many middle class families, particularly in communities with higher taxes and higher standards of living, paying, potentially, the AMT. 
   What we have looked at is that some of the proposals that have been laid out there would provide AMT tax relief to middle class taxpayers by increasing the tax burden. Specifically, we understand that some in our committee are considering an AMT exemption for families earning up to $250,000. 
   That sounds great, but it also, potentially, will raise taxes at the high end. We have just had an election in France. In France, one of the issues was that their economy hasn't been very dynamic because of their top tax rate. The top tax rate in France is about 48 percent. Unfortunately, fixing the AMT would require so much revenue that if it's only done through raising the top rate, our top tax rate would be in the range of 48 percent. That would be a significant break on the economy. 
   Let me put this into a local perspective. I represent a district where not many people are in the highest income levels, but we have many local businesses and many local manufacturers that are subchapter S companies. They are closely held relationships, and they exist, basically, and pay personal income tax rates. This would, in effect, on some of our most dynamic job-creating local companies put the brake on their growth. 
   This is a direct tax on jobs in the emerging economy. As such, it is a real concern in a place like northwestern Pennsylvania where we have mainly people who are working class and middle class and very few high-income people. We think that this would have a big impact directly on our local economy. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I am very concerned that we get this right, and I am also very concerned, not only that we fix the AMT but also that we do it in the right way. Now, we have a proposal, and I think it's very important to realize there is a proposal out there to repeal the individual AMT. 
   I am a cochairman of the zero AMT caucus, and I am prime sponsor of a bill, H.R. 1366, that would flat out repeal the AMT. In my view, the AMT is a Frankenstein's monster, which over the years has affected more and more taxpayers by subjecting them to a parallel tax system that arbitrarily and sometimes unpredictably deprives them of tax preferences and incentives that they have planned for. 
   In effect, the AMT runs the risk of punishing millions of middle class Americans every year with a tax that is, as I have said, was intended only for a handful of the highest level earners. My legislation once and for all would rid the Tax Code of this arcane and unfair tax policy and remove a significant barrier for economic growth in the American economy. 
   The AMT is not only a source of higher taxes; it's a source of complexity in the Tax Code. Getting rid of it is a priority for many of those who have advocated a simpler Tax Code. 
   The AMT, I believe, is unfair on the face of it, because it is now applied to a whole host of taxpayers that Congress had originally told them, this will never apply to you. While the structural features of the regular income tax are indexed to inflation, the AMT is not. As a result, as incomes have risen over the past 20 years, more and more taxpayers have fallen into the AMT. I think that Congress needs to act now. Act now to repeal the AMT or at very least to patch it. 
   As I said earlier, it would take $47 billion, which is a lot of money, but in a $3 trillion budget, it's something that we could find the room to do. Patching for 2 years would cost, they estimate, $110 billion. That's also something that's expensive, but it's something that we should be prepared to do. 
   An alternative approach would be to make the AMT a temporary tax provision. I have argued potentially for doing that if Congress does not have the will to pursue flat out repeal. But the idea of getting rid of the AMT by simply raising taxes is very, very dangerous. 
   I was always struck by a quote from H.L. Mencken, ``When a new source of taxation is found, it never means, in practice, that an old source is abandoned. It merely means that the politicians have two ways of milking the taxpayer where they previously only had one before.'' 
   I think that the unfortunate thing about the AMT is that it is generating now so much revenue that people in Washington are afraid to do away with it. I think we need to have an aggressive approach to getting rid of the AMT that does not simply shift the tax burden more to taxpayers. 
   We need to come up with a creative way of dealing with this problem. I believe that there is the will to do it. I have offered to work across party lines with my colleagues on the other side, and I want to extend that offer again today. 
   I do think that if we approach this as something that has to be fixed through a combination of savings and maybe other changes in tax policy, there is going to be a range of ways that we could deal with this problem and certainly to protect the middle class from the AMT falling on it.     
   But we are concerned when we hear the press reports that suggest that the House Democrats simply want to use this to raise taxes. 
   Here is what in effect they are doing. They are taking that additional 20 million taxpayers and they are effectively holding them hostage for a higher tax level which is going to generate revenue for them to fulfill their campaign promises. We think that there has got to be a better way of doing that. 
   We are also concerned that the AMT can become a locomotive, recognizing that many taxpayers will otherwise be hit by liabilities that AMT relief will become a basis for running through a bill that generates much higher levels of revenue, in effect, manufactures a crisis. That way, the AMT bill becomes a locomotive for driving much higher taxes in the economy. 
   Today, I would argue very simply, Mr. Speaker, that Washington take a very high percentage of what people earn in America today. The problem and the source of our national deficit is not the fact that we don't generate enough revenue. In fact, revenue has been growing steadily on a year-to-year basis. The problem is not that we haven't entertained tax increases, because in effect we have been passing and adopting tax policies; curiously, through lower capital gains rates we have been generating more revenue from capital gains. The problem has not been a lack of revenue. It has been a lack of spending restraint. And, unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle have approached the AMT problem exclusively as one that needs to be dealt with through revenue. 
   I think people need to understand what level of taxpayer we are talking about here. The AMT would be applied to people who are authentically middle class. I am struck here by the fact that if we look today, Washington is left to deal with this growing monster that is the AMT that is going to ensnare 23 million Americans come April 15, 2008. It operates as a parallel tax system, and in effect it takes away from taxpayers some preferences that Congress had firmly intended to them. This, I think, represents something that is fundamentally unfair. 
   We are talking here that, for the year 2006, under the AMT, the basic exemption from the AMT is only $62,550 for joint returns. This is not, in my view, a wealthy couple. It is $42,500 for a single and head-of-household returns, which in turn is subtracted to obtain AMT taxable income. It is the income above that that pushes people into the AMT. 
   These exemption levels, as I have pointed out, are the result of a patch that past Congresses have enacted. In other words, they are temporary and are scheduled to revert in 2007 to their prior levels of $45,000 for joint returns and $35,750 for unmarried taxpayers. 
   The basic AMT exemption is phased out for taxpayers with high levels of AMT income. A two-tiered rate structure of 26 percent and 28 percent is assessed against AMT taxable income.  The taxpayer then, and this is how it works, compares his AMT tax liability to his regular tax liability and pays the greater of the two. As a result, middle-class Americans, hardworking families, are falling victim to what was, and always was, intended to be a policy that was aimed at the wealthiest and which ultimately at the end of the day is simply bad tax policy. 
   We think that we need to do a better job of dealing with the AMT, but to do that, simply raising taxes, is the wrong way to go. 
   How high would taxes have to go to deal with the AMT problem? I am struck by an estimate by the Urban Institute in Brookings Tax Policy Center that took a look at this question and came back with some startling figures. They argue that, in order to repeal the AMT, the majority, if they were to do that simply through tax increases, would have to increase the top three brackets very substantially. This study estimates that the majority would have to increase the 28 percent, 33 percent, and 35 percent brackets to 32.2 percent, 38 percent, and 40.3 percent respectively. 
   On top of the already enormous tax increase in the Democrats' budget, this level is confiscatory tax policy and it is a recipe, in our view, for a quick and nasty economic slowdown. 
   Well, I sincerely believe that there is the potential for a bipartisan consensus here. I think what we are seeing is a setup for much higher taxes; and that is why I am here on the floor tonight, to blow the whistle on it. 
   In my own district, in Pennsylvania's Third Congressional District, in 2005, a little over 2,700 taxpayers were impacted by the AMT. By contrast, if Congress does not act, in 2007, roughly 18,500 taxpayers will be hit with the AMT. This is a serious tax bite, and it has to be dealt with in a serious way and not simply by raising taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, the AMT is a classical example of the rule of unintended consequences. The fundamental reason for the spread of the AMT is that the exemption amount was never indexed to inflation. As a result, the AMT spread rapidly before the 2001 and 2003 tax laws were adopted, and it would have continued spreading without those laws. It is projected to spread further after 2010, even if those laws are sunset. Taxpayers who move on the AMT in 2007 through 2010, due to the 2001 and 2003 tax laws, will still enjoy a net tax cut from those laws. 
   The most recent attempts to deal with the AMT have been through the use of patches; yet, I would argue that a more comprehensive solution is more desirable. 
   You know, it is also important to realize, we had an opportunity to repeal the AMT in 1999. It passed the House and it passed the Senate. It was part of a broader tax bill, and it was recognized at that time to be a very important priority. Repealing it at that time was something that we knew we could afford to do; yet, in 1999, the Clinton administration vetoed that legislation. Unfortunately, some of those who now want to deal with the AMT by raising taxes voted to sustain that veto, voted in effect to leave in place a tax that was never intended for the middle class. 
   The individual AMT doesn't just affect individuals. It also hurts small businesses. The many small businesses that pay the individual AMT lose the benefit of important tax incentives, such as the R&D tax credit, the work opportunity tax credit, accelerated depreciation, and many other general business tax credits. It is, anyone who has been in it and any accountant will tell you, ridiculously complicated and arbitrary. It is almost impossible for the average taxpayer and small business owner to calculate the AMT without help from a tax preparer or from tax software. 
   If we are serious about dealing with the problem of complexity in the Tax Code, one of the quickest things that we could do, one of the simplest things that we could do is flat-out repeal the AMT. We think this is something that ought to be of direct interest to us today, and we are very concerned that this real problem is being commandeered by those who simply want to raise taxes. 
   Our solution is that we want to see action today. We want to see both parties come together and talk about this problem honestly, not just discuss plans to raise taxes behind closed doors. We want to see an opportunity here today to discuss how we can use fiscal discipline and restrained spending to get rid of the AMT, or to potentially sunset it and phase it out over time. It is not too late to do that. 
   We believe that there are ways to deal with the AMT as an alternative that don't require us to bring our top tax rates up to the level of France. I believe that there are means of dealing with this problem without sucker punching our economy. I believe that we have the opportunity to deal with this problem fairly and honesty without presuming a tax increase. 
   We tend to forget this in Washington, but when somebody is paying out more in taxes, that is a tax increase. Whether that tax increase was the phaseout of a tax provision that was put into the law years ago and simply not renewed, whether that change in tax policy is something that was a policy from the 1960s that was never adjusted or modernized, the fact is we anticipate a tax increase unless we show fiscal restraint this year. And the Democratic budget, in addition to positing the largest tax increase in American history, has manufactured this AMT crisis and created a challenge for us that the Democrats are apparently proposing to respond to simply by raising taxes. 
   When people hear that the only folks experiencing the tax increase are going to be the highest income people, that doesn't tell the whole story, because so many jobs are tied up in companies that are also taxed at those rates. This is a challenge that I think requires an authentic bipartisan solution, not just a tax increase. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas such time as he may consume.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. First of all, I want to thank the gentleman for his stirring words. I can say in northwestern Pennsylvania, we have watched the developments in Kansas with horror, because it was just a couple of decades ago that we had a series of major tornado events that very much marked, seemingly immutably, many of our rural communities. And I think of Albion, Pennsylvania, and how it took years for its downtown to bounce back. 
   Can I reassure the gentleman that I think all of his colleagues appreciate his plea, appreciate the terrible dilemma facing so many of his constituents? And you can count on our solidarity in this effort. 
   And it seems a little trite to point this out, but I have to say, the gentleman has always been one of the most eloquent voices for rural America. He has done a great job here tonight of laying before us the plight of this community. But we are particularly grateful for his advocacy tonight, and I want to say, our prayers will be with you. Our resources will be with you, and Northwestern Pennsylvania will be there for Kansas in any way we can help out.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for his contribution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am going to keep my remaining remarks brief and, again, salute the gentleman for taking the time to come down and share the experience of his district and his community with this awful weather disaster, which we in northwestern Pennsylvania certainly understand and certainly we will reach into our pockets and be generous in helping our fellow Americans. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to, for a moment, return to my prior topic, put my green eye shade back on and talk about the AMT and its potential effect on taxpayers. 
   You know, one point that I hadn't had the opportunity to make earlier, was that over the past few weeks, in the ramp up to what we fear will be an attempt to use the AMT as a basis for a broader tax increase, we've heard made the strange argument by our friends on the other side of the aisle that somehow, the AMT is falling on more families because of the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003. This argument has been echoed within the Ways and Means Committee, and it's bizarre on the face of it. But there are actually arguments that are being made trying to connect these dots and square this circle. 
   The argument is that, as a result of reduced income tax rates relative to the AMT, more taxpayers are subject to the AMT. Conversely, this logic maintains that if income taxes are increased, less people would be subject to the AMT. It's an odd reform that raises taxes on Americans, and this smells an awful lot like robbing Peter to pay Paul. After all, if taxpayers are paying the AMT, or paying the basic income tax, one way or the other, what is relevant to them is how much they're paying. 
   The argument we are hearing from the other side simply runs roughshod over the facts. The AMT is growing significantly because the tax brackets involved were never indexed to inflation. Clearly, no American is worse off under recent tax relief. And fewer taxpayers are subject to the AMT than otherwise would be as a result of the patches that that tax relief contained. 
   I have, I believe, a number of charts, but I am not going to trouble you with them at this time of the evening, that demonstrate that this problem has been stated in an unusual way. It is misleading to claim that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts led to more people paying the AMT. 
   The fact is, between the patches and the tax cuts, fewer people are paying the AMT today than would have under pre-2001 tax laws. This is a very important revelation. 
   The fact is, past Congresses have moved, in budget after budget, to protect the middle class from the ravages of the AMT. Notwithstanding that, the AMT now hits nearly 3 million taxpayers, where it was originally designed only to hit a few hundred. Without a patch, the AMT would fall on 23 million taxpayers. 
   Because of that added tax liability on 20 million taxpayers, fixing the AMT is certainly a challenge. But to me, it's a much bigger challenge to argue that somehow we should let the AMT fall on these people when it was never conceived as a tax to be applied to them.     
   The fact is the AMT at the current rate runs the risk of crowding out the rest of the tax code and becoming the Tax Code, and that would be a disaster. The AMT does not treat families as favorably. It does not treat small business investment as favorably. It doesn't have the nuances of the current Tax Code, and it simply has higher rates. 
   We believe that in the end, the real solution is fundamental tax reform, to move to a reformed tax system that contains no AMT but through its simplicity also requires no AMT to guarantee that everyone pays what they are obliged to pay. Through simplicity we can reduce the tax gap. We can make the Tax Code more predictable, and we can provide through fewer loopholes fewer opportunities for people to take unfair advantage. That is the real solution at the end. 
   I believe, though, that we are going to see this year a concerted effort by the new majority to do what they did the last time they were in the majority, and that is to push through massive tax increases. The AMT, it looks like, is going to be their first excuse to do it. So it is going to be the first real test of this Congress, whether it is going to take a different route than that that we traditionally expect or whether it is going to go down the old path of tax and spend, raising taxes, expanding the size of government, and ultimately hitting the taxpayers in newer and more subtle ways. 
   Enacting French tax structures is not the solution to growing the economy. It is not the solution to the deficit, and it is not the solution to the AMT. 
   I think the time has come for Congress to deal with this issue honestly, to bring it out into the open. My hope is that our committee, the Ways and Means Committee, will have an opportunity to do hearings specifically on this point. As ranking member of the Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee, I also hope that we have the opportunity there to more closely examine the AMT and to build on recent hearings to look at actual solutions and come up with a solution that reduces the tax burden and protects the middle class rather than simply raising taxes. That may be a challenge that requires statesmanship, but I believe the time has come to deal with this issue directly. 
   Anyone who, I believe, signs on to what the papers tell us might be the solution here can't claim that they are following certainly the dictum of Americans for Tax Reform, which years ago got many Members of Congress to sign a pledge not to raise taxes. I believe that any AMT solution that raises taxes will put Congress on record as being in favor of Big Government and higher taxes. I believe that we need to look at creative alternatives and the time has come for that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to take my party's leadership hour.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I must tell you, Mr. Speaker, I have seen this FTA evolve and I have watched it, representing as I do an area of the country where we have seen both the positives and the negatives of globalization and of trade, and I watched this FTA fully prepared to be skeptical. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to rise in strong support of this free trade agreement on the strength of the fact that it clearly will further advance America's economic as well as political and foreign policy interests. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, since 1991 our country's commercial partnership with Peru has been driven by unilateral preferences extended to Peru under the Andean Trade Preference Act. Over the past 16 years, Peru clearly has demonstrated its commitment to that agreement in both terms of political and institutional resources. After making significant strides in shifting away from production and shipment of illegal drugs, Peru has become a proven ally and has established itself as a steadfast partner in combating narcotics trafficking, countering regional terror groups, and helping to supply America's energy needs. Approval of this trade agreement will be a critical signal to the Peruvian people and not only help to promote closer ties but to open the door to a new era of trade for our country. 
   We recognize that the Peruvian economy is roughly the size of the State of Louisiana that the distinguished ranking member represents. It is roughly the size of Louisiana as of 2005. While Peru is not an enormous market, it is still a significant opportunity for U.S. exports. 
   In 2006, 98 percent of Peruvian exports entered the United States duty-free under the Andean trade pact. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement levels the playing field by moving beyond one-way preferences to full partnership and reciprocal commitments under which U.S. exports also benefit from duty-free treatment. Under this agreement, 80 percent of U.S. exports would become duty-free from day one and other tariffs on exports would be phased out. 
   The International Trade Commission has estimated that U.S. exports to Peru will grow by $1.1 billion, or more than double the estimated growth of imports from Peru. Additionally, the ITC estimates that the big winners in the U.S. economy will be value-added products, especially in the machinery and equipment sector. The largest import gains from Peru, the ITC estimates, will be inputs, such as basic metals as gold and copper. 
   In addition to being economically complementary, this agreement will provide substantial new opportunities for American farmers' agricultural exports, break down barriers facing U.S. service providers, and strengthen protections for workers. In fact, the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement marks a significant milestone with its inclusion of the most advanced labor obligations of any bilateral or regional trade agreement. 
   Specifically, this trade pact will require Peru to adopt and maintain fundamental labor rights, as stated in the International Labor Organization Declaration Principles and Rights at Work. This includes freedom of association, collective bargaining rights, the abolition of child labor, among others. Mr. Speaker, these standards are an enforceable part of the agreement, and that is in itself a seminal reform. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are additional components that I think make this FTA particularly compelling, including enforceable environmental standards. This is a high standard agreement that furthers the commercial and foreign interests of the United States of America. 
   What this is not, and I emphasize this to my constituents, this is not another NAFTA. This is not a threat to our manufacturing base. I think this is precisely the kind of agreement that many of us have argued for for years. 
   Isn't it time, if we want a stronger trade policy, that we take ``yes'' for an answer? If we embrace this free trade agreement, we have an opportunity to use it as a model for future trade agreements, and that in turn will strengthen the hand and level the playing field for American companies and American workers. 
   For all of my colleagues who share that goal, please vote for this FTA. Please send that message.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to enter into a colloquy with Chairman Visclosky about a critical issue relating to my district, and I appreciate the gentleman's leadership and the minority ranking member's leadership on the issue before us. 
   If I could direct this to Chairman Visclosky, as you know, being from the Great Lakes region, there is an ever-constant threat of shoreline erosion on the coast of the Great Lakes. My district is home to Pennsylvania's only shoreline on the Great Lakes on Lake Erie. Each year it is of vital importance that sand, displaced by winter storms, be renourished and redistributed on that shoreline. 
   Without annual nourishment, the shoreline would erode to the point where natural resources and habitats are jeopardized or even lost. Perhaps the most vivid example of this is Presque Isle. Presque Isle is a unique ecosystem and truly a natural gem. Every year as a State park it receives over 3.4 million visitors and it receives more visitors annually than any national park other than Yosemite. 
   Every year since 1975, the shoreline of this unique feature has received truckloads of replacement sand. This sand has kept the bird sanctuary at Gull Point effectively from eroding away. Birds that have been sighted here or call the sanctuary home include federally endangered species such as the piping plover. Without sand, however, Gull Point and other areas of Presque Isle's shoreline will be washed away, leaving these vulnerable species with even less habitat for recovery. 
   While there are no specific project allocations in this bill at this time, I encourage the subcommittee to allocate sufficient funds to the Army Corps of Engineers' construction account and make every effort to afford the beach nourishment project at Presque Isle at Erie, Pennsylvania, the resources required to be able to restore the sand lost from winter storms. And also, as part of an ongoing Federal commitment, a Federal-State partnership which has existed since the Reagan administration. I thank the gentleman and welcome his consideration. 
   I yield to the chairman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, let me just say first off I think we all owe a great debt of  gratitude to the chairman of the subcommittee and also the ranking member. 
   The chairman of the subcommittee has approached the extended unemployment benefit issue with the sense of urgency that it deserves, and it has been a privilege for me to serve as a cosponsor of the initial legislation that was reported out of our committee. 
   Today, I think it is very important that we act, because in my neighborhood on the west side of Erie, Pennsylvania, people have been increasingly uncomfortable about the growing financial challenges facing our country. But for them, their highest concern and their most immediate concern is their job. And with rising unemployment rates and big challenges in the economy, it is important that we act today to give everyone on unemployment extra weeks of benefits in order to develop a sound footing, to be in a position to have extra time with extra weekly paychecks in order to meet their needs, in order to cover their mortgage, in order to put money back into the community. This will have a positive multiplier effect in many communities in this country and in neighborhoods like mine on the west side of Erie, Pennsylvania. 
   I think it is important, having acted today to stabilize Wall Street, that we reach out to Main Street and beyond to West 6th Street in Erie, where people are facing real concerns about their employment prospects, where people need to know that the safety net is going to be there if they are laid off. 
   This is a bipartisan issue, one that should rise above partisan politics, one that I think should speak to the philosophy of virtually everyone in this chamber. I urge the passage of this legislation. I urge that we act now to get it done and we reassure the working families of America that this safety net is going to be there for them.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (MAKING TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS BETTER FOR THE FUTURE -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, as the United States enters a new era of trade liberalization, where foreign competition and an evolving international market challenge the historic preeminence of America's manufacturing base, Congress must be vigilant in upholding its commitment to working people and update the safety-net programs that were created to help America's families stay afloat during challenging and troubling economic times. 
   As the growing global economy continues to reduce barriers to trade, domestic employers are forced to respond to new opportunities and challenges alike. The Trade Adjustment Assistance programs collectively assist in the transition involved in overcoming these challenges. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, the House passed landmark legislation to extend these critical safety-net programs to American workers and employers who have suffered from foreign trade. The reauthorization of these programs represents an opportunity for significant reform and enhancement and will serve as one of the milestones that can be a foundation for strengthening U.S. trade policy. 
   Since 1975, over 3 million American workers have been certified for assistance under the TAA for Workers program, and more than 2 million workers have directly received assistance. In the last 10 years, the TAA for Firms program has saved more than 60,000 jobs. In my district in western Pennsylvania, more than 20 companies have gone through the program and, as a result, have been able to save and even create new jobs for local workers. 
   Clearly, the TAA programs as a group have an impressive record of success. And the bill that we voted on today, although not designed exactly as I would have preferred, is a strong step forward in strengthening these programs so that they are more efficient, more robust, more flexible and more user friendly. 
   H.R. 3920 would move to overhaul and reauthorize the TAA for Workers, Firms and Farmers programs for an additional 5 years, through 2012. Importantly, the measure would speed the delivery of benefits by establishing an automatic industry certification system for workers negatively impacted by trade. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, the TAA certification process has been a bureaucratic nightmare of red tape that has plagued the program for a long time. H.R. 3920 would replace the current sluggish and Byzantine system which requires the Department of Labor to individually approve the petitions for assistance for these workers. The establishment of an automatic industry certification alone will be a dramatic improvement on current law. 
   In addition, the bipartisan measure would extend eligibility to service workers, such as engineers, boost health care benefits, and improve wage insurance programs. In fact, many of these provisions rather closely mirror legislation that I introduced early this year, H.R. 910, the American Competitiveness and Adjustment Act. 
   As cochair of the TAA Coalition, I have long advocated for the strengthening and streamlining of these critical safety-net programs, and I am proud to have been a part of today's House action, which has been years in the making. 
   By expanding and clarifying benefits, cutting through mountains of red tape and channeling the right resources toward retraining, H.R. 3920 represents the most important restructuring of TAA since the program's inception. In my view, the Congress has a fundamental obligation to American employers and workers to devote the time necessary to make significant improvements to the program this year. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance these commonsense improvements to vastly accelerate and enhance the opportunities afforded workers displaced by trade, as well as augment the competitiveness of American employers before they are forced to furlough workers. 
   TAA has proven to be a lifeline for American workers displaced by trade. It has prevented thousands of American companies from surrendering to the often increased pressure of the international marketplace, despite their innate ability to compete on a level playing field and to succeed in doing so. 
   House passage of this bill clears the first hurdle in helping to make TAA better for the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to act swiftly on this critical issue. American workers, employers and indeed our economy cannot wait.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it's a rare privilege for me to rise here tonight. 
   As the senior Republican in the Pennsylvania delegation, I have certain opportunities and certain obligations. The one that I'm exercising this evening is one that I am particularly pleased to do, not without a certain reluctance, because I'm rising to honor a colleague of ours who is retiring and who has done a great deal for the State of Pennsylvania. 
   I have known Representative JOHN PETERSON, really, since 1981. JOHN PETERSON came to this body in 1996, and he has served with distinction for the last 12 years, but when I first knew JOHN PETERSON, he was then a member of the State House. He had been elected in 1977. He was recruited by local Republicans as the obvious choice when that vacancy occurred, and I first knew him as one of the most energetic members of the State House within the district of my boss and mentor who was then serving in the State Senate. 
   When Senator Kusse retired in 1984, again, JOHN PETERSON was the obvious person to succeed him into the State Senate. There, JOHN PETERSON became known as one of the authorities on rural health care and as one of the strongest advocates for transportation improvements in western Pennsylvania. 
   So it was an obvious thing in 1996 when Congressman Bill Clinger decided to retire that JOHN PETERSON was an obvious but not an uncontested candidate for that seat. After a vigorous primary, which included some fairly famous names, JOHN PETERSON won the Republican primary, and went on to win a convincing election in the fall. 
   My colleague JOHN PETERSON has made a great mark on this institution in 12 years. 
   When he came to the House, he, rather rapidly, established himself as an advocate for rural issues, not only in western Pennsylvania but all over the country, and he has always been a prominent member of the Rural Caucus. Surprisingly, for a member of a delegation from one of the States, from a Commonwealth that was one of the original 13 colonies, he has also been a leading member of the Western Caucus because of the infinity of the issues within his district with western concerns. 
   Perhaps one of the great distinctions about JOHN PETERSON is his representing one of the largest districts, if not the largest district, east of the Mississippi. He has brought an extraordinary energy to the job of representing a district that runs from the Titusville area, in my neighborhood, all the way down to some of the farthest bedroom communities within our State capital area.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (SSI EXTENSION FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2608, the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled Refugees Act; and I was particularly pleased to cosponsor this legislation. And I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in supporting it. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States has been a welcoming Nation to individuals and families fleeing oppression and tyranny in their own country. Repeatedly we've opened our doors to refugees  from places like Nazi Germany, Stalin's Soviet Union, Cuba, China and Vietnam. And more recently, we've taken in dissidents from African dictatorships, Islamic theocracies, the Balkans, Latin America's strongmen, and nations suffering from near total anarchy. We've not discriminated at any time according to race, religion or politics. We have simply asked refugees to demonstrate that they would face violence or oppression at home for any of these reasons, and then made them welcome here in a new home. This is an important part of the American tradition. 
   Unfortunately, refugees often arrive in this country with severe health problems or advanced age. Many of them have spent time in prison or in re-education camps. Some, like the Hmong tribesmen who testified before our subcommittee, have shed their own blood in defense of American values or foreign policy and have been severely punished by their own governments for doing so. Often these health problems leave refugees with limited job prospects or ability to gain the skills necessary to compete for employment. This is particularly true of elderly refugees who may have difficulty learning English. 
   As the chairman and ranking member have explained at length, under current law, these refugees lose their eligibility for SSI benefits, which is often their primary source of income, after they've lived in the United States for 7 years, unless they become citizens. Unfortunately, between the now infamous bureaucracy at the State Department, the difficulties of learning English, and a cap on green cards for refugees, many of these individuals are unable, through no fault of their own, to complete the immigration process in the required 7 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, we did not welcome these refugees to our shores only to see them starve in our streets, nor should we impose the burden of their support on local governments or private sector nonprofit organizations.     
   I am extremely proud that many of these individuals have chosen to make their new homes in northwestern Pennsylvania, particularly my hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania, which enjoys a national reputation for welcoming refugees. But our local communities have very limited resources with which to assist large numbers of low-income refugees. 
   H.R. 2608 wisely recognizes the Federal nature of our obligation to help these people build a new life. It is compassionate yet responsible legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in a ``yes'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a longtime advocate of raising the minimum wage, as someone who supports the McKeon-McCrery alternative because it is balanced and provides incentives for investment and small business and job creation. As someone who worked 10 years ago for the last increase for the minimum wage, working very closely with my then colleague Mr. Quinn of Buffalo, we were able to achieve that. 
   Today, we have an opportunity to raise the minimum wage, but because of the procedural restrictions we face on the floor some are going to be left behind and that is particularly disappointing. 
   While H.R. 2 will provide a $2.10 raise for American workers, sadly, it fails to take into account many Americans with disabilities who are in our workforce. These are disabled Americans who receive SSI disability benefits who are active participants in the workforce and maintaining jobs that give them great satisfaction. Unfortunately, they are left behind because, currently, SSI beneficiaries are limited to $900 per month in order to remain eligible to receive benefits. If the wage hike under consideration today goes into law without raising an earnings limit for people on SSI, Americans with disabilities engaged in full-time employment would either potentially lose their benefits or have to cut back on their hours. That is a decision they shouldn't have to make. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not only a disincentive to work, it is a woefully shortsighted policy, which hopefully we will be able to correct before this law goes into effect. 
   I introduced H.R. 290 which would ensure that workers with disabilities would not lose their payments through raising the earnings limitation on SSI. I wasn't able to offer that provision today because no amendments are being allowed. The result, unfortunately, is, having barred Republicans from having offered this change as an amendment, the majority has created as real victims not House Republicans but Americans with disabilities. And that is a shame. 
   Although an increase in the minimum wage is critical, and I strongly support this bill, I sincerely hope that the new majority will move ultimately to rectify this inequity in this Congress.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to lament a lost opportunity. Mr. Speaker, our friends on the other side of the aisle had promised to produce an energy tax bill that would promote America's energy independence. They had a real opening to produce innovative policies, to incentivize new technologies and promote the diversification of our energy consumption. Instead, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats have presented the House with a placebo that will ultimately reduce domestic energy production, give American energy companies less of a reason to invest in exploration here at home, encourage greater dependence on foreign oil, and damage America's manufacturing base. 
   This bill is energy policy light and consists of a dog's breakfast of stale notions clearly intended to appeal to the blogosphere rather than to market forces.     
   The Democrats' solution to America's energy crisis is to single out oil and gas producers for a tax increase. That is a great sound bite. But the fact is, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is not likely to impact oil producers' profits in any way, shape or form. The one thing you can you can be sure this bill will do is raise prices at the pump for American consumers. 
   Furthermore, it creates disincentives that will decrease the supply of domestic natural gas and oil and increase our country's energy imports. While this legislation not only forces our country to become more dependent on foreign oil, it will also force America's working families to bear the brunt of increased energy costs. The more than $15 billion tax increase built into this bill will inevitably be borne entirely by consumers in the form of higher gasoline and home emergency prices. 
   This is vastly, in fact, about double, the tax increase contained in H.R. 6, a staggering sum that will stifle growth and hit working families' bottom line. The effect of high gas prices will ripple throughout the economy, increasing prices on everything from electronics to school supplies. 
   This legislation is also an assault against America's manufacturing base. Using nearly one-third of the Nation's energy both as fuel and feedstock, energy is the heart of American manufacturing. With such an energy-intensive sector, raising energy prices will make domestic manufacturers less competitive in the world market, forcing more of our good-paying manufacturing jobs offshore. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have long advocated for a comprehensive energy plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and increase America's access to clean, affordable and dependable energy for their cars, their homes and their businesses. Yet, here again, Mr. Speaker, this bill is moving in the wrong direction. It throws out our effective incentives for producing renewable energy and replaces them with retrograde policies. 
   In this bill, the Democrats have created a $6 billion slush fund for local projects in States and cities, with no safeguards to ensure that the money is actually used to improve America's energy independence or the environment. This is a blank check for so-called green pork projects all over the country that mayors and governors can dole out like candy on Halloween. But, Mr. Speaker, this is going to be no treat for the American taxpayer. 
   In addition, the wind credit, one of our most proven and effective sources of renewable energy, gets a substantial haircut in this bill and is effectively, under current conditions, gutted. This legislation is bad energy policy. It is bad tax policy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would hope that our colleagues would join us today in standing up for American manufacturers, for American consumers, and stand up to preserve our domestic energy supply and guarantee our energy future by voting this bill down. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we have had, I think, a very good debate today on the energy tax bill, and I admire the passion on the other side, even if I don't associate myself with all of its particulars. I believe the debate offered Members a chance to hear both good and bad about what is in this bill. 
   The very bad, huge tax increases on American oil and gas companies and on domestic production and the green bond slush fund are removed from our substitute in this motion to recommit. 
   But the fact that I strongly oppose the bill put together by the other side does not mean that the tax code can't play a constructive and creative role in promoting conservation and increasing the use of renewable and alternative fuels. 
   The motion to recommit provides Members of the House with the opportunity to consider a different approach on these issues. 
   This motion would extend many current law provisions designed to encourage the production of alternative fuels and the conservation of energy, many of which the majority saw fit to include in their bill. 
   But several current tax provisions encouraging energy conservation will expire if H.R. 2776 is enacted in its current form, including incentives for individuals to make energy efficiency upgrades in their home, to install solar power and solar water heating capacity, and to purchase hybrid and other fuel-efficient vehicles. 
   I believe the extension of these consumer-based tax credits is important, and I regret that the majority chose not to include them in their bill and rejected, on a party-line vote in committee, an effort to restore the tax credit for making energy efficiency upgrades to existing homes. 
   It is unfortunate that the majority has become so enamored of their tax credit slush fund program that they forgot the tax credits for consumers are highly effective. For example, 2007 hybrid vehicle sales in the United States are projected to be double the level from 2005, the year Republicans first enacted the credit. 
   In addition, my substitute would extend the section 45 production tax credit that has helped increase the amount of electricity generated from sources like wind and biomass and landfill gas. 
   But unlike the bill before us, H.R. 2776 as reported by the committee, my substitute does not reduce the value of the wind credit. Many supporters of the credit, even those who have endorsed the extension provided by the bill, have expressed real reservations that the ``haircut'' given to the credit, that it could threaten the continued rapid expansion of this promising alternative to fossil fuel-powered electricity generation. 
   Finally, let me highlight the fact that the motion to recommit does justice to America's greatest energy source, coal. 
   This country's vast reserves of coal can continue to fuel America's economic engine for decades, even centuries to come. More than half of the electricity in America comes from coal. It would be irresponsible, if not irrational, to ignore this inconvenient truth. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, the substitute would extend and reauthorize the advanced coal and coal gasification investment tax credits. These credits reward companies for investing in promising technologies that convert coal into clean-burning natural gas. By placing a new carbon sequestration requirement on these projects, the provision helps secure our energy security while protecting our environment at the same time. 
   The credit also helps manufacturers who depend on natural gas as a feedstock, because it will ensure a secure, reliable and affordable source of this vital commodity. In doing so, we can help keep the high-paying manufacturing jobs that rely on natural gas right here in the United States. 
   And Mr. Speaker, if Members want to vote for an energy bill that might actually increase the supply of energy, that might actually lower the price of gasoline or heating oil, that will encourage the clean development of our Nation's most abundant energy source, coal, you have your chance right now. 
   Join us in voting for this motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, we cannot express enough the tremendous debt of gratitude we owe the brave men and women who defend our freedoms every day. It is with great honor that I join my colleagues on the House floor today and  help lead the debate on H.R. 3997, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act. This legislation is more than a simple cleanup of some of the disincentives, distortions and oversights that have disadvantaged our active duty military and veterans in the Tax Code. 
   This legislation is significant because it sends a clear message that even as many of our best and brightest are currently in harm's way in theaters where they are facing hostile fire, this Congress is prepared to work on a bipartisan basis to consider every option and every opportunity to improve the lives of their families and their predecessors. 
   The $2.3 billion tax package which was reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee last week will bolster tax and Social Security benefits for military servicemembers, veterans and volunteers. This important measure will allow our active military men and women to benefit from the earned income tax credit by allowing them to pair their nontaxable combat pay with their earned income. 
   H.R. 3997 will ease the financial burden of losing a loved one by allowing survivors to put military death benefits into Roth IRAs without limitations. Furthermore, this legislation will ensure military Reservists will have the opportunity to make penalty-free withdrawals from their retirement plans, including 401(k) and IRA accounts. If deployed, these men and women will be able to provide the financial footing their families may depend on during their absence. 
   I am also pleased that the majority, in bringing this bill to the floor today, included in it an amendment I offered and withdrew in committee. I appreciate the bipartisan support displayed on this critical issue. Specifically, my provision will expand Social Security income benefits to our aged, disabled and blind veterans. 
   Under current law, the Social Security Administration counts annuities paid by State governments to veterans who are blind, disabled or aged as earned income. As a result, veterans in certain States like Pennsylvania, which provides paralyzed vets with an $1,800-per-year annuity, may be denied Federal benefits or receive a lower amount than veterans in States that do not provide such annuities. H.R. 3997 will correct this inequity in the law and ensure that annuities awarded by States to vets with certain disabilities are disregarded when determining SSI benefits. 
   Madam Speaker, the dedication and bravery made by American soldiers have allowed us to exercise our everyday freedoms. Many have made the ultimate sacrifice, and it is our duty in Congress to make sure that veterans rights and interests are protected and served. As many of us prepare for this upcoming Veterans Day, this legislation reaches our Chamber at the proper time and includes the right incentives to help our men and women in uniform. Overall, this legislation is a bundle of commonsense changes to help those who have contributed to the defense of our country and the protection of our freedoms. I am proud to be a supporter of this initiative, and I retain the balance of my time.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   In conclusion, I believe the case has been made compellingly that this legislation consists of many components, but they have been developed within the Ways and Means Committee as a benefit for our veterans and our active duty military. 
   I don't believe there is a great controversy here. What I do believe is there is a lesson. When Republicans and Democrats work together on a bipartisan basis, when they put aside political posturing, when they put aside ideological poses, when they insist on procedural fairness, then I think we can find common ground to move forward on things that are genuinely important. 
   I want to particularly credit the chairman of our committee, Mr. Rangel, and the gentleman from Massachusetts, the chairman of our Select Revenue Subcommittee, for having moved this legislation forward and having set a very high standard. And I would like to take credit for the fact that there has been substantial Republican participation in the development of this bill. 
   This bill, I think, is important to move forward now, but not only for what it consists of, but for what it symbolizes, and that is what this Chamber can achieve when both parties work together. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in reluctant opposition to H.R. 3162. 
   Yesterday, I joined my colleague, the gentlelady from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) in the introduction of a bill which embodied the Senate version of SCHIP reauthorization. I am proud to be an original cosponsor; I fully support that legislation. 
   Unlike the bill we are debating today, the Senate version is far less pernicious and does not raid low-income seniors to pay for an expansion of coverage for middle-class families. 
   Proposed Medicare cuts in this legislation could have a devastating impact on access to Medicare Advantage plans. The seniors that use these plans, if they didn't experience an outright loss of coverage, would, at minimum, experience higher premiums, benefit cuts, or both. 
   According to an April 2007 study by Emory University researchers Ken Thorpe and Adam Atherly, 3 million people would lose their access to MA coverage if Congress sets MA payments at the same level as payments for traditional Medicare. 
   Moving from the macro numbers to the practical effects of seniors in my district, it causes even more concern. Over 15,000 seniors in Butler County, Pennsylvania would experience a 15 percent cut in their plan's reimbursement. Nearly 15,000 seniors in Erie County would experience a 29 percent cut, and over 8,000 seniors in Mercer County would be impacted by a 17 percent cut in their plan's reimbursement should this bill be passed. 
   This blatant raid on seniors' pocketbooks contained in this bill is enough to warrant a vote in opposition. But, Mr. Speaker, the most troubling factor in this bill is that this raid on seniors is being used to pay, in many cases, for families with incomes as high as over $82,000 a year. At a time when so many seniors are tightening their belts on fixed incomes, raiding their pocketbooks to pay for health care for middle-class households is simply not right. 
   I have been a supporter of SCHIP from the beginning. I have trumpeted its success. But this SCHIP reauthorization has been hijacked by people who have a different agenda. We will have another vote on this when it comes back from the other Chamber and from conference. I am voting ``no'' on this wrongheaded approach on a very important issue.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, in my view, there are three Grand Canyons in America. One is famous, and it is in Arizona and, I think, familiar to most in the West. Another is well known in the eastern United States, and it is in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania. 
   The third has opened up since the last election. And here, Mr. Speaker, I am referring to the grand canyon, the gap, between the rhetoric of the Democratic Caucus in the House of Representatives, as witnessed on the floor of the House in the last Congress and in previous Congresses, and the policies of the Democratic Congress since being sworn in in this Congress. 
   I remember, Mr. Speaker, fondly, some of the speeches that were given on the floor of Congress on behalf of the Social Security system. Some fierce, even lachrymose presentations that any additional funding for any new priority inevitably would be at the expense of the balance of the Social Security system, which is seriously in the red. In other words, new spending, because we were running a deficit, was inevitably at the expense of the Social Security system. I have heard our friends on the other side of the aisle make the case repeatedly in previous Congresses to restrict spending because additional funds would be coming out of the Social Security system. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, since the election, Democrats seem to have muted these concerns and Democratic actions have been very different. 
   Mr. Speaker, I propose to give our friends on the other side of the aisle an opportunity to bridge the Grand Canyon. I propose to give the majority a small, perhaps symbolic, but very important opportunity to reach out and express their commitment to fiscal policies that preserve the Social Security balance for what it was intended for: to fund retirement savings. 
   Mr. Speaker, by commingling our Social Security surplus with our deficit-ridden general fund, we potentially expose our Social Security system to risk by shielding our policymakers from their spending decisions to the full consequences and the full balance sheet. The time has come for us to change that practice. 
   Specifically, this motion says that the funding authorized for the Advanced Technology Program will be capped at the previous year's appropriated amount until such time as the Social Security surplus is not used to foot part of the bill. 
   There is no doubt that the ATP program has great merit. But I think we have to ask ourselves, Mr. Speaker, is increasing funding for the program more important than saving the Social Security surplus for future beneficiaries? 
   Mr. Speaker, I serve on the committee of jurisdiction, and recently we had an opportunity to hear from the Social Security actuaries one more time that the Social Security system is at risk, is under enormous pressure, and that the time has come to take decisive steps to make it solvent so that its promise can be fulfilled to the next generation. What we are proposing here today is maybe to begin this process in a small way and create an opportunity for all of our friends in this institution to go on record firmly in an important policy decision and make it clear that we are not going to raid the Social Security fund in the future. 
   This is a very clear issue. It is a very simple issue. It is an opportunity to cut past the rhetoric and, frankly, create an opportunity for us to do something very significant on one of the major issues facing the country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope everyone in this body will join me in supporting this very important initiative on behalf of the Social Security fund. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, with regard to the current debate on the floor on Iraq policy, I would like to offer the following observations. 
   First, I respect the President's constitutional role as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, and I appreciate President Bush's offer to entertain suggestions from Congress regarding Iraq policy. 
   I understand that success in Iraq depends on bipartisan support at home. 
   I applaud U.S. troops who are serving in Iraq with professionalism and bravery. They deserve the support of all Americans. 
   It is becoming self-evident that multiple, extended deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have strained the military. Current deployments and those to come will have lasting impacts on recruiting, retention and readiness of the all-volunteer military. 
   Unfortunately, sectarian violence in Iraq between Sunni and Shia Muslims is increasing, and the failure of Iraqis to reach political settlements and support a unified government greatly contributes to the increased violence. 
   I believe it is time for Iraq's government and security forces to step forward and bear primary responsibility for internal security. 
   As the gentleman from North Carolina noted, the former head of the U.S. Central Command, General John Abizaid, told Congress last November that sending in more U.S. troops would not contribute to success in Iraq because it would prevent the Iraqis from taking more responsibility. 
   It is clear that Iraqi public sentiment opposes the continued U.S. troop presence. 
   In November, the Iraq Study Group called for new diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the region and a change in the primary mission of U.S. forces that will allow the United States to ``begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq responsibly.'' 
   Unfortunately, the Iraqi Government has made little progress toward assuming more responsibility for security, disbanding militias, reconciling sectarian differences and improving essential services. 
   Therefore, I have reluctantly concluded that I have to disagree with the President's plan to send in an additional 21,000-plus combat troops. While I applaud the President's reassessment of U.S.-Iraq policy, I joined with several of my colleagues in January in informing the White House that I did not support an expansion of American troop strength on the ground, and  nothing that I have learned since has caused me to reconsider my position. 
   Nevertheless, Congress should not take any action that would endanger U.S. military forces in the field, including the elimination or reduction of funding for troops in the field. 
   Most Americans fundamentally understand the long-term security interests of the United States would be best served by an Iraq that can sustain, govern and defend itself and serve as an ally in the war against extremists. 
   Overall U.S. military, diplomatic, and economic strategy should not be regarded as an open-ended commitment but should be conditioned upon the Iraqi Government's meeting benchmarks, including the deployment of additional Iraqi troops in Baghdad, equitable distribution of resources without regard to sect or ethnicity, the use of oil revenues to benefit all Iraqi citizens equitably, and granting military commanders authority to make decisions without political interference. 
   Mr. Speaker, with very minor edits, the remarks you have just heard from me summarize the resolution on Iraq offered by Senator Warner in the other body. It is one of the alternative resolutions we should be debating here today. Unfortunately, the majority leadership does not want to allow a full and fair debate on Iraq. 
   When the Democrat leadership in the other body tried to force a vote on the resolution without an opportunity to offer meaningful amendments, the minority was able to insist on their right to a real debate rather than this phony pretense. Unfortunately, we do not have that ability in this Chamber. 
   So I will vote in favor of the resolution before us as offered, as narrow and as inadequate as it is, but I cannot help but express my frustration that the leadership of the House has squandered an opportunity to allow a full and fair debate with real amendments, not just to Republicans, but to all Members of the House, including their own Members whose voices are stifled by this decision to put political calculations ahead of the national interests and a robust debate. 
   I am not sure what the leadership of the majority party is afraid of. If they have the votes to reject alternatives, then they lose nothing by allowing them to be offered. If they do not, they will quickly learn, as we did, that if you need to use procedural games to avoid a tough vote, you have already lost on the underlying issue. 
   I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for allowing me to be a part of this debate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was Ralph Waldo Emerson who once wrote that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. 
   Mr. Speaker, our friends on the other side of the aisle have today trumpeted forward an energy bill which they claim will promote America's energy independence. As the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee noted, this is a serious issue. But for those of you who are inclined to actually keep track of these things, this is actually the fourth time that the majority has advanced this particular flawed proposal in one form or another. That to me is a foolish consistency, or just like a broken record, this bill clearly is not playing with the American people. 
   We fear that it will harm consumers, both individual consumers and companies, and it will also hurt the competitive position of the American economy. At a time when that economy is teetering on the lip of a recession and we are passing through this Chamber stimulus legislation, Washington ought to think twice before we go forward with a bill like this instead of embracing an energy policy that meets the needs of our economy now and that anticipates the challenges of the future. 
   It is clear today that the majority have not chosen this necessary path. In reality, Mr. Speaker, our friends on the other side of the aisle have presented the House Chamber with a placebo that will ultimately reduce domestic energy production, will punish American energy companies that do what we want them to, and that is invest their profits in exploration here at home, will encourage greater dependence on foreign oil, and will potentially damage America's manufacturing base.     
   This bill is not a serious solution. It is ``energy policy-lite,'' and it is clearly intended to appeal more to the blogosphere than to market forces. The Democrat solution to America's energy crisis is to single out what they claim are the five largest oil and gas producers for a tax increase. 
   The fact is, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is not likely to impact oil producers' profits in any way, shape, or form. It is also not limited to the five largest producers, as they claim. The one thing you can be sure that this bill will do is raise prices at the pump for American consumers and create a looming sense of uncertainty which will compound the forces increasing prices today in the marketplace. 
   Furthermore, it creates disincentives that will erode the supply of domestic natural gas and oil and increase our country's energy imports. While H.R. 5351 not only forces our country to become more dependent on foreign oil, it will also force America's working families to bear the brunt of increased energy costs. The effects of high gas prices will ripple through the economy, increasing prices on everything from electronics to school supplies. 
   H.R. 5351 is also, I am afraid, an assault against America's manufacturing base. Using nearly one-third of the Nation's energy both as fuel and feedstock, energy production is the very heart of American manufacturing. With such an energy-intensive sector, raising energy prices will make domestic manufacturers less competitive in the world market, forcing more of our good-paying manufacturing jobs to go overseas. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have long advocated for a comprehensive energy plan that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and increase Americans' access to clean, affordable, and dependable energy for their cars, their homes, and their businesses. Yet, here again, Mr. Speaker, this bill is moving in the wrong direction. It throws effective incentives for producing renewable energy out the window and replaces them with backward and broken provisions. 
   In this bill, the wind credit gets a substantial modification that will dramatically reduce its effectiveness for some of its most successful consumers. This will eliminate a critical incentive to increase renewable energy sources, one that has worked. 
   Mr. Speaker, this version of the Democrats' energy bill is also in an odd way hostile to domestic not only economic interests, but I would argue foreign policy interests. This bill raises taxes on American oil producers while cutting a break for the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, CITGO. In effect, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will take away incentives that have proven to bolster domestic energy production right here at home, while giving more American dollars to, I guess we would call him a tin horn leftist dictator who has threatened to sever Venezuelan energy supplies destined to the United States. Clearly, America's best interests are not in the heart of this plan. 
   This bill further repeals the domestic manufacturing deduction for domestic oil and gas companies, but allows all other oil and gas companies to receive a 6 percent deduction. This creates a situation whereby foreign-owned companies can claim the U.S. domestic manufacturing deduction, but certain U.S. employers can't. 
   H.R. 5351 is simply not the answer. It wasn't in any of its three previous incarnations, and it isn't today. This legislation threatens America's investment, threatens Americans' jobs, threatens the American economy, and puts the consumer at a disadvantage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we defeat this here today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would first like to yield myself 30 seconds to clear the record. 
   It has been intimated here that somehow Hugo Chavez's CITGO does not get a special break, and yet the definition in the bill, I think, clearly excludes it. Basically this bill would repeal the special domestic manufacturing deduction for major integrated oil companies, but under the strict definition included, CITGO is not defined as a major integrated oil company since it does not produce crude oil itself. Based on this, CITGO would continue to receive the domestic manufacturing deduction while a number of U.S.-based companies will not. 
   With that I will retain the balance of my time but yield 3 minutes to a very distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and ranking member of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton).

And this is extremely important. By putting a cap on this credit, it will have the effect of discouraging many from participating in the wind energy credit, and for a district like mine that produces windmill technology, this is a real cause for concern.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I will just yield myself 1 minute to set the record straight. 
   The underlying legislation is not going to, as the last speaker suggested, reduce the dependency of the U.S. on foreign oil. In fact, every analyst who has looked at this suggests it will increase the dependency on foreign oil. It certainly in the short run, courtesy of its $17 billion in tax increases on energy production, will increase prices. And that's because the tax increases that are in here are not taxes on profits. 
   We've heard a lot about oil company profits, but in fact what we are taxing here under their bill is any investment in enhanced production. In other words, any time an oil company takes their profits and invests it in new production and doing what we would expect them to do, we're going to hit them over the head. And this should be a cause for concern because we've heard some rhetoric about how energy costs have gone up, but since they took the majority, gas prices have gone up 30 percent. And under the spot market, a barrel of oil has gone from $55 to $100 a barrel. That is not a favorable trend.

I do want to congratulate the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for having given our Select Revenue Subcommittee the opportunity to explore through hearings what our tax policy should be at energy and policy, and I am hopeful that the day will come when those hearings will yield the results that we would hope. I am afraid today is not likely to be that day. 
   The crisis we are facing is a real one. Mr. Speaker, we are facing a rising global demand for energy of all sorts as the economies of China and India grow. We are seeing the phenomenon of peak oil playing out. Clearly, we are not going to see the growing reserves that we have enjoyed in the past, and increasingly many of the remaining reserves are being mediated by state-owned oil companies with ideological or nationalistic agendas. 
   Our consumers, both our individual consumers and our corporate consumers, are facing the consequences of high prices, and yet we are imposing on our production artificial restrictions on new production. That is the wrong policy at a time like this. And we are facing aging energy infrastructure, whether it is a power grid that frankly is facing brownouts or refineries that are now at 92 percent of capacity. So if any one of them breaks down, we face a shortage in energy. 
   These are real problems. And coupled with them is the legitimate concern about externalities, the fact that greenhouse gases from the consumption of fossil fuels are having an uncertain impact on our climate. And yet in the context of all of that, H.R. 5351 is simply not the answer, Mr. Speaker. It wasn't in any of its three previous incarnations, and it is not now. It is bad energy policy. And it is bad tax policy. There are parts of it that represent a continuity with the policies of past Congresses, and I salute the other side for including the extenders. But just like a car with an empty gas tank, this legislation is a nonstarter. It is not going to go anywhere in the Senate. It is not going to get on the President's desk. And today I would ask all of those who join me with these concerns to join in voting against this wrongheaded bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats took control of this body, prices at the pump were about 30 percent lower. The price on the spot market for a barrel of oil was $55, not $100 the way it was last week. They promised to address the energy crisis that has plagued the economic stability of this country and seek lower prices at the pump for American consumers. 
   Unfortunately, the bill that stands before us today fails to accomplish this goal and fails to meet the needs of the American people. By taking away the very tax incentives that helped promote oil and gas exploration here at home, this bill diminishes domestic companies' opportunity and incentive to produce gasoline. This in turn will raise energy costs for cash-strapped consumers. 
   While the majority party has come to believe that handing out new tax credits and new bonding authority to Governors and mayors is a coherent energy policy, there are many of us in this Chamber who are a little skeptical on that point. 
   These dulcet-sounding bond programs lack effective safeguards to ensure that the money from the newly created liberal slush fund would go toward environmentally sound projects that will promote or improve energy independence in America. 
   This Rube Goldberg device can't be seriously expected to help the average American cope with today's high energy prices. What's more, these things certainly do nothing to help consumers cope with tomorrow's higher energy prices that the tax increases incorporated into this bill will certainly generate. 
   This legislation will not help Americans who carpool to work and will not help working moms driving their children to school. It will not bring down home heating costs for families struggling to make ends meet during this winter season, and it will not lower the cost of fertilizer for farmers. 
   Mr. Speaker, our motion to recommit will help ease the burden of economic hardship for many of these working families. This motion will strike all of the tax increases from the bill at the time when the economy needs more innovative solutions rather than simply stacking tax increase upon tax increase with no help for working families. It will strike the massive haircut that this bill gives to the most effective renewable energy policy in this code, the wind credit. The bill risks undermining the success of the wind credit, which has been the most promising source of alternative energy. This motion to recommit restores it to its full value. 
   This motion also rids the underlying bill of the egregiously wasteful bond program that, in our view, is nothing more than a waste of taxpayer dollars with no real potential oversight. 
   We also eliminate something that I know is dear to some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, and that is the tax incentive for people who ride their bikes to work, and I am sure I will hear about this from my paperboy. 
   This motion represents a much more rational approach for moving American energy policy forward. As we all know, the pro-growth tax policies enacted by Republican Congresses have been a source of fertility in the American economy, helping tens of millions of taxpayers; and for that matter, millions who don't pay taxes but receive refundable tax credits from the IRS every year. 
   While Washington Democrats have continued to demonize tax cuts for only helping the rich, the facts speak for themselves. 
   This motion to recommit preserves two critical pro-growth policies and prevents tax increases for many working Americans. 
   First, it would prevent the current $1,000 child tax credit from being slashed in half in 2011 through Democrat inaction. 
   Second, it would prevent a substantial increase in the marriage tax penalty which is set to occur in 2011. According to the Treasury Department, allowing these tax incentives to sunset will force more than 6 million additional taxpayers to become subject to the individual income tax, and 116 million families will have an average tax increase of more than $1,800. 
   Sunsetting the $1,000 child tax credit and keeping the marriage tax penalty on the books will, without a doubt, subject millions of families to being hit with serious tax increases. 
   What does the majority's inaction on these tax reforms mean? It means higher taxes on low-income families with children and higher taxes on married couples. What does passing the energy bill in front of us mean? It means higher energy prices across the board and greater dependence on foreign oil. What does passing the motion to recommit mean? It means preventing tax increases. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to recommit and against this badly flawed underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and certifying in the process that I am PAYGO compliant, something that will come as a source of great relief to my wife, among others. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule before us today. Very simply, it puts protecting deadbeat taxpayers ahead of shielding unsuspecting citizens from additional taxes and penalties resulting from the majority's inaction on the AMT. 
   Yesterday, I offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the underlying bill. My amendment would have addressed the severe consequences to middle-class taxpayers come next April as a result of the majority's inaction on the alternative minimum tax. As has been noted here, this amendment was fully compliant with PAYGO rules of the House, but it was dismissed out of hand by the majority. As a result, I am here today to strongly urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question on the rule so it can be amended to incorporate consideration of the English substitute. 
   The fact remains that the clock is ticking, and without a minimum amount of effort by this majority in Congress, millions of taxpayers will not only be socked with an unsuspected bill from the tax man in the form of the AMT, they will also be slapped with punitive penalties by the IRS for not withholding enough as AMT taxpayers. 
   My amendment would have created a safe harbor for those taxpayers and not penalized them for something that they did not know they would be subjected to; and, frankly, something they never should have been subject to in the first place.     
   Let's put this in more concrete terms, Mr. Speaker. There are now less than 30 legislative days left in this Congress. So far a bill has yet to be introduced by the majority to spare 23 million American taxpayers from unintentionally being subject to the alternative minimum tax. 
   Now, after having 10 months of the year to deal with this impending explosion of increased taxes on working families, the majority has done absolutely nothing. 
   This is the longest period of time the AMT has been pushed aside, and it is incomprehensible that we're not addressing the fallout from this inaction today, even as forms are being prepared to send out to taxpayers. 
   Working families should not have to pay the price for the majority's inaction on the AMT. In fact, Mr. Speaker, they can't afford to. 
   I oppose this rule because it embraces the misplaced priorities of the majority to chase phantasms rather than deliver real and meaningful legislation to spare working families from a huge tax increase that was never intended for them. 
   My substitute would strike the repeal of the private debt collection program and put in place a safe harbor for unsuspecting taxpayers about to be clobbered by the AMT and then again by penalties. Otherwise, my substitute would leave the bill unchanged. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have to come to grips with the fact that we have to address the AMT. We must do it now. I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and bring a rule to the floor that addresses the immediate and pressing needs of working families in this country.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, there was a time when our national leaders publicly felt the ability to invoke the Creator and invite His blessings on our national causes. 
   On D-Day, June 6, 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt read a nationally broadcast prayer as our troops landed at Normandy. I'm going to read this prayer in the House today, to both commemorate this event and honor the men and women of our Armed Forces. 
   ``Almighty God, our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have set forth upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our republic, our religion and our civilization and to set free a suffering humanity. 
   ``Lead them straight and true. Give strength to their arms, stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness to their faith. 
   ``They will need Thy Blessings. Their road will be long and hard, for the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return again and again, and we know that by Thy grace and by the righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph. 
   ``They will be sore tried by night and by day, without rest until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the violences of war. 
   ``For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice arise and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They yearn but for the end of battle for their return to the haven of home. 
   ``Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive them, Thy heroic servants into Thy kingdom. 
   ``And for us at home, fathers, mothers, children, wives, sisters and brothers of brave men overseas whose thoughts and prayers are ever with them, help us, Almighty God, to rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of great sacrifice. 
   ``Many people have urged that I call the Nation into a single day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a continuance of prayer as we rise to each new day and again, when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips invoking Thy help to our efforts. 
   ``Give us strength too, strength in our daily tasks, to redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the material support of our Armed Forces. 
   ``And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our sons, wheresoever they may be. 
   ``And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee, faith in our sons, faith in each other, faith in our united crusade. Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dull. Let not the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but fleeting moment, let not these deter us in your unconquerable purpose. 
   ``With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and racial arrogancies. Lead us to the saving of our country and with our sister Nations into a world unity that will spell a sure peace, a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy men, and a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise, sadly, to oppose this unconscionable power grab in which the Democrats, who claimed they have changed, have clearly indicated that they are back. They are up to the old tricks that they tried 12 years ago when they were thrown out of the majority. Here they are again using the Constitution as a political Handiwipe and extending full voting rights to favored rotten boroughs. 
   Now what is a rotten borough? During the 19th century in Britain, there were municipalities with tiny populations that were given full voting rights, and it took Britain years to get rid of that political inequity. 
   Today, to these people we are talking about extending voting rights to territories that have a fraction of the population of a congressional district, one territory that has the population roughly of Butler County, Pennsylvania, one of my constituencies; one that has roughly the population of Mercer County, Pennsylvania. And to my good friend from Samoa, and he is a good friend, he represents a constituency with roughly the population of Mill Creek Township in Erie County, Pennsylvania, which I represent. And yet he would be given full voting rights within the Committee of the Whole. That is an outrage.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (ECONOMIC STIMULUS -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, the current subprime housing crisis, coupled with volatile energy prices, rising costs in health care and looming tax increases, among others, have put our country on the dark path of economic slowdown. And although not yet a technical recession, it certainly feels like a recession in the communities that I represent in western Pennsylvania. 
   Clearly, America's hardworking families and employers are feeling the crunch from the slowing economy. 
   While there's a growing consensus in Washington that Congress needs to take action on a stimulus package to stave off further economic challenges, an agreement on how to proceed remains very elusive. 
   In addition to recently participating in a Joint Economic Committee hearing on the state of the economy, I've met with half a dozen respected economists, and I strongly believe that unless Congress acts swiftly on a stimulus package that will inject money into the American economy and incentivize job creation, middle class America will be forced to bear the brunt of our country's economic instability. 
   To be clear, now is not the time for politics as usual. We need to unite to enact sound stimulus legislation that, among other things, will benefit both wage earners and job creators, will encourage investment in good paying jobs, and will put more money back into the pockets of working families. 
   Now, how can Congress achieve these goals on a bipartisan basis? In my view, Madam Speaker, the single best way to help struggling employers in this climate, while providing a jumpstart to the economy, is to allow companies to quickly recapture the money they invest in capital. 
   Congress should step up to the plate today to create incentives for American employers to invest in new equipment, to revive bonus depreciation to boost employer's capital, and to work to enact common-sense policies that will curb the reach of the corporate alternative minimum tax at exactly the time when its reach is most devastating, during economic downturns. 
   At the same time, Congress must explore ways in which we can mitigate the impact of a sluggish economy on low and moderate income families that are now facing new and severe economic uncertainty. 
   By extending unemployment benefits, rolling the income tax on unemployment benefits back, and increasing the child tax credit and providing a significant tax rebate for middle-class families, Congress can ensure that every American has access to the financial resources they need to weather this pending economic storm. 
   While I've outlined a stimulus plan that will create an environment for job growth, reform how we tax American employers and improve UC benefits for the long-term unemployed, Congress must be vigilant in crafting a pro-growth plan that will not disturb the government's fiscal balance. 
   I believe frankly we need to avoid absurd PAYGO rhetoric which, coupled with a liberal budget requiring tax increases, now seems to be hobbling action on the other side of the aisle. 
   Over the past year, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have insisted on a budget that would impose substantial tax increases on a struggling American economy. 
   These Herbert Hoover Democrats have used the labels of tax reform and revenue neutrality as a carnival mask to conceal a policy of higher taxes and higher spending, essentially placing a higher percentage of the American economy under government control, and this at a time when the economy is vulnerable, facing slower economic growth. 
   Instead of setting new priorities, the new majority has chosen to throw priority setting to the wind and have undermined the benefits of the very tax policies that have grown the economy and helped America's middle class. 
   At the time of economic hardship, when Americans are struggling to make ends meet, it would be inconceivable to place additional, unnecessary tax burdens on the backs of middle class America. 
   Madam Speaker, time is of the essence. Putting the economy back on a growth path must be a top priority for Washington. Congress must move on a bipartisan basis to enact a stimulus package that is swift, significant and effective. 
   We need to set aside sterile politics of class warfare and embrace strong pro-growth tax policies that will help benefit everyone by reinvigorating the American economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (TAX BURDEN IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I have been listening this evening to the presentations of the last two speakers and I am struck by how, with powerful presentations, I think with a logic which is difficult to challenge, and with oration rhetoric they have laid out the challenge facing American workers with a tax bill, with a tax initiative coming from the majority that is going to raise taxes on working families, driven by a budget by the majority that took revenues from applying the AMT to 23 million taxpayers and now is requiring the majority to look willy-nilly for ways of bridging that tax gap, we now come to the mother of all tax hikes, which has been rolled out in our committee, presented as a tax reform, but ultimately I think is an albatross that would be a dead drag on the American economy. 
   There are so many problems with the majority's mother of all tax hikes that, frankly, Mr. Speaker, I sincerely doubt that one hour would allow us to do justice to all of them. 
   So tonight I'd like to focus my remarks on how working families in districts like mine are, as a result of the bill, potentially going to be facing one whopping marriage penalty, see a reduction on the value of deductions for things like mortgage interest and State and local taxes. In addition, if they have got kids, they better be prepared to hang on to their wallet because it's going to take the revenue from dropping the child tax credit to $500 from $1,000, and raising the 10 percent bracket to 15 percent. I'd also like to talk about how this bill will make America less competitive and cost America jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, beginning in 2001, the Republican majority at the time took steps to neutralize the marriage penalty. We were successful in reducing this unfair penalty on marriage and families in the Tax Code. Yet, in the mother of all tax hikes bill, the Democrat majority is proposing to resuscitate the marriage penalty and bring it roaring back to life. 
   The MATH bill sets income thresholds for a newly designed surtax. But instead of setting the income threshold for married couples at twice the level of income as the threshold for single filers, the majority creates a gargantuan marriage penalty. In fact, the threshold for married couples is only 33 percent higher than the one established for single filers. This creates a 66 percent marriage penalty for taxpayers affected by this new surtax. 
   This is one way in which the MATH bill moves our Tax Code clearly in the wrong direction. The very same surtax is at the heart of the new marriage tax penalty and is also going to diminish the value of deductions that can be claimed in the filing of taxes. These deductions include the mortgage interest deduction and the deductions for charitable contributions. Under the bill, the deduction for State and local taxes would also be diminished in value. 
   How exactly are the Democrats going to erode the value of these deductions, and that is another shell game, Mr. Speaker. Because they would implement this surtax based on adjusted gross income instead of taxable income, the surtax is applied before you're able to make any deductions.  While that may sound like something that only green-eye-shade types can decipher, it's going to be hard not to understand the next time you end up tallying your taxes. The end result is simple: less money in the pocket of working families all across America. 
   So to recap so far, the Democrats have put forward a bill that socks it to married couples in the form of a brand new mammoth marriage penalty and that decreases the value of any deductions that are available to the claimant, including the standard deduction. What else could they possibly dream up to tax the American family? How about the tax on families with kids? That, Mr. Speaker, is the next station this train wreck of a tax bill heads to. 
   A magnifico in the Democrat Party in the House earlier this year called the alternative minimum tax the parent penalty. I guess that was a poll-tested term. In fact, it was during his national radio address on the AMT when the following was said, and I quote: ``While Republicans were passing multiple tax cuts for the very wealthy over the last 6 years, the Bush administration and the Republican Congress seemed to have forgotten about the middle-class families.'' The new Democratic Congress has made cutting the AMT, the parent penalty, our top priority for tax reform. 
   Curiously, the Democratic budget and the MATH bill don't fix this so-called parent penalty. Instead, it forces the taxman to drop the hammer on working families by increasing taxes on those the Democrats claim to want to help. To understand how the Democrats are now increasing taxes on middle-class parents, we have to go back to 1997 when the Democrats claimed Republicans were focused on cutting taxes for the wealthy. The Republican 
   majority created the child tax credit in 1997, and then increased the credit from $500 to $1,000. It was limited at the top. It was capped in the families by income that would be eligible for it. 
   Also, the Republican majority lowered the bottom tax bracket to 10 percent from 15 percent. Those are working families at the bottom end of the economic ladder who benefit from that. Yet the Democrats in their budget want the child tax credit to revert to $500 and those in the lowest tax bracket to pay 15 percent instead of 10 percent. 
   So using the current level of tax and value of the credit and then comparing it to the tax rates imposed on middle-class families in the MATH bill, just how do parents fare? The answer may surprise you, given all the Democratic rhetoric flying around the Capitol in recent years. Let's look at an example to see what is really going on. 
   Peter and Kelly of Waterford, Pennsylvania, are a married couple with two children and have an adjusted gross income of $45,000 in 2011. They have four exemptions totaling $14,800, plus $13,000 worth of deductions for their charitable contributions, mortgage interest and State taxes. Under the current tax system, Peter and Kelly would have a negative tax liability of $275 and would get a check from the taxman. Under the MATH bill proposed by the Democrats, however, Peter and Kelly would owe the taxman over $1,500. 
   How can that possibly be? After all the Democrats said they wanted to help working families like Peter and Kelly. The fact is that the Democrats are playing fast and loose with their rhetoric and are now playing the game of three-card monte with this family. They say they are removing something called a parent penalty, but by assuming the expiration of the 10 percent tax credit and the child credit declining to $500, the tax bill doesn't lie. This is a big tax increase and in some respects a different standard of living for these parents. 
   That is why it is so important to talk about just how bad this bill is. With all the information in hand, taxpayers won't be fooled by the Democrats' smoke and mirrors. The only ones foolish enough to believe the claims about this bill, I believe, are my colleagues themselves on the other side of the aisle. 
   If that wasn't enough, Mr. Speaker, the majority proposes to vault U.S. individual tax rates to among the highest in the entire developed world. When the surtax included in the MATH bill is combined with the take-the-money-and-run revenue grab of repealing the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the majority would leave the top tax rate at more than 44 percent. Of all the members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, that is the club of the developed world, only five would have higher top marginal tax rates in 2011. This is a staggering increase on the top rate. 
   Some will counter that this increase is only fair because it is directed at only the wealthiest individuals in our country. But those critics would be dead wrong. They would fail to recognize that this crushingly high tax rate will affect small business owners and farmers who report business income through the individual tax code and will cripple the engine of opportunity, job growth and innovation that makes our economy strong. This is the most dynamic part of our economy. 
   In fact, the Heritage Foundation has estimated that this bill, in conjunction with the repeal of the 2001 and 2003 tax policies, would have the effect of eliminating the entire economic output of my hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania, seven times over each year beginning in 2011. 
   All year, Democrats have been blindly and steadfastly hanging on to the misguided theory that taxpayers are worse off as a result of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief. Their theory is that because those taxpayers got a tax cut, they were more likely to go into AMT status and therefore be subject to a higher tax bill from Washington. 
   Not everything in their theory is completely inaccurate. Yes, as a result of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief, more taxpayers were subject to the AMT, and the reason is simple: you are subject to the AMT if your liability under it is higher than your liability under the regular tax. The part they have wrong is that those taxpayers are worse off as a result of now being in the AMT. In fact, they are not worse off than they were, because without the 2001 and 2003 tax policies, they would have paid the same or higher taxes than they do now, even in the AMT. 
   Where this story gets interesting, however, is that the Democrats' own logic is now turned against them and exposes a major flaw in their bill, the mother of all tax hikes. The stakes are high and job creation hangs in the balance. Unfortunately, the mother of all tax hikes will dole out one serious beating, particularly on small manufacturers, on innovators, on entrepreneurs, and ultimately on job creation. 
   To understand why, let's borrow the Democrats' own theory, namely, that if rates are lowered, more taxpayers will be subject to the AMT. Only this time, under the mother of all tax hikes, the taxpayers are getting thrown into the AMT as employers. 
   The individual AMT is not the only monster lurking in the Tax Code. Similar to the individual AMT, the corporate AMT is a horribly inefficient and counterproductive parallel tax system, a source of complexity. The Democrats' bill will, by virtue of modestly lowering the corporate income tax rate, have the effect of increasing the number of corporate AMT taxpayers. 
   What do the Democrats do to head off this problem, which they decried as a fundamental unfairness when the Bush tax cuts did the same things for individuals? Not a thing. Nothing at all. Nada. 
   Why is this more important, you may ask? Won't they be better off than they would have been absent the tax cut? While it may be true that corporate taxpayers thrust into the corporate AMT as a result of the mother of all tax hikes may not pay more tax overall, the corporate AMT has built in disincentives to capital investment and job growth. 
   In short, the corporate AMT, especially for capital-intensive industries, such as the ones in my district, manufacturing, forces employers to choose between investing in their tax bill or investing in job creation. I, for one, have long advocated for a Tax Code that embraces incentives to create jobs, as opposed to a policy that is a dead drag on the economy. 
   In addition, by lowering rates but not dealing with the corporate AMT at the same time, the mother of all tax hikes will further entrench employers already in the AMT. This will make it even harder for those taxpayers to get out of the AMT.  
   The practical consequence of this is that existing corporate AMT taxpayers, being forced to stay in the AMT longer, or even indefinitely, will not be able to use the AMT credits that they have accumulated.     
   These credits are given so a corporate AMT taxpayer will be able to offset future tax liability as a way to make sure that the AMT is not a permanent tax increase. But unless the taxpayer can ultimately leave the AMT, the reality is, in effect, it is a permanent tax increase. In other words, by increasing the strength of the AMT's hold on taxpayers, it will likely translate into a permanent tax increase for some employers that find it difficult to get out of the AMT, and many of these are tax sensitive. 
   This is absolutely the wrong direction for Congress to take. Instead of entrenching the corporate AMT in the Tax Code, we should be repealing it outright. The corporate AMT turns incentives enacted by Congress to spur new investment and create jobs into liabilities. This includes research and development activity and the purchase of new equipment. 
   Because more firms are subject to the AMT during economic downturns, the AMT increases taxes during recessions and decreases them during relatively prosperous periods. This artificially accentuates natural market cycles and unnecessarily destabilizes the economy. 
   The end result is job loss and employers being forced into protracted fears of stagnation when it comes to investment in ingenuity. Not only does the mother of all tax hikes fail miserably to deliver on its promise of middle-class tax relief, but it also makes an intense effort to put those middle-class taxpayers out of work. 
   This is a bad initiative. It is one borne of ideology rather than practical experience. It is a bad tax policy, and we know from past experience that an old saw of Daniel Webster's holds true: The power to tax is the power to destroy. 
   If we allow these higher taxes to go into place, it will have a negative impact on our economy, on many of our working families, on many families that we have sought to support through judicious use of the Tax Code. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it would be a terrible mistake if, without a fight, we allowed this Democrat tax bill to go into law masquerading as tax reform, but basically dramatically increasing the amount of our national wealth that is confiscated. 
   I am prepared to join this fight. I am delighted to join the gentleman from Texas and others. I believe there will be a clear philosophical difference laid out before this Congress between those who want to reform the Tax Code through simplification, putting in place the right incentives and pro-growth economic policies, and those who want to game the Tax Code and generate more revenue at whatever economic cost and shift more and more of the burden down to the middle class. This is a fight worth having, and I am proud to join the gentleman from Texas to be part of it.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. That's correct. What we are seeing is a vehicle being called ``tax reform'' being used as a locomotive to drive higher taxes, higher revenues, and higher spending levels. This is an attempt in the name of fiscal responsibility to take more from the American economy, more from American working families, more from the public at the expense of the private economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. And what is particularly perverse about it, to respond to the gentleman, is we are talking here about permanent tax increases, to provide temporary protection to other taxpayers. Ultimately they have created a series of PAYGO rules that allow them to go in each year, hold certain taxpayers harmless, but at the expense of permanent increases in revenue into the foreseeable future. 
   What they are doing is setting up a system that can be gamed that will permit them to go forward and raise taxes each year without calling it a tax increase where they are trying to avoid the label. I think that is particularly perverse because what it assumes, even as Republicans for years when they were in power each year tried to look for ways of cutting taxes, it seems like the Democrats have set up a PAYGO system by which they will be able to go in each year and justify tax increases. 
   They may call some of it loophole closing, but it is higher taxes, and they are going to be looking for more and more creative ways for generating more revenue for years to come, particularly as the cost of patching under their rules, the cost of patching the AMT each year grows higher.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. I think the time has come to put together budgets where the math is accurate, where the math isn't based on phantom revenues, where the math doesn't assume the phaseout of taxes every year, and where the math is not based on applying new taxes to whole new classes of taxpayers, particularly a tax that was intended for the wealthy but increasingly is being targeted to the middle class. I think we need to take this opportunity to make a departure from past practice. 
   As the gentleman knows, when we were in the Ways and Means Committee marking up the unfortunate patch bill that is being brought to the floor tomorrow, I put forward an amendment that was defeated by the majority that was consistent with their budget rules, that would have eliminated the AMT by a date certain. This is 
   something absolutely consistent with their budget practices. They claim to want to get rid of the AMT. But when they had a chance to actually get rid of the alternative minimum tax, they voted us down on straight party lines. This would not have done violence to any of their budget calculations. It would not have required them to adjust their current budget. It would have just required them to acknowledge that they have to stop using the AMT in the outyears to plump up their revenues because they are not entitled to that revenue. Congress never intended to apply this tax, the AMT, to middle-class taxpayers. And the fact that the majority party is so addicted to its revenue that they are not willing to just say no I think tells the entire tale.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (THE SIMPLIFIED USA TAX -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about an issue that has been close to my heart since I came to Congress. Clearly, the current tax code is far too complicated. It is riddled with obvious inequities. Its structure punishes savings and investment, which reduces economic and job growth and burdens domestic industries struggling to remain competitive in today's global market. 
   Although the U.S. Treasury Department has called for international tax reform and has advocated policies to advance U.S. competitiveness, increase national savings, and reduce our trade barriers, this Congress has failed to offer a substantive response. 
   Recently, we in the Ways and Means Committee have received a proposal that presents itself as tax reform but is, in fact, as you are going to hear later tonight, a Rube Goldberg device to raise taxes. In this context, it is important to consider other alternatives, and tonight I would like to discuss my own tax proposal which encompasses all of these concerns and would attract a broad cross-section of working Americans. 
   My proposal, the Simplified USA Tax, puts the right incentives in place to grow our economy and to create new jobs. The Simplified USA Tax has three key components: 
   One, it simplifies the tax code by a factor of about 75 percent; two, it takes the taxes off of savings to promote thrift and address a national dearth of savings; and, three, it makes America significantly more competitive, thereby creating and preserving better jobs within our borders.     
   The simplified U.S.A. tax starts out with just three simple low rates, 15 percent at the bottom, 25 percent in the middle, and 30 percent at the top. 
   Through a payroll tax credit to all wage earners, SUSAT effectively lowers the income tax rates to the 7 and 17 percent range for nearly all Americans. 
   Under my proposal, and this is one significant departure from some tax reform blueprints, everyone would get a deduction for mortgage interest on their home. In addition, the SUSAT proposal allows charitable donations and tuition deductions. 
   To further ensure that the new Tax Code would be progressive, my proposal also permits all families to take a generous family credit, and qualifying families to take an additional refundable work credit. These two credits simplify and improve the current child credit and earned income tax credit. 
   I believe the Tax Code must also give Americans a fair opportunity to save part of their earnings. By taking the taxes off of savings, we will increase the savings rate and ultimately reduce the cost of capital. 
   My proposal encourages savings by allowing everyone to contribute to an unlimited Roth IRA. It also repeals the individual and corporate alternative minimum tax, Federal death and gift taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you can see, the individual tax system, under my proposal, is designed to be simple. The tax return will be short, only a page or two for most people; but, more importantly, the tax return will be comprehensible. 
   My proposal also contains a new and better way of taxing corporations and other businesses that will allow them to compete and win in global markets in a way that exports American-made products, not American jobs. 
   All businesses are taxed alike under our proposal at an 8 percent rate on the first $150,000 of profit, and a 12 percent on all amounts above that small business level. All businesses will be allowed a credit for the 7.65 percent payroll tax they pay under the current law. 
   One of the most pro-growth elements in SUSAT is that all costs for plant equipment and inventory in the United States will be expensed in the year of purchase. This is important because investment in state-of-the-art equipment is critical to manufacturing in a global economy. 
   The other key component of SUSAT which will make American business more competitive is that it will be border-adjustable. In other words, SUSAT would end the perverse practice unique among our trading partners of taxing our own exports. All export sales income is exempt and all profits earned abroad can be brought back home for reinvestment in America without penalty. 
   Because of a 12 percent import adjustment, all companies that produce abroad and sell back in the U.S. markets will be required to bear the same tax burden as companies that both produce and sell in the U.S. This policy would finally take away the bias in favor of imports built into our current tax structure, which, in my view, contributes dramatically to our trade deficit, which, in my view, continues to rise at record-breaking levels.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (TAX INCREASE PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I'll keep my remarks brief and submit the bulk of my remarks for the Record where they contain economic analysis and no theology, so they may be out of place in this floor debate. 
   It's been fascinating to listen to the lecture that we've heard about failure. The failure that is on display here is the failure of this majority to fix the AMT as they promised or even to patch it in a timely fashion. 
   We are voting today on a bill that we should have voted on 4 to 6 months ago and easily could have, and the blame here, if there is to be any blame, is on the other side for having passed a budget that was built on quicksand, that was balanced based on revenues from applying the AMT to 23 million mainly middle-class families. And every one of them that voted for it voted to do it. 
   They took PAYGO and they made a burlesque of it. What they have been doing up until this point is trying frantically to hold the AMT crisis that they created as a hostage in order to drive higher taxes. They've been using the AMT issue as a locomotive for a tax increase that is unnecessary and is inappropriate, particularly if, as the majority leader feels, the economy might be slowing down. 
   They have been single-minded in their approach to try to drive higher taxes. Today, we have an opportunity to protect the taxpayers without a tax increase. Let's take it.  
   Madam Speaker, since coming to Congress, I have been a vocal champion for repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax. The AMT is a horribly inefficient parallel tax system that was never intended to impact those it is, or soon will ensnare. 
   This Congress, like so many before it, I have introduced legislation to repeal the AMT. 
   In recent years, Congress has turned to enacting temporary relief--or a patch--to keep the AMT from reaching more and more taxpayers in the middle class. This is necessary because the AMT was never indexed for inflation. 
   This fact, in conjunction with the Democrats' distortion of pay-as-you-go budgeting has placed us in the situation we face today. 
   While I think it is fair to say that most people believe the AMT was a mistake and it should be addressed, the debate is over how it should be addressed and if, in fact, other taxpayers should pay more taxes in order to keep the AMT at bay. 
   In other words, does it make sense for the rule of the House to require Congress to find revenue through real tax increases in order to stop a tax increase from happening? 
   The Democratic majority says yes. I say that this premise is utterly absurd. 
   Only in Washington could some green-eye-shade type conjure up the idea that it is necessary to raise taxes on one group of Americans in order to prevent another group of Americans from paying more taxes. 
   Instead of focusing our energy on who should pay more taxes, as this majority has done, Congress should be focused on what kind of pro-growth, pro-innovation and pro-job tax policies to enact. 
   Sadly, Madam Speaker, this majority has failed in this regard, even at a time the economy is beginning to show signs of softening. 
   Even on the more narrow issue of ensuring 21 million new taxpayers aren't subject to the AMT next year, the majority has barely received a passing grade. 
   This is the latest in the year Congress has dealt with an AMT patch--ever. Well, in this instance, tardiness as a severe consequence. 
   The Internal Revenue Service has said that the delay in enacting an AMT patch this year will result in massive confusion for taxpayers and lengthy delays for those expecting refunds this year. 
   And perhaps most disappointing of all is that when you dig deeper, the misguided banner of paygo which the majority holds up today is nothing more than a feeble attempt to mask their true intention with the AMT all along: to hold 23 million taxpayers hostage as they implement a protracted effort to permanently raise taxes in exchange for temporary tax relief. 
   They may say today that they are issuing an ``IOU'' to taxpayers that they intend to ``pay for'' this bill to prevent a tax increase. But, no American is fooled by these reindeer games. They know that all that means is that the House Democrats have just made a reservation to come to your house and raise your taxes. 
   I'm particularly pleased Republicans were able to call the majority out on this folly today in the name of the American taxpayer and economy. But, we must also insist that the majority's reservation is never honored.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Thank goodness they are not going to have to wait a generation for a Democratic President. 
   This bill, Madam Speaker, is a good resolution to a political impasse and a good solution to the hindering cuts that impede our Nation's physicians and would impact on the health care of our young people and our seniors. 
   It makes a substantial adjustment for physicians who participate in the Medicare program, albeit only temporary. Although I would have liked to have seen a more permanent and comprehensive solution to a range of Medicare issues, we just couldn't wait and allow 10 percent cuts in payments to physicians to occur. I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on a more permanent solution in the upcoming year to this particularly thorny issue. 
   The legislation before us also endorses important issues that I have fought hard to be involved with and to make progress on, including extending the exceptions process for therapy caps and a revision of the policy structure for long-term care hospitals. Those are legacy issues that we are going to have to take up sooner rather than later. 
   I am glad we have a final resolution temporarily on SCHIP. Thank you. I urge a vote for the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. The rule waives all points of order on the underlying bill to shield the Democratic Leadership's attempt to bypass the rules of the House and the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. Clause 5(a) of Rule 21 states that, ``a bill or joint resolution carrying a tax or tariff measure may not be reported by a committee not having jurisdiction to report tax or tariff measures.'' 
   Yet, the bill before us today was not reported by such a committee, only by the Committee on Agriculture. Specifically, Section 1303 of the bill would change the administration of U.S. tariff rate quotas for imports of sugar so that the tariff rate quotas no longer apply on a yearly basis, but rather on a semi-  annual or even quarterly basis for certain imports. 
   Under this provision, importers who wish to import sugar into the United States outside of the narrow time period specified in the bill would be required to pay the over-quota tariff rate rather than the in-quota tariff rate to which they would otherwise be entitled. Thus, this provision would increase the tariff rate on these imports from 1.46 cents per kilogram to 33.87 cents per kilogram: an increase in the tariff rate of over 2,000 percent. 
   In effect, this bill changes the tariff classification of these imports because it changes the tariff to which these imports are subject based on when they are imported into the United States. As a result, this language would affect the amount of tariff revenue collected, thus triggering clause 5(a) of rule 21. 
   Completely egregious in its own right on the merits, the inclusion of this provision also flies smack in the face of the rules of the House and should not be included in the bill today. But, sadly today we are precluded from raising a point of order against this provision as a result of this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker the rule also contains a self-executing tax increase that will put the squeeze on investment in the U.S. and cost America jobs. Also not considered by the Committee on Ways and Means, this provision, masquerading as a way to keep jobs here, will in fact send jobs overseas. 
   The practical effect of this amendment is that employers like BASF in Evans City, Pennsylvania will be at a direct disadvantage simply because they have chosen to locate a manufacturing plant in the U.S.--and employ U.S. workers--but have a parent company based in Germany. Similarly, companies throughout my district would be indirectly affected as a result of some of their customers--companies like Honda and Sony among others--being disadvantaged by this provision. In addition, this provision completely disregards obligations made under international tax treaties. 
   Mr. Speaker, American workers deserve better, American employers deserve better, and our treaty partners deserve better. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this most misguided rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (SMALL BUSINESS FAIRNESS IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the motion to commit is very simple and self-explanatory, but at the same time, it is also very timely. It comes at a time when there are legitimate and growing concerns about the pending change in tax policy in America and how it might affect the most dynamic sector of the American economy, and that is, after all, small business. 
   We know that literally 80 percent of the small businesses, 80 percent of the jobs that are created in the economy in America are created in small business, as has been defined under statute. We are anticipating that as this body moves forward and has passed a budget from the majority that implies the largest tax increase in American history, implies the phaseout of tax policies that have grown the economy since 2001, implies that in order to deal with the pending challenge of the AMT, that there is going to be a massive increase in personal rates, particularly at the high end, that affects subchapter S small businesses. 
   We think that it is very important now to require the SBA administrator, under this motion, to consider small businesses as economically disadvantaged if they demonstrate an adverse impact due to the expiration of this tax relief. After all, who in this body could possibly be against accounting for and recognizing through an SBA designation the impact on such a vital portion of our economy before haphazardly increasing taxes through what we anticipate is going to be the father of all tax increases. This is, I think, a huge challenge for us, and it is a challenge which we should adjust this program to acknowledge. 
   I am concerned that if we see a change in our tax policies on this scale, that it is going to have a huge impact on small businesses in districts like mine. For example, the potential change in tax policy could dramatically downsize the section 179 small business expensing provision. This allows small businesses to immediately expense critical capital investment, allowing them to remain competitive in the global economy, allowing them to put money back into the their hands, back into their production line, back into the hands of small business, an immediate write-off that demonstrably creates jobs right here in America. 
   Without the help of section 179, many of our small businesses are at an enormous competitive disadvantage. Section 179 was once described to me by an economist as one of the most progrowth features currently in the Tax Code. The notion that we would allow it to lapse to its previous level is particularly troubling and I think requires us to prepare the SBA for the impact that these tax policy changes could have. 
   All this motion to recommit is seeking to do is to give small businesses a tool to enhance their success in the marketplace, despite the potential for being hammered by a Brobdingnagian set of tax increases required by the budget that we are going to be facing. 
   By offering this motion to recommit, we feel that the underlying bill ought to also lay before Congress a way to determine whether or not the tax increases that will be proposed by this budget will move small business backwards and also provide for a tool, but in a very small way, to counteract that. Every Member of this body should join me in supporting this motion to recommit if they care about the future ability of small businesses in their districts to grow, to survive, to compete and add new jobs. 
   I urge the adoption of this motion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this motion.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENT SAFE HARBOR ADJUSTMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today the House is considering legislation that, in my view, represents the first brick in a Chinese wall of tax increases. 
   Generating revenue by assuming that Americans with more than $5 million in income will increase their annual withholding by one-tenth of 1 percent simply makes a mockery of PAYGO. 
   The majority is exploiting a statistical quirk in the way that the Joint Tax Committee does its revenue estimates, and will have accountants, not normally known for their high spirits and good humor, roaring with laughter all over the country. 
   Perhaps, in the aggregate, there are enough people in America making more than $5 million who will pay an extra $2,000 in estimated taxes to raise revenues as much as anticipated, but this seems more likely to be an instance where the Joint Tax Committee's scoring rules and common sense have dramatically parted ways. 
   If the Judiciary Committee thinks the companion bill to create a new Member from Utah and add voting rights to a Member from the District of Columbia is such a good idea, surely they could have found some program within their jurisdiction to trim by an offsetting amount. And they didn't find a user fee in their jurisdiction to increase by just a few dollars. 
   In fact, despite the fact the Democratic majority created a budget that includes more than $2 trillion in spending, they could not even trim $3 million from that total to pay for this rather modest initiative. To put this in perspective, the majority could have offset this bill by reducing entitlement spending by just two ten-thousandths of a percent. 
   By not going down that route, this bill confirms what we have all suspected: the Tax Code is going to be the ATM machine that pays for all of the new majority's fondest initiatives. The bill today may be cheap in total dollar terms, but we will not be so lucky the next time around. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, in my view, H.R. 1906 represents what will be the first of a series of bizarre revenue raisers, Rube Goldberg devices, and tax gimmicks to be trotted out to pay, first for small things, and then pay for the demands of the majority's budget, which includes the largest tax increase in American history, nearly $4 billion over 5 years. 
   It also demonstrates that the majority's PAYGO promise that new entitlement spending could be offset with entitlement spending cuts is hollow and cynical. If they can't even find $3 million of entitlement savings for this bill, can we expect them to pay for their new programs with anything other than a significant tax increase ultimately on the middle class? 
   This makes even traditional budget gimmicks, like putting routine spending into an emergency spending bill, or bypassing the budget resolution by using ``advanced appropriations'' look pristine by comparison.  
   The process for this bill's consideration is flawed, deeply and fundamentally. It did not go through the Committee on Ways and Means. This is another example of the new majority ignoring their own promises for regular order. 
   The procedure, Mr. Speaker, for considering the broader issue of expanding the House of Representatives itself is deeply flawed. The example being set today that you can split a bill into separate elements so as to limit what amendments and motions will be germane is the triumph of form over substance. 
   The proposal before us only adds more complexity to the Tax Code. And think about this: if you thought filling out your taxes wasn't tough enough, our friends on the other side of the aisle are raising the level of difficulty to complicate the code and increase the risk that an inadvertent error will have the IRS demanding interest on your underpayment. 
   At least it is better than the last version of this proposal, which generated an even more ludicrous $3 million by raising the safe harbor amount for people with incomes over $150,000 by just three one-thousandths of a percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a flawed bill. It is a silly exercise. And I think it is appropriate that we vote it down.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I also rise in support of this legislation. Congress must not stand by while the financing of our Nation's airways are to lapse. The cost to our Nation's economy of doing so would be devastating. 
   As you know, authorizing legislation permitting the collection of aviation taxes and fees sadly expired at the end of the last fiscal year. Congress since then has extended that authorization through the end of this month in the consolidated appropriations act. It is unfortunate, in my view, that Congress was not able to reach an agreement with the other body on a longer term solution before resorting to temporary extensions. 
   I feel that the Ways and Means Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee worked well together to put together a workable bill that would continue financing our system with modest changes for a period of 4 years. Four years would have given us enough time to allow this body to devote the necessary time to make a close examination of the financing of the system and consider the long-term changes that technology and the demands of that system are imposing on us, something that I believe the Committee on Ways and Means and the Select Revenue Subcommittee did not have time to accomplish, despite multiple hearings on this issue. 
   While today's bill will only extend current law authority through the end of June, this is a necessary step in the process. It certainly does not speak well of this Congress that we are not able to do these things promptly with discipline and do so in a timely fashion, but I believe that our committee, Ways and Means, together with the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, have provided value added, and I would like to believe that given some additional time, that we would have had an opportunity to put forward a permanent solution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I think we have made the case here, Mr. Speaker, that it is important that this legislation go forward to cure an inability of Congress to bring closure on this very, very important issue. This is stop-gap legislation that is necessary to allow America's aviation system to remain airborne, and at a critical time. It is essential that we pass this bill in order to ensure that thousands of FAA employees are not furloughed through congressional inaction. It is also vitally important for communities engaged in an airport construction project, communities like my hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania, that the bill before us reinstates the contract authority for the FAA to issue money under the Airport Improvement Program. 
   I believe that this is an opportunity for us to get this right in the coming months. It is essential that the House Ways and Means Committee, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and the bipartisan leadership of this body engage the Senate in order to pass a permanent solution that provides long-term funding for the FAA in a manner that is consistent with the fundamental changes in that system in order to provide the necessary investment in this essential piece of our national transportation infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman. 
   As chairman of the Zero AMT Caucus, I rise to strongly oppose this wrongheaded measure, which instead of offering a prescription for tax relief or tax reform, which they promised at the beginning of the year, it is a placebo that imposes a permanent tax increase in exchange for the false promise of temporary tax relief. 
   This legislation, as the other side has said, is all about hostages and brinkmanship. Their budget was built on the quicksand of AMT revenues that assumed the revenue from taxing 23 million people under the AMT. Now we have to raise taxes to protect them. They are using this crisis as a locomotive to drive higher taxes. 
   But those aren't the only hostages, Mr. Speaker. Other taxpayers are being held hostage to delay. Already, this is the longest Congress has gone into the year without dealing with the AMT's reach ever. The IRS and Treasury have indicated that this delay will, at best, cause massive chaos and confusion in the upcoming filing season, but at worst, it is the likely scenario, since this bill was put forward dead on arrival with the Senate and the House, 50 million taxpayers could find their refunds delayed by many weeks. 
   But that isn't the only hostage. The extenders are being held hostage. Everyone who utilizes the extender deductions on State and local taxes, the tuition deduction, expenses for school teachers, combat pay under the EITC, mortgage bonds for veterans, companies that use the R&D tax credit or certain charitable contributions, these extenders are going to be delayed if it is tied to this dead-on-arrival bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill does nothing to deal with what they said was their top priority, which is reforming or getting rid of the AMT. It's bad tax policy. It's a large tax increase no matter how they dress it up. And it's a tax increase coming at a time of economic slowdown. Just say ``no.''

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. I would like to thank the distinguished Member from Washington. 
   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I have to rise in strong opposition to this rule. I wouldn't normally speak out against a rule, but I think these are unique circumstances and they're highlighted by the comments of one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who accused Republicans of holding hostages. That's really an extraordinary statement under the circumstances. 
   After all, it was House Democrats who conspired to preserve the AMT in 1999. It's House Democrats who had talked broadly about repealing the AMT this year. It is House Democrats that passed a budget that used the revenue from applying the AMT to 23 million mostly middle-class taxpayers. And it is, after all, House Democrats who have come forward today with a placebo that doesn't do what they originally said that they were going to do. 
   I have offered before the Rules Committee and in the Ways and Means Committee an amendment that would have directly addressed the Democrats' promise. Yesterday, an amendment was offered in the Committee on Rules and dismissed out of hand that, by defeating today's rule, may yet be preserved to fulfill the promise of the Democrats to get rid of the AMT. My amendment would have sunset the AMT by a date certain. It would have fully repealed the individual alternative minimum tax. And any vote against this rule, Mr. Speaker, is a vote against an opportunity to ultimately and permanently eliminate the AMT. 
   The amendment is very simple. The AMT would be repealed and never seen again after 2018. That's far enough in the future that we should be able to plan around it. 
   As Congress continues to wrestle with the ridiculous notion of how to pay for eliminating a tax that we never intended, this amendment allows us to set a firm horizon on which the AMT will be eliminated and require that our budgets no longer be built on the quicksand of AMT revenue. 
   And the amendment is fully PAYGO compliant, so there's no reason not to have allowed this amendment to be debated if the majority is, in fact, serious about ensuring that the AMT is eliminated. 
   Unfortunately, the bottom line is that the majority, in fact, believes that they need the revenue, and they want to continue to do things like they do in today's bill, which is pass permanent tax increases in order to fund temporary tax relief. If the majority, in fact, believes that it will find a way to repeal the AMT before 2018, then this amendment should be allowable. Nothing in this amendment would prevent the Congress from taking up a plan to get rid of the AMT sooner than 2018. 
   What this amendment does do, though, is let the taxpayer know that the AMT will be history. 
   As I said, we missed the chance to do that in 1999 because of the position that the other side took. And this amendment would have given Members of this body an up-or-down vote on whether or not to support the repeal of the AMT. 
   Perhaps this is a true indication of the majority's intent to take this tax monster, harness it, and put it to work to allow with PAYGO rules that every year we churn the Tax Code to raise taxes ever higher. I think the AMT has got to go and that's why I'm offering this amendment if allowed. 
   I urge the defeat of the rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, whatever the rhetoric, the Democratic budget resolution fails to keep faith with the American people. 
   Instead of embracing fiscal responsibility, it underwrites a saturnalia of spending propped up by, and listen to my words, the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Instead of maintaining pro-growth tax policies that grow the economy and reduce the deficit, this budget clobbers the American economy by requiring nearly $400 billion of new revenue. 
   Instead of protecting middle-class families, it lays the groundwork for tax increases on a whole new level of taxpayers. 
   Instead of setting new priorities, it throws priority setting to the wind and undercuts the benefits of tax policies that have clearly helped the middle class. 
   The details are stunning. For starters, the Democratic budget threatens to reduce the child tax credit by half, increase the lowest tax bracket from 10 to 15 percent, reconstitute the marriage penalty and eliminate incentives for higher education savings like the student loan interest deduction. 
   In my home State of Pennsylvania, the average taxpayer can expect to see an estimated $3,000-plus increase in their annual tax bill. That is an increase in the tax bill for a working family of more than $15,000 over a 5-year period. That is a different standard of living. 
   So much for their empty rhetoric about children and families. Not only does this budget contain the largest tax increase in American history, it also chooses to employ smoke and mirrors instead of underwriting real financial relief from the AMT for Americans. 
   For years, the AMT has been a growing monster because while originally intended to close loopholes for the very wealthiest taxpayers, it was never indexed for inflation. It is now hitting more and more middle-class taxpayers. As a result, this year, without relief, 23 million taxpayers will be forced into AMT status and hit with a significant tax increase, ten times the number than if it had been indexed to inflation. The Democrats' budget does nothing, sets aside no resources to address this problem. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle fail to include an AMT repeal in their budget. They don't even include the bare minimum step of a patch to keep it at bay as Republicans have in previous years. Instead, this budget resolution holds millions of middle-class taxpayers hostage to a record tax increase. Don't let the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle fool you. The reserve fund that is folded into this resolution is utterly meaningless. This is a piggybank that doesn't even rattle when you shake it. 
   America's working families deserve better. I urge every Member who cares about working families, cares about protecting their earnings to vote ``no'' on this budget today.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this amendment, which would require local education agencies to use American steel and iron for modernization, renovation, or repair projects, such as at a public school facility. As the past chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus and as the current vice chairman of that body, I have been working for some time on a bipartisan basis to promote policies to provide for the use of American steel precisely in these sorts of settings. 
   Madam Chairman, you may recall one of my favorite books which was Robert Penn Warren's remarkable novel, All the King's Men, in which the anti-hero Willie Stark is thrust into prominence because he takes on the local political machine, the local political machine which is building a schoolhouse with cheap materials at risk to students. He raises this issue; he is ignored, but in the end he is vindicated because once the schoolhouse is built, because of cheap steel ultimately many children are hurt and killed in a terrible accident. 
   Today, we are contemplating a similar set of circumstances and the same risk. Just a few months ago, our Steel Caucus held a hearing to examine the dangers with imported Chinese steel products. What we discovered is that there are serious and legitimate concerns regarding the quality of these imports and whether they are adequately monitored. We currently have no mechanism for evaluating or for stopping steel that does not meet specifications at the border. And once it is inside our market, this steel is used on bridges, buildings, power plants, and even schools. In fact, in the fall of 2007, the California Department of General Services posted an alert on Chinese steel tubing fabricated for school construction projects that had been found to be defective. 
   Through independent tests and studies we know that there are frequently deficiencies in Chinese steel, yet we also know that American steel consistently has met the highest standards. 
   Madam Chairman, if the goal of the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public Schools Facilities Act is to provide a safe and healthy learning environment for children, we should be insisting that we are using steel of a clearly determined quality; and, we would be doing a disservice to the parents and to the children of our country by not ensuring that the school's infrastructure is built with steel of a guaranteed quality. The difference between  steel that makes the grade and steel that doesn't meet required standards could very well be a matter of life and death. 
   The use of deficient or structurally inefficient steel for renovations or repair projects is a clear public safety hazard. Such a blunder could increase the overall cost of projects and increase construction time. If the school construction projects provided under this legislation are truly going to meet the high standards that we expect of any structure for our children, we must ensure that the steel used is from American companies that will follow the proper safety and quality standards in its products. 
   Madam Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment that mirrors legislation that I have introduced with the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky) earlier this year. I am delighted that the author has seen fit to offer it as part of this legislation. I would strongly urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (ECONOMIC STIMULUS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, tonight the House has an opportunity to give American working families and employers the shot in the arm they need to weather this growing economic storm. 
   The heart of this bipartisan plan focuses on putting more demand into a flagging economy, more money back into the hands of America's hardworking middle-class families. Through tax rebates and a bump in the child tax credit, this agreement will quickly inject a cash infusion into the economy to assist families with skyrocketing food, services, and energy costs. 
   Importantly, this legislation will go a step further than the original compact and ensure that veterans and seniors receive additional financial support to boost their buying power. All of that is positive. And as we've already heard, the housing provisions to increase limits on loans backed on by the FHA and GSEs will, without a doubt, give relief to families facing financial pressure from the subprime mortgage crisis. 
   Finally, and importantly, by rewarding businesses for making critical capital investments here onshore, we will expand investment, create new jobs, improve the competitiveness of the American economy, and put an immediate infusion of liquidity into the economy. 
   Madam Speaker, in my view, this is precisely the right tonic at the right time. This should be a start, not the last word. We should be moving forward with regulatory reform and, above all, let me note to the people on the other side of the aisle, a budget this year without a large tax increase looming in the future. 
   But short of that, this is a good starting place. And I urge my colleagues to vote for working families, vote for jobs, and vote, above all, for a growing economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2956, RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in the strongest possible opposition to this rule. 
   In the panoply of public policy issues, there is no more important question than starting or ending an armed conflict. The decision we make today will determine whether men and women will live or die, not only on the battlefields of Iraq but also potentially in the cities of Europe and America. 
   The discussion that we conduct today should transcend crass political partnership and narrow ideology to reflect our deepest concern for the Nation and, indeed, for the community of nations. 
   The House of Representatives today should be prepared to engage in a free and fair debate regarding all of the potential options for the future conduct of combat operations and diplomatic initiatives in Iraq and the broader Middle East. We should be discussing the recommendations of the Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group. We should be examining some of the ideas laid out by Senator Lugar. We should be considering the suggestion of Congresswoman Heather Wilson and I that we made to the President recently encouraging him to convene a high-level summit of Iraqi sectarian leaders. We should exclude no viable alternative, even that offered by my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich). 
   The legislation we will consider later today does have the potential to serve as a starting point of determining a new course of action in Iraq, but it is badly flawed, and it needs substantial improvement, and unfortunately, that will not be possible. The rule the Democrats have laid before the House today demonstrates their motivations are, at core, political. And I remember when politics ended at the water's edge. 
   They do not offer us an open rule, allowing full and free debate. They don't even allow us a structured rule, permitting, at the very least, discussion of some of the major alternatives that I've outlined. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know that certain parties want things from this debate today. They've already recorded their robo calls, purchased airtime for their attack ads. They've scheduled buses for their rent-a-mobs. And the last thing they really desire is a free, open and informed debate that might result in a unified policy regarding our Nation's future efforts in Iraq. They seek not to unite our Nation but to divide it. 
   The people who bring this rule to the floor today do not allow amendments because they're afraid. They're afraid that some of these amendments might prevail. They're afraid that, given viable alternatives, some Members of their own party will choose cooperation over confrontation.     
   Mostly, they are afraid they might lose a major issue for their campaign to maintain their majority. Their fear may or may not be justified, but its very existence is a sad commentary on their faith in the Members of their own party, this body, and the American people. 
   I remind my colleagues that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Reject this cynical rule. Vote ``no'' on the previous question. Let's have a full and fair debate on this, the most critical issue of our generation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would add a section at the end of the bill to express a sense of Congress that the Corporation for National and Community Service should attempt to coordinate the recruiting and assignment procedures of their various programs to allow senior citizens and their grandchildren to share volunteer opportunities and be assigned to the same geographic areas during their period of service. 
   I would note, Mr. Chairman, Marian McQuade, the founder of National Grandparents Day and a homemaker from Fayette County, West Virginia, held as one of her primary motivations of her advocacy for a National Grandparents Day, persuading the grandchildren to tap the wisdom and heritage of their grandparents. This amendment builds on the principles that evolved into National Grandparents Day by creating more opportunities to build bridges on an intergenerational basis and strengthen the family structure. This amendment will honor grandparents and enhance the bond between grandparents and grandchildren while encouraging a lifetime of community service.     
   It seems somehow fundamental that AmeriCorps and Senior Corps work together to bring grandparents and grandchildren together to share memorable and rewarding experiences of community service together, strengthen bonds of family, and make the lives of fellow citizens brighter. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this amendment today. This is a remedy for many of the pressures that we feel today on families, it's an attempt to unite generations, and it's an attempt to better coordinate two very important programs in the interest of fostering stronger families. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would retain the balance of my time.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment creates a sense of the Congress that the Corporation for National and Community Service should make the maximum effort possible to coordinate with the National Endowment for the Humanities to provide opportunities for young people enrolled in national and community service programs to collect oral histories from senior citizens in the communities that they serve. 
   As cochairman of the Congressional Humanities Caucus, I have been actively advocating policies and programs to raise awareness of the role of history, literature, languages, and other humanities in Americans' lives. As we all know, studying our history, our culture, and our heritage can help provide a framework to guide our decisions as we confront challenging issues facing us now and into the future. It also gives us a national memory. 
   If we look back to the experience during World War II when the Federal Government employed many writers to do histories of local communities that now have become an important resource to us, recognizing that we are at a time when our greatest generation is now moving on and the opportunity to consult them could very well be lost in the near future, this is an opportunity that we must seize. 
   As we all know, studying our history, our culture, and our heritage can be an important part of our future defining of who we are. We not only learn from museums and books, but we also learn from those who have lived in the past. For that reason, I think it's important for our youth to reach out to our knowledgeable elders who have lived through tougher times, who have fought and seen wars, and who have seen the transformation of America. 
   Close to 1,000 World War II veterans die each day. Many have never spoken of their experiences. During a time in their lives where many are lonely and yearning for an opportunity to have an exchange, this creates an opportunity for us to capture those memories and institutionalize them. 
   To carry on the American tradition and living history, I urge the support of my colleagues for this amendment today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I retain the balance of my time.

   Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, the freedom of the United States has depended on the courage of men and women in uniform for over 200 years. Our veterans, having served as a member of the greatest military in the world, can be assured that they have the appreciation and admiration of millions of Americans. 
   The experience gained from the U.S. military is without a doubt invaluable, and I applaud our veterans for the courage and the commitment that they have demonstrated consistently while serving our country. 
   With that said, I would like to offer this amendment, which will provide a valuable service to our veteran population while giving young volunteers an opportunity to be exposed to some of these American heroes that have allowed us to exercise our everyday freedoms. Specifically, my amendment would require the Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service to work with the Disabled American Veterans organization to provide opportunities for young people to serve as drivers in the DAV transportation network. 
   This new service will certainly help ease the burden on veterans throughout the country, especially in communities like mine and in yours, Mr. Chairman, in rural areas where we have many veterans who have a challenge getting the service that they need from our brick and mortar VA institutions, give them easy and convenient transportation to doctor appointments, physical therapy, and routine checkups. 
   Mr. Chairman, at a time when America's veterans are facing increased challenges regarding health care coverage and full access to the benefits that they have earned, Congress ought to embrace commonsense policies that will help ensure our veterans get the care they need and deserve. 
   In my part of Pennsylvania, Mr. Chairman, it has been a challenge to drum up the volunteers to provide driver service for many of our VA participants and clients. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this initiative that will help fill that gap and encourage more of our young people to volunteer to help some of our aging veterans and some of our younger veterans who happen to live a distance away from the institution that serves them. 
   Mr. Chairman, I retain the balance of my time.
