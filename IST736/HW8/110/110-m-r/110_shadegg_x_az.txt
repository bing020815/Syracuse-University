<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I think it is important to sort out what this debate really is about. It is not about union workers and it is not about unions. I understand people who support unions and union workers. What this debate is about is too much power for unions. Don't take my word for it. Listen to The Los Angeles Times. 
   ``Unions once supported the secret ballot for the organization elections ..... Whether to unionize is up to workers. A secret ballot ensures them that their choice will be a free one.'' 
   You simply cannot come to this floor and say this bill is balanced or fair, because it does not treat both sides right. If you want to decertify a union, that is a secret ballot under this bill. If you want to create a union, it has to be by card check. Why isn't it extended to both issues?

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by complimenting the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), and the ranking member, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson), for showing support for hydropower in the base bill. 
   Hydropower has long been overlooked as a source for clean energy. I am very pleased that this bill, and the report that goes along with it, support hydropower and encourage its use and its utilization.  
   My amendment builds off of that effort by simply saying that the existing hydropower that we have should not be decommissioned at this point in time. 
   As everybody in this body knows, we are very concerned about greenhouse gases, both on the Commerce Committee, where I serve, and on the Select Committee on Global Warming and Energy Independence. 
   We are looking at the danger posed to this country by greenhouse gases. Indeed, that is a threat to this economy, to this Nation, and to this world. My amendment simply says that hydropower manages to address that issue by producing both clean power and power which has no hydrocarbons whatsoever. 
   Hydropower is emission-free, and it is also completely renewable; so therefore this amendment simply says that none of the funds in this legislation shall be used to decommission any existing Federal dam which is currently producing hydroelectric power. 
   Now, I know of no dam that has currently been proposed to be decommissioned that is a Federal dam and is producing electric power. But it seems to me that this is an action item. This is an opportunity for us to say we are serious about greenhouse gas reduction. We are serious about renewable energy. We are serious about a clean environment. We are serious about not doing more damage by simply saying none of these funds shall be used to decommission or remove from current production any existing hydroelectric power dam that is producing electricity for Americans today. 
   It truly is clean, and it truly is renewable; and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank both of the gentlemen. I would be happy to work with them. I simply want to stress, we understand, and I think everyone here does, that hydropower is more efficient than virtually all other energy. Ninety percent of its available energy is converted into electricity by hydropower. By contrast, the best fossil fuel power converts only 50 percent of its energy. 
   Hydropower produces zero greenhouse gas emissions. And we have avoided some 160 million tons of carbon emissions by the use of hydropower here in the United States in the last year. 
   The report says hydropower is reliable, it is efficient, it is domestic, and it is emissions-free. Indeed, as I state in my comments, the report is very supportive of hydropower. I think this amendment is an opportunity to take a concrete step both toward renewable energy and toward clean energy that produces no greenhouse gases. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, I think this is a very enlightening debate. Fortunately, I think the American people are smart enough to understand this debate. They understand that, for example, even though there won't be a tax increase before the election in 2008, that policies that get adopted this year will force tax increases in future years. I think they understand that. 
   I want to comment on the remarks of the committee Chair who just spoke. I think he made a compelling case for leaving the priorities that are in this bill precisely where they are. I think your committee, with the help of the minority, worked diligently to produce a sound product, a product that attempts to allocate the resources amongst the various priorities. 
   But there will come a time when this Nation wakes up. There will come a time when we will have to be responsible about spending on this floor. 
   The speaker before the last speaker criticized Republicans and said, ``You spent too much on your watch,'' and he was dead right. 
   This is the Hefley amendment. I voted for the Hefley amendment every time, trying to get us to cut 1 percent. Let me explain why. Because in 1994 when I was elected to Congress, and in 1995 and in 1996, we went across America, Republicans and Democrats alike, and we asked the American people if they wanted us to continue spending at that pace or if they were willing to see us reduce that pace of spending to reduce the burden on our children and our grandchildren. 
   One after another of them rose and said, ``Don't cut my program''; but one after another of them, every single one of them that I heard, at field hearings in Prescott, Arizona, and in Wyoming and Montana, said that if the cuts are even, if the cuts are evenly spread and fair to everyone, then, yes, you are right. We have to rein in spending to a level we can live with. That is what this amendment does. It is responsible. It is good public policy. I urge my colleagues to adopt it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of health care for America's poor and near-poor children. I also rise in equally strong opposition to this bill. 
   For more than a decade, I have introduced into the United States Congress every single year a bill that would give every single child covered by this bill health insurance. Indeed, it would provide to every family covered by this bill a source of money, tax funds, to them and their family, to buy the health insurance they need for them and their children. But make no mistake about it. This bill is a fraud. The American people are smart. They know it is a fraud. This bill is Congress playing fast and loose with the facts. If we are going to have a debate about covering every single American, let's have that debate. But let's not hide it in a debate about children's health care. 
   The American people are generous to a fault. They want to cover poor children. They want to cover children who are uninsured. The SCHIP program we have was supposed to do just that. But this program is a fraud. It doesn't cover just poor and near-poor. It covers middle-class families. Some will say, ``Oh, it is capped at 300 percent of the Federal poverty level.'' But under the law and the language in the bill, States can define income any way they want. Therefore, there is no cap on income. It doesn't just cover uninsured children. It covers more children who are insured already than those who are uninsured. CBO says that if we pass this bill, 2 million children currently covered by insurance, getting better coverage than they will get under this bill, will lose that coverage and go on SCHIP. Be proud of reducing the quality of the care they get. In fact, this bill isn't even limited to children. Indeed, this bill will cover adults. In Wisconsin today, 75 percent of the SCHIP money is used to cover adults. In Minnesota, it is 61 percent. In Arizona, we do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we want to have a debate about universal care, I am for that debate. I have got that bill. But don't have a bill that is a fraud. We must be honest in this debate. This bill will hurt children's health care in America.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Let me just ask you a question; I thought that when the Democrats took control, they promised the most open process in the history of the United States Congress. You've told us here in these remarks tonight that we're going to debate this for a whole day--a whole day. I thought those rules said that, in this open Congress, Members would get 24 hours to see a bill before it was voted on. I think our colleague, Mr. Westmoreland, brought that to our attention. And yet you mentioned that this bill has not gone to Rules yet and wasn't written in subcommittee or full committee or ever marked up in subcommittee or full committee. And it's in Rules in the dark of the night as we approach 10 o'clock here on the east coast. You can't really mean they're not going to give us 24 hours. You can't really mean they're going to write this bill in a back room and yet bring it to the floor still tomorrow, with less than 24 hours in this, the most open Congress in history? 
   I would be happy to yield back the gentleman's time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I want to thank the gentleman for conducting this Special Order. I think it's vitally important. I want to thank all of my colleagues, the chairman of the Policy Committee, my colleague, Mr. Westmoreland from Georgia, and each of my colleagues who have spoken before me. It is I think a particularly sad moment. Kids grow up in schools in America today believing that legislation is written in a committee process allowing people across the Nation, quite frankly, to have input either directly themselves to that legislation or through their Member of Congress. And so they get out a textbook when they grow up that says ``How a Bill Becomes a Law.'' And it shows that a citizen has an idea, and they take it to a legislator. And that legislator says that is a good idea, and they write it into a bill. And then they bring that bill to this floor and they introduce it. And the bill gets assigned to a committee, and from the committee to a subcommittee. And it goes through a subcommittee hearing and a subcommittee markup and a full committee hearing and a full committee markup. And then here in our body it might go to a second committee. And ultimately it goes through Rules Committee. 
   I suggest that in America we need to amend our textbooks because under the  current regime under Speaker Pelosi, that does not happen. Bills get written. This bill of huge moment and of huge importance to the American people was not ever written or introduced or seen in a subcommittee, never seen in a full committee, never had a chance for input. And that is shocking. But let me point out why that matters. 
   It matters because the Nation believes this week in Washington we're going to do something important. The Nation believes this week in Washington we're going to take up the drilling issue. I want to suggest to you, and I know my colleague understands this, that nothing that happens this week will have any legal meaning, any practical impact at all. I don't mean to be harsh. But it is a charade. It is, quite frankly, a hoax on the American people. And let me tell you why. Not one of these bills, not the bill you just held up, not any of the three bills that will be debated in the House and Senate this week, will produce a drop of oil. And if Americans sitting across the country are saying, well finally we're going to draft a bill that will produce some oil, they need to sit down. They need to listen carefully. They're about to be shocked. Not one drop of oil will be produced. 
   I will tell you why. Because the bill didn't go through a committee markup process. All of these bills are silent on legal challenges. I asked the gentleman in the chair to listen. He is a thoughtful Democrat. He knows that these things matter. I ask him to listen. Not one of these bills contains language dealing with legal challenges. And without that language, there won't be a drop of oil. Let me tell you why. This Nation has got people in it who will file lawsuits challenging whatever we do, and not a drop of oil will be produced. 
   Back that claim up, Congressman Shadegg. Well let me tell you the story. Here are the facts. Radical environmentalists, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and numerous others, Earth First, have filed lawsuits blocking every single oil lease issued in this country and all future oil leases already. 
   Let me give you some shocking statistics. In February of this year, the Bush administration issued 487 oil leases in the Chukchi Sea, which is the coast off the west side of Alaska. Radical environmental groups, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and others challenged not 80 percent of those leases, not 90 percent of these leases, they challenged with a lawsuit, pending right now, stopping those leases from going forward, all 487 leases. They didn't let one go forward. 
   The government decided to issue a 5-year plan for oil leases in Alaska and in the lower 48. And so in July of 2007, the Federal Government issued a plan to allow oil leasing over the next 5 years. Radical environmentalists, the Center for Biological Diversity and others, already filed lawsuits challenging every existing oil lease and every future oil lease. In Alaska there are a grand total of 748 oil leases. How many do you think have been challenged? I will yield to the gentleman. How many do you think have been challenged if there are 748?

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (THE DEMOCRAT ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. The gentleman is precisely correct. That is to say whatever bill we pass today, whatever oil leases come from that bill, if Joe back in Texas or Sarah in Washington State or Jill in my State of Arizona or Jack in Utah believe that that bill will in fact lead to drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, they are wrong. 
   It will lead to nothing because radical environmentalists will sue every single oil lease. This year in the Chukchi Sea, we issued 487. They sued to block 487. In all Alaska including the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, we issued 748, and they filed to block 748. 
   The Minerals Management Service this year approved an exploration plan for 12 leases in the Beaufort Sea. That is to say an oil company came in and said we've got a lease. We now want to go forward. Here is our exploration plan that they have to file with the government under current law. There were 12 of those that were approved this year by the Minerals Management Service of the Federal Government. How many of the 12 were challenged? All 12. You got it right. 
   There is another lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act going after every single lease in the country. But it is not just in the Outer Continental Shelf. Let's talk about here in the United States. On July 16, 2008, the Bureau of Land Management, New Mexico State office, auctioned off 78 oil leases, some in New Mexico, some in Kansas, some in Oklahoma, some in Texas, the gentleman who just spoke. Out of 78 leases they issued in New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, along comes a group called the Western Environmental Law Center and Wild Earth Guardians, and they filed suit against not 80 percent of them, not 85 percent of them, not 92 percent of them, they filed a lawsuit against 100 percent of the leases in New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. The government issued 78 leases. Radical environmentalists sue 78 leases. 
   This is I think a really sad day because the Democrats are holding themselves out, and tomorrow on this floor, they will say they are addressing drilling in this country. They will say they are going to allow drilling to go forward. And it is a charade. It won't happen because they know that the Center For Biological Diversity, Natural Resources Defense Council, and friends like Wild Earth Guardians will file suit and stop not some of these leases, not most of those leases, but every single one of them. 
   That makes me sad because it has the Congress deceiving the people of Arizona, the people of America. They are deceiving the people of my home State of Arizona too, and it shocks me. This is amazing. And somebody might say well, Congressman, that is the norm. People can always file suit. That is not true. When we did the Alaska pipeline, we wrote a provision into the law that said, if you want to file suit, you have to file it in this court and it has to be done in this amount of time. All of us on the floor here were here when we passed the legislation to build fencing along the southern border of the United States to keep out illegals. In that legislation, we said that if you want to file a legal challenge, the government can get you past that legal challenge. 
   I want to suggest, as I conclude here, that if Speaker Pelosi really wants to produce oil, if the Democrats on the other side in the Senate, the other body, really want to produce oil, if our friends, our good Republican friends who are a part of the original gang of 10, now maybe it's the gang of 16 or the gang of 20, if they really believe they want to produce oil and they want to contribute to this, it's easy.     
   You can write language into the bill that says we are going to allow lawsuits. Everybody believes in the process of law. I call myself a recovering lawyer. I don't want to preclude all lawsuits. But we can write reasonable language to block dilatory lawsuits, language that says you must file any legal challenge to this bill within 180 days, and it takes priority over any other litigation, and it must be resolved within that 180 days, and then you get a period of time of maybe another 180 days for appeal. 
   If we pass a bill here in the Congress, in the House or the Senate, which says to the American people we are going to allow drilling to occur, and it is silent, as that bill you are holding is, it is silent on expediting legal challenges, the bill is meaningless and we will have played a nasty, mean-spirited trick on the people at home who want us to do something about oil. 
   I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. If they care about solving the problem of drilling, if they really mean yes, I am willing to allow some compromise on drilling, then it has got to have language expediting lawsuits. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (MANNER OF CONDUCTING PROCEEDINGS IN THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for yielding and appreciate his taking the time to bring this message here to the floor and to talk about it. 
   I guess my curiosity or my interest is piqued by you talking about the conditions that are placed in this bill. I will tell you that I fundamentally do not believe that you can justify, that any nation could ever justify, announcing, while their troops were in the field in the middle of a war, announcing that on a date certain in the future, we are  going to unilaterally stop. It seems to me that the illogic of that should be apparent to everybody, but even perhaps the immorality of that should be important. How do we say to troops, well, fight until August of 2008, and then, by the click of a tock on the arm of a clock, by the hand going one more notch until it now becomes August 2008, the fight is over. To me, that makes no sense. And I think it is important that the Nation have a discussion about whether that policy makes any sense. 
   I would like to discuss it from two points of view. First of all, will withdrawing from Iraq end the war? I think that is a fair question. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, if we withdraw from Iraq, if we so called ``redeploy,'' that will end the war. Well, I think that is worth discussing, and I think that is an important issue. But I think there is another important issue, and that issue is, what do we owe to the people of Iraq? And on that latter point, I want to note that this morning a reporter for UPI appeared on Washington Journal; her name is Pamela Hess. She has written a series of articles that, as you know, in Washington Journal, they have callers call in. And a caller called in and said, look, this is an unjustified war; we are never going to win, all the various arguments. And she said, well, I would like to suggest, and she was not taking anybody's side in the fight; she said, I would like to suggest that it is important for us to recognize that while one can criticize or analyze the reasons why we went to war, and that is one set of facts and circumstances, one can also look at why we are there now. And interestingly, her assertion is one that I have made, and she laid out an explanation. She said, having come into Iraq as we did, having dismantled their army, sent them packing, having dismantled their police forces, sent them packing, having dismantled, disassembled, taken apart their government, we created a situation where there was chaos.     
   Ms. Hess, in her comments on Washington Journal this morning, said, stop for a moment and imagine if another country had invaded the United States and if they had wiped out our Army and wiped out and disbanded our police forces and sent them home and then taken down our government. How long would it take before even here in the United States we began to see chaos, not unlike the chaos you see on the streets in Iraq? 
   And her argument was one that I think is the other important argument which is not being made in this debate. The one, as I mentioned, is if we retreat, if we embrace defeat, as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are urging us to do, and say we cannot win in Iraq, let us leave and let us leave by a date certain, my first argument is, we can leave but the war will not end. I would suggest they have already demonstrated they will come to the United States. They will attack us here. They will attack Americans and nonradical Muslims all over the world. They will attack us and other Westerners in Europe, in Spain, in Indonesia. They will attack us everywhere. So I will suggest the war will not end. 
   The second argument is, forgetting how the war started, what obligation do we have to assist the people of Iraq in reestablishing the basics of a government, of a police force and of an army such that they can stop chaos, they can stop lawlessness? 
   One of the ways that you hear people in the Middle East articulate this, and the ambassadors from Jordan and Saudi Arabia came and made this argument to us and I think you heard them talk, they said the United States came into Iraq uninvited; the United States owes it to the Middle East and to the people of Iraq not to leave uninvited. And then you ask them what they mean by that, and they mean the same thing that Pamela Hess said, which is we have an obligation to aid the Iraqi people at least until they can get a government up and functioning, an army up and functioning, and a police force so that chaos does not reign. 
   I think those are the two key arguments. I would insert into the Record articles that Ms. Hess has written since returning from her most recent visit to Iraq that document the things that have changed. 
   Analysis: Loudspeaker Diplomacy  
   Ramadi, Iraq, Feb. 17.--It's old fashioned. It's low-tech but it works. One U.S. unit operating in Iraq has found the best way to win hearts and minds is to put loudspeakers on police stations. The speaker systems are erected over the police stations. The daily broadcasts are 10 to 15 minutes long. They are timed not to compete with the call to prayers, and the messages are written by the police and local political officials. Some of the speeches are copied onto CDs and distributed around town. The broadcasts include Iraqi top 40 music; news dispatches taken from the BBC and Al Jazeera, speeches by the governor and the police chief, warnings about high threat areas, and the national anthem. 
   ``That's a pretty catchy song,'' said Maj. Dan Zappa, the executive officer of the 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, responsible for security operations in some of the most contested areas of Ramadi. ``It's interspersed with popular music. We've got video of kids dancing, hundreds of them, jumping around.'' 
   ``We have the police chief in western Ramadi'' Zappa said, ``and he's addressing his family, his extended family and his tribe.'' Said Maj. Tiley Nunnink, a guest staff member of the battalion sent by the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab in Virginia: ``It's a vehicle for Iraqi policemen to say what they need to say to the people.'' 
   The loudspeaker program would be a gamble in a town without a legitimate local police presence. In that case it would just be the overbearing--and clumsily worded--symbol of the occupation trying to co-opt local religious customs, senior commanders said. 
   But they believe the loudspeaker broadcasts are part of what seems to be turning the population in Ramadi against the insurgency. 
   ``The system's working because the local population is approaching the Iraqi police with valuable information to help put down criminal acts--roadside bombs, building IEDs, stuff like that,'' Zappa said. 
   ``Those are definitely the metrics, how does the population respond to this?'' Nunnink said. ``You can hear it in the broadcast. The broadcast says thank you for providing this information. You're contributing to the further security of the city.'' 
   The loudspeaker initiative addresses a huge hole in U.S. warfighting capabilities in Iraq: Insurgents can turn around videos of successful attacks on U.S. convoys, or dead Iraqi soldiers, or doctored or misrepresented footage of events within hours, sometimes before those events have even been reported to American headquarters. The videos show up on racks of bootlegged DVDs and CDs that seem to be for sale on nearly every street corner almost instantaneously. 
   Deployed U.S. forces however, do not have the authority to respond directly on their own; ``information operations'' products and messages have to be approved at high levels in the chain of command. That takes time, and by the time the message is approved, the story has moved on. Score one for the adversary. 
   ``I have the power to call in a lethal air strike but not to respond to an insurgent video,'' one senior U.S. commander told UPI this week. 
   ``We've been getting our butt kicked by the (local) media,'' Zappa said. ``There would be an incident when they would blow up a Humvee and kill two Marines and wound civilians, and they would turn that around and say that we wounded the civilians.'' 
   ``That's how information travels out here, by word of mouth,'' Nunnink said. ``So the question was, how are we going to compete with that?'' 
   Ramadi is notorious as one of the bloodiest battlefields for U.S. forces. 
   ``There are local Iraqis doing great things for the community, innocent civilians, heroes, trying to put down the insurgents,'' said Zappa, a native of Pittsburgh. ``They are out there but they don't have the ability to get the voice that the insurgents do. So that population sitting on the fence doesn't know, doesn't understand because they are not in receive mode of that information.'' 
   For the last four years, U.S. forces have tried hosting daily radio shows or cobbling together television broadcasts to try to win the loyalty of the people. They hand out flyers promising additional reconstruction funds if violence ebbs. None of the delivery methods are really ideal for this culture; the flyers go unread, the television and radio require a recalcitrant public to actively tune in to listen. But one thing everyone listens to is the booming call to prayers from the local mosque's loudspeakers, five times a day, plus a sermon on Friday. 
   Zappa and Nunnink and several other headquarters officers meet weekly to discuss the ``non-kinetic'' campaign--that is, all the non-lethal activities the battalion conducts. 
   ``Our approach was what can we do that is gonna be more effective. We can kill bad guys all day but you're never gonna kill enough of them; They are always gonna create more. So we ask, what do the people really need? What's gonna give a tactical advantage? What's gonna get the Iraqi army, get the police out there? These are the things that drove us,'' Zappa said. 
   ``We realized the opportunity was here if we could convince people the insurgency is not supporting them, it was destroying their city ..... it was just offering chaos, and capitalize on that, and the little successes that  these (Iraqi police) guys were bringing to the table.'' 
   It was in one of these meetings they came up with the notion of a loudspeaker campaign of their own. 
   Analysis: The U.S. War of Ideas  
   Washington, Jan. 5.--As the ``global war on terrorism'' enters its sixth year, the United States government is beginning to rethink its approach to the larger battle--the so-called ``war of ideas.'' 
   The war on terror is, at its heart, a physical fight against extremists. The war of ideas, on the other hand, is a philosophical debate that pits extremist ideology in the Muslim world against tolerance and freedom. So far, however, the United States seems to be losing.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (MANNER OF CONDUCTING PROCEEDINGS IN THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman. You hit upon one of the keys or at least one of the major concerns or arguments that I have over the idea of our colleagues that we can withdraw from Iraq and it will end the war. 
   You touched upon the fact that radical Islam teaches that they must kill all infidels. I make the point that, look, I understand the desire of people who want us out of Iraq to end the war and end the killing and to not have American troops on the battleground dying each day. I want that as well. 
   The question one has to ask is, is that a viable strategy? A lot of people think back to the Vietnam War and say, well, look, we ultimately made a decision that we couldn't win the Vietnam War. Indeed, as your discussion earlier in this hour pointed out, there were Members of this Congress who decided we want out of Vietnam; we are going to cut the funding back; that will bring us home. 
   Some could argue that with the help of this Congress, we did cut off funding for the Vietnam War, and the Vietnam War did end. I would suggest for thoughtful Americans looking at this today, we are in a very different world. To my knowledge, and I have asked this of a number of people, I know of no incident ever where any North Vietnamese leader had announced that, if we finished in Vietnam and left Vietnam, that would be insufficient. I know of no Vietnamese, North Vietnamese, leader, Communist Vietnam leader, even leader of Communist China at the time, who said, as soon as we defeat the Americans in Vietnam, then we will take the fight to them in the United States. 
   That is a very, very, very, very different circumstance than we have here. Read Osama bin Laden. Read Ayman al Zawahiri. Read any of the leaders of the radical militant Islamic movement in the world of the leaders of al Qaeda, now thought to be reforming in the mountain areas of Pakistan and reasserting itself in a more cohesive fashion; they have made it clear. They don't want us just out of Iraq. Their goal isn't, if the Americans will leave Iraq, the war will end. They have never said that. What they have said over and over and over again is, we intend to kill the great Satan. 
   You talked about Ahmadinejad. He has given speeches in which he envisioned a world in which there is no Israel and a world in which there is no United States. How does one unilaterally declare peace? I think that is a fair question; could we have said at some point during World War II, you know what, we are losing soldiers in France, we are losing soldiers in the Netherlands fighting this battle, let's just quit, and the war will end? Or had Hitler said, I am going on, I am going forward, my plan is an Aryan domination of the world? 
   This is a different circumstance. The leaders of this radical, militant, jihadist movement have said, we must confront the infidel. As you just explained, they define it: Anybody who doesn't believe and practice Islam the way they believe it and practice it must be killed. 
   I think by announcing, as this proposed supplemental bill does, and the language of it clearly states, we will leave Iraq by August 2008 no matter what. We have to think about the message that sends. That is a very clear message. That message is, if you are Osama bin Laden hiding somewhere in Pakistan or on the border lands between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and you hear that message, and you know he is paying attention, and he has heard that message, what do you think? If you are Ayman 
   al Zawahiri and you are his chief lieutenant and you hear that message, it is very clear: Hang tight, lay low, go to the cities outside of Baghdad, keep your profile low, kill a few people on the side as you are going, but don't worry about it, because, in a handful of months, maybe as early as next January, but, according to this measure that the Democrats announced earlier this week, no later than August 2008, the Americans will withdraw from Iraq, gone, finished, out of here. 
   You have just announced to Osama bin Laden: Hang on, hold tight. In August, the Americans will abandon Iraq. In August, the war will end, and you will have control of Iraq, assuming the Iraqis can't defend themselves at that point, and you can take this war forward wherever you want to take it forward. 
   I don't understand the mindset of that. I understand the mindset of somebody who says, end the war tomorrow, let's bring them home. That is safe. If that's the choice of the American public, if that's the choice of the majority in this United States Congress, that is something, get them home and get them home tonight because they are safe. 
   But announcing that they will leave as of almost a year and a half from now, and between then they fight for what, is something I just can't understand. I do believe that Osama bin Laden and Al Zawahiri will understand that message.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   I would like to make three quick points. Sadly, this bill will increase our dependency on foreign oil, exactly the wrong public policy. It taxes the production of domestic oil and, therefore, encourages us to buy more foreign oil. The wrong policy. 
   Second, this bill will increase the cost of gasoline and fuel oil for every American. Make no mistake about it, when you increase the tax, the producers will pass that tax on and our prices are going up. 
   But I want to make a broader, more important point, and that is to discuss for the American people and for the record how this bill and the preceding five bills were brought to the floor. That procedure is a raw exercise of power, and I would like to ask my Democratic colleagues why they are afraid to allow discussion and dissent. 
   This bill came to the floor allowing Republicans no amendments. Zero. This bill didn't go through committee. It couldn't be amended in committee and it can't be amended on the floor. 
   Some people say this is a response to the Contract With America. I would like to make the point that in the Contract With America, we were allowed to set our agenda. You are entitled to set your agenda here. But in the Contract With America, for those bills we allowed Democrats to offer 154 floor amendments. To our Contract With America in 1995, you got to offer 154 amendments. We get to offer zero. 
   In our Contract With America, in allowing you to offer 154 amendments in addition to the amendments in committee, 48 of the Democrat amendments to the Republican Contract With America were adopted and became a part of the bill. Zero Republican amendments will be adopted because you allow none. 
   I do not understand and I do not believe that beginning this debate by not allowing the minority to express itself shows any pride. Let the minority speak. What are you afraid of?

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR MURDER VICTIMS -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank my colleague from Illinois for his strong words of support. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 223, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of a National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois and the gentleman from Georgia for their support, as well as the chairman of the full committee and the ranking member of the full committee. 
   This legislation is in fact very important to very many Americans; indeed, to, sadly, too many Americans. 
   I, along with my colleague, Mr. Chabot of Cincinnati, Ohio, introduced this resolution on behalf of murder victims and their families across our Nation. H. Res. 223 does two simple things. First, it recognizes the many organizations that provide services to the loved ones of murder victims. As the two speakers before me have acknowledged, a victim of crime suffers greatly over and over again, and there are many organizations across our country that help them. The second thing this resolution does is it supports the establishment and urges the establishment of a National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims to be held on September 25th of each year. 
   I noted that in our prayer today we were called upon to thank God for our loved ones and our families. This bill is very much about those loved ones and those families who are left behind when a murder is committed and someone is taken from us as a result of violence. 
   On September 25, 1978, 19-year-old Lisa Hullinger was murdered by her boyfriend. Three months after her death, her parents formed the National Organization of Parents of Murdered Children, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. Parents of Murdered Children earnestly advocates for the thousands of parents who have lost a child as a result of violence. Parents of Murdered Children is one of many organizations that do this work, that help the friends and that help the families to try to cope with the loss of a loved one. 
   Other organizations include the National Organization for Victim Assistance, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, as well as the National Crime Victim Law Institute. Each of these organizations plays a vital role, and there are so many others. This resolution not only honors Parents of Murdered Children, but all of the similar organizations providing support and assistance to the loved ones of murdered victims. 
   Mr. Speaker, since the introduction of this resolution I have received countless e-mails from all across the country, not just from my district, but from everywhere: from mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives and children of murder victims.     
   All of them have contacted me to say how much they appreciate what the United States House of Representatives is doing for them today. This legislation is indeed important. 
   We all know that there are established days of remembrance for many dark days in our Nation's history. There is, of course, one for 9/11. There is another one for the day of the Oklahoma City bombing. These were both solemn times in our Nation's history, and yet people are murdered every single day. 
   On 9/11, almost 3,000 Americans were brutally murdered. It is worth noting that every 10 weeks in this Nation, another almost 3,000 Americans are murdered. That is why I believe we need to establish a day that not only honors them and recognizes them, but also recognizes and honors the victims they leave behind, the family members, the fathers, the sons, the daughters, all of the others who suffer so much. 
   Each of us has a list of tragedies that we know of personally. My colleague from Illinois recited several. There are way too many. 
   I cannot rise today without thinking of Duane Lynn and his wife, Nila. Duane and Nila lived in a retirement community in north Phoenix after Duane retired from the Arizona Highway Patrol. One day they chose to attend a homeowners' association meeting in their neighborhood. Tragically, a killer walked into that meeting and senselessly murdered Nila. Nila died in Duane's arms. That was a crushing blow to him and a pain that he suffers every day. 
   But Duane took that negative pain and became an advocate for other victims. With his help, this Congress passed the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, Nila Lynn Crimes Victims Act of 2004. 
   I also think of Sally Goelzer, whose brother, Hal, was murdered in a gang initiation killing. Sally took the pain of that incident and went to work to fight for tougher laws against gangs and against gang killers. 
   I am also reminded of the incredible story of Colleen Campbell and her tireless work on behalf of victims, as well as that of her husband, Gary. Colleen tragically has lost not one family member, but three family members on three separate occasions to murder. 
   First, her son, Scott, was murdered. Then later her brother, well-known and famous in America for his work in auto racing, Mickey Thompson, was murdered. And then still later, her sister-in-law, Trudy Thompson, was murdered. 
   Colleen has spent 22 years in and out of various courtrooms in America dealing with the pain inflicted upon her by the murder of these three loved ones. Again, she has turned that negative pain into being a tireless advocate for victims and for victims rights. She was essential to the creation of victims rights legislation in California and she established Force 100, one of the earliest advocates for victims' rights across this Nation. Force 100 sought to create organizations in every single State in America to advocate for victims of crime. 
   There are so many stories. There are too many stories. But these victims and their courageous survivors need to know that we in the Congress, and we as a Nation, remember their tragedy and their courage. 
   Today, this Congress, this House, can do its part. We can say that too many of us have been affected by the horrors of murder, by passing this simple, yet very important, resolution, acknowledging that murdered individuals are not the only victims; that those left behind to cope with the loss on a daily basis are victims also. 
   We can tell them, however, that those family members and loved ones are not alone. We can recognize the many organizations that do invaluable work to help them. That is why this resolution not only acknowledges the murder victims, but also honors the organizations and the people who devote  their lives to counseling, crisis intervention, assistance and other help in getting those victims through our criminal justice system. The work of these organizations is so invaluable to so many. 
   The last organization I want to talk about is the National Crime Victim Law Institute at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. This organization, recently established, provides legal assistance to the victims of crime, and has established many programs in colleges across our country, and, I believe, in eight different law schools across our country, to help give legal assistance to the families and the loved ones of those murdered who are left behind. 
   H. Res. 223 lets victims, families and friends know that they are not alone, and that we remember their loved ones. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and honoring all of those men and women who have devoted their lives to helping those among us who have to cope with the senseless violence of a murdered loved one.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I rise in opposition to House Concurrent Resolution 63, the resolution that calls on us to disapprove of the increase in troops in Iraq. I rise to oppose it, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to carefully reflect on what we are doing. 
   This debate may benefit the American people. This resolution will undoubtedly harm America and harm our troops. Every American wants our troops home. Every American wants this war over. But it is not that easy. You cannot just wish this war would end and believe it will go away as a problem for America. Life is never that easy. 
   Let us begin with the text of the resolution. Make no mistake about it, it is very brief, and all of us should have read it. It is two sentences long. It essentially says: stay the course. A resolution which says, we oppose increasing troops, but we support our current troops is a resolution that says, stay the course. 
   It is not a resolution that says withdraw. That might be a morally defensible position, because perhaps we should withdraw, at least some believe. It is not a resolution that says, put in more troops. It is a resolution that says, adding more troops is wrong, but we support those that are there. 
   That is a resolution to stay the course. I would suggest no American believes we should stay the course. I would suggest that the RAND study and the Army's manual on counterinsurgency both suggest that staying the course is wrong. Indeed, it is a recipe for failure. Both RAND and our own counterinsurgency manual say, if anything, we should have between 400,000 and 450,000 troops there. 
   So why would we support staying the course? Now, we all know that many of us, and I included, wanted a change in strategy in Iraq. My colleagues on the other side called for a change in strategy. This surge is the change in strategy. 
   Indeed, and I am mystified, and I am glad some of my colleagues today have made the point, this is the change in strategy, at least one of them, recommended by the Iraq Study Group. I thought my colleagues on the other side supported that. It seems to me that there is also an important flaw in this debate. 
   My colleagues say that this is a nonbinding resolution. I would suggest to you that when you are at war, and when the United States Congress acts with regard to that war, it is not nonbinding. The world is watching. The world is watching every word that is said on this floor. 
   I believe we have a moral duty to finish what we began. Earlier on the floor, my colleagues have mentioned that many leaders in the region, in the Middle East, have begged us not to leave. They have begged us to stay at least long enough to stand up the Iraqi Government so that it can defend itself. They have implored us not to leave. 
   Let me give you their words. They have said, because they opposed our originally going in, the coalition came uninvited, it should not leave uninvited. They are making the point that we have a duty to finish this effort. They have talked about analogies. They pointed out that a heart surgeon who begins a heart surgery is not entitled, halfway through the surgery, to say, you know what, I am tired, I want to leave. 
   On the other side of the aisle many of my colleagues have said this is hard. Indeed, it is hard. But that is not a justification for leaving. The best analogy I heard was one that said, this is like stepping on a land mine, where you put your foot on it, but you know that if  you lift your foot off it will blow up. We have put our foot on a land mine in Iraq. But if we lift our foot off before the Iraqi Government can defend itself, it will blow us up, and it will blow them up. 
   You cannot wish this war away. And so I would suggest this resolution is binding. The world is watching. Our allies, if we abandon Iraq, will never trust us again. But why do they want a nonbinding resolution? Because they do not want to accept responsibility. 
   The President does not have that choice. He has responsibility. Those who oppose this war have a duty to take a stand, one side or the other. If you oppose the war, then seek withdrawal. If you do not, then do not undermine our troops. Because make no mistake, this nonbinding resolution hurts our troops. 
   Let me just conclude with this point. In the midst of an ongoing war, it is impossible to support the troops and oppose the mission. Let me make that clear. The world is watching. Our enemies, al Qaeda, and the radical jihadists who hate us and want to kill us are watching. If we tell them we oppose the mission, we are encouraging them. They have guns, rockets, and missiles pointed at our troops. This resolution is a grave error. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And I have listened to his eloquent words today about the radical threat we face. 
   I have a fundamental question for the other side. I thought our colleague from New York did a superb job of acknowledging the good intentions of every Member of Congress involved in this debate and the good intentions of the majority. I share his frustration with the progress of the war to date. I share the comments made by my colleagues on the other side who are unhappy at how we got here. But I think that misses what I believe is the essential question we confront now, and that is, where do we go from here? What will this resolution do? And I would suggest that that is a question that has not been examined in this debate. I would suggest that many would like to wish this war would go away, that many would like to believe that if the United States withdrew its troops from Baghdad and withdrew its troops from Iraq that somehow Iraq as a problem would go away. 
   But, Mr. Chairman, you have made the point over and over and over again today: this isn't about Iraq. 
   I would ask my colleagues on the other side can they name a single jihadi leader, a single radical Islamist, who has said if they prevail in Iraq, if we will just leave Iraq, that this will end, that they will no longer desire to conquer the world, that they will back away from all of their rhetoric about attacking all Westerners everywhere? And I suggest you can't name anyone like that. 
   Let me read you just a few quotes to make this point. Ayman al Zawahiri, we all know who he is, a well-known jihadi leader: ``It is a jihad for the sake of God and will last until our religion prevails.'' Not until we abandon Iraq, but until their religion prevails. 
   ``The entire world is an open battlefield for us,'' he goes on to say. ``We will attack everywhere until Islam reigns.'' Ayman al Zawahiri does not say we will attack until the war in Iraq ends, we will attack until Americans pull out of Baghdad, we will attack until they are no longer in the nation of Iraq. He says, ``We will attack everywhere until Islam reigns.'' 
   Again al Zawahiri: ``The jihad in Iraq requires several incremental goals. The first stage: expel the Americans from Iraq.'' Note that that is only the first stage. ``The second stage: establish an Islamic authority or emirate. The third stage: extend the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq.'' It will not end. 
   If your resolution, if a resolution tonight, could end this war and bring our boys home and our girls home and make the world safe, I would be the first to vote for it. But it won't. 
   Osama bin Laden says it clearly: ``Hostility toward America is a religious duty, and we hope to be rewarded for it by God ..... I am confident that Muslims will be able to end the legend of the so-called superpower that is America.''  
   We are on notice. I think we have to take them at their word. It isn't about Iraq. It is about our confrontation, a historic confrontation, with radical jihadists who seek to kill us

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I like us being pleasant with each other. 
   I think this is a fascinating debate and an important debate, and, quite frankly, I have watched it unfold over the bills earlier this year. And the reality is, in Washington, nobody has the high ground on spending. 
   When I and my colleagues as fiscal conservatives get up on this side and say cut spending, as we are in this amendment by a mere 1 percent, it is absolutely fair and absolutely true for my colleagues to get up on the other side, as they have done and done well, and lecture us about spending. You guys are the, to use the words a moment ago, platinum standard on spending. And in many ways they are absolutely right. 
   I note with chagrin that because neither Republicans nor Democrats have the high ground on spending, something has to be done, and I would suggest at some point we have to begin. Maybe it is with this amendment, maybe it is not with this amendment, maybe it is with something else. But let's talk about spending. 
   On our watch, on the Republicans' watch, family income grew from 1995 to 2004 by 8.2 percent. Pretty good. Not bad. We could all wish it had been better. But what did Republicans do on spending? Republicans grew Federal outlays by a staggering 25 percent. You are right, we don't have much high ground to talk about. But when, then, will we start? And who will it be that starts? 
   Your side of the aisle encouraged the American people by saying, James Clyburn, Democratic House chairman, said in a press release on October 10, 2006: ``Democrats offer a new direction which includes fiscal responsibility.'' 
   Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi in a press release November 16 said: ``We will work together to lead the House of Representatives with a commitment to integrity, to civility, which we have  seen a little bit of tonight, and to fiscal responsibility.'' 
   And Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said: ``It is imperative to the future of our Nation, and I agree with him, that we come together, Democrats and Republicans, and restore fiscal responsibility.'' 
   There are some hard facts that both sides have to deal with. Those hard facts include: As we stand here debating this bill, it will increase spending by 6.7 percent over last year, this particular bill. That is nearly three times the rate of inflation. It might be less than Republicans grew the spending in some occasions; but nonetheless, if we keep growing spending at three times the rate of inflation, we will double the size of this government in a short 10 years. 
   I would simply suggest that neither Republicans nor Democrats can defend putting that kind of a tax burden on our economy and on our taxpayers and sustain it. And I would suggest that the respected leaders of the Democrats' party, Mr. Clyburn, Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Hoyer, acknowledged that when they said it is time to restore fiscal responsibility. 
   This kind of an explosion in Federal spending is simply not sustainable. Now, I have listened to my colleagues on the other side say, well, you guys spend in this area or that area. Now you want to cut here. You come in and say, we spent in an inappropriate way on, call it corporate subsidies, call it tax giveaways, whatever it is. So be it. That is fair criticism, too. 
   But the question I think that presents itself to all of us, Republican and Democrats alike, is: When do we reduce spending? 
   If you don't want to reduce spending on this bill by 1 percent or on the next amendment by one-half percent, then where are we going to cut spending? Because at the end of the day, this economy, I do not believe, will sustain, whether it is driven by Republicans or Democrats, a continued growth of three times the rate of inflation. 
   The average American gets by without anywhere near that kind of an increase in their spending. The average American's budget doesn't double in that short a period of time. It doesn't go up by 6.7 percent per year. And it seems to me, whether it is on your watch on this bill, on your watch on a different bill, or on our watch someday down the line, we have got to rein in government spending, or we will cripple this economy. And if you want to change the priorities and spend in different places, that is your right. You are the majority. But somebody, whether it is you or whether it is us, has got to reduce the level of spending, because it simply isn't sustainable.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I rise in strong support of this amendment. It is an amendment that I hope all our colleagues understand. It would reduce the increase in spending not by 3 percent, not by 1 percent, but by one-half of 1 percent. Now, it is not a cut. 
   The word ``cut'' gets misused on this floor, and we have heard it misused and misused and misused and misused here tonight. No one is proposing a cut. 
   We just heard a long discussion about how the last amendment was going to cut spending for airport security. It was going to cut spending for housing for the elderly. It was going to cut spending for this program and that program and the other program. 
   Let's assume every single one of those programs is a very worthy program. There is no doubt that they are. They are indeed very worthy programs. But not a single amendment has been proposed tonight, not one amendment, not one amendment proposed by my colleagues, would cut spending. Every single amendment proposed by this side, every single amendment proposed by my colleagues over here who have said we want to change the bill a tiny amount, would increase spending, but we would reduce the increase by a tiny amount.     
   Only in Washington can a reduction in an increase be called a cut with a straight face. 
   This bill grows spending by 6.7 percent. Almost no American is going to get an increase in their income this year, in their salary this year of 6.7 percent. So we said wait, wait, let's reduce the increase. We're going to have an increase; every amendment is going to have an increase. Let's just reduce that increase by a tiny amount, by a 3 percent reduction in the increase, or a 1 percent reduction in the increase, or on this one, one half of one penny on the dollar. And that's too radical. And that's called a cut. 
   Well, let's be honest; it's not a cut. None of these are a cut. But it is time to slow the pace of growth of government spending. It is time to slow the pace of that growth because it imposes a burden on every single American. And we are simply standing here, and I'm proud to stand here, and if somebody wants to call it a ``fringe group,'' that's their choice. But I'm proud to stand here in defense of the American taxpayer and not to slash and burn and cut. There is no cut. 
   What we're saying is this side has proposed spending at an increase of 6.7 percent, almost three times the increase in inflation. We're simply saying how about take off one half of one penny. 
   I think the lady's amendment is right, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I rise in opposition to this legislation, but I compliment my colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak). He has, in fact, worked diligently on this issue, and I join him in my concern about prices that are charged to the American people. Indeed, he just indicated he would very much like to see relief at the pump, and so would I. I happen to drive a Ford F-250, which does not get good gas mileage, and I, along with others, would like to see relief at the pump. I certainly commend all those who are cosponsors of this legislation as having good intentions. 
   My concern, however, is that it will not achieve that result. The reality is we do have very high gas prices, and we have prices that have gone up dramatically in just the recent few months. We all want to know the answer for that, and I've spent some time trying to look at it. 
   Unfortunately, I don't see evidence that there is price gouging and that high gas prices are a result of price gouging. What I see is that they are the result of policies of this government, and it seems to me that we ought to be looking at the policies of this government. 
   For example, we as a Nation, this Congress, have imposed a tariff on imported ethanol. We could bring in ethanol produced in other countries at a dramatically lower price than the ethanol we're producing in this country today, but instead, we tax that ethanol and make it even higher priced. Last year, when the prices went up, I voted  against price-gouging legislation, but I dropped my own bill to suspend that tariff so that we could take advantage of lower-priced ethanol. Unfortunately, the Congress didn't move in that direction. 
   Two years ago, I went to the commodities market in New York, and they told me the problem with gasoline prices is refineries. We do have a lack of refineries in this country, and I've dropped legislation to encourage the construction of more refineries. I think there is concern that the refinery industry is holding the capacity of those refineries right at the edge so the prices can be the highest possible. 
   But one of the issues you hear is that part of the reason gasoline prices are so high right now is because of the conversion from winter gas to summer gas. That conversion is compelled by government regulations which drive up the cost and by government regulations which spell out precisely how it must be done and that they must draw down supplies. 
   It seems to me, before we start tampering with the free market, which has served us so well, and before we start passing very wide ranging legislation of this type, we have to make a decision. Do we want the government to regulate prices? Do we want a huge new bureaucracy in there looking at a poor mom-and-pop gas station to see if they raise prices? Or do we want to look at the policies of this government which have held down supply and which have not met demand? 
   It seems to me this is simple and straightforward. I understand the urge to do it, but the problem is, if we empower a massive new government bureaucracy, we will not get relief at the pump which Mr. Stupak wants and which I'd like to see. We will indeed just create a large bureaucracy.     
   In my home State of Arizona, we have tried this. We have had attorney general after attorney general, even in my tenure, when I was in the attorney general's office, we investigated price gouging and could not find evidence of it. Let's look at the market forces that are causing these high prices. I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Madam Speaker, I rise to say that this bill is tragically flawed. It contains no increase in FDIC insurance, which would make people comfortable and safe when they're rushing to their banks right now. It contains no capital gains tax, no tax changes, no attempt to deal systematically with the problem. Most importantly, it contains no change in the mark-to-market rules. 
   This morning, a banker of mine called me from Arizona. He said, ``Mark to market is destroying the capital in the market, and is dragging down the value of these markets.'' He explained that bank examiners are not even enforcing their own rule. Their own rule says an asset shouldn't be marked down until, one, its value drops and, two, until the people stop making payments, but bank examiners are now saying that they must call it mark to market and destroy its value even if the owner of the property is still making those payments. 
   We have asked over and over again for FDIC insurance to be increased and for a change in the mark-to-market rules. Again and again and again and again, those requests have been rejected.

That amendment would strike a grand total of $300,000 from the public affairs budget of the Department of Homeland Security. It would hold the Department's public affairs budget to the same figure that they are living with this year. I would suggest that that is not a shocking proposal. It is one that I am happy to support, and one that I think illustrates the kind of thing we can do in this Congress on this floor to demonstrate to the American people that we get it, that we understand that as a Nation we are overspending. We are spending not our money, we aren't even spending our children's money; we are spending our grandchildren's money. And they, the American people, have told us they do not want us to do that. They want us to stop that practice. They want Republicans to stop that practice, they want Democrats to stop that practice, they want conservatives to stop that practice, they want liberals to stop that practice. They want us to live within our means and to be reasonable. 
   The ranking member of this committee has spoken earlier today that the bill increases spending by 13.6 percent. I want to ask, how many Americans, how many people in this room, how many Members of Congress, how many of your children who have gotten a job this year will get a 13.6 percent raise this year? I suggest virtually no one can answer that question and say they will get that kind of staggering raise. 
   Instead, the ranking member has proposed a reasonable solution which is, in fact, quite frankly, generous in and of itself, and that is a 7.2 percent increase. Not exactly a tiny, not exactly a squeaky cheap amount; a pretty darn generous raise, a generous raise that probably any American would take. And yet, that is not enough. 
   I also rise to express my objections to the earmarking practices that are being condoned and that are proposed to be implemented in this body. 
   The reality is that earmarking has its defenders and can, in fact, do some good. The reality is that earmarking is also susceptible of outrageous abuse and can lead to scandals. Many of the scandals in this body which were talked about by the minority in the last election are scandals that relate to earmarks. And yet, in the face of promises that we would have more sunshine, in the face of promises that the American people would get to see where their money is being spent, that they can hear about it, that it could be challenged and debated on this floor, that it could be vetted and viewed, I happen  to believe in sunshine. I came out of the Arizona Attorney General's Office, and we had the most open sunshine laws in the Nation because we believed sunshine would bring cleanliness, sunshine would allow people to see what government was doing. And here we propose to hide that. We propose to hide tens of thousands, I guess the chairman of the committee says 36,000 earmarks are going to be air-dropped into the legislation at the end of this process. That is simply unacceptable to me, and it ought to be unacceptable to the American people. 
   The gentlelady just spoke of the importance of securing the Arizona border, and I believe that is extremely important. But let's talk about one provision of this bill that simply not only makes no sense, it is hypocritical, and it will clearly violate the U.S. Constitution. 
   In this bill we say point blank we are appropriating $1 billion for new high-tech security. And I certainly agree with my colleague from Arizona that every dime of that $1 billion for high-tech security on our border is needed. If we are to secure that border, we need that money. But this legislation says, we appropriate $1 billion, but then $700 million, almost three-fourths of $1 billion, is reserved and cannot be appropriated until a committee in the Congress says so. That is unconstitutional.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   It seems to me we are in some danger of forgetting what we are here about. We are here about the second-degree amendment of the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry). I rise in strong support of that amendment because it would restrain the excessive spending in this bill. 
   But it's more important that we talk about what we are really here about. What we are really here about is the people's business. What we are really here about is how we spend their money. 
   What brings us here tonight, in the middle of the night, is that the majority has proposed a procedure for handling earmarks which is inconsistent with what you told the American people. It is indefensible, and it cannot stand. You can recognize that. You can accept that fact tonight and change that procedure; you can accept that fact tomorrow.

   Mr. SHADEGG. You can accept those facts tonight and change the procedure. The majority can accept that fact tomorrow and change the procedure. The majority can accept that fact next week and change the procedure, but the procedure will change. 
   I have the greatest respect for the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I admire his energy, his tenacity and his passion. I understand that he believes he has proposed a fair system. I understand that he has just recited for us a history lesson about how earmarks were handled in the past. 
   But I would suggest to you that time moves on. The American people now understand earmarks in a way they did not understand. The American people understand earmarks, and they understand this process, and they cannot be fooled. You cannot take the process for disclosing earmarks and make those earmarks public after the bill has been debated. 
   There is not a constituent of yours that believes that makes sense. The American people understand that some people in this body believe earmarks are very good, and some people in this body believe earmarks can be very bad and very corrupt. 
   They are in unanimity on one point, and that is, they want to know what's in those earmarks. That means those earmarks have to be debated on this floor. 
   Now, I understand that the gentleman who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee believes that he can just vet them, and he can post them in August, but that obviates the most important part of this process. We do not engage in this process by adding language to bills, critical language to bill language that the American people don't get to see or know about after debate has occurred. 
   We didn't tell the American people that we would make the process open this year, that we would disclose every earmark and allow every earmark to be debated, because we don't run the place. 
   You run the place. You're in the majority.

   Mr. SHADEGG. The majority party told America that these earmarks would be openly revealed, and that means they have to be debated. 
   It doesn't matter. You can relent now, or you can go on and defend this practice through the press tomorrow and tell them that you want secrecy. You do not want a Member over here to be able to debate an individual earmark. You do not want that earmark revealed to the public today. 
   You do not want that earmark revealed to the public today. You want to put its being revealed off to some point later, when no Member can raise it or object to it, but the American people get it. The history lesson is nothing more than a history lesson. 
   Earmarks in this body must now be disclosed because the Speaker said she would disclose them. That's all we are asking for. We are asking that they be disclosed so the American people can see them, so that our constituents can see them, and so on this floor we can debate them and discuss them. The good ones will pass, and the ones that are corrupt or inappropriate will fail. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Thank you. I would rather cut the Secretary's budget by $101 billion as a way to save money than to cut the Medicare Advantage program because the Medicare Advantage program helps millions of Americans and thousands in my own congressional district. So as the Democrats propose to cut that program in their SCHIP bill, I believe it would be better to cut this program. 
   I rise in support of the McHenry amendment to cut $101,000 from the Secretary's budget because the Medicare Advantage bill will cut 3 million seniors' ability to collect their benefits through Medicare Advantage. That 3 million includes some of the poorest of seniors who are on Medicare Advantage, and I would rather cut $101,000 from the Secretary's budget than cut that money going to Medicare seniors who need it desperately. 
   I support the amendment by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry) to cut $101,000 from the budget of the Secretary of Agriculture because the other cut we are faced with is a $15 billion cut in part A, including a cut in benefits to skilled nursing facilities, as the Democrats propose to do in their SCHIP bill.

   Mr. SHADEGG. And I will continue to say that a $15 billion cut in skilled nursing facilities is, from my perspective, a bad idea, much worse than a $101,000 cut from the Secretary's budget. And, therefore, I rise in strong support of the McHenry amendment because I don't want to see skilled nursing cut as the Democrats propose to do in their SCHIP bill. 
   I support the McHenry amendment which would cut $101,000 from the Secretary's budget because I don't support cutting rehabilitation facilities as the Democrats would do in their SCHIP bill. 
   Indeed, I would much prefer to cut $100,000 from the Secretary's budget than to cut, as the Democrats do in their SCHIP bill, rehabilitation facilities.

   Mr. SHADEGG. As I believe I have, quite skillfully. 
   I do rise in very strong support of the McHenry amendment because I believe that cutting the Secretary's budget is a much better idea than cutting skilled nursing facilities. 
   I believe it is a much better idea than cutting long-term hospital facilities, as the Democrats do in their SCHIP bill. And I think it would be much better to cut $100,000 from the Secretary of Agriculture's administrative budget than to cut, as the Democrats do, funding for long-term care by hospitals. 
   It seems to me this is a simple debate: Where do we cut? I would much rather cut $100,000 from the budget of the Office of the Secretary than to cut $9 billion from Medicare plan B, including payments for oxygen, as the Democrats do in their SCHIP bill. It seems to me that kind of cut in their SCHIP bill is a bad idea. I would rather support the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. SHADEGG. And I thank the Chairman for her ruling, and I am pleased to say that each of my points have tried to explain that I support, adamantly support the amendment by the gentleman to cut $100,000 from the Secretary's budget because I don't favor these other cuts. I don't favor cutting the funding for end-stage renal disease programs. I would much rather cut the Department of Agriculture administrative budget than do as the Democrats would in their SCHIP bill, cut $3.6 billion from the end-stage renal disease program. 
   It seems to me that the amendment of the gentleman from North Carolina to cut $100,000 from the administrative budget of the Secretary is a much-preferable method to achieve the savings that we need. In each of these instances, I believe that cutting the Secretary's budget would make much more sense than cutting the Medicare program. 
   I have constituents in my district who would much rather see us cut the Ag budget than see us cut Medicare or see us cut end-stage renal disease or than see us cut oxygen therapy as is all done in the Democrats' SCHIP bill. For all of those reasons, I believe it is very important that we support the gentleman's amendment.

As I understand the ruling of the Chair, it is appropriate for me to say I support the gentleman's amendment because I do not support cuts in skilled nursing facilities or cuts in rehabilitation facilities or cuts in long-term care hospitals or cuts in oxygen, or cuts in brachytherapy, or cuts in end-stage renal disease or cuts in Medicare Advantage; but that I cannot say which appear in their SCHIP bill. Is that correct?

   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman. My colleague on the other side just said nobody got everything they wanted out of this bill. The reality is nobody gets anything out of this bill. Nobody gets anything of out of this bill except the environmental groups who will sue to block all oil production. The reality is we are legislating to solve a crisis that we created. It was the Congress at the urging of environmental groups that blocked Outer Continental Shelf drilling. It was the Congress that blocked drilling in the Inter-Mountain West. It was the Congress that blocked drilling in Alaska. 
   Do you know what that has done? That has cost Americans jobs. That has cost the people in my district their chance to earn a livelihood because we locked that all up. Are we opening it up today? Is my colleague right that this is a compromise? Absolutely not. We are not opening up one single square inch of drilling. Let me make it clear. The Sierra Club said ``we are working very hard on this bill to ensure that its focus is not expanded offshore drilling.'' Mr. Murtha, a close friend of Speaker Pelosi, said, he admitted that, this is a political month. Last Wednesday, he said that there are all kinds of things we are going to try to do that will go away after we leave. 
   They don't plan to produce oil under this bill. It's just talk. The legislative director of the radical Natural Resources Defense Council acknowledged the same thing about the Democrats' ploy: ``This is about politics, not necessarily about policy.'' Democrats know that not a drop of oil will be produced because lawyers will file lawsuits stopping every single one. Let me make the point: The administration last year issued 487 leases in the Chukchi Sea. Environmental groups sued to stop and have stopped all 487. 
   The administration has a total of 748 leases in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea. How many lawsuits have been filed and how many leases have been challenged in lawsuits? All 748. Various oil companies in February of 2007 filed  exploration plans for 12 separate leases in the Beaufort Sea. How many of the 12 have been challenged? Every single one. The BLM in New Mexico offered for sale 78 leases in New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. How many have been sued? Every single one.

   Mr. SHADEGG. The truth is this problem could be easily solved. If my Democrat colleagues were genuine about wanting to create American jobs, about putting Americans to work and about getting off our dependence on foreign oil, then put reasonable language in the bill that limits lawsuits. We can allow lawsuits. But they don't have to be dilatory. They don't have to be such that no oil will ever be produced. 
   Sadly, the Speaker called our efforts to produce a hoax. If you don't fill the litigation loophole in this bill, this bill is a hoax. And it's not nice to fool the American people, to tell them you're doing something when you know you're not doing anything.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day for America. Contrary to what my friend from Massachusetts says, there is no drill, drill, drill, no change in this bill. There is not one drop of oil in this bill. And let me explain why. 
   I went to the Rules Committee and said that any oil produced under this bill will be challenged in lawsuits and there won't be a drop produced. Let's put a limit on the lawsuits. The Rules Committee said absolutely no. 
   Why did I do that? Last year, the Bush administration issued 487 leases in the Chukchi Sea. Environmental groups sued not 484 or 485 or 486. They sued every single lease. 
   There are 748 leases also in Alaska in the Beaufort Sea. The environmentalists have sued all 748. 
   There were 12 drilling plans filed last year with the Minerals and Management Service to produce oil off of Alaska. How many were sued? All 12. The Center for Biological Diversity, the Natural Resources Defense Council, every single lease has been challenged in court. We could solve that problem with limits, reasonable limits on litigation.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Chairwoman, this is an issue with which we're all very familiar. We've just heard some interesting debate on the floor here. My colleague, Mr. Cooper, offered I think an excellent amendment to increase the funding for Historically Black Colleges and made a very strong case for that. He noted that he was not able to designate a source for that and that it would require $125 million in funds. 
   We just discussed the importance of science education and the need for funding for that amendment, and the Chairman of the full committee has made the point that there simply aren't enough funds to accomplish these purposes. 
   I would suggest that this amendment is something that we could look to find those funds. It strikes funds for the AmeriCorps program, saving some $255.6 million. That is double the amount of money needed to fund or to plus up the funding for Historically Black Colleges requested by Mr. Cooper and, therefore, would leave room for the science funding that was just advanced. 
   I would suggest that, while well-intentioned, the AmeriCorps program simply does not achieve its goal. It has been plagued throughout its history with paying volunteers for programs that are inappropriate, and I will recite some of those, but more importantly, it denigrates the notion of volunteerism. 
   This Nation has been known since its inception for its grand tradition of volunteerism, going back to Alexis de Toqueville, who wrote about America and the volunteers of this Nation. It simply is important for Americans to volunteer, and the notion of this program to pay young people to volunteer simply makes no sense. 
   Let me talk about some of the abuses. AmeriCorps volunteers have been paid to lobby against the voter-approved California initiative to put violent criminals in prison for life after their third violent crime. 
   AmeriCorps volunteers, if you can call them that since they're paid, have been paid to disrupt Republican political events while working for the liberal advocacy group Acorn. Don't just trust me; it's a fact. 
   AmeriCorps volunteers have been paid to press for rent control in cities across our Nation. 
   AmeriCorps workers, not really volunteers, have also been paid to seek expanded Federal housing subsidies and to enroll more people in welfare programs. 
   Indeed, Citizens Against Government Waste, the watchdog group here in Washington, has vigilantly tracked many examples where AmeriCorps funds have been abused, and Citizens Against Government Waste issued a report saying that AmeriCorps has become a showcase for the waste and abuse inherent in many federalized civic sub-enterprises. 
   Both private and public investigators have determined that AmeriCorps' financial books are unauditable. AmeriCorps' own Inspector General years ago documented cases in which recruits received funds for working at a McDonald's while being paid for not working at all and for working while they were in prison. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I honor each of the gentlemen here who were Peace Corps volunteers. I recognize that they, indeed, may have been inspired to become pure volunteers, unpaid volunteers, as a result of their service in the Peace Corps. But I think what is sad about this debate is we haven't really discussed the issue I raised. 
   My colleague from Connecticut says he is for a program where they are paid a stipend to live and how they couldn't volunteer unless they were paid some living expense or unless they were paid for some food expense. Unfortunately, that's not the structure of the AmeriCorps program. The AmeriCorps program we are debating today, and the one that I am challenging the funding for and suggesting how funding could be better used, provides wages to the AmeriCorps so-called volunteers. 
   If we want to create a separate program, I am in favor of that. If we want to encourage volunteers by paying them a stipend instead of wages, by providing them housing instead of wages, then we might not distort the meaning of volunteerism, but we don't do that. 
   That's not what this program does. This program pays them wages, and as in the example I cited, it pays them wages in some cases to do work for which they are being paid, to work at a McDonald's. It seems to me that if you want to inspire volunteerism, which I encourage and encouraged in my opening remarks, then let's inspire volunteerism. 
   If you want to provide a stipend for housing, let's provide a stipend for housing. If you want to provide a stipend for meals, let's provide a stipend for meals. But don't call wages a stipend for housing or meals. These are wages to which these people are paid. I suggest people that do volunteer in this country, and there are millions, to set up a government program to say the only people that volunteer are people who are encouraged to volunteer by being paid to do so diminishes all of us and all of the volunteers in this country. 
   I wholeheartedly agree that if we want to revise AmeriCorps and make it a program which encourages volunteers  and pays them to volunteer and pays them a stipend for a living, including housing and/or food, absolutely. But to pay them wages is wrong. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

As the gentleman knows, we live on opposite sides of the country, you in New York and I in Arizona. But the essence of your amendment says we should not be judging these schools until they've had a chance to, in fact, educate these children in a second language. And judging them after only 12 months, as the gentleman clearly pointed out, is unrealistic and punishing the school, which means to punish all the students at that school and all the parents of those students and all of the teachers and administration officials at that school by evaluating those children and holding them accountable after only 12 months is unrealistic.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that this is supposed to be a healthy debate, and quite frankly, I don't think Members on either side should criticize Members for coming to the floor and debating issues. 
   The gentleman from New Jersey raised, I believe, a legitimate issue, and that is the issue of the equity of people from one State paying in much more money to the Federal Government than they get back versus people from another State getting much more money back from the Federal Government than they pay in and questioning a particular program. That's the kind of debate that is supposed to occur here. It's the kind of debate that should occur here. 
   Indeed, I think everyone on this floor acknowledges we have a problem with having spent too much money. We have a problem with too much debt, and I think the people on this side of the aisle have tried to make the point that at some point we need to stop that spending or slow that spending, and I believe the people who have carried forward this discussion, at least from this side of the aisle, have readily acknowledged that a great deal of that overspending occurred on our watch. We're not trying to point blame, but we do have a duty to come here and debate our financial priorities and debate our jobs.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, I'm happy to conclude this by simply noting that no Member who brings an amendment to an appropriations bill is criticizing the ranking member or the chairman of that committee.

   So I want to make it clear that I don't believe that by the gentleman from New Jersey or myself or any other Member of this body, any Member on the majority side, offering an amendment, and there have been amendments offered, in doing so that they are in any way criticizing the good hard work. Indeed, I think we're honoring the tradition of the Appropriations Committee in that these are, in fact, brought to floor under an open rule, and we have full and open debate which I think is what the American people want.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, I hope that this is a simple and straightforward amendment. It is premised on the notion, not that the program doesn't work, but rather, that when the task is finished, the funding should stop. 
   This program, the Advanced Credentialing Program, was established by the Congress to develop teacher standards and to have those standards developed by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards or other nationally certification or credentialing organizations. That task has, in fact, been accomplished. 
   The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, a private body, has received more than $180 million from the Department of Education since 1991. These Federal funds supported the development and implementation of the certification standards and assessments in 24 different academic fields. That task has now been completed. 
   In addition, since the legislation called for such standards to be established by other nationally recognized certification or credentialing organizations, the Department awarded $32.8 million in a 5-year grant to the American Board for the Certification of Teacher Excellence. That board will receive the final year of its funding in Fiscal Year 2007. 
   By Fiscal Year 2008, the American Board for the Certification of Teacher Excellence will have successfully completed the development and implementation of its teacher credential system. As a result, State and local teaching organizations, educational agencies, will have not one but two different sets of standards to pick from, one developed by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and one developed by the American Board for the Certification of Teacher Excellence. I believe when the task has been completed, it is important that we stop the funding. 
   I want to make clear that the purpose of this amendment is not to eliminate funding for States to encourage teachers to receive advanced degrees or to assist them in that endeavor. 
   My wife is a teacher. She has a master's degree. She received her advanced credentialing in order to improve her education and her ability to serve as a teacher, but the task has now been accomplished. 
   The Department, as well, supports giving States and districts more tools to help them identify and retain effective teachers. Indeed, the 2008 budget requests $2.8 billion for the improving teacher quality State grants program and an additional $199 million for the teacher incentive program. These programs combined provide flexible sources for State and local education agencies to use to improve their teacher recruitment and retention systems according to their own needs. 
   The goal of this amendment is to simply acknowledge that the creation of the standards has been accomplished and accomplished by two different entities, the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) and the American Board for the Certification of Teacher Excellence. 
   In addition, I would note for anyone concerned about this that the effects of the NBPTS credential system on student achievement have been somewhat mixed. There are studies that show it has been somewhat helpful. However, the studies have found the positive effects are very small and that they are neither large enough nor consistent enough to justify further Federal funding beyond that which is provided in the existing $2.8 billion for improving teacher quality State grants, and the $199 million that I already referred to in teacher incentive fund training. 
   I do wish, at this point, that I had reallocated the $10.7 million that would be saved by this amendment to Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Having listened to the discussion of the last bill, I note that IDEA is underfunded. It has all been underfunded, and I wish that I had cast this amendment in that fashion. I did not do so but I, nonetheless, would encourage its adoption and would encourage, perhaps, those at conference to take that $10.7 million and to add it to IDEA funding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to express my concern about the tone of this debate. Let me make it clear: I compliment my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Ethics reform is needed here, and today you are making a good first step. But please listen carefully to those of us on this side of the aisle who will vote with you for this package when we implore you to go further and when we take some credit for the efforts of the past. 
   It is true that we passed as a law through this House, sadly the Senate did not follow suit, a bill that corrected many of these things. Your bill, in some respects, goes further, but some of us are concerned that it needs to go even further. And it is not because we are revisionists. 
   I have campaigned in this body and out of this body throughout my career for reform. I believe it is not enough just to do so-called lobbyist reform. We must direct our ethics reform at the Members of this institution. And one way to do that is a way that was recognized by our new Speaker a decade ago, and that is to say that the Hiss Act, passed clear back in 1954, which said a Member of Congress who was convicted of bribery would lose his or her pension, should be reinstituted, because it was repealed in 1961. 
   Over a year ago, watching what I was disappointed in in the criminal conduct of some Members of this body, I introduced a bill with 57 cosponsors saying that any Member, any Member, Republican, Democrat or otherwise, convicted of bribery in connection with their office ought to, at an absolute minimum, lose their pension. And I believe that is the standard we owe the American people, and no less. 
   My colleague says this is just a rules package, but this is your first hundred hours. There is no rule that says you could not have brought a statute, and I implore the gentleman and tell him that I will join with him, as will my colleague from Illinois and my colleague from Nebraska, each of whom had introduced bills a year ago or more seeking to prohibit Members from collecting a taxpayer-funded pension when they have, as the gentleman from Massachusetts pointed out, used this office not as one of public trust but one of public abuse to benefit themselves.  
   There is no time for delay. Pass a reform now punishing Members who misuse their office. Take away their pensions and do it now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that this is an extraordinary moment in American history. Indeed, I would suggest that this is an unprecedented moment in world history. 
   I know of no example in the history of mankind where a Nation at war with troops in the field has announced that on a date certain almost 2 years off it will simply unilaterally stop the war. I don't believe that has ever happened before in human history, and I believe it is a stunning moment. 
   What I do not understand is how you can explain that or defend that to either the soldiers you are asking to fight for the next year and a half or to their families. And I am not the only one who finds this to be a strange policy, a dangerous policy, a risky policy, an ill-advised policy. 
   The Los Angeles Times wrote just a few weeks ago, ``It is one thing for the House to pass a nonbinding vote of disapproval. It is quite another,'' they said, ``for it to set out a detailed timeline.'' It then went on and said, ``This is the worst kind of congressional meddling in military strategy.'' Those are the words of the Los Angeles Times. 
   Then let's look at another source. In 2005, now majority leader of the U.S. Senate Harry Reid said, ``As far as setting a timeline, that is not a wise decision, because it only empowers those who don't want us there.'' 
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relation Committee, Joe Biden, said a deadline for pulling out ``will only encourage our enemies.'' 
   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said, ``I don't believe it is smart to set a deadline for withdrawal.'' 
   This is a policy that makes no sense, and this is a policy that can do nothing but harm our troops and our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment and sadness at the majority's politicization of funding for our veterans. 
   This is a sad day. Today, the majority is tying Veterans Affairs funding to outrageous overspending in a completely separate bill to pork. That is a sad day. It's using our veterans for political gain. 
   America's veterans deserve better than that. They deserve the support of the American people, and they certainly deserve the support of this Congress. 
   Yet, as you've heard, the Veterans Affairs appropriations act passed this Congress months ago. It should have gone to the President. But here we stand today fighting the leadership of the Democratic Party who has decided to attach that bill to a separate, contentious, already bloated spending measure, essentially to blackmail our veterans. 
   Madam Speaker, next week is Veterans Day, and this is how we're honoring our veterans who have served our country and fought for our freedom. 
   Our veterans deserve the money in this legislation. They deserve to have the appropriation passed as a stand-alone. I call on the Congress to do that now, today, and not to punish our Nation's veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is flawed in many respects. It provides $7.5 billion in loans to cities, States, and nonprofits to buy foreclosed homes from mortgage lenders who made bad loans. That will not help people avoid foreclosures. In addition, it provides $7.5 billion in grants to rehabilitate those homes. As such, it is a giveaway to the mortgage industry that made bad loans. 
   Nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is a genuine attempt to improve this bill. If the majority insists on going down this path, the least we can do is to give those who have served our Nation the highest priority in receiving housing assistance under this legislation, and to make sure that those who have preyed upon our society as criminals are not helped by the legislation. 
   In its present form, the bill allows homes acquired and rehabilitated with taxpayer money to be purchased by convicted drug dealers, convicted sex offenders, and people who have been convicted of mortgage fraud. 
   Last night our colleague, Mr. Altmire, offered an amendment that prohibits homes made available for sale under this bill, acquired and rehabilitated with taxpayer dollars, from being sold to illegal immigrants. That was a good amendment and I am glad to see that the House just now overwhelmingly adopted it. 
   In advocating for his amendment, Mr. Altmire said that homes made available through this bill should be available only to law abiding U.S. citizens. 
   My colleagues, Mr. Altmire is right. This motion to recommit brings the same commonsense to this bill that Mr. Altmire's amendment did. It simply says that homes made available under the bill cannot be sold to drug dealers, sex offenders, or people convicted of mortgage fraud. 
   I ask my colleagues, imagine how you would feel if your taxes were taken under this legislation and used by the government to purchase foreclosed homes, then to rehabilitate a foreclosed home in your neighborhood, and then if that house was put on the market and sold by the government to a convicted drug dealer, a convicted sex offender, or person guilty of fraud in the mortgage industry who contributed to the very housing turmoil we are now faced with. You would be outraged, and you should be. We cannot let that happen under this legislation. 
   The second provision of the motion to recommit corrects another defect in the bill. Yesterday an amendment was offered to provide veterans and public safety officers such as firemen and police with a preference in purchasing homes made available under this bill. The chairman of the committee quite appropriately accepted that amendment. But we can do better than that. This motion to recommit takes that concept one step further. It provides that disabled American veterans are to be accorded an even higher preference in acquiring homes under this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, every Member in this body is aware tragically that American soldiers are returning with horrific wounds. Like many of you, I have been to Landstuhl Hospital in Germany and visited our fighting men and women. I have been to Walter Reed Army Hospital and visited them. It is wonderful that we can save their lives, but this motion to recommit recognizes and rewards their sacrifices. It provides that disabled veterans, seeking to purchase a home made available under this legislation, must be given first preference. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are commonsense changes to this bill that will improve it, and I urge my colleagues to adopt them by passing this motion to recommit. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Madam Speaker, reserving the right to object, I would like to clarify the unanimous consent request that is before us and get a further understanding of any other agreements that may have been reached. And I would appreciate if I could clarify these points with the distinguished majority leader and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
   First, as I understand it, the agreement is that with respect to the 10 bills that will come up following this bill and Military Construction, that is the bills that we would begin on, I presume, Monday, there is an agreement that all of those bills will come to the floor with all of the earmarks which are proposed to be placed into those bills added to those bills before they come to the floor. 
   That is an extremely important point. That was the issue we have debated for the last few days. We believe that sunshine is the best way for us to ascertain what is in those earmarks. Admittedly, we may have no objection to any of those earmarks, but that is only possible if we know that the earmarks which are to be added to those bills are added to the bills before they come to the floor. 
   So, I would like to know if in fact that is the agreement that has been reached. 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I really wish this debate was about what my colleagues on the other side want to make it about. I wish this bill was a debate about the uninsured children of the near poor or the working poor. I wish it was a debate like we had 10 years ago about insuring children too well off to get Medicaid but not well enough to buy insurance. But that is not what it is about. It is about cutting Medicare to provide health care services to middle- and upper middle-income children and to provide health care services to adults. 
   And when you hear SCHIP, children, you don't expect that. When you think it is to go to the uninsured, you don't expect that. 
   The median income in America, listen carefully, is $45,000. This bill will extend SCHIP benefits to families earning $60,000 and up to $80,000. That means it does not provide money for health insurance to the poor or the near poor or the working poor. We are all for that. That is why we initiated the program. We just don't think it ought to go to upper middle-income Americans. 
   And let's see what the program has done. Sixty-one percent of the children who are in the SCHIP program today had private health insurance before the program was created. They dropped their private health insurance to take SCHIP. Is that what generous, compassionate Americans want to do for the poor? I don't think so. They dropped their private insurance to take SCHIP. 
   CBO says that the Democrats' billions of dollars larger program will produce one person dropping private insurance for every one person who gets SCHIP insurance. Speaker after speaker on the other side has said this will insure 5 million more children.     
   What they don't tell you is that 5 million children, according to SCHIP, will drop their private insurance. Obviously, what they want is to take people off of private insurance and put them on SCHIP. That's not what the American people understand when they understand that that is supposed to be a bill about the children of the working poor. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. It's a fraud.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise to discuss a part of this debate that relates to the Intelligence Committee, and I think it is important that I thank them for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have argued on this floor that this discussion and debate ought to be about more than just Iraq, indeed, that it is about the worldwide jihadist movement to attack us. I have argued and quoted many jihadist leaders who have said their goal isn't just to win in Iraq, but to take that fight to Westerners and, in turn, ``unbelievers'' throughout the world. 
   But I am not alone in that view. This is the language of the National Intelligence Estimate written last April, and it warns America in very simple terms. It sets the case forward in two clear sentences, which I hope all of my colleagues have read and thought through. 
   The first sentence is, ``We assess that ..... perceived jihadist success [in Iraq] there would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle elsewhere.'' What does that tell you? If they are successful, if the jihadists who hate us in Iraq are successful there, they will carry that struggle on elsewhere. Ask yourself, where is elsewhere? I would suggest to you elsewhere is Great Britain. I would suggest to you elsewhere is Japan. I would suggest to you elsewhere is the United States of America and the streets of your hometown. 
   I have challenged my colleagues on the other side of this debate to name for me a single jihadi or Islamist leader, name one, name me just one who has said if we withdraw from Iraq, if we pull our troops back, they will stop. Name me one who has said that if we leave Iraq they will walk away and not carry their fight to the rest of the world. 
   But I am not alone in saying this issue is bigger. Let me tell you what the National Intelligence Estimate, written by our Nation's best and brightest intelligence experts in every intelligence agency we have, said next. They said, ``Should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive themselves, and be perceived, to have failed, we judge fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight.'' That is the national intelligence community giving us a simple message. If we prevail in Iraq, the world will be safer. If we are defeated in Iraq, the world will be more dangerous. 
   Now, I would argue that there ought to be some attention given to the words of the troops in the field, and I want to devote the rest of my remarks to a column written by First Lieutenant Pete Hegseth last October. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask to insert this column by First Lieutenant Hegseth in the Record. 
   More Troops, Please--``NOT LOSING'' ISN'T THE SAME AS WINNING   
   I've heard President Bush repeatedly state he will send more troops to Iraq if the commanders on the ground ask for them. I think, having returned home from Iraq two months ago, that there must be a breakdown in communication somewhere along the line. Maybe units on the ground are painting too rosy a picture for the generals. Perhaps the generals aren't asking because it goes against the ``can do'' ethos of the Army. Possibly the military is being squeezed by the Pentagon to do more with less. Or maybe the White House doesn't want to admit more troops are needed. In any case, while I do not have the answers nor do I seek to place blame, it is painfully obvious there's a disconnect. 
   I volunteered to serve in Iraq because I believe in our mission there. I share the president's conviction about the Iraq war--we can and must win, for the Iraqi people, for the future of our country and for peace-loving people everywhere. But I'm frustrated. America is fighting with a hand tied behind its back. Soldiers have all the equipment we need--armored humvees, body armor for every body part, superior technology, etc.--but we simply do not have enough troops in Iraq, and we need them now. 
   After witnessing two national elections during three months in Baghdad, my Army unit moved north to Samarra, where we spent eight months sowing the seeds of progress. While we had success in uprooting the insurgency and building the local government, it wasn't enough. We had just enough troops to control Samarra and secure ourselves, but not enough to bring lasting stability or security. ``Not enough'' became the story of my year in Iraq. 
   The future of Samarra, and Iraq as a whole, ultimately lies in the hands of her people--their sympathies are the ultimate prize in this war. No matter how many insurgents we kill, city leaders we meet or policemen we enlist, it is all for naught if we cannot provide security and stability. Tribal sheikhs told us that even within Samarra--deep in the Sunni triangle--a vast majority of people just want peace and order and will side with whoever can provide it. Right now Samarrans rightfully question who that will be. 
   The end goal is for Iraqis to do everything for themselves. But their government and security forces are not ready. Insurgents use death threats and murder to assert power over anyone working with the City Council or joining the police force. This atmosphere forces moderate Samarrans to keep their mouths shut, and their silence abets the insurgents who live and fight in Samarra. Despite killing scores of insurgents, we are unable to provide lasting security, and so the Samarran street slips away. 
   Two things are to blame for our predicament, one a corollary of the other. The first reason is that we did not have enough troops in Samarra. The skill and courage of 150 American soldiers prevented chaos, but was never enough to fully secure a city of 120,000 people or maintain the rule of law. The soldiers in the city were preoccupied with defending themselves and conducting night raids, and were therefore largely unable to regularly patrol during the day--thus giving insurgents reign to move freely and intimidate the local population. A visitor in Samarra on an average day would be hard-pressed to point out a single American humvee traversing local neighborhoods. The same is true for Baghdad. 
   Our four-vehicle civil-affairs patrol was often the only American presence deep inside the city and we were frequently greeted by locals with the question, ``Where have you been?'' Americans can't of course be omnipresent; but we should at least be there when it matters. When Americans are there, either the insurgents are not or they are on the losing side of a firefight. 
   Second, because of a lack of troops, American military leaders are forced to make a choice between mission objectives and self-preservation. Many of our leaders are opting to guard supply routes and coagulate on sprawling military bases, rather than consistently moving into dangerous areas and fighting the insurgency. In our case, we had 500 soldiers stationed outside Samarra who made infrequent trips into the city center. There is little reason why most of these troops were not stationed inside Samarra, canvassing every neighborhood with platoon-sized patrol bases and suffocating insurgent operations. Rather than take the risks necessary--like small patrol bases and frequent foot patrols--our unit opted to secure itself and its supply routes rather than commit resources inside the city. And while this approach is safer in the short run, it only prolongs mission accomplishment, ultimately endangering more troops. We often speculated our unit would be back next year, driving the same streets with even fewer guys. 
   I believe that ``the safety of America depends on the outcome of the battle in the streets of Baghdad.'' Why then do we have just enough troops in Iraq not to lose? Americans understand a defeat in Iraq would have horrible consequences for America and its allies for decades to come. America has the capacity to win. 
   Why then are we pursuing a bare minimum approach?

   Mr. SHADEGG. Pete Hegseth served in both Baghdad and Samarra for a year. He was an infantry platoon leader in Iraq. He fought both on the streets of Baghdad and Samarra, and here is what First Lieutenant Pete Hegseth said about the surge. He never heard the term ``surge,'' but he described the struggle he faced. He said, and I quote, ``America is fighting with a hand tied behind its back.'' ``We simply do not have enough troops in Iraq, and we need them now.'' That was last October. 
   Discussing his situation in Samarra, Lieutenant Hegseth went on. There in Samarra, he goes on to say, and I quote, ``We had just enough troops to control Samarra and secure ourselves, but not enough to bring lasting stability or security.'' 
   He goes on and says, ``Two things are to blame for our predicament. The first reason is that we did not have enough troops in Samarra,'' and I quote ``the second, because of a lack of troops, American military leaders,'' those on the ground, those engaged in this fight, ``are forced to make a choice between mission objectives and self-preservation.'' He goes on to complain that all too often that choice that they are forced into is protection of our troops, not mission objectives. 
   Let me tell you how he concluded, because I think it is pertinent to this debate, where what we seek to do is to disapprove the surge of 20,000 troops. 
   I believe that the safety of America depends on the outcome of the battle in the streets of Baghdad. Pete Hegseth  asks, and I quote, ``Why then do we have just enough troops in Iraq not to lose?'' 
   To conclude, he says ``Americans understand a defeat in Iraq would have horrible consequences for America and its allies for decades to come. America has the capacity to win.'' He wrote, ``Why then are we pursuing a bare minimum approach?''

   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentlelady from Tennessee for yielding, and I want to commend her for her work. You know, there is a story here tonight. There's a story the Nation needs to know. There's a story of an institution charged with protecting this Nation and carrying out the responsibilities of this government, and it is a story of shame. It is a story of failure. It is a story of an institution that's supposed to be doing its job and isn't. 
   And I commend the gentlelady from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for her efforts to bring that story forward, to point out the 3,565-page bill that was laid on us less than 20 hours ago when we were given less than 20 hours to pass it. 
   But the real story here, I would suggest, is a story that some of my colleagues have already commented on, and that is the story of 9,200 earmarks in this bill. Now, I suppose if you're an average American you're sitting back at home and you flip through the TV channel and you catch C-SPAN and you know generally what an earmark is. But let me tell you what it is. An earmark is an effort by a Member of Congress to name some little project that will somehow benefit, or they can make an argument that it will benefit, them or their constituents in some way, and yet, sadly, when you examine those earmarks, you find one thing is true. Every single one of them is self-serving, designed to get that Member of Congress re-elected, and every single one of them is put in there with huge effort. 
   Now, in this bill, we have 9,200 individual Member projects, earmarks, if you will, inserted in the bill. You heard my colleague, Mr. Ryan from Wisconsin, point out that 300 of those Member projects or earmarks were dropped in this bill just last night. That is to say, they've never been seen before. 
   Now, my colleague from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, pointed out that none of us could do what I was asked to do when I ran in 1994. When I ran for the United States Congress in 1994, my constituents said to me, Congressman, we want you to go back there and promise us you'll never vote for a bill that you haven't read. Ladies and gentlemen, no one can read a 3,565-page bill in 20 hours. It can't done be done.  
   I had a conservation with a constituent this weekend when I was home, and he said to me, because I was complaining to him about earmarks, about misspending, he said, Well, I thought that the Democrats cleaned that up. I thought that practice ended. I thought they'd ended that. I thought the reforms had changed that. 
   Well, the gentlelady from Tennessee and the gentleman from Texas and my colleague from Wisconsin have pointed out the story of the night. The story of the night is all the talk about reform was just that; it was talk. Reform has not happened. If the American people believe that they elected a new majority to this Congress to end wasteful spending, it didn't happen. If they believe they elected a new majority to Congress to get things done in regular order so we could review the bills and read them before they were voted on, it did not happen. If the people across America believe they elected a new majority, and that new majority reformed the rules to end earmark abuse, it didn't happen, because those earmarks are here. 
   Hillary Clinton's hippie museum, it's here. And God knows what else is in this bill, because the 3,565 pages which sit right there cannot possibly have been combed by all of us in this time. 
   What you have heard is that while Congress could find time to put in 9,200 earmarks in this bill, and combined with prior bills, take the total earmarks for the year to 10,300, roughly, roughly $17.6 billion in Member projects and earmarks, we could find the time to do that. All the Members of Congress could, you know, write out their list requests and say, I need this project and I need that project and I need this project, and Hillary Clinton needs a hippie museum, and God knows what else is in this bill. But we couldn't find time, as my colleagues from Texas and Tennessee and Wisconsin have pointed out to you, we couldn't find time to put money in there for our soldiers in Iraq. 
   Oh, we could find time to renovate the U.N.'s headquarters in New York. We could find time to essentially overturn the Secure Fence Act by making it almost impossible to build that fence. We could find time to craft 692 pages of individual Member requests, little requests, fund this so that I look good and I get re-elected. We could find time for that. We could find time for 9,200 of those. 
   We could air-drop, that's right, you heard, air-drop earmarks. What does that term mean? Well, an air-drop earmark is an earmark that is inserted in a bill after it has left both the House and the Senate. How many of those are there in this bill that nobody's ever seen, perhaps, but the author of the bill? There are 300 of 
   those. So we could find time for 9,200 earmarks, 300 of them air-dropped, never seen before. No American, no average American back home has had any chance to review them. We could find time for that, but we could not find time to fund the war in Iraq. 
   I commend the gentlelady for bringing these facts forward. I think it is a story that America needs to know. They need to know that this Congress, as the gentlelady from Tennessee pointed out, was supposed to do this work clear back last August, last September, and be done with it. But they couldn't find time to do it until now, almost Christmas Eve. But by gosh, they could find time for their earmarks, their pet projects. But no time for the Nation's defense. 
   I commend the gentlelady from Tennessee. I appreciate her yielding me time. I think this is a story the American people know about, need to know about, and I think it's worth saying here one more time. My friend Tom Cole from Oklahoma said, ``Earmarks are a gateway drug to higher spending. I suggest this bill proves that to be true. Once again, earmarks pave the way for higher spending. And as my colleague from Texas pointed out, that means higher taxes, less money in the pocketbooks and wallets of the American people, more money in the hands of the government to, frankly, misspend in ways to try to get themselves re-elected. I think it's an important story. I think it's a sad day, and I commend the gentlelady for asking the time, late at night to take her time and to work hard to make sure that some Americans know the abuse that's going on, the outrages, the hundreds of thousands of earmarks and the hundreds of thousands of air-dropped earmarks, special projects nobody has ever seen that are put into this bill. And I commend you for the job you're doing.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I want to take this opportunity tonight to discuss one of the hottest topics here in Washington, a topic that has occupied much of our time. It's been an issue on which we have debated and discussed extensively. And I think that's been good for the American people because it has enabled them to learn what they didn't know to begin with. 
   The topic I want to discuss is the proposed expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, what you have commonly heard referred to as SCHIP. That's a program that was created a number of years ago, and the President has put on the table some parameters about how to renew the program, but the Democrats have decided, no, we need to dramatically expand the program. And I think it's important to discuss these issues and for the American people to understand what is involved. 
   But on this one, I think it's more important than usual. And I think a way to illustrate that is that very recently a Republican colleague of mine was stopped by a reporter here on Capitol Hill. The reporter said to him, hey, how can Republicans possibly vote against the State Children's Health Insurance Program? And the reporter was incredulous at this thought, given that it's a health insurance for children and that its title said it's the State Children's Health Insurance Program, how is it the Republicans thought they could vote against a bill with that title? Well, fortunately, my colleague, who was quick of mind, said, I think a better question is, how could any Member of Congress vote for a bill based solely on its title? And, in fact, that's what the Democrats are urging us to do, vote for this dramatic expansion of this health care program just because its title indicates it's for children. 
   And in reality, you begin to take apart the various levels of the onion, the layers of the onion and examine the program and you discover, well, it's supposed to be an insurance plan for poor, uninsured children; and yet, if you examine it, you discover that it's not for poor or even near-poor, it's not for uninsured and, in fact, it's not even for children, a rather stunning provision. You discover that it's actually for middle- to upper middle-income Americans, some of whose families make more than $60,000 a year, and in some States their families make more than $80,000 a year. That's hardly anybody's definition of poor. 
   So, if it's not for poor children, then one would think, well, it's supposed to be for uninsured children. And yet, you discover, no, as a matter of fact, 61 percent of the children who originally became eligible for this program already had insurance. So, the program hasn't really been to help uninsured children, at least not initially, 61 percent of the children who are eligible already had private insurance, and they dropped that insurance to go on this government program. 
   Well, then you look at the CBO score of the current Democrat bill. And we ought to talk about how many times they've brought this up and the President has vetoed it, and I know there  are some of my colleagues here who will discuss that, but the Congressional Budget Office scored the current proposal that's before us, and CBO said that one out of every two children who become eligible under the new bill, under the bill that Democrats would have before us now, one out of every two will already have private health insurance. One out of two new children who become eligible for this program will already have private insurance. And if they decide to drop that private insurance and go on the SCHIP program, this Cuban-style, government-run program, well, half of those people will have already had private insurance and they will drop that insurance. 
   That opens the door for a discussion, I think, about the fact that, and CBO estimates 2 million; if 2 million kids in America who have private insurance drop their private insurance to go on this new expanded government program, the cost of that private insurance for everyone else will go up. So, let's see: It's not for poor or near-poor; it's not for the uninsured. Surely, this program must be for children because, after all, the Democrats are saying nobody can vote against a bill that's called the State Children's Health Insurance Program, but. 
   Voila, you discover, no, it's not just for children. As a matter of fact, there are a number of States where there are more adults on the State Children's Health Insurance Program than there are children on the program. As a matter of fact, I think in Wisconsin, it's 61 percent of the money is spent, not on children, 61 percent of the SCHIP money, State Children's Health Insurance Program money, 61 percent is spent on adults. I believe in Minnesota it's 75 percent of the money for the State Children's Health Insurance Program is spent on adults. 
   I looked at my own State. I thought, you know, I'm in Arizona, I'm interested in what's going on in Arizona. Kind of a shocking fact I discovered, and that is, Arizona had, at one point in time, put 110,000 adults on the program, but, and listen to this one, this is the State Children's Health Insurance Program, they put 110,000 adults on the program, and 85,000 of those adults were childless. They didn't even have a child. 
   Now, unfortunately, there is no such thing as truth in legislating, so it's okay to label a bill the State Children's Health Insurance Program and have it intend to cover poor and near-poor uninsured children, and then to dig into the weeds of the bill and read and discover, well, it's really not for poor and near-poor, it's for upper- and upper middle-income Americans. It's not for the uninsured, at least in several States, more than half are already uninsured. It's not even for children. It's for adults. And I think many Americans know that the President vetoed this bill. And then the majority party, the Democrats, decided to put off the override vote. And their thought was, well, we will put off the override vote and put these Congressmen under pressure to try to 
   force them to vote for the State Children's Health Insurance Program and override the President's veto. Well, when the truth is on your side, when the facts actually help you, when the facts point out that the program isn't what its title says it is, it isn't really the State's Children's Health Insurance Program for poor and near-poor children who are uninsured, it actually covers middle-income kids and not-poor kids, it covers kids that are already insured and causes them to drop their private insurance, and it covers adults, the delay didn't help, and the delay caused more Americans to learn about the bill. 
   But last week, on the last day we were here, once again the Democrat Party tried to stuff through a bill, without making any real changes to it, that had all these same flaws to it. And so, I thought it was important that we should come to the floor and talk about those issues. But there are actually more. I want to talk about the funding source. Because as challenging and as, in fact, untrue as the claims are about the bill covering poor children or uninsured children or even children, it turns out the funding mechanism is a scam as well. Actually, it's got all kinds of budget gimmicks in it, and it relies on certain things that simply will not come true and wouldn't be good policy if they did to fund it. 
   But before we move on to the funding issues in this bill, which I think is important for the American people to know about, I would like to give some of my colleagues here on the floor a chance to talk about their view of the bill, why we do support health care for poor and near-poor children, we do support health care for uninsured children, we just don't want to do it for middle-income Americans. We don't want to do it for those who already have insurance. As a matter of fact, I've had a bill that I've introduced in this Congress every year for the last 10 years to give a refundable tax credit to every single American who can't afford health insurance and let them buy their own coverage. So, I support dealing with these kids who need care, but not in a way that deceives the public about what we're doing. 
   I would be happy to yield to my colleague to give us her perspective on this important piece of legislation and help, perhaps, educate the American people about what this debate is and why we have the concerns we have about the bill.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Reclaiming my time, I would like to just bring out a couple of the points that the gentlewoman from Tennessee mentioned and drive them home a little bit. I think the key one you mentioned was coverage of illegal aliens. As I understand it, the way the bill is written, it, in fact, appears to prohibit illegal aliens from being covered under the bill, but the authors of the bill have conscientiously, intentionally chosen vague language that would require virtually no proof of citizenship. Is that not correct? Would you explain that?

   Mr. SHADEGG. Income disregards is a perfect segue to what I want to talk about in this bill, and it stuns me, and I know that the authors of the bill have been confronted, and they have been asked to change the language to make it clear that this coverage would not go to illegal aliens. They have rejected that. They use the term ``income disregard.'' What the heck is an income disregard? People in my congressional district certainly don't know what it is. But it is game-playing. 
   This is one I love. And you used the phrase, why would anyone write a bill and have it intentionally designed to fail; have it through kind of shifty means, through kind of squeaky wording, through provisions that you know won't hold up, have the program designed to fail. I think you are referring to one part of the bill that I find fascinating, and that is here as demonstrated on this graph. 
   It turns out that for the first 5 years of this program in the bill the majority has put together, the Democrats' bill, they provide the funding for the program, for this new expanded SCHIP program. But we fund our bills over 10 years. It turns out that because of their rules on budgeting that they have to cut off funding, and in year 5, actually 6 months into year 5, 80 percent of the funding for the entire program goes away. It is kind of like Lucy and the football. They say, Well, we will fund it for 5 years, and then we are going to take 80 percent of the funding away in year 5, and that way we will trick people and make it appear that we have the money to fund the program. 
   But that is not even quite as fascinating as one of the points I really want to bring out tonight in this debate, and that is, one of the funding mechanisms of the bill is a 61 cent per-pack increase in the cigarette tax. Now, you might say, Look, smoking is bad for people. Smoking is a habit we should discourage. So I am all for increasing the tax on cigarettes. I wouldn't have an argument with that. 
   But here is the problem, and this is where we go to terms like ``income disregard'' and, actually, not honestly confronting the funding of the bill. It turns out that for this 61 cent income, or cigarette tax, to be sufficient to fund the bill, more people than currently smoke would have to take up the habit. As a matter of fact, the official estimates are that to pay for the bill with a cigarette tax increase that is in it, a staggering 22 million Americans will need to take up smoking. 
   Now, I thought, how can a graph demonstrate 22 additional million Americans starting smoking? So I had my staff get 22 cartons of cigarettes. Here they are. We have got all 22 stacked here. I would like to have them out there where you can see them. There are 22 cartons of cigarettes here. And each carton represents an additional 1 million nonsmokers in this country who, to fund this bill if you leave it funded with the Democrat 61 cent per-pack cigarette tax, will have to start smoking. 
   Now, maybe proponents of this bill think that having 1 million people for every one of these 22 cartons of cigarettes take up the habit and pay their tax is a good idea. I happen to not think it is a good idea. 
   Mr. Speaker, for anybody who just tuned in, I want to tell them where we are. We are discussing the proposed expansion of the SCHIP program, a program that many of us are concerned is a bill that we will be forced to vote for because of its title. It is supposed to be a health care bill that provides health care to poor uninsured children. And it turns out that it provides health care not to poor children but to middle- and upper-income children whose families are making 60 to $80,000 a year, in some instances more. It turns out to cover not just uninsured children, but 61 percent of the people originally covered already had insurance, and that would displace them, causing the cost of private insurance for the rest of us to go up. 
   It turns out it was supposed to be for children, and it is not actually for children. In some States, in Minnesota and Wisconsin, there are more adults covered than children and more money is spent on adults. 
   Then the final point I was just making, and I don't know, I hope the camera will get the cigarette cartons stacked in front of me, but one of the funding mechanisms in the bill is an increase in the cigarette tax. You might think that an increase in the cigarette tax is a good idea. But unfortunately it doesn't do the trick because the proposed increase in the cigarette tax of 62 cents a pack, it turns out, will only work, it will only provide enough money to pay for the program called for in the bill if an additional 22 million, staggering, 22 million Americans take up smoking and pay the tax. 
   So I thought to graphically illustrate that, I would get my staff to go out and acquire 22 cartons of cigarettes. Well, we couldn't afford the 22 cartons of cigarettes so we just got the outside of the cartons. But here they are stacked in front of me. You might say, Why are those cartons of cigarettes stacked in front of him? What's the big deal there? Doesn't he like cigarette taxes? That is not the issue. The issue is if each one of those cartons of cigarettes in front of me represents a million people in America who don't smoke today, a million Americans who don't smoke today, who, in order to fund this bill and have enough money coming in based on their cigarette tax, will have to start smoking in order to pay for the bill? Maybe somebody thinks that is good policy. Maybe somebody thinks we ought to be encouraging people to take up smoking and pay the 61 cent tax. I know my colleagues in Congress who are doctors probably don't think that is a great idea. 
   I do have my colleague from Georgia here, Mr. Westmoreland. I would be  happy to let him give his comments on the idea of 22 million new people starting smoking to pay for this bill that really isn't for uninsured poor children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Reclaiming my time, that is absolutely correct. One of the objections that those of us who think this is not a well-written piece of legislation, we support the policy. We are all in favor of taking care of poor children and ensuring that they have health care coverage. Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, I have introduced a bill every year for the last 10 to provide a refundable tax credit to those children. But one of the things that we object to is the program currently covers adults and in several States there are more adults on the program than children; and yet as the gentleman from Georgia pointed out, there are millions of children who are, in fact, poor and who are, in fact, eligible to participate in this program who aren't currently participating. 
   One of the amendments that we have suggested, but have never been allowed to offer on the floor because we have never been allowed to offer an amendment on the floor, would be an amendment that says, You can cover people at a higher level of poverty, you can go on up the income scale, after you have covered the poorest American children. The President has proposed that, as well.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time briefly, when we talk about 300 percent of the Federal poverty level or 400 percent of the Federal poverty level, the abuse of the program, can the gentleman tell us about how much money that means? 
   We say this program is not directed just at poor or even, I like to say, nearly poor children. Poor children are supposed to be taken care of by Medicare. This is supposed to be for the near-poor.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time for a moment, I think it is kind of sad to take a children's bill, a bill that says this is a health care bill for poor, uninsured children, and exploit it. I would be happy to have a debate about how more Americans can get help getting health insurance. As I said, I have had a refundable tax credit to do that. But to try to pass a bill based on its title, and like this reporter says, how can Republicans possibly vote against a bill called the State Children's Health Insurance Program? You can't possibly vote against that. 
   Well, fortunately, democracy allows us to get into an open debate and say wait a minute. If it really were a bill focused on poor or even near-poor children who are uninsured, we might have a program we could support. But it turns out it is not for the poor or the near-poor, it is not for the uninsured, because more than half already have insurance, and then you discover it's not even for children; it is for adults.

   Mr. SHADEGG. They don't want to talk about it; they just want to peel a few Members off. 
   I see that we have been joined by one of your colleagues from Georgia, a  medical doctor, Dr. Gingrey. 
   I have been railing against this bill, as you heard me a few moments ago. I have been saying that I find it stunning that the pay-for in this bill contemplates an additional 22 million people who are nonsmokers today needing to take up the smoking habit so they can pay the 61-cent per pack tax in order to have enough money to pay for the bill. 
   So I did this graphic. I created all these cartons. There are 22 cigarette cartons sitting in front of me, representing 22 million, a million for each carton, new Americans who don't smoke now who would have to take up the habit to pay for the bill. 
   I think that is a little deceitful. I certainly can't believe that the proponents of this bill would walk down here and say they think it is a great idea to have 22 nonsmokers in America start the habit. 
   But as a medical doctor, I would sure be interested in your opinion on that issue, or any other comments you have on some of the details on this bill that are important for the American people to know.

   Mr. SHADEGG. If the gentleman would yield back briefly, and I would like him to continue making that point, I have a hunch there are voters out there, people out there across America, people listening to this saying, no, it can't really be true. It couldn't really be true that the SCHIP covers people who are already insured. It couldn't really be true that the SCHIP program that is supposed to be for poor Americans covers kids in families that make $80,000 a year. It couldn't really be true that the Children's Health Care Program in many States covers more adults than children. Those things couldn't be true, but in fact they are. 
   This chart illustrates the point you were just referring to, and I thought it might be a good graphic for your remarks. This is the number of new smokers needed to provide tobacco tax revenues for the SCHIP bill. As the bill has been written and been voted here on the floor two times now, and as the President vetoed it, this chart shows that this many new Americans, this many new nonsmokers, going up to 22.4 million nonsmokers, to fund the bill by this revenue stream at least, will have to start smoking. 
   I just find so many aspects of this bill just stunning and unbelievable. But there is one; 22.4 million new smokers will need to take up the habit and pay the tax in order to have the revenues that the Democrats project will be needed for this new SCHIP bill.

   Mr. SHADEGG. I just want to emphasize some of the points that the gentleman made. I love the name the CHUMP Act. Again, I think it would be hard for Americans to believe that this program is as it is. For example, these cartons represent, each one of them, 22 cartons of cigarettes, 22 million new Americans that will need to start smoking to pay for the SCHIP bill. I guess you can call that a CHUMP Act, because I don't think 22 million Americans who don't smoke now are going to start. 
   If the gentleman will stay, I want him to explain that chart one more time. It shows the kid climbing up and then it shows the kid parachuting down. You call it the CHUMP Act. We call it here the cliff. 
   Maybe you can explain one more time for the voters back home what this cliff means in terms of the funding of the program, because I think it is important for people to understand that it appears the funding is there, but then in year 5, whoops, it disappears.

   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for participating in this debate. I am thrilled we have a democracy here where, while our colleagues may come to the floor and put up pictures of children and say those mean Republicans don't want to cover children, at least we can bring out some of the facts. We can bring out the fact that there is a funding cliff and that you would have to have 22 million nonsmokers take up the habit to pay for the bill. Unfortunately, we have not been able to offer amendments to correct those deficiencies in the bill. 
   But we do support health care for poor and near-poor children. I support it for uninsured children. I have introduced every year for the last 10 years a bill that would give a refundable tax credit to every poor American to go out and buy their own health insurance. The reason I like the idea of giving them the money to buy their own care is because they will buy a plan that meets their needs, not some bureaucrat's needs. They will buy a plan based on choice, not based on government rationing of their care. They will buy a plan that their family likes and a plan that they will have control of. And if they don't get the service they want, they can fire that plan and buy another. It would be portable, and they can take it with them. 
   Instead, we are talking about expanding a government-run program with, quite frankly, a lot of smoke and mirrors that, sadly, people will vote for just because of the name of the bill. Or maybe just because of the name of the bill and because the advocates of the bill can put up a picture of a child and say, Don't you want insurance for that child? 
   Well, I do want insurance for that child. I just don't want insurance for adults under a program that is supposed to be for children. I don't want insurance for already insured kids causing them to drop their insurance. 
   We are joined by Mr. Hensarling from Texas, and I know he has details and thoughts about this program and about how important it is that Americans understand the details of this, so it is not just are you for children or against children. It is a deeper discussion than that. I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. SHADEGG. I think the gentleman has made some strong points, and I would like to draw them out. 
   One of the ones that gets missed so often is we talk about this being a program for poor children. I noticed that the gentleman in his remarks made the point that it really isn't a program for poor children. We have a program for poor children, and that is called Medicaid. That is already in existence. That is one of the points that you made.

   Mr. SHADEGG. The gentleman's remarks remind me of something I think we already know, and that is certainly with legislation the adage that the devil is in the details is pretty important. I think a lot of our Democrat colleagues, a lot of the majority, think we will put up a picture of a child, we will call it the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and no one can vote against it. And you know what, if it were the State Children's Health Insurance Program for children of the working poor who are uninsured, I would be all for it. But when you get into the details, it ain't quite so.

   Mr. SHADEGG. I think that is an important note. We care about the structure of the bill. My main concern is patient choice. I believe creating government programs and forcing people into those programs is not the preferable way to care for people or to help them. I personally think we would be doing better to give people choice, give them in my case a refundable tax credit and let them buy a health care plan that suits their needs, not to be forced into a government-controlled, government-run bureaucratic, rationed-care program, but give them choice. 
   I was talking with one of the doctors in our conference earlier today, and he pointed out that the reimbursement rates under SCHIP, because it is a government program, are dramatically lower than under many private programs. So kids who do drop their private health insurance and go on a government-run SCHIP program will actually get worst care. 
   I know that the gentleman is an expert on budget and finance, and I think that chart demonstrates, and I don't know whether you want to call it hypocrisy or whether you want to call it trickery or whatever you want to call it, it is playing fast and loose with the budget facts on this bill. Maybe the gentleman would like to direct his remarks to that in light of the fact that the cigarette tax, and I have tried to make a big point out of this tonight, that the cigarette tax in the bill isn't enough to fund the bill. It is kind of a scam. It is kind of a scheme. 
   The cigarette tax in the bill would only fund the bill if 22 million new nonsmokers took up the habit and started smoking. So for a graphic, we got 22 cartons of cigarettes, each carton representing another million Americans who would have to start smoking. I thought it would be helpful if the gentleman addressed those issues as well.

   Mr. SHADEGG. We have this chart which makes the point that the gentleman just brought up. The burden of tobacco taxes falls largely on poor Americans. As a matter of fact, 28 percent of the people who smoke are considered poor. They make less than 100 percent of the poverty level. And 26 percent of the people who smoke are near-poor. They are in that 100 to 200 percent. And for the not-poor, that is only 18 percent of Americans. So this tobacco tax that is supposed to pay for the bill, but it is not enough money to pay for the bill unless millions of Americans, 22 million, take up smoking, post the burden of this legislation on the people who can least afford to pay it.

   Mr. SHADEGG. I think we're about to run out of time. I want to thank the gentleman very much for participating in this debate. 
   I think there are millions of Americans who don't quite understand and who perhaps learned a little more tonight about why the President would  veto this bill and why many of us would vote to sustain that bill, about our concern that it is called a program for the near-poor or the working-poor uninsured children, and it turns out it's not for the near-poor or working-poor uninsured children. 
   As we've demonstrated in this discussion tonight, it covers people who make up to $60,000 and in some cases $80,000 and more a year. It's not for the uninsured because the original study shows 61 percent of those who became eligible already had private insurance, and under the new bill, one out of every two who become eligible will have already had private insurance, and they'll drop that insurance. And when they do, the cost of the private insurance for everybody else, everyone else who has a child in that private insurance, will go up. 
   It turns out so it's not for the poor or the near-poor or the working poor. It's not for the uninsured, because we discover it makes millions, 2 million by the latest estimate, children who are already privately insured eligible to go on this program. Then you think, well, the children's health care bill has to be for children and you discover, shock of all shock, the children's health care program isn't for children; it's for adults. 
   I thank the gentleman. I think the 22 million new smokers is a stunning fact. I'm sorry we haven't been able to offer amendments on the floor. I'm glad this debate gives us a chance to explain to the American people what's going on, and that there's more to this bill than just the title, and it's important to pay attention to these details.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I think this is a very, very important debate. I understand the frustration of the majority in trying to deal with this issue, but I believe they have created a structure that even they themselves don't understand, and a structure that fundamentally turns the Constitution and the role of at least two branches of the government upside down. 
   We have the executive branch which is charged with defending the Nation against foreign enemies and we have the judicial branch which is charged with applying and interpreting the laws. But it is charged with judging disputes between American citizens, not with making decisions how about to gather foreign intelligence. 
   Now, how does this bill work? Number one, it says if the executive branch in carrying out its duty to protect the country from foreign enemies knows in advance that both people, both ends of a telephone communication or some other electronic communication, are in fact foreigners, no warrant is needed. 
   Well, if we could be mind readers and if we could hire mind readers as intelligence officers, that might be useful. But everyone in the intelligence community tells you that have targeted one person, and without the ability to read the mind of that person, you don't know who the other person they are calling is. 
   So as a matter of fact, you can never know, never ever know, no CIA agent, no judge, nobody can ever know that both people are foreigners. And so if the law says if you don't know that both are foreigners, you must get a warrant from a judge. 
   Now they have said we are going to be reasonable about it; it is going to be a basket warrant. But that then gives the duty of protecting the Nation to a judge, an unelected judge.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that this bill raises a fundamental question: Do we trust judges, unelected judges, to control foreign intelligence? Are we going to move that responsibility from the executive branch to judges? Or is that not their job? 
   As I explained earlier, this measure requires that a warrant be obtained every single time you are seeking to gather foreign intelligence. That means that we are asking Federal judges, who are unelected, to decide in 100 percent of the cases whether we can or cannot gather intelligence. 
   Now, I respect judges. I admire judges. But judges have the duty of deciding disputes between Americans. They do not have the responsibility to protect our Nation. But this bill says you can never gather intelligence from a foreigner without first going and getting a warrant. 
   So a job that under our Constitution has been given to the executive branch, that is, to conduct foreign intelligence and protect the Nation, we are now taking from the executive branch and giving to judges. Because unelected Federal judges, who have no responsibility to protect our Nation, no responsibility to gather foreign intelligence, now get to decide, this has never been true in the history of our Nation, whether or not the Federal Government will gather any intelligence. 
   I respect judges. I am all for judges. If I am in a dispute over the civil rights of an American, I want a judge to decide. But when it comes to gathering intelligence about terrorists, we are going to take that authority away from the executive branch, which we have never done in the past, and give it to judges and judges only? Judges whom we cannot defeat in office, judges who are appointed, judges who do not stand for election, judges who cannot be voted out of office? We are going to take the authority away from the executive branch to protect our Nation and in 100 percent of cases give it to unelected judges. That is a mistake.

   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am stunned at this debate. All of our colleagues are watching. Yeah, we brought you a rule that says transparency was a good idea. We still believe transparency is a good idea, but that rule is being waived here. We are not being allowed to debate air-dropped earmarks dropped into this legislation. We are not being allowed to follow the rule. 
   Now, let's see if I understand this. It is okay for America if you adopt rules that require transparency, but it is also okay if you just waive the rules that require transparency, because after all, you said you were for transparency and adopted a rule for transparency and you just waived it. So there is no transparency. I believe it is vitally important that the American people know how their money is spent. I think they would want to know that we are spending millions of dollars in air-dropped earmarks for things that make no sense in the Defense bill, including golf training. I have yet to meet a soldier who didn't perhaps want to improve his golf game, but I have yet to meet a taxpayer who thought we ought to be funding that. You are either for transparency or not. I think it is simple and straightforward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank my friend and colleague from Texas. I want to compliment him for conducting this special order on earmarks tonight. It's an issue where the American people need to understand what is going on in the government that they elect. 
   I think most of them, if they harken back to their civics class in high school or grade school, would be stunned at what happens here and would find it, quite frankly, disgusting, because it is. It is a perversion of a system. 
   We use the term earmark, and we try to describe it. I am not certain that many people at home fully understand how the process works. To some degree, if you don't understand how the process works, you can't understand why some of us think it is so outrageous. 
   I want to get kind of down to some basics. Let me talk about the equity of the earmark process. Some of us think that we were each elected to come here to represent our congressional districts, and we were also elected in representing them to look at the good of the Nation. 
   Some of us don't believe that we were elected primarily to come to Washington and take as much money as humanly possible from the other taxpayers around the country and rip it out of their taxpayers' pockets and put it in our congressional districts. I don't remember being taught that in my civics book. Yet, the way the earmark system works in this Congress today, it is outrageously inequitable. 
   You might say, well, you know my congressman knows the needs of my district, so why shouldn't he get a couple of projects in your district. Every one of your congressmen who gets earmarks come back and say, look, I got you this bridge, or I got this business in our community, this money, and they say, aren't I great. 
   But, you know what they don't tell you? They don't tell you how much somebody else got. They don't tell you that the congressman three States over got 100 times as much money. They come and say, look, I got us $2 million for this project right in our town. But they don't tell you that the congressman from the State two States over was more powerful than your congressman, and he didn't get $2 million, he got $800 million. 
   So the taxpayers, you, the taxpayer and the congressman whose district brought home $2 million, you got fleeced to the tune of the $800 million that went to the powerful congressman, and that's how it works. Earmarks in this Congress today go to powerful Members. So if you are the chairman of a powerful committee, or you are in the right position to get it done, you get, literally hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe even billions of dollars for projects that you get to direct. 
   But, if you were a poor American taxpayer who lives in a district where you don't have a mega powerful congressman, well, your junior congressman, your fairly new congressman, your less-than-powerful congressman, he brings home next to nothing, but he brags about what he brought home. He just doesn't tell you that it was a fraction of what was taken out of their pockets to pay for somebody else.

   Mr. SHADEGG. I am glad the gentleman brought that up. I am going to go through a description that I think will help people understand what we mean by earmarks and by the kind of a simple earmark that you might think about, and then the more complex, the more subterfuge, the more hidden ones. 
   First of all, you have powerful Members of Congress get billions, not-so-powerful Members of Congress get next to nothing, but taxpayers pay for it all. The other fascinating process that goes on here with earmarks is the at-risk Members, that is a Member who is in a competitive district and might lose, and their political party wants to help them, oh, they bulldoze money to that Member's district. 
   But if you have some other congressman who is secure in her District or secure in his district, well, too bad. So you better hope that your congressman is an at-risk Member of Congress because then billions of dollars will be steered to your congressman's congressional district and to your community and to the business and the jobs in that community. 
   But if you have a secure congressman who gets 
   re-elected each year easily, and he is not powerful, you get a fraction amount of that money or you get zero, once again. Once again, money is coming out of your pocket and being distributed on a completely inequitable basis. It goes to the powerful Members of Congress, it goes to the at-risk Members of Congress to get them reelected. 
   Let's see if we understand this, my tax dollars go to fund my Federal Government, but they aren't distributed on the basis of merit to the good projects.  They aren't distributed on the basis of need, to people who are in need. They aren't distributed to the Nation's needs. They are distributed to some congressional district because that Member is powerful or to some other congressional district because that Member is at risk of losing his or her seat. 
   Now if you like your money being distributed on that kind of an unfair basis, then you are for earmarks. Let's talk about kind of an explanation of what earmarks are, as my colleague from Texas just mentioned. 
   You know, there is the kind of mundane earmark, the routine earmark. A Member of Congress gets asked to do a community project. I happen to like one, they have got a harbor in their district, that harbor needs to be dredged every few years and so they say, look, I just want to go get an earmark to get that dredged. It's asked for by the community, it's needed by the community, and it looks like a pretty innocent fair-minded earmark. 
   If they were all like that, we might not have any problem as long as they were allocated equally to all 435 districts in the country. Then no one would be taken advantage of. But, guess what, that's not what most earmarks are, at least that's not what many of them are. Many of them are an earmark that goes to a local college or a university or an earmark that goes to a private business. That's my favorite, earmarks that go to private businesses. 
   I am a congressman, I have a business in my district, and it is not quite making it, or it's a startup, so they come and see me and they say, hey, Congressman, we would like an earmark. Give us some taxpayer dollars because we can't survive in the marketplace. So I steer some money to that small business or that big business in my district. 
   You know what happens? This is just surprising. Do you know what happens? I would ask the gentleman to join me for a moment. Do you know what often happens? Do you know that often the executives of the company that get that earmark money, your Federal tax dollars, do they make donations to that congressman?

   Mr. SHADEGG. Taking back my time, I think it's stunning, but I don't like the words ``special interest,'' because that makes you think it might be some kind of a public interest, maybe it's for hungry children or maybe it's for needy families or maybe it's for dental care? No. This is for a private for-profit corporation, a huge business advantage for them and, interestingly, the executives of that corporation just suddenly decide that they like that congressman and send him contributions. 
   Well, that's pretty interesting, but what about the next level of corruption in earmarks, what about could it have ever happened that a Member of Congress creates a for-profit corporation or creates a nonprofit corporation himself and puts his friends and cronies on the board of directors of that nonprofit corporation or that for-profit corporation and then earmarks money to them? Shocked. Tell me it wouldn't be so. 
   We are taking earmark money, we are taking taxpayer money, hard-earned money by American citizens, taking it away from them and giving that money to an entity that we created that we incorporated, and we put all the Members on its board of directors and, shock of shock, they donate money back to our campaign or, in some instances, they might hire the congressman's wife or his daughter or his son or some other needy family member. 
   That's very appropriate. That ought to happen with our taxpayer dollars. That's what we expected when we sent our taxes to Washington that a congressman would take that money and donate it through an earmark, direct it, force it through an earmark, not debate it on the floor of this House, to go to a for-profit or a nonprofit corporation that a congressman created that employs his son or daughter that makes donations back to him. 
   We haven't even talked about the lobbyist who used to work for the congressman who then went to work for a lobbying firm that seeks earmarks who, by the way, shock of shocks, asked for the earmark, got the earmark, got paid by the for-profit business or the nonprofit business for getting the earmark, and then both executives of that for-profit or nonprofit corporation and the lobbyist, former staffer, donate to the Member of Congress. This is all above board, all wonderful, all that the American taxpayers ought to think happening with their dollars.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I think the gentlelady is correct. I think intellectually we could come to an agreement. 
   Sadly, the language of this bill is fatally flawed. Page 3, line 18, the language she refers to is not workable for reasons that I think both sides understand. It says that no warrant is required when you know that both persons are outside the United States. It is impossible to know that both the person placing the call and the person receiving the call are outside the United States. So section 3 grants no authority whatsoever. You might as well make it blank paper, because it does not give us any authority, even if well-intended.     
   Second, the bill, for the first time in the 200-year history of this Nation, says that when our executive branch wants to gather foreign-to-foreign intelligence, it must first go to the judiciary. That is a violation of the Constitution, and it places the duty for protecting American citizens in the hands of unelected judges. 
   In reality in this Nation, the duty to protect us from enemies foreign and domestic is in the hands of the executive branch. 
   This legislation is fatally flawed, even if well intended.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that this is one of those debates where you are sitting in your office and you are watching what has happened and you have no intention of coming down, and then you hear something said and you feel it is important to talk about that issue. That is how this strikes me, and I think it is important to set the record straight on some important points. 
   I don't think anybody on this side of the aisle challenges the importance of protecting the Speaker of the House and ensuring that she is secure. Indeed, that is a very important point to all people in the Nation. But that is not what this discussion is about. 
   I believe this discussion is about whether or not we are being asked to waste money, whether we are being asked, as has been articulated, to spend an extravagant amount of money, not to fly the Speaker and a few staff members, but to fly the Speaker and lots of staff members, plus family, plus other Members and who knows who. I think that is a legitimate issue to discuss here on the floor and an appropriate issue to discuss here on the floor. 
   One of the things that troubles me in this debate is that people say, well, we shouldn't be discussing this. I would like to invite my colleagues to think about the context in which this debate occurs. I would suggest that it is important to understand that when the  majority takes office and brings the first six bills to the floor under what is called a marshall law or some provision that says no amendments will be offered, and that is what happened here, you brought this under a rule or a provision that said we could offer no amendments to the minimum wage bill. Can't discuss it. Can't propose an alternate idea. 
   You then brought the 9/11 recommendations bill to the floor. No amendments. Not allowed. Can't discuss it. Can't offer your own ideas. At that point, in fact, you didn't even have a functioning Rules Committee.     
   You proceeded to bring many other important bills to the floor. The gentlewoman said that Republicans, in her view, didn't address the important issues, and yet your first six bills including minimum wage, stem cell, the 9/11 recommendations, student loans, energy, and Medicare prescription drugs, you bring to the floor, and you do not allow a single amendment by Republicans. And then you say, well, as soon as the 6 for '06 is over, we will allow amendments. We will go back to regular order. 
   But, in fact, that didn't turn out to be true. The seventh bill was the page board. Then the Pension Act, a very important bill that I thought was important for the Nation to pass, no amendments. Then the delegate bill. Finally, we get to bill nine, and you allow one amendment on that bill. 
   Then you come to the CR omnibus bill. On the CR omnibus bill that runs this government for the balance of the year and spends billions of dollars, how many amendments were the minority allowed? Absolutely none. And now you find it odd that we would want to engage in this debate right now. 
   As long as the rights of the minority are repressed by the majority so that we cannot do our job and represent the people of our district then you can expect this kind of exchange to occur on the floor. 
   And for my colleague from Texas who came to the floor and said he was disappointed in the level of debate, I would suggest that you look within yourself. If you repress debate, if you do not allow us to speak and address our issues, then we are going to use whatever tools we can. 
   I want to address another point that has been raised on the other side, and that is that the White House has said that it doesn't view this issue as all that significant or views it as ``silly.'' Well, with all due respect to the White House, I respect Tony Snow and the White House's position on the issue; but, quite frankly, Tony Snow does not hold an election certificate and Tony Snow doesn't represent the taxpayers of Arizona. He does not have a duty, as I do, to come to this floor and to discuss the consequences for our taxpayers. 
   It seems to me that next week we are going to debate an issue of great importance to this Nation.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that it is important to understand the context in which each of these debates occur. 
   I agree with my colleagues on other side of the aisle who would say that this debate is not the central debate in America today, whether or not we spend an excessive amount of money to accommodate one Member of the Congress who ought to be protected. That is not exactly the most momentous moment or issue before the Nation right now. 
   But next week we will debate the war in Iraq. Next week we will debate the confrontation of this Nation with global terrorism. Next week we will debate the jihadis and their desire to destroy America and the importance of that fight. 
   Now, here is my concern: you on the other side of the aisle are concerned that we are making a big deal out of this issue. I would like to know if somebody on the other side of the aisle will promise me that next week you will have an open rule on the Iraq debate so that we can have a full discussion of all of the issues, because I welcome that debate. But what I fear, what I fear deeply is that we will not have an open rule next week. We will not have a reasonable opportunity to debate all of the alternatives.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that in the Contract with America we offered to the minority 154 amendments. We had a functioning Rules Committee. Every bill in the Contract with America went through the standing committee process. Every bill went to the Rules Committee. The minority was entitled to bring amendments to, I think, all but two of those bills. This was our first effort. This was our first initiative to claim the attention of the American people. 
   We allowed the minority at that time to offer 154 amendments. And in that period, 48 of the minority's amendments were accepted. Now we have been here almost 1 1/2 months, and we are being allowed the ability to amend only those bills on which there is no controversy. 
   I agree with the minority: the Speaker of the House should be protected. I agree with the minority that whether she is protected or not is an important issue for this Congress. But I do not agree that the minority isn't entitled to debate the expenditure of public funds, as we are doing here. I do not agree that this is an issue where, if the White House says it is a silly issue, we are not supposed to raise it. If that is the rule in this House, then I think there are a lot of things the White House is saying that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are challenging. 
   And it seems to me that if you are unhappy with this debate, then you need to look at the context in which this debate occurs. And I would suggest to you that next week when we begin a debate on the war in Iraq and a debate on the war against the jihadis who threaten our lives in America, who threaten world security, I only hope, I dearly hope, that you will give us an open rule or a rule that allows each of the alternatives to be debated, because if you don't do that, if you continue to repress the rights of the minority, then you are going to have to expect this kind of debate by us whenever we can  raise it. It is our duty to our constituents. It is our obligation.

   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, we just heard how serious this bill is; and, indeed, I think it is serious and important. 
   Over a year ago, I introduced a similar bill, so did my colleague Mr. Kirk, and so did my colleague Mr. Terry. The majority leader has just told us that we ought to all vote for this bill because it is so important; but once again, we are here in a procedural abuse of mind-boggling consequences. 
   For my colleagues who have not been here, you need to know that in the last hour this bill has been amended by the majority. Indeed, in the last 24 hours, it has been amended not once but twice. It was introduced in one form. This morning they announced two different amendments to it, changing both its effective date and the crimes to which it applies, and your offices were all told when you arrived here today that it had a new effective date and had a new series of crimes to which it applies. But guess what, do not rely on your staff because this bill is so important the majority has amended it within the last few minutes. Now they have added a crime, but changed the effective date again. 
   This is not the way that serious Congresses legislate. If you believe this bill is important, don't ask these Members to vote on it with less than an hour's notice. If you would like to look at a copy of the bill, many of our Members on the majority asked for a copy moments before debate started, and they could not get a copy. Indeed, the amendments appear to have either been handwritten or typed within the last few minutes. 
   This is not the way to legislate. Procedure matters. We have not been allowed to see this bill go through committee and to be marked up. It did not go to Rules where we could offer amendments, where we could offer the effective date we think is right or the list of crimes that we believe is right. 
   No, the majority has decided that the minority does not matter. Well, let's talk about fundamental fairness. In the Contract with America, we allowed that side, when they were in the minority, to offer to our Contract bills 154 floor amendments. That is on top of taking all of those bills to committee, and 48 of those amendments passed. 
   This is a procedural outrage, and they ought to be ashamed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   It really is a sad day here in the United States Congress. This is an effort in pure politics. If this was an honest effort at compromise, how come nobody ever sat down with the President? How come nobody ever sat down with our leaders? 
   The gentleman just said that they tried to address the issues. Everybody here on the floor knows they didn't address the issues. 
   Adults remain covered under this legislation, though Republicans said adults shouldn't be covered in the child health care program. 
   And crowd-out, the issue of people losing their private health insurance, causing the private health insurance to go up in cost, was not addressed. The CBO, a nonpartisan body, says 2 million people will lose their private coverage by crowd-out under this legislation. 
   The sad thing is, this is pure politics, and it was demonstrated the day that the override attempt failed. Because, on that day, the Republicans had an opportunity to celebrate, having sustained the President's position. But we weren't proud of that moment or of that day because we'd like to deal with the Nation's problems. 
   You know who applauded on that day? Democrats applauded when the override failed. Why? For political gain, not because they care about insurance or kids or kids' health, but because they want political gain. That's sad; this is a sad day for this Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Madam Speaker, I listened to one of my colleagues just a moment ago say that this bill should be easy to reauthorize and should be done on a bipartisan basis, and, indeed, it should. But it is not because it has fallen victim to politics. It is victim to overreaching and political exploitation. 
   This is a program that is supposed to be about uninsured poor children. But the President vetoed it because the majority insisted on expanding it to already insured middle-class children and adults. 
   We can reform this program and keep it where it is supposed to be, and then we can move on to real health care reform. In his State of the Union address this year, the President proposed an idea to help every uninsured American, a proposal to end the outrageous discrimination by which those who have employer-based insurance get it with pretax dollars but the rest, who don't, have to pay more. 
   We can do better for all Americans. We can help all the uninsured. And when this veto is sustained today, as it should be, let's reauthorize this program, but then let's reform health care for all the uninsured.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I think this debate comes down simply to: Do you trust bureaucrats, or do you trust the forces of competition which have already delivered a drug benefit under budget? 
   To me, the answer is simple. But don't take my word for it. Last November, The Washington Post, not exactly a right wing newspaper, indeed one of most liberal newspapers in America, editorialized against precisely what this bill does. The Washington Post, not John Shadegg, said that the drug benefit in the current bill has turned out to be cheaper than projected. 
   The Washington Post, not John Shadegg, said that most beneficiaries are satisfied with the current program. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Dingell and others, over and over and over and over again in this debate have cited the veterans program and said it is much better because they negotiate drug prices. 
   But The Washington Post, not John Shadegg, said, and I quote, ``that is not a fair comparison.'' The Washington Post says that the Veterans Administration keeps prices down by maintaining a sparse network of pharmacies and a restricted formulary. Indeed, delivering three-fourths of its prescription drugs by mail. That's not John Shadegg; that's The Washington Post. 
   Indeed, the Post points out that more than one-third of the veterans in America eligible to sign up for the veterans program instead take the Medicare prescription drug program. Why? Because Americans don't want to say goodbye to their local pharmacy, which is what my colleagues on the other side will make them do. 
   If the program is so much better under the veterans, then why do a third of America's veterans prefer the current Medicare program? The answer for that is, it is a better program. 
   The Washington Post answers that by saying, in their words, the veterans' programs restricted choice of drugs and restricted list of pharmacies is less attractive. 
   Let me conclude the way the Post concluded. They said, ``A switch to government purchasing of Medicare drugs would choke off this experiment before it had a chance to play out and would usher in its own problems.'' I urge my colleagues to consider those problems. 
   They went on to say, ``For the moment, the Democrats would do better to invest their health care energy elsewhere.'' 
   I urge my colleagues who read The Washington Post regularly to follow its advice. This is a bad bill and bad for America's seniors.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time that has been yielded to me, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, I have the greatest respect for the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton). I honor him and respect him deeply. But this legislation is deeply and fatally flawed. It will damage America and American interests for two reasons: 
   First, it is a purely political document, hopelessly vague and meaningless. Let me explain why. The bill turns on two key terms. One, that the United States transition to a ``limited presence'' in Iraq within the next 120 days; and, two, that the President provide a justification of ``the minimum force levels required to protect the United States' national security interests in Iraq.'' 
   While I am pleased that the authors recognize that we are in Iraq to protect our national security interests, again, the legislation is hopelessly vague and therefore meaningless. Neither of these two key terms, ``limited presence'' and ``minimum force level required to protect U.S. national security interests'' is defined. Oh, the bill has a definition section and other terms are defined, but ``limited presence'' and ``minimum force level required to protect U.S. national security interests'' aren't defined. 
   You might ask yourself, why would the authors of the measure leave two such critically important terms undefined? Well, the answer is easy: Because this bill is not about policy; this bill is about politics. 
   The chairman of the Armed Services Committee knows exactly why these terms are not defined, and indeed the Democratic leadership knows why these terms are not defined. They are not defined because they need ambiguity. Indeed, ambiguity in this legislation is essential to its passage. They know that they can't agree on what the meanings of these terms are. You see, if they defined ``limited presence'' as too many troops, then their most liberal, most antiwar Members would not vote for the legislation. They couldn't. And, if they defined limited presence too low, then their Blue Dog Members would not support the bill. Again, this bill is about beating up on the President and about scaring nervous Members of Congress. 
   Again, let's look at the other term, ``minimum force levels required to protect U.S. national security interests.'' Why not define what that minimum is? Answer, again, if they define it too high, those who want out tonight and want our force levels at the lowest conceivable level couldn't vote for the bill. And if they define it too low, then those who recognize we face a threat from Iran and other regions' interests wouldn't vote for the bill. It is deeply flawed for those reasons. 
   And I would ask proponents of the bill what they would say if the President, as he could under the language of the bill, were to decide that ``limited presence'' means 154,000 troops, just 1,000 fewer than we have now? That would comply with the letter of the bill, but it wouldn't satisfy proponents of the bill. 
   And what if the President, as he can under the language of the bill, were to define the term ``minimum force level required to protect U.S. national interests'' not as 155,000 troops as we have today, but rather at 500,000 troops? 
   You see, they can't agree on those terms. I wonder how many of the Members realize that the critical terms in this bill aren't defined. 
   The bill is also flawed for a second reason, and that is that it reneges on the essential agreement Congress struck just 2 weeks ago. It is a little bit like Lucy pulling the football out from under Linus just before he kicks it. Here, don't rely on my opinion; rely instead on today's Washington Post. You see, today's Washington Post editorial makes the case for me. The Washington Post, not exactly a conservative journal, says, ``It seems like just weeks ago, because it was, that Congress approved funding for the war in Iraq and instructed General David H. Petraeus to report back on the war's progress in September.'' Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't September. 
   The Post goes on to write, ``Before Congress begins ordering withdrawals, it should at least give those generals the months they asked for to see whether their strategy can offer some hope.'' We owe it to those generals to give them, as The Washington Post says, the months they asked for, but, instead, we have given them 27 days. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHADEGG. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And just to follow up, I was going to actually begin my remarks tonight by noting the tremendous speech I thought that was given by my colleague Mr. McHugh, I believe it was the night before last, in the midst of this important debate. And I think this is an extremely important debate. Indeed, I think this is the most important debate in my 12 years in the United States Congress and I would assert the most important debate this Congress may, indeed, ever have. 
   But with regard to being unpatriotic, I want to make my position clear and I want to reference what Mr. McHugh said. 
   First, I respect every Member on the other side of the aisle, and I respect  their right to express their views. And, quite frankly, the other evening when I spoke in this debate, I said I respect and share their frustration, both at where we are in this war and how we got there. 
   But the gentleman pointed out that he hadn't heard anybody labeled unpatriotic. I think Mr. McHugh's comments were quite in tone with what I have heard in the portion of this debate that I have watched, and I have watched a lot. And he said, ``I have listened today with great interest, and I have enormous respect for Members on both sides of the aisle.'' I have that respect. I have the respect for the sincerity of my colleagues on both sides of this aisle. We have, however, an important disagreement which deserves to be aired. 
   I think there is an important question that needs to be asked. That question is, if we do not defeat radical jihadists in Iraq, the radical Islamists with whom we are at war there now, if we do not defeat them in Iraq, then where? And if we do not defeat them now, then when? 
   Let me first start by making a few points about the record and setting the record straight. My colleague from Texas pointed out a few moments ago that we are each entitled to our own opinion, but not to our own facts. I would suggest that there is a fact across this Nation, an accepted fact, which is flat untrue. And it was referred to in the debate here just a few moments ago. And that is the notion that Shia and Sunni have been at war with each other for hundreds of years and killing each other for hundreds of years. 
   Today, the bipartisan Antiterrorism Caucus met, and we heard from an expert from Brookings, and he said that is simply not true. The notion that we are in the midst of a civil war that has gone on for hundreds of years simply is not true. It is not a fact. 
   What is a fact is that we face an extraordinary enemy, an enemy that hates us, an enemy that has been taught a set of beliefs that requires them to kill us; that requires them to kill all Americans, all Westerners, all unbelievers; indeed, a radical jihadist sect that calls for them to kill many Muslims and to do so without excuse. To break all law in doing so. To ignore international law in doing so. 
   I would call my colleagues to read this book, ``Knowing the Enemy'' by Mary Habeck. I read it after she spoke to the bipartisan Antiterrorism Caucus. I want to read a few paragraphs out of this book because I believe it is important to understand: ``Jihadist ideologues use this generally accepted belief to argue that their interpretation of Islam is also intended for the entire world, which must be brought to recognize this fact peacefully if possible and through violence if not.'' 
   We have been told over and over and over and over again that these jihadists, the radical jihadists, hate us. In the debate earlier on this floor I asked my colleagues, I asked anyone on either side of the aisle, if you can name for me a single radical jihadi leader who has said that if America leaves Iraq, if America will pull back from Iraq, the war will end? I have asked that question on this floor at least twice, maybe three times, and nobody has taken it up. And the answer is because that is not what they want. 
   I listened to the debate here tonight and I respect it. As I said, I share the frustration over where we are in this war. But if you listen carefully to this debate, what you hear is: well, if we will stop, the war will end. I am afraid it is not that true. I am afraid it is not that easy. I am afraid it is not that simple. If we were to stop, the war would not end. 
   Listen to the words of al Qaeda, the words of Osama bin Laden, the words of Ayman al Zawahiri. Over and over and over again, they have told us that that would not be the end of the war. Indeed, it would not end their war against us. 
   Let me talk first about Ayman al Zawahiri. Here is his quote: ``It is jihad for the sake of God and will last until our religion prevails ..... The entire world is an open battlefield for us. We will attack everywhere until Islam reigns.'' 
   Osama bin Laden: ``The whole world is watching this war and the two adversaries; the Islamic Nation on the one hand and the United States and its allies on the other. It is either victory and glory or misery and humiliation.''     
   Ayman al-Zawahiri again: ``The jihad in Iraq requires several incremental goals; expel the Americans from Iraq, establish an Islamic authority or amarat, extend the jihad to secular countries neighboring Iraq, and then the clash with Israel.'' 
   And last, Osama bin Laden: ``Hostility toward America is a religious duty. We hope to be rewarded by God for it. I am confident that Muslims will be able to end the legend of the so-called superpower that is America.'' 
   There is no end to this war simply because we choose to stop fighting. It will not go away. 
   Let me refer again to Mary Habeck and ``Knowing the Enemy,'' which, Mr. Speaker, I hope you have read and all others who participate in this debate will read. 
   ``The three main jihadist ideologues make clear a central point of the ongoing war with falsehood: That it will continue until Islam has liberated the entire world from darkness, tyranny and servitude. Jihadists thus neither recognize national boundaries within the Islamic lands, nor do they believe that the coming Islamic state when it is created should have permanent borders with unbelievers. The recognition of such boundaries would end the expansion of Islam and stop offensive jihad, both of which are transgressions against the laws of God that command jihad to last until judgment day or until the entire Earth is under the rule of Islamic law.'' 
   It would be nice if we could ask this war to go away, but it won't. So I ask again, if you do not want to confront radical jihadists in Iraq, then where? And if not now, then when? 
   This war did not begin in 2003. It began not in 2001 with the attack on the World Trade Center. No. We have been at war with these radical jihadists for decades. In 1979, radical jihadists seized the American embassy in Tehran and held American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, radical jihadists attacked the Marine barracks in Beirut; 241 were murdered. In 1988, they brought down Pan Am Flight 103, known as the Lockerbie bombing; 270 were murdered. In 1993, Islamic terrorists attacked the World Trade Center for the first time; six were murdered. In 1996, they attacked the Khobar Towers. I have been to Khobar Towers before it was brought down. I saw where they killed 19 U.S. servicemen. 1998, al Qaeda attacked the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. They killed 212 in Tanzania and 11 were murdered in Kenya. In 2000, the Islamic terrorists attacked the USS Cole and 17 are murdered there. 2001, they attacked New York, Washington and Pennsylvania and they killed 3,000. 
   This war is the heart of the war on terror, and if we do not confront them now, then when? If we do not confront them in Iraq, then where? 
   There have been parallels to prior wars. I would suggest that this debate is similar, very similar, to the debate that led up to our involvement both in the World War I and World War II. Men of goodwill do like not to engage in war. It would be nice to have been able to believe that Hitler would go away, and well-meaning Americans argued that we should stay out of that war. But ultimately we couldn't, because ultimately the Japanese empire attacked us at Pearl Harbor and we recognized that we had to be involved in that war. 
   I would suggest to you that that is where we are now, and I would suggest to you that there is no such thing when you are at war as a nonbinding resolution, and there is no such thing as a resolution that does not do damage to the morale our troops. 
   Let me conclude, if I might, just by pointing out that this resolution may send a message to the White House, and I understand and sympathize with the desire to do that. But the more important message it will send is to our allies around the world that America cannot be trusted, that America cannot be relied upon, that America is an ally that will leave. 
   Osama bin Laden has said it over and over and over again: Attack them, fight them. Ultimately they will grow weak and they will back down.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHADEGG. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment by the gentleman from Virginia. I think it is important to focus on this debate. There is no challenge greater than this facing America right now. It is vitally important that we succeed in Iraq and allow that nation to establish a democracy. I hear on the other side that, well, we have amply funded this already. 
   We are imposing dramatic increases in spending in thousands of other areas, a 56 percent increase in HIV/AIDS funding alone. What message do we send i f we reduce spending in this area at this time? I would argue that whether you want out of Iraq tonight or whether you support the current course, it is vitally important that we send every message we possibly can to the Iraqi people and to our Nation that we are doing everything we can to support democracy.     
   That is wh at these funds are for. Of course, other funds have been spent, but these funds continue the effort to tell the Iraqi people we stand with them. These are funds for domestic purposes, for their security, for governance and for rule of law. I believe it is vitally important, indeed critically important for our Nation, that we fund this money now. I rise in strong support of the gentleman's amendment.

What I was suggesting is that there are many places where we are increasing spending even more dramatically than is suggested by the gentleman' s amendment here for what I believe is a vitally important purpose, which is democracy, rule of law and governance in Iraq.
