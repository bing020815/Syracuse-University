<DOCNO>Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. (HONORING BROOKGREEN GARDENS IN MURRELLS INLET, SOUTH CAROLINA -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday this House unanimously approved H. Con. Res. 186, which honors the 75th anniversary of Brookgreen Gardens, which is located in my district in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. I rise today to thank my colleagues for celebrating Brookgreen Gardens, which is one of the most beautiful places in coastal South Carolina. 
   In 1931, Archer and Anna Hyatt Huntington founded Brookgreen Gardens to preserve the native flora and fauna of coastal South Carolina and to display objects of art within that natural setting. Today, Brookgreen Gardens is a National Historic Landmark, and contains more than 550 works from American artists in what was the country's first public sculpture garden. Brookgreen Gardens also offers a natural exhibit center and a small zoo, which educates visitors on the unique species and issues of coastal South Carolina. 
   In conclusion, I would like to especially thank my colleagues from the South Carolina delegation that have shown bipartisan unity in cosponsoring this resolution, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the opening of Brookgreen Gardens.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. (MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF FORMER REPRESENTATIVE MENDEL DAVIS OF SOUTH CAROLINA -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. I certainly appreciate the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mendel Davis was a close friend of mine. He was born in and was a resident of North Charleston, South Carolina, which is part of my congressional district. 
   Mendel Davis entered Congress after a special election in 1971 to replace his godfather, former Representative Mendel Rivers. Mendel Davis was reelected to Congress an additional four more times. He was a graduate of the College of Charleston and received his law degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law. 
   Mendel Davis was one of the major reasons that the USS Yorktown now calls Patriot's Point in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina its home. 
   He was a champion for the little guy, and he was always known for his timely and efficient service to his constituents who loved and respected him. 
   I know we will all miss Mendel Davis very much. During his time serving the people in the House of Representatives, he made it a better place to be. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe 1 minute of silence in honor of our former colleague, Representative Mendel Davis.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. (HIRE A VETERAN WEEK -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, which will do so much to highlight the contributions made by so many veterans even after they have stopped wearing the uniform. 
   I want to especially call attention to the hard work of my colleague Mr. Holt. During the last Congress, I was proud to work with him on this resolution and am glad to see it come to the floor so early in this Congress. 
   Leadership, teamwork, integrity: these are all skills and qualities that employers today are looking for in order to compete in today's fast-paced and complex business environment. Thankfully, these are all attributes our Nation's veterans bring to the table. Their training in our Nation's military and experience working under pressure have provided them with skills and qualities that should put them at the top of any hiring list. 
   However, many veterans still find getting a job after they leave our military a challenge. Veterans may not understand how their military skills can translate into civilian life, and employers may not recognize the benefit of focusing on hiring veterans. This resolution highlights some of the ways we are trying to help both veterans and employers. 
   One tool out there is the Web site HireVetsFirst.gov, which is a comprehensive career Web site for hiring veterans of America's military. The Web site contains dedicated resources for matching employment opportunities with veterans. I urge Members to highlight this Web site as much as possible in the coming weeks. 
   In closing, Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Holt for introducing this resolution and thank Chairman Filner and Mr. Buyer for their work to bring it to the floor. It says a lot that we are considering such an important resolution so early in the 110th Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise to engage in a brief colloquy with the subcommittee chairman and ranking member regarding the Corps' regulatory program. 
   On June 19, 2006, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision regarding the scope of the Federal Government's jurisdictions over wetlands and other water bodies under the Clean  Water Act. Just last week, almost a year after the Rapanos decision was issued, the Army Corps and EPA issued joint field guidance interpreting the decision. 
   Because this guidance took almost a year to develop and issue, Corps districts around the country have thousands of backlog applications and projects seeking jurisdictional determinations and permits. Unfortunately, while the newly issued guidance sets targets for the Corps to complete and review applications, it did not review any plan for dealing with the current backlog. It also neglects to provide Congress and the American people with the work plan showing how Corps resources should be allocated to ensure that the application deadlines contained in the guidance of already existing statutes are met. 
   I thank you for the substantial increase in regulatory funding that is contained in this bill. These funds will go a long way towards ensuring that the Corps has the resources to meet the requirements as outlined in the June 5 guidance. 
   However, we need to ensure that the Corps focuses those resources where they are most needed, toward ending the backlog of over 20,000 outstanding applications and making certain it does not happen again. 
   I hope that you and the committee, Mr. Chairman, will recognize the importance of this issue and work in conference to include language requiring the Corps to show Congress that it is addressing the wetlands permit backlog and has the plan in place to meet the additional review requirements under the newly issued guidance.

   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, last night, nine brave firefighters from my district lost their lives in the line of duty. Responding to a fire in the West Ashley area of Charleston, these men made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our community in what was the single worst loss of firefighters since 9/11. This tragedy is a somber reminder of the dangers our first responders face on a daily basis as they serve to protect us and our property. We are forever grateful for their service and deeply sadden by their loss. 
   Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of these courageous men: Captain William ``Billy'' Hutchinson, Captain Mike Benke, Captain Louis Mulkey, Engineer Mark Kelsey, Engineer Bradford ``Brad'' Baity, Assistant Engineer Michael French, Firefighter James ``Earl'' Drayton, Firefighter Brandon Thompson and Firefighter Melven Champaign. 
   These men, who had over 100 years of service among them, gave their lives doing a job they loved. 
   I now yield to my good friend, Mr. Clyburn.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I would like to discuss a very serious battle our veterans are waging here at home, a battle against ALS, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
   Several independent and government studies have found that military veterans are at a greater risk of dying from Lou Gehrig's disease than those who have never served in the military. In fact, veterans are at a 60 percent greater risk to develop ALS. Lou Gehrig's disease is a horrific disease that robs a person of the ability to control their muscles. 
   Unfortunately, I have met firsthand and have knowledge of the true nature of ALS and its impact on veterans. I have watched the disease attack a good friend of mine, Tom Mikolajcik, a retired Air Force brigadier general. He was diagnosed with ALS in 2003. Since then I have seen the disease take a once-powerful man and rob him of nearly all of his physical abilities. 
   Mr. Chairman, only certain veterans with ALS who served in theatre during the 1991 Persian Gulf War are currently presumed to be eligible for service-connected benefits, and there are significant research needs related to the causes and treatment of ALS. As such, we must begin to take the steps necessary to not only discover why our veterans are at greater risk of ALS and to find treatments for the disease but also to help ensure that they have timely access to needed VA benefits. 
   I hope that you and the committee will work in conference and ensure the resources of the VA are directed towards meeting the research and benefit needs of all veterans who are diagnosed with ALS.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the argument that we have today is an argument that we have been discussing for a long, long time about our energy and energy independence. 
   We recognized, this past week, when the storm went through Houston, that we found another problem that we had. We were concerned about the price of gasoline. 
   Now we are concerned about the price, not the price, but the availability. What we need is more supply if we are going to compete in the world arena. 
   Some 70 percent of our energy today is coming from foreign sources. If you have been following the dialogue on the world market, Russia now controls most of the natural gas going to the European nations. 
   You notice from time to time there is a threat to cut that supply off. One day that's going to happen to America. With 70 percent of our energy coming from offshore from people that don't like us, we are going to have the same problem one day, a supply problem. Just like we had back with the oil embargo in the 1970s, the same situation is going to happen to us, even as we see some families now going to stations, and they say ``out of supply today.'' 
   The bill we are looking at today concerns me. I represent the coast of South Carolina, some of the prettiest beaches in all the world. We would love to say there are alternate ways to find our energy solutions, but we are willing, in South Carolina, to pay the price, just like in Louisiana, just like in Texas, just like some other places, California and other places, that are using their energy resources to help cultivate the economy of this great Nation.     
   We recognize if we don't do all of the above, we are going to find ourselves in a Third World situation. We need nuclear power. We need wind, we need solar power. But we also need gas and oil. Gas is one of the best fuels we can find. We can burn it in our automobiles and we can burn it in our power plants. It is a clean-burning fuel, and we have an unlimited reserve off the Outer Continental Shelf. We need to be able to access those resources.

   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the energy crisis that we are facing in America today is affecting every segment of our society, and my constituents in coastal South Carolina are getting more concerned every day that with what goes on that we do not have a solution to bring a more domestic supply of energy on line. 
   My constituency sees Russia holding Europe as an ``energy hostage,'' and they do not want to allow foreign and sometimes unfriendly nations to have the ability to hold the United States as an energy hostage in the future. 
   Right now, Russia supplies 50 percent of Europe's natural gas, and by the year 2020, Russia will supply 75 percent of Europe's natural gas. Right now America is 70 percent dependent on foreign energy. So much of American energy is being produced in prime hurricane zones that are susceptible to natural disasters every year. 
   Mr. Speaker, we should view our energy resources as a natural asset, not as an environmental liability. The energy crisis that we are currently in cannot be solved by having us being dependent on foreign and sometimes unfriendly nations. 
   We all must learn a valuable lesson from what's currently going on between Russia and Europe and seize this opportunity to vote on all-of-the-above.

   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Madam Chairman, the earmark I'm here to discuss and defend is for the South Carolina Aquarium located in my district in Charleston, South Carolina. 
   The South Carolina Aquarium is a nonprofit education and conservation organization that is truly part of the Charleston community. The aquarium is funded by a combination of tickets, concessions and souvenir sales and corporate, government and private funding. The aquarium has more than 80 paid staff, with a complement of more than 300 volunteers. 
   Funding from this earmark would go towards the development of user-friendly, interactive exhibits and displays, including touch tanks where children can interact with rays, horseshoe crabs, and many other native species from the waters of South Carolina. 
   Funding would also go towards funding a live feed connection so the children would be able to see into the inaccessible realms of the Hollings Marine Lab, and further development of the South Carolina Sustainable Seafood Initiative, which educates children on fisheries conservation. 
   Madam Chairman, funding for institutions such as the South Carolina Aquarium are worthwhile investments for the taxpayer. The reason is that with ``seed money'' organizations such as the South Carolina Aquarium are able to attract corporate donations which amount to much more than the original earmark and prove to be the foundations that our zoos and aquariums are built upon. 
   If my colleagues would like to research the criteria for projects under the Institution of Museum and Library Services account within this bill, the South Carolina Aquarium project is exactly why the Institute of Museum and Library Services account exists.  
   And I urge my colleagues, Madam Chairman, to vote ``no'' on the Flake amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge the passage of H.R. 2933, the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2007. 
   H.R. 2933 was introduced by my good friend and colleague Congressman Gary Miller and I have paid special attention to this bill as it as made its way through the legislative process of the Committee on Natural Resources of which I am a member. 
   H.R. 2933 is an important bill for the residents of coastal South Carolina and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
   The current Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program funds preservation and conservation efforts at many famous Civil War battlefields across the Nation. It is very important that we preserve these sites for future generations to observe and visit these sites that are so important to our Nation's history. 
   Some of the more famous locations in my district include, Fort Sumter, the target of the first shots of the Civil War as well as the assault on Morris Island's Battery Wagner, which is the battle which inspired the Academy Award winning movie Glory. 
   Other famous battles fought at Secessionville, Grimball's Landing, Simmon's Bluff and sites in and around the Charleston Harbor would also be eligible to receive funding for preservation and conservation. 
   Madam Speaker, reauthorization of the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program could not come at a better time. In just 3 years, America will commemorate the 150th anniversary of the beginning of the Civil War. 
   I know that in my district the planning has already started and many residents of coastal South Carolina are planning to observe this important date from where the first shots of the Civil War were fired. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill as swift passage of H.R. 2933 would help in the preparation, preservation and conservation of many of these hallowed sites in advance of this important anniversary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and this critical legislation. While today is, unfortunately, a day several years overdue, it should not diminish the importance of this legislation. 
   When I came to Congress in 2001, I was excited to be a part of the Water Resources Subcommittee as we began to work on the next Water Resources Development Act. Water is critical to my district, not just because of the projects it authorizes but also because of the important guidance it gives the Army Corps of Engineers. The reforms contained in this bill, which are the results of that process started in 2001, represents meaningful change that will ensure that our limited dollars are spent wisely. 
   Improving infrastructure is not a partisan issue. It is a commitment we as a Nation must ensure is met. If we do not, then we as a Nation will be facing significantly greater environmental and economic challenges than we do currently.  
   I cannot think of a group of individuals more committed to improving our Nation's infrastructure than my colleagues on the Transportation Committee. Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica have shown true leadership in guiding this legislation forward, especially as we worked to merge our bill with the one passed by the Senate. 
   Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Baker have stepped up to their new positions this year with true energy and passion about the issue before our subcommittee. And a special word of thanks must go to my friends, Don Young, Jerry Costello and Jimmy Duncan, who led the fight for this bill the past few Congresses. So much of this bill is because of their work and leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to close by urging all of my colleagues to support this rule and this critical legislation so we can get the Corps to work. To those who complain about the cost of this legislature, let me remind you that this one bill is doing the work of three WRDA bills. 
   If you missed a payment on your house, would the bank allow you to pay only the next month's payment, forgetting the payment you missed? Would the bank allow you to do the same thing if you missed two monthly payments? Of course not. You would have to make your catch-up payment, plus make the payments for the current month. That is what this legislation represents, a catch-up of two bills that went uncompleted, while also addressing our current needs. 
   For the good of our Nation's economy and environment, I urge my colleagues to support this overdue catch-up and pass this rule and the WRDA Conference report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as President Bush and his top military advisers implement the new plan for victory in Iraq, we must be united in a common goal for victory, and we should never forget that our enemy is listening to this debate, just as our troops are listening to every word of every Member of this Congress. 
   As many of my colleagues have done, I have personally visited Iraq. I have seen the progress and I have seen the good job that our brave men and women are doing for us and for the people of Iraq. 
   We have achieved some major accomplishments in Iraq. Women are now able to vote in real elections for the first time in their lives. Iraqi citizens are now able to protest and let their opinions be heard in public, and Iraq is a self-governing nation, free of tyranny. 
   I was proud to sit down and share a meal with many soldiers from South Carolina's First District. And the question many of our soldiers kept asking me was, why are none of the good stories making it back to the folks at home? 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that many of us today are trying to share some of the good stories and recognize some of the positive things that our brave men and women in Iraq are doing for us. 
   South Carolina's First District has a high proportion of active and retired military personnel and are directly impacted by the war in the Middle East. At the Charleston Air Force Base, the C-17 aircraft that come and go are a direct link in the supply chain that assist our brave soldiers fighting for us in Iraq. 
   At Force Protection in Ladson, South Carolina, they continue to build the Buffalo and the Cougar vehicles that save the lives of our soldiers against the mines and IED attacks every day. 
   Last year on Memorial Day, in my capacity as chairman of the Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health, I was fortunate enough to be the guest speaker at an American cemetery in Normandy, France, which overlooks Omaha Beach. 
   Our brave soldiers during World War II were in France not to fight the French, but to fight the occupying Nazis. Today our soldiers are not in Iraq and Afghanistan to fight the citizens of those countries, but are there to fight the insurgents in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
   In listening to the debate over the past few days, it reminded me of my visit and reading some of the names of the brave soldiers that fought our Nation's war during World War II. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are over 9,300 buried in Normandy. Those brave souls fought in a war against the forces of evil then, just as our soldiers in Iraq are fighting against the forces of evil today. 
   What would have happened if Franklin Delano Roosevelt pulled our troops out of France after the casualties we took storming the beaches of Normandy? If Franklin Delano Roosevelt was alive today, what would he think of this debate which empowers and energizes our enemies and demoralizes our brave fighting men and women? What would America have done if the Congress enacted a nonbinding resolution to pull our troops out of France after D-Day? What kind of world would we be living in today? 
   Iraq is directly tied to the future security of our Nation, and consequently, failure in Iraq is not an option. 
   I do not believe we have already lost in Iraq, but we will lose if we don't give the troops what they need to win. I remain hopeful that the Democrats and Republicans can unite around a new policy, clearly defining our troops' mission for the sake of our national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support President Bush and his vision for the new strategy for victory in Iraq. I cannot in good faith support this resolution because it sends our soldiers the message that the United States Congress believes that they cannot succeed in their mission. It is much easier to complain, while offering no real ideas or alternatives. This resolution is all bark and no bite. 
   I will conclude with a quote from a good friend and someone I am proud to have as my constituent, Medal of Honor recipient and retired Major General James Livingston. ``Today we have a choice of fighting the enemy in Iraq. If we do not take them on in Iraq, then we will be forced to fight the enemy here on our homeland.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this resolution.

   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. I thank my good friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 5540, the Chesapeake Bay Watertrails Network bill. 
   While I understand the value of the bill we're discussing today and I commend my colleague, Congressman Rob Wittman from Virginia, for the hard work he has done on this bill, his efforts will be all for nothing if we do not address the energy crises we're facing in the United States today. 
   In my district of coastal South Carolina, my constituents are dealing with the same problems as those who live and work along the Chesapeake Bay. Just as the watermen of the Chesapeake Bay cannot afford to bring their boats out of the dock to catch blue crab due to the all-time-record-high diesel prices, my constituents in our fishing communities cannot bring their shrimp boats on the water to catch shrimp due to the high cost of diesel fuel. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is irresponsible for our Democrat colleagues to continue obstructing responsible energy legislation that will help our energy crisis from being considered on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, we currently depend on foreign--and in many cases unfriendly--nations for over 60 percent of our Nation's energy needs. This is a serious national security concern for my constituents in coastal South Carolina. 
   On behalf of all the recreational and commercial fishermen, the shrimpers, the tour boat operators, and the recreational boaters in coastal South Carolina, I would like to ask the Democrat majority why we are not voting today on the many pieces of legislation that have been introduced that would open up domestic sources of energy and help them get back on the water immediately?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend Joe Wilson for yielding me this time and for those great remarks of Mr. Pascrell. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H. Con. Resolution 68, which is a resolution honoring the life of Gian Carlo Menotti, who was the founder of the Spoleto Festival USA that happens every year in Charleston, South Carolina. 
   Mr. Speaker, on February 1, 2007, Gian Carlo Menotti passed away. He was a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and champion of the arts in the United States and in Italy. 
   In 1958 he founded the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, as a forum for young artists in Europe. In 1977 he decided to plan a companion American festival, and they searched for an American city that would offer the charm of Spoleto, Italy. 
   Mr. Menotti and the Spoleto Festival organizers decided that Charleston, South Carolina, was the perfect counterpart to Spoleto, Italy. Charleston is small enough to be dominated by nonstop arts events during the 17-day festival but also large and sophisticated enough to provide a knowledgeable audience and appropriate theaters. 
   Organizers also observed that Charleston, South Carolina, has an extensive history of involvement with the arts from housing America's first theater and ballet companies to housing the oldest musical organization in the country. 
   The Spoleto Festival quickly became a haven for a large group of artists, both traditional and experimental, who found the mix of dance, theater, opera, music, and the visual arts. 
   The Spoleto Festival USA has maintained traditions of the Festival of Two Worlds, such as a dedication to young artists and an enthusiasm for providing unusual performance opportunities to recognized masters in their fields and a commitment to all forums of the performing arts, including classical ballet, modern and post-modern dance, opera, chamber, symphonic, and choral music, jazz, theater, and visual arts. 
   Spoleto Festival USA currently claims an audience of over 75,000 attendees each year, and the festival continues its dedication to providing performance opportunities to young artists from across the United States and Italy. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 68 has been endorsed by the National Italian American Foundation and is cosponsored by the entire South Carolina delegation, including my friend and colleague who also represents part of Charleston, South Carolina, the majority whip, Jim Clyburn. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 68 in honor of the father of Spoleto Festival USA, Gian Carlo Menotti.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. I thank my great friend from Texas (Mr. Sessions) for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today in strong support of H.R. 6003, the bipartisan Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. 
   I want to applaud Subcommittee Chairwoman Brown and Ranking Member Shuster, along with Full Committee Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica, for crafting a bipartisan reauthorization package that is focused on both improving Amtrak's capital assets, while also providing for development of new corridors in partnerships with States. 
   I am most pleased to see a major commitment to high speed rail contained in this bill, something that is absent in the Senate's bill. This legislation calls for more than just paper plans for high speed rail projects; it actually calls for dedicated funding and private sector involvement to move these projects forward. 
   Specifically, I am pleased that this legislation contains a provision that will improve the ability of future high speed rail corridors in the Southeast to best meet the changing population patterns and tourist demands along the cost. 
   With America facing $4 gas and airlines seeing fuel costs 100 percent higher than last year, we must look to develop in ways that will ensure that new travel options such as high speed rail are directed where they are most needed. 
   High speed rail can play an important role in reducing congestion in places like the Grand Strand in my State, which sees 14 million tourists a year, and Charleston, which is the most congested small city in the country. And I am glad that this bill takes the next step towards addressing the transportation needs of these communities. 
   Another important element of this bill moves us towards planning for rail transportation the same way we plan for highways. Again, as we face historically high gasoline and diesel fuel costs, we must ensure that our transportation system is planned out to provide the connectivity that we need for increased passenger rail use and to take advantage of freight rail's ability to move a ton of freight 436 miles on a gallon of fuel. When combined with the investment this bill makes in high speed rail, and by allowing freight and passenger railroads to negotiate access to freight-owned tracks, the Committee's reauthorization proposal will go a long way towards an improved rail system in the future. 
   But that future may not be possible, Madam Speaker, if America continues  to face $4 gasoline at the pump. I urge the majority to bring to the floor one of the many pieces of legislation introduced to open up domestic sources of energy, or else we won't be able to catch even an on-time train.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 3891, a bill I introduced with Fisheries, Oceans and Wildlife Subcommittee Chairwoman Madeleine Bordallo. The fundamental purpose of this legislation is to increase from 25 to 30 the number of members who may serve on the Board of Directors of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. 
   The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was created by Congress in 1984. Since that time, it has financed more than 9,500 conservation projects throughout the United States and in other countries. By using a partnership and challenge grant approach, the Foundation has provided $1.3 billion in critical funding to accomplish its strategic goals of sustaining, restoring and enhancing fish, wildlife and plant populations and their essential habitat. 
   Under current law, the Secretary of the Interior may appoint up to 25 individuals to serve on the Foundation's Board of Directors. The members of this Board have expertise in fish, wildlife and natural resource conservation; they serve as conservation Ambassadors throughout the world; they review and approve projects submitted to the Foundation and they raise funds for the operation of this highly successful organization. 
   By increasing the size of the Board, we will greatly enhance the Foundation's ability to finance additional meritorious projects in the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yea'' on H.R. 3891.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. (RECOGNIZING 200 YEARS OF RESEARCH, SERVICE, AND STEWARDSHIP BY NOAA AND ITS PREDECESSOR AGENCIES -- (House of Representatives - December 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. I appreciate the gentlewoman from Washington for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 147. I am pleased we are considering this measure today on the House floor. I would like to thank my friend and the chairwoman of the Fisheries, Ocean and Wildlife Subcommittee, Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo, for her hard work on cosponsorship of this resolution. 
   And what a real pleasure it is to work along with you as your ranking member. 
   And I would also like to thank Chairman Nick Rahall and Ranking Member Don Young of the Natural Resources Committee as well as my colleagues on the House Science Committee for their support of this resolution. 
   House Concurrent Resolution 147 recognizes NOAA and its predecessor agencies for 200 years of research and service to the people of the United  States and its stewardship of the marine environment. 
   It was the foresight of the third President, Thomas Jefferson, that started us down this path of surveying our coastal areas for the benefit of the Nation and laid the blueprint for what we now all know as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
   My district is home to several outstanding NOAA facilities including the Hollings Marine Laboratory and the Coastal Services Center, both of which are located in Charleston. These facilities and their work are an important part of the coastal South Carolina community. 
   NOAA has shown its dedication to our Nation's ocean and coastal resources. NOAA's management and conservation actions have allowed all of us to continue to enjoy our Nation's oceans and coastal resources. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important resolution, and I congratulate NOAA for their 200 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. (ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I spoke at a rally highlighting how America's energy crisis is impacting the working men and women in our Nation. The average working person in my district works at a hotel or a restaurant meeting the needs of the tourism industry. 
   That average person also drives to work. There is no light rail or subways taking them from rural homes to their place of work near the coast. The folks they serve probably drove hundreds of miles with their families for a well-deserved vacation, but few families are coming to the beach this year because of high gasoline prices. It also means that few folks will be working at the hotels and restaurants. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrat-led House's lack of action on energy policy is affecting every segment of our society, so much so that I am receiving drill bits in the mail demanding that we take action to lower energy prices in America. Those drill bits aren't coming as part of some well-financed campaign; they're coming because we can no longer hope that the problem will go away. 
   Like many other countries, the United States is blessed with many types of natural resources. I agree with the vast majority of Americans by viewing our natural resources as one of our greatest assets, not as an environmental liability. 
   We must take action now and vote on legislation immediately that would allow for more domestic energy to be produced by Americans for Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this critical legislation. I want to thank so many on this committee for their hard work and long dedication to this legislation, especially our chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and our ranking member, Mr. Mica; and the subcommittee chairwoman, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Mr. Baker, the ranking member. I also thank Mr. Duncan, the former chairman, and Mr. Costello, who is the ranking member. 
   We have been working on this bill now for my term in Congress, and this is my fourth term, and I am happy today we are here to present it again. 
   One of the most important elements in this bill are reforms made to the processes and procedures of the Army Corps. The infrastructure needs of our Nation have never been at a higher level. We need to do all we can to ensure that the limited dollars available are spent wisely, and the reforms in this bill will give the Corps the tools to make that happen. 
   In addition, the bill makes significant changes to the project delivery process used by the Army Corps. The process the Corps has to go through now to deliver a project are long and hard, to say the least. This bill makes commonsense change to streamline that process to help our communities. 
   Improving infrastructure is not a partisan issue, it is a commitment we as a Nation must ensure is met. If we do not, then we as a Nation will be facing significantly greater environmental and economic challenges than we do currently. 
   In closing, I want to say again that I strongly support this legislation and I am confident we will enact a bill this year. I also want to thank my friends and colleagues on the committee as we all have joined to invest so much effort into this particular legislation. 
   I am proud to stand with you in support of its passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. (BRIGADIER GENERAL FRANCIS MARION MEMORIAL ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. I certainly thank my good friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 497 is an important bill for my constituents in South Carolina's First Congressional District. I thank my colleague and friend Congressman Joe Wilson for introducing this important piece of legislation. 
   General Francis Marion is an important part of the history of South Carolina, and the national forest bearing his name is located within my congressional district. 
   Francis Marion commanded the only Revolutionary force in South Carolina and was instrumental in delaying the advance of British forces by leading his troops in disrupting supply lines. General Marion's tactics, which were unheard of in rules of war at this time, commanded lightning raids on British convoys, and then he and his forces would retreat into the swamps to avoid capture. 
   British General Tarleton stated that ``as for this damned old swamp fox, the devil himself could not catch him.'' Thus, the legend of the Swamp Fox was born. His victory at the Battle of Eutaw Springs in September of 1781 was officially recognized by Congress. 
   H.R. 497 seeks to authorize the Marion Park Project and the committee of the Palmetto Conservation Foundation to establish a statue of General Francis Marion on Federal lands in D.C. in Marion Park at no Federal Government expense. 
   I was proud to work with Natural Resources Chairman NICK RAHALL and Ranking Republican DON YOUNG to assist in the passage of this bill for my constituents of South Carolina's First Congressional District and for all of South Carolina, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 497.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. (PROVIDING FOR AGREEMENT BY HOUSE WITH AMENDMENT TO SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2095, RAIL SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this historic and forward looking legislation. Freight and passenger rail play an incredibly important role in our Nation's transportation system and our economy. The legislation before us will serve to strengthen that important contribution, and I was proud to have worked on it with Chairman OBERSTAR, Ranking Member MICA, Chairwoman BROWN, Ranking Member SHUSTER, and all the members of the Transportation Committee. 
   Today's legislation will foster introduction of new intelligent transportation systems technologies at highway-rail grade crossings. New technologies being researched now will one day provide the ability to use an in-vehicle warning of danger at highway-rail crossings and, perhaps, even provide the means to intervene before a collision occurs. H.R. 2095 will speed up the development and deployment of these technologies by allowing innovative partnerships between the private sector, State DOTs and the Federal Government. 
   Even more important, this legislation contains a new commitment to high-speed rail for our country. High-speed rail can play an important role in reducing congestion in places like the Grand Strand, which sees 14 million tourists a year and Charleston, which is the most congested small city in the country. By engaging the private sector along with public partners, H.R. 2095 calls for more than just paper plans for high-speed rail projects--it calls for action. 
   Our constituents are paying record high prices for gasoline and spending $78 billion a year due to highway congestion. The time is now to make progress on high speed rail for our country, and this bill will do just that. H.R. 2095 sets the foundation for a privately-funded high speed rail line along the eastern seaboard connecting the population centers of the north to the tourism centers of the South, including Charleston and Myrtle Beach in my district. This is not only a sound business decision, it is a sound public policy decision that will benefit our nation. 
   Madam Speaker, I will proudly be voting ``yes'' on H.R. 2095, and I ask all my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. (MEDAL OF HONOR SPECIAL PENSION INCREASE -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6980, a bill to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase the amount of the Medal of Honor special pension provided under that title by up to $1,000. 
   I especially want to thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for working with me on this legislation, and to thank Chairman Michaud for joining me in introducing the original version of this legislation, H.R. 1137. 
   Madam Speaker, the Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States of America. It is awarded ``for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, in actual combat against an armed enemy force.'' 
   Since its initial presentation in 1863 to Private Jacob Parrott, 3,448 Americans have been awarded the Medal of Honor. Today's legislation is important, but I want to spend most of my time talking about the heroes who have received this honor. 
   Today there are 100 living recipients of the Medal of Honor. The average age of a living recipient is 74 years of age, and 47 percent of recipients earned their medals more than 50 years ago while serving in World War II and in Korea. The oldest living recipient, John W. Finn, is 99 years old. He received his medal for manning a 50-caliber gun in an exposed position, while wounded, during much of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In addition to Mr. Finn, 34 other recipients are veterans from World War II. 
   Sixty living recipients of the Medal of Honor earned their medals while serving in Vietnam, including a good friend of mine from my congressional district, General James Livingston. Another recipient of the Medal of Honor, Frank Curry, also lives in my district and is a veteran of World War II. The Congressional Medal of Honor Museum, located on the hangar deck of the USS Yorktown in Charleston, South Carolina, serves as both a memorial to the heroic acts of the Medal of Honor recipients and a way to educate the public on their extraordinary service to their country. 
   The most recent Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously on June 5, 2008, to Private First Class Ross A. McGinnis, a member of the U.S. Army recognized for his service in Iraq. On December 4, 2006, Mr. McGinnis' platoon was on patrol when an insurgent threw a grenade into his HUMVEE. Although Private McGinnis could have escaped, he threw himself on top of the grenade, pinning it between himself and the radio mount and saving his fellow soldiers in the HUMVEE. Private McGinnis is the fourth Medal of Honor recipient from Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Navy SEAL Master-at-Arms Michael A. Monsoor and Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy, as well as Marine Corporal  Jason L. Dunham, were all posthumous recipients of the Medal of Honor for their incredible bravery in service to our country and their fellow men in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   In recognition of their exceptional service, Medal of Honor recipients are entitled to a special pension, as first authorized by Congress in 1916. Currently, the 100 living recipients received an inflation-adjusted $1,000 per month. H.R. 6980 will increase the base payment to $2,000 per month, subject to appropriations. This benefit will act as the smallest token of appreciation to people who have shown the greatest possible devotion to their fellow soldiers and to their country. 
   Madam Speaker, this legislation would not have come to the floor today without the support of my good friends, Chairman Filner, Ranking Member Buyer and Chairman Michaud. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. (HONORING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROOKGREEN GARDENS IN MURRELLS INLET, SOUTH CAROLINA -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 186 which honors the 75th anniversary of Brookgreen Gardens, one of the most beautiful places in coastal South Carolina. 
   In 1931, Archer and Anna Hyatt Huntington founded Brookgreen Gardens to preserve the native flora and fauna of coastal South Carolina and to display objects of art within that natural setting. Today, Brookgreen Gardens is a National Historic Landmark and contains more than 550 works from American artists in what was the country's first public sculpture garden. 
   Brookgreen Gardens also offers a nature and historical preserve; it also includes a small zoo that is accredited by American Zoo and Aquarium Association, and a nature exhibition center. The natural exhibition center and zoo exhibit educate visitors on the unique species and issues of coastal South Carolina. 
   In conclusion, I would like to thank the rest of my colleagues from the South Carolina delegation. They have shown unity in celebrating the 75th anniversary of Brookgreen Gardens by unanimously agreeing to be cosponsors of this resolution. 
   To honor the 1932 opening of Brookgreen Gardens to the public, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
