<DOCNO>Mr. BILBRAY. (EMPLOYEE VERIFICATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, 99 percent plus efficiency. Where else in the Federal Government can we claim that we have a program that is over 99 percent effective, efficient, and gets the job done? 
   I am here to support this bill; and, sadly, I am here to support it at a 5-year extension rather than the 10-year originally proposed. And my big question is, those that did not want to extend it to 10 years, what don't you understand about 99.6 percent efficiency for the American citizens in the United States? Is it too efficient and that is why we are not today extending it 10 years? That is a question I think that every Member of Congress is going to have to answer to their constituency in the very near future. 
   Mr. Speaker, the employee verification system is not a pilot program anymore. For over 5 years, it has been a national program not restricted to the five original States but universal throughout the United States. It has been so effective that judiciaries across this country, judges, have required that anyone caught hiring illegal has been required to use this system to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
   The system is so effective that the executive branch and the legislative branch has made this the gold standard for hiring employees. Congress today does and has been required to make sure that Social Security numbers and names match before we hire them. The executive branch had asked for Congress themselves to do that. You haven't heard the horror stories and the end of the world because 99.6 percent is a number hard to argue with. The executive branch was confronted by this number, and now has mandated that any contractor and every government operation will use this system from now on. The question, Mr. Speaker, is why are we just maintaining the status quo for 5 more years? 
   Two years ago, the American voters were very upset with the fact that the then Republican majority refused to confront the issue that the number one source of illegal immigration was illegal employment, and that there was a simple, easy way to stop the problem if there was a will in Washington to get it done, and that system was E-Verification. 
   Today, we are confronted with a 5-year extension of what we have had for over 5 years rather than moving forward with a system that can address the number one source of illegal immigration, a simple system that can not only stop illegal immigration but stop a lot of problems related to that. 
   The SAVE Act was introduced by a Democrat named HEATH SHULER from the great State of North Carolina. It was supported by over 156 Members of the House of Representatives. It has actually received a discharge petition that is within less than 30 people to sign it to be able to bring it to a vote. That would make it a universal phase-in system to allow every employer and require every employer to not only use E-Verification before hiring somebody, but using E-Verification before--are you ready for this?--claiming a tax deduction for employing somebody who may be illegal.     
   I wish that Democrats and Republicans could have got together on that bill the way we did with this one. But sadly, the leadership of the Democratic Party in this House and Speaker Pelosi has blocked any legislation of substantive numbers that does not include an amnesty for the 20 million people illegally present. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are those who talk about compassion about those who are illegally here. Well, let me give you another number. Three hundred-plus illegals are sitting in prison today because an employer in Iowa did not use the E-Verification system before hiring them. And if you don't care about illegal immigration, and you say you care about immigrants coming to this country illegally, and you want to be humanitarian, then require the people that are exploiting them to check through E-Verification as a mandate, not a voluntary, so that future illegals that come into this country are not put in prison because their employer didn't check that the name and the Social Security Number matched. 
   I wish this town would act on its verbiage and its promises half as much as they expect the American people to respond to the responsibilities of citizenship. 
   As Members of Congress, we are now placed at having to vote for a 5-year extension rather than a 10, and we are denied the ability by the Speaker of the House to vote on a bill that is bipartisan, and able to address this issue. And I would ask that the SAVE Act be brought forward as soon as possible so we can back up this voluntary program with a mandatory one that will take care of the problem.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Madam Speaker, I think everyone will agree, when it came to earmarks, the big concern  about the abuses of the past were two components: one is transparency or the lack of transparency in previous proceedings when it came to earmarks. The other was the issue of what is called air drops, those that could be in a conference and at the last minute add things into the budget without going through the review of the committee or subcommittee and a public review of that aspect. 
   I have to compliment both sides of the aisle when it comes to transparency. I think that both Republicans and Democrats are working together to make sure the public knows who has asked for earmarks to be included. But I ask that at the same time, and to say we are a little let down, I think the public is going to feel let down, because both sides, both Republicans and Democrats, have not addressed the air drop issue. In fact, let's face it, why put your earmark or your request through the review process of committee and subcommittee if you can get put on the conference committee at the last minute, and just before the votes are brought to the House floor add your item in without going through the review process? 
   So I would ask the majority and the minority to take a look at this aspect and not move this bill without having it specific that unless an item has been voted on in the House or the Senate before it got to conference, that it shouldn't be added in at the last minute. And I come from the 50th District of California, as you know, and we saw the crisis in credibility and government that was created by the Member that preceded me, and one of those crises was the fact that the game here was get on that conference committee so you could add your item in, in an air drop, at the last minute. 
   So I would ask the majority to go back and take a look at this item and bring back something that stops the abuse of air drops, the last-minute inclusion of earmarks that doesn't go through the review process, doesn't allow the public to know about it, and doesn't allow you and me as Members to be able to address this issue individually. 
   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the chance, and I ask you to reconsider that before we move this item.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Chairman, as a former member of the Clean Air Resources Board in California, as I think a lot of people in this town know, one of the premier air pollution agencies in the world, the one thing that we have got to send a message out there is ``do no harm.'' Even though the chairman may think that there isn't a need to send a message, I think we need to say very clearly that climate change is a threat, something we need to address. We have to be willing to make sure we do the right things now. 
   This amendment is really a way for us to start off right from the get-go that we are not going to allow a mistake to happen that could cause major impacts on climate emissions and that we just didn't care enough to pass this resolution. 
   I strongly support the amendment of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Shadegg) because I think we should say right off, our first step at reducing greenhouse gas emissions is to make sure we do not decommission any zero generators from this point forward unless it is part of a comprehensive plan to reduce greenhouse gases. So please, here is a motion at least we can stand up and say, we did no harm; we made sure that a mistake wasn't made.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Chairman, the American people have listened to Democrats and Republicans blame each other about budget crises. I became a Member in 1995. I left for 5 years. How things change. The parties change names, but it is the same tactics. 
   The American people want us working together on the budget. This amendment is a minimal effort of just saying to the American people, look, we recognize that even the best operation and the best budget can still be operated on 99 percent of what was projected. It is a minimalist kind of approach to this. If you can't vote for a 1 percent across-the-board cut, go to your town hall meetings, go into your communities and say, well, I really didn't want to do it because of what it symbolized. The fact is that this is the minimum of what we can do to say, look, we are trying to get back in the discipline of doing the right thing by the American taxpayer. 
   And if you can't vote for a 1 percent, how can you expect in the long run to be able to control the Federal budget, and that is exactly what the constituency wants us to do. 
   So I just say dump the Republican and Democrat argument. You get back to the fact that you have a motion that says quite clearly: we will make the effort of a 1 percent reduction across the board. That is a very small, little step towards fiscal responsibility and let's get together, Democrats and Republicans, and do the right thing and support the new Hefley amendment as authored by the gentleman from Georgia. If you can't do that, please don't think you can stand up and carry the mantle of self-righteousness when it comes to budget. We all bear the responsibility. Even those of us who weren't here bear the responsibility of doing the right thing and dumping the jargon about being Democrat or Republican and the other guy is at fault. We all bear that responsibility, and the voters and the taxpayers will blame all of us, regardless of our party affiliation, if we can't even make this minimal stance of a 1 percent across-the-board.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chance to be able to present this issue before this body. I think that, as the Congressional Immigration Caucus has pointed out, there is an issue here that obviously the American people are interested in and we were able to present tonight. 
   I just have to close with a few comments. One is the fact that the White House has discussed that there are procedures they have to go through. I think it is quite clear to anyone who reads the Constitution that the White House, the President, does not have to go through any procedure except to the decide either to pardon or not to pardon. 
   We hear a lot over the years of Executive privilege. Executive privilege. And every White House since George Washington has loved to discuss the concept of Executive privilege. But with that privilege goes Executive responsibility. And the White House bears the responsibility and the sole responsibility to issue pardons where there has been a miscarriage of justice. And I think the consensus is among many of us that this is exactly the kind of situation that the Founding Fathers had in mind when they proposed that the Executive and only the Executive would have this power, and this unencumbered power, separate from other procedures, to be able to right a wrong when the justice system has failed. I think that this is a chance that we can talk about. 
   But the thing that concerns me, Mr. Speaker, as being a Member who was born and raised on the border, I think that what has happened in Texas with this case reflects the total lack of understanding of just how out of control our borders are. 
   I hear people again and again in the Federal Government say that there are not the resources down at the border to be able to enforce the laws against drug smugglers, that there just isn't enough money and manpower to be able to address the problem, that we must allow these people to go free. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, if there was enough money to go down into Mexico, find a drug smuggler, negotiate a back-room deal with this drug smuggler, bring the drug smuggler back, and give them amnesty not just once but twice, if there were enough resources to cut this kind of deal and make this kind of effort to make sure that two Border Patrol agents get convicted, my God, aren't there enough resources to use the same effort to go after the drug smugglers? And I really ask that we consider that. 
   I would just like to say that tonight we were able to spend almost an hour discussing an issue that is very near  and dear to those who are concerned about the fact that our borders are out of control, that this incident happened in an area where Border Patrol agents had a firefight with smugglers with automatic weapons a few months ago, if you remember. And we wanted to remind the American people how out of control and absurd the situation has become in a lot of ways. 
   We hope, as the Congressional Immigration Caucus, Mr. Speaker, that over the next few months that Wednesday night will be spent as a night where those of us who are concerned about the illegal immigration issue and the out-of-control border will spend an hour every Wednesday night reporting to the American people of what is going on, on this most critical issue that Democrats and Republicans both care about.     
   If there was ever a situation and ever an issue where partisanship should be put aside and being an American should be first, it is time that we find a way to work together on the immigration issue. I call on you and everyone that has the honor of working in this House of the people to join together to address that. I invite you and every Member of the House to join the Immigration Caucus, so that we can work together for the good of all Americans.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to present our report to the American people on the status of the immigration issue tonight, and it is an honor to be able to welcome you to the Speaker's chair. 
   As a new freshman, or as one of your first times up there, I want to congratulate you on your advent to service of the people of America as the acting Speaker tonight. 
   Mr. Speaker, actually tonight we are talking about an issue that a lot of Americans have asked for a long time to be addressed, and that is the many different ways that we are encouraging illegal immigration. But actually tonight, we are to be talking about one of the items that originally was not intended to be one of immigration, it was one to be basically addressing national security and neighborhood security. 
   For good reasons, Congress in the past, both Democrats and Republicans, have said that the movement of capital funds, of bank accounts, was a major issue in fighting things like drug trafficking, of terrorist activities and of other illegal activities to where the United States' Congress, with this support and the consent of the people of the United States, said that before somebody opens a bank account, before they start getting involved in business transactions with a lending institution, they need to show and prove who they are so we know who is moving this cash back and forth. The identification issue became critical to make sure that drug cartels and criminal elements and terrorist elements were not able to use our institutions of lending, of finance, as part of their terrorist and illegal activity. 
   Sadly what has happened, though, is we passed a law that said everyone must be identified. There are lending institutions that have found ways to get around the law and say that if somebody is able to get a phony ID from a phony government document, we will look the other way and use that to be able to open bank accounts. 
   A lot of this discussion is specifically about illegal immigrants being able to get these documents, because you have countries such as Mexico that are willing to give documents, ID documents to individuals without any proof of who they are. Thus, the document such as the consulate card from the Republic of Mexico isn't worth the paper it is written on. 
   What has happened is these institutions, these American institutions, are actually participating in business transactions that they know violates the spirit of the law and accepts phony identification as a way to be able to engage in business that otherwise would be illegal for legal resident aliens and U.S. citizens to engage in, because the rest of us are required to show viable identification.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that the gentleman from Texas pointed out a real issue here, and that is the special treatment being given to somebody who is being perceived to be legally in the country. If you are a resident, legal alien, if you are a U.S. citizen, you are expected by these institutions to show up with the proper documentation, viable ID to prove you are who you are. But under this misguided concept that if you are here illegally, we can't expect you to live up to the minimum standard that everyone legally is playing here, that we will accept this consular card, which, admittedly, is given without any documentation, without any verification, and could be used by drug cartels, could be used by terrorists, could be used by anyone as a way of hiding their identity. But because we perceive you may be illegally in the country, we will abandon all our standards that we apply to everyone else and allow you to have a special standard that does not hold you to the viable ID requirement. 
   I just think that Americans across this country keep saying, how far off course can we go in America? And sadly, this is an issue that the Federal Government has been allowing to happen, that the administration has looked the other way on, and I think it is something that this administration has to address, this Congress has to address. And the American people need to call their Members of Congress and say, where do you stand on this issue of viable identification for the opening of financial arrangements? 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege to be able to yield whatever time he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia, Virgil Goode.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Thank you very much. I appreciate the gentleman from Virginia. 
   Just to let you know, a lot of people might say, Mr. Speaker, how many illegal alien babies can be born in America, can it be that big a deal? Well, let me just say to the gentleman of Virginia, in my State of California, the cost of just giving birth to the children of illegal aliens every year is $400 million. That is just for the birth. Then the parents who are illegally in this country qualify to get welfare payments in the name of their children because we give them automatic citizenship, even though technically the parents are not totally subject to the jurisdiction as required by the 14th amendment. You can't draft them, you can't try them for treason. But $400 million just for the birth. And in fact, just the cost of the welfare, Mr. Speaker, paying for the children of illegals have gotten so big that even a great moderate like Arnold Schwarzenegger, our terminator, or what we call ``governorator'' has recognized that he wants to be able to provide health care to these children, he wants to be able to take care of the costs, but even he is proposing that we now have to cut off welfare payment to the children of illegal aliens at 5 years, not because he wants to cut it off, but because even the wealthiest State in this Union, California, can no longer afford to pay the benefits to illegal aliens that have been going on for so long. It has gotten that far. 
   And I think anybody would recognize that Arnold Schwarzenegger is not exactly anti-immigrant. He is probably the flagship and the banner boy for the successful immigrant story. But even he has looked at the bottom line and said there is a place where you have got to be able to say enough is enough. How much are you going to take from the law-abiding citizens and the children of law-abiding citizens and shift it over and give it to people who have broken our laws? . 
   I appreciate the gentleman from Virginia for bringing that up. And all I have to say is a lot of people may talk about this issue of banks looking the other way and accepting these consular cards, even they are not viable because their argument is, but we are making money. This is America. We are supposed to be making money. This is breaking that fine line between legal and illegal. Those who make money legally are totally separate from those  who are making it illegally. And the banks are saying we are getting away with it, so let us keep doing it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think you would admit, this is right 
   where the issue of racketeering brought the Federal government in to address people who were into bootlegging, though they were making big money, people that were into prostitution, people that were in drug dealing, people that were involved in the labor market below fair market value. We have laws against racketeering, and these major banks are involved in racketeering. They are profiteering from illegal activity because they are willfully and openly encouraging people that are in violation of the law, working and making money in violation of our laws, and then taking that money and profiteering by cutting a deal with the illegal alien that we will let you be in our institution if we get a wink and a nod and we are able to get our pound of flesh out of it. So I think it is something we need to address. 
   I appreciate the chance to be able to be here tonight with you. And Mr. Speaker, let me just say that American people may say they hear a lot about the problem of illegal immigration and what do we do about it, but not enough people talk about simple answers. And I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, and everybody that wants to find a simple answer, it is not a Republican or Democrat problem, it is an American problem. And there were two great Americans, one was a Democrat, a former Border Patrol agent called Sylvester Reyes, another was the former chairman of Rules, now ranking member of Rules, a Republican from California named David Dreier, who sat down with the Border Patrol agents, the men and women that are tasked with taking care of the immigration issue. And they were asked, what is the one thing you would do if you had one law to take care of illegal immigration? And they didn't say be mean to anybody, all they said is give the American employer such a simple way as a tamper resistant Social Security card, one document, only one document to prove who is legal to work in the United States and who isn't. Make it so simple for an employer to know who is legal that there is no excuse for somebody to hire an illegal so the Border Patrol agents then can go in and really crack down on those who are hiring illegals. Because the employers who are knowingly hiring illegals cannot hide behind the guise of well, I am like the little guy who didn't understand, it will become so clear. 
   So I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you do us the privilege of looking at H.R. 98. Sylvester Reyes is a very respected member of the Democratic Party, David Dreier is a very respected member of the Republican Party. This bill has had the support from members of the Hispanic Caucus and members of immigration groups. This is where Democrats and Republicans can work together, and I think it is a place that America expects us to work together. 
   And I would ask anyone that is within the range of my voice, call their Member of Congress, call their Senator. Mr. Speaker, all they have to do is ask where the Member of Congress stands on H.R. 98, because this is where both Americans, Democrat and Republican, should be able to come together for the good of our future and for the future of our children and our grandchildren. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would yield back my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to, first of all, thank the chairman from Oregon and the ranking member for  supporting my bill, H. Res. 446, in recognition of the life of Wally Schirra. I would just have to say that when we go through the record of the life of Wally, he was a San Diegan for a long time; and we celebrated Wally as a neighbor and as a friend and as a national and international hero. 
   The fact is that he did serve extensively, like many San Diegans, in the military, with three Distinguished Flying Crosses, two Air Medals, more than a MIG or two on the side. He obviously went into the space race with a lot of accomplishments. 
   Being the only individual to fly in all three of the first stages of manned space flight for America was unique, but I think, as was pointed out before, Wally is a man that filled in so often when others might have hesitated. 
   After the terrible disaster of losing astronauts in a major fire, he did not hesitate to look forward to being the first to step back into those capsules and move on and move up with our space race. That kind of bravery we didn't really take into consideration at the time. What a huge challenge it must have been to explain to your wife, ``Honey, I am going to get in this capsule. Somebody has to do it, and I will be the one.'' We don't think about that family, that personal aspect of being a hero and moving forward with those kinds of accomplishments. 
   I also would like to say that we forget that, without the docking procedure that Wally was able to master, there was not going to be any trip to the moon. It was an essential component, as important as any missile, any rocket, any control system. The ability for man to dock with another spaceship was an essential part, and Wally was a major part of that. 
   But I want to thank all my colleagues for supporting this bill. Wally was our neighbor, he was our friend, and he really did live a life that San Diegans are proud of in public service. He spent his later years working with the local museums for flight history, and he also spent a lot of time on his sailboat in San Diego. 
   But I want to thank all of you, because Wally was not just a hero to the world and to America; he was a neighbor and a friend to those of us in San Diego.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILBRAY. To the gentleman from West Virginia, let me just say I know your concern about the process here. But I think that if you reviewed this situation and the process these two Border Patrol agents went through, you would understand why some of us are standing up and saying, first of all, the 10-year minimum for the commission of a crime while carrying a firearm, it was used to apply to these agents, was never meant to apply to law enforcement agents who are required by law to carry firearms. And I think we can kind of understand. 
   Remember when we passed that and it went through, it was sort of like, criminals, if you are going to engage in criminal activity, leave your gun at home, as a way of lowering the level of violence and the potential violence of criminals carrying firearms at the time of the commission of the crime. 
   This law that we passed at the Federal level is being applied to Federal officers who are required by statute to carry a firearm. And so now what we have is that we have law enforcement agents who are sworn to serve the American people, that are being prosecuted under a statute that says we are going to nail you because you were carrying a firearm during the commission of a crime when, as a requirement of their employment, they had to carry the firearm. 
   Doesn't anybody else find this kind of absurd, if not ridiculous? 
   And all I have to say is I would sincerely hope that the chairman of the committee will take a second thought about opposing this amendment, because I think in all fairness the American people are saying we have two agents who were serving their Nation as best as they could. They might have made a mistake that should have been administered through an administrative process; and those of us in local government that have worked with law enforcement know this, excessive force happens in certain situations. 
   But this is where a Federal law that we passed in Congress that says we are going to nail the criminals who use firearms in the commission of a crime and tell them don't ever carry a firearm when you are thinking of breaking a crime, that that law is being applied to our agents who are executing the requirements of Federal law. That was never the intention of this law, but it is being applied to these two agents. 
   So I just have to say sincerely, I would really ask the chairman to reconsider his opposition to this amendment. I think fair-minded people that know why this Federal law was passed know that it was not meant for Border Patrol agents or any Federal agents that are required to carry a firearm, to use this law against those agents. And if you can do it to Border Patrol agents, you can do it to FBI agents, you can do it to everybody. 
   Now, let me just say something about the unique situation that we are seeing down at the border. At this location, Mr. Chairman, within the month of this incident you had Border Patrol agents under fire by automatic gunfire, AK-47s firing at our agents from across the border. There was good reason to think that our agents might have been a little more active with their guns than we might have preferred. But, in all fairness, it really comes down to: Are we willing to stand up and say there has been a mistake, that mistake needs to be addressed, needs to be reassessed, and do we now relinquish our responsibility of the budget to the executive branch where we say these agents have been wronged? 
   And if those of you that want to talk about this, in all the years I was in local government I saw excessive force cases brought very seldom. In this one sector, this Federal attorney has brought excessive force cases against three different law enforcement officers. Every one of them that we know of, or I know of, just happened to have been cases that involved illegal aliens, drug smugglers, foreign nationals committing a crime. That is really unique. I have never heard of that kind of situation occurring anywhere else. 
   In this case, it is time that we stand up and we say, you have the jurisdiction to prosecute, you have the jurisdiction not to give clemency on this issue, but we have the jurisdiction of saying you will not use the taxpayers' funds to prosecute these men.

   Mr. BILBRAY. I think you agree, though, that when we talked about the 10-year minimum, the jury was told that they had to administer the 10-year execution based on the commission of the crime. And I think you were here when the 10-year minimum was passed. I think you would agree the idea was to try to encourage anybody that, if you are going to do something that was illegal, you don't carry a gun, because it would lower that level of potential.

   People have to understand how really, really we have bent over backwards to accommodate people to immigrate to this country. We have about 800,000 people become citizens. We have a million that are allowed to be permanent resident aliens every year, and then we have another million-plus that are allowed to come here to work in the United States. That is almost 3 million people a year that we are accommodating from overseas in one way or the other. And when people say we are a Nation of immigrants, we are a Nation of legal immigrants; but there is a reasonable level of immigration. When the American people realize that we just absolutely have our doors open, there is no excuse for illegal immigration, and we have to make sure that our legal immigration policies are reasonable. 
   I don't think it is much to ask, those of us who are sworn to represent the people of the United States, to make sure that the American immigration policy is for America first and for the immigrant second. We not only have a right, we have a responsibility to make sure that our immigration policy serves the American people. Like every other policy that the Federal Government is initiating, the American people should come first before anyone else.  
   This issue of the cost of just the legal immigration, let me give you one cost that most people don't think about. The cost just in one State of giving birth to the children of illegal aliens in California is $400 million a year. That is $400 million just for giving free birth to the children of illegal aliens. In San Diego County, it is $22 million a year just for birthing babies of people that aren't supposed to be in the country. 
   You add that up, the impact on the taxpayers, there is no way in the world I can believe that any man or woman can stand up in this Chamber and say I am for a balanced budget, I am for fiscal responsibility, but I am for giving amnesty that has been estimated to be $50 billion if Mr. Kennedy and some people in the House get their way of rewarding people for being here illegally. 
   I think there is a basic issue that we ought to call down and say, since when does this country believe that those who follow the law should be punished and told to stay at home, but those who break the law get rewarded and get into this country? 
   And since when is it not the right thing to do to make sure that our immigration policy serves the people we are sworn to represent in this Chamber and in the Senate? It is a major issue that the American people need to be asking those that they have sent to Washington. 
   I, as the new chairman of the Immigration Caucus, look forward to working with Democrats and Republicans because I think in all fairness, immigration is not a Democrat or Republican issue, it is an American issue. And Americans across this country on both sides of the political divide believe it is time we address this issue reasonably and not make the terrible mistake we made in 1986 of rewarding people with amnesty and not doing something about enforcement. 
   I appreciate the chance to be able to address the issue. That chart scares me to death. And I just say this as a practicing Catholic with five children. Your numbers are a lot lower than for those of us that are in my Mass every day. I think we have to recognize this number as a huge threat of really overturning the entire concept we have of reasonable immigration levels, and those reasonable immigration levels are not only our right to set here in Washington, it is our responsibility to do that. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. BILBRAY. I just remember I was involved with running the County of San Diego in 1986, and I remember that before the bill was passed the number estimate was 300,000. It was after the bill was passed that they said, oh, it might be as high as 1 million, and then they kept continuing the deadline and increasing those who qualified to apply, and it ended up being 3 million. So I just think people have got to remember, when the bill was passed, what was being told was 300,000, and what ended up being the final number was 3 million.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Well, I would just like to congratulate you on explaining exactly what your legislation is focused on. You articulated the problem, the challenge, and it seems to me not only a very common-sense approach but a very, very compassionate approach to the issue. 
   I think any American that thinks about hundreds of people coming to this country because one person was allowed in sort of boggles your mind saying why has not anybody brought this up before.     
   I think that look at your diagram there, and the level of legal immigration you are proposing per person, based on family relations, is quite reasonable. I don't think any of us, especially those of us that are a family from immigrants, my mother came from Australia, could say that is an unreasonable and an unfair proposal and unrational proposal at this time. 
   I really want to compliment you at actually addressing this issue, because we are talking about a lot of other difference issues. But this is one that is sort of below the radar, people aren't talking about, and I am glad you are able to bring it up. I think that is why  our Wednesday evening reports to the American people on the status of immigration is so important. I want to thank you sincerely for bringing up this issue and for introducing this bill.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Let me say this as a Republican. I think the American people will be so pleased if the Democratic majority would bring a bill forward that addresses the major source of illegal immigration, and that is illegal employment. If the Democrats were brave enough to just come forward, not with an amnesty that rewards illegals for being here, not pandering to the illegals and the whole industry that has been built up around that, but went and actually did a project that addressed the real source of illegal immigration; and that is, have a simple employer verification system and a crackdown on the people that are profiteering from illegal immigration, and that's the employers. IF the Democratic Party did that, I think the American people would embrace that. 
   I think it's a real chance for them to show that they can get the job done and get this issue done that the Republicans didn't get done. You know, as an American, I think that is more important than Republicans having to take advantage of this issue. I just wouldn't be happy as an American to see the Democrats sit there and actually get the job done so I could join them, could vote with them at doing, actually getting the legislation through that the American people have been waiting for too long. I would sure love to be surprised, and I am sure the American people would love to see us working as Democrats and Republicans for America first, not our party first and our Nation second. 
   I just tell you, I think that our grandchildren would be well served, because all of us, I know the three of us here, if it meant somebody on the Democratic side getting credit for it, then God bless them. What's important is that we leave an America for our grandchildren that is worth our grandchildren living in, and taking care of this problem is going to be part of the important part of doing that.

   Mr. BILBRAY. I think the key is the fact that every legitimate employer wants to have a simple system that lets them know who is qualified to work and who is not. The employer doesn't want to be the person having to make that determination. 
   We require every employer in this country now to get a Social Security number for their employee. All we are saying now, with the Silvestre Reyes-David Dreier bill, H.R. 98, is we will now give the employee a card to prove that it's their number, so that the employer, when they get this number, gets it from a card, doesn't just take somebody's word. It gives us, as legitimate citizens or legal residents, the ability to prove this really is our number, not 20 other people that are using that number somewhere else down the road. 
   This issue of upgrading the Social Security card seems so simple. We haven't done this since the 1930s, though every driver's license from every State has been upgraded since then. Now that we have done the real ID bill, where we are requiring finally that driver's licenses be upgraded, isn't it appropriate that the Federal Government do the same thing with our card, our Social Security, to upgrade it to be as tamper-resistant as the new driver's license would be?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2649, a bill that is looking at a precious resource that needs to be cleaned up and used. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you in working and speaking with me about other challenges we have environmentally around this country, one of them being the fact the Federal Government is still mandating the polluting of our air and the picking of our pockets with the mandate of corn and ethanol going into our gasoline. I don't know about in your State, but in our State, that impact has reached $6 a comparable gallon untaxed ethanol being forced into our fuel system by the misguided approaches here in Washington. 
   I look forward to working with you in eliminating that mandate and protecting our air and protecting consumers when we go to the pump. But as we talk about liquid gold, out west it is not just gasoline and ethanol that are liquid gold, but actually clean drinking water. This bill would address a problem that has actually been created by a well-intentioned but misguided application of the Endangered Species Act and other Federal regulatory activities.     
   Where Lake Hodges had traditionally had a clean watershed kept clear from debris and undergrowth, because of the Federal agencies' misguided application of our environmental regulations, such as the Endangered Species Act, the local agencies and community were not allowed to clear the watershed while the water was low so that once the water did rise up we did not have rotting organic material in our water source. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, that has occurred, and the water quality of the lake is now in violation of the Clean Water Act, 303(d). This bill will allow us to give a portion of the money, probably around one-quarter of it, to allow the local community now to purify the water so that it can be compatible with 303 of the Clean Water Act. 
   I hope that we will be able to work together, pass this bill, and be able to work with the local community. I look forward to working with you, Mr. Speaker, at not only cleaning up our water, but cleaning up our air and taking that ethanol out of our gasoline.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chance to speak before the House today, and it's about an issue that many Americans all over this Nation are discussing, are listening about, and, frankly, are very concerned, if not outraged, and that is the proposal before the Senate this week that would actually not only allow, but demand amnesty for 12- to 20 million illegal immigrants in this country while millions wait patiently outside to immigrate into our country legally. 
   Tonight I am honored to be able to have colleagues here to be able to address the issues and actually talk about what's going on in their districts and address the issue that where does America go from here? How do we stop the Senate from making this terrible mistake? How do we turn the President and the Senate away from the path of amnesty that was followed in 1986, which caused the greatest influx of illegal immigration? How do we get the elite here in Washington to wake up to the fact that you do not stop illegal immigration by announcing to the world that you are now going to reward up to 20 million people who are illegally in the country? 
   I have the privilege to recognize the gentleman from Texas at this time.

   Mr. BILBRAY. One of the things, I think, people misunderstand when they talk about the amnesty, that people that are here illegally working in the United States are not just violating immigration law. A lot of people don't realize that about 73 to 75 percent of everyone who is here illegally is working illegally because they acquired false documents, stole somebody's ID or identification to work, which is a felony. 
   The Kennedy proposal in the Senate not only gives amnesty, an exemption from prosecution, for being illegally in the country, but exempts them and gives amnesty for the felony they committed when they used somebody else's identification or used false documentation to acquire a job. 
   So we have got to remember that we are not only giving amnesty for immigration, we are now proposing that we will pick a certain population to be exempt from a felony violation and not only forgiven for that violation, but to be given a special program, the Z visa, that only those who have broken the law qualify for. Those individuals who have been waiting patiently to immigrate into this country illegally are not allowed, under this proposal, to have the Z option, to go for the Z visa. 
   That is a concept of rewarding illegal behavior, a little felony illegal behavior, when you are telling those who have not broken our laws that you are not going to offer them the same thing.

She came here, played by the rules; and, as she reminds me again and again, it is an insult to her and everyone else who played by the rules to gain legal status in this country to watch anybody, let alone the Senate of the United States, announce to the world that they are going to give up to 20 million people the cherished ability to live permanently in the United States and to give them a vehicle towards citizenship.

   Mr. BILBRAY. If I may reclaim my time. I think the one thing we don't talk about enough in this country is that there is this perception that we don't allow very much legal immigration inside. 
   The United States today, Mr. Speaker, accepts more legal immigration than all the rest of the world combined. We are accepting more legal immigration today than at any other time in the history of our Republic. This country is one of the most gracious and welcoming countries, the most welcoming country in the history of the world. And so we have nothing to apologize for when it comes to accommodating, except for the fact that we made a terrible mistake in 1986. 
   When you were talking about the definition of amnesty, it actually comes from the Latin word for amnesia. And maybe what the Senate is forgetting in having this amnesia is what happened the last time they proposed this type of amnesty. 
   Einstein said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Let's just look at what happened when Mr. Kennedy, who promised in 1986 this would be the last amnesty that America would ever have, clearly stated, ``It will never happen again.'' 
   Twenty years ago, we tried this experiment of rewarding illegal immigration. We were promised that it was only going to be 1 million illegals that were given amnesty. It turned out it was 3 million. Now, 20 years later, rather than having 3 illegals in our country we have 12 to 20. Mr. Kennedy, did your amnesty really eliminate illegal immigration? 
   I will tell you as somebody who was down at the border, I was actually the chairman of San Diego County on the border, a county of 3 million. The greatest influx of illegal immigration that we have seen in this country happened immediately after the last amnesty. And anyone who says that we are going to stop illegal immigration by announcing to the world that 20 million illegals got rewarded is either ignorant of the facts or willing to fabricate verifications that are absolutely outrageous. And you cannot stop illegal immigration when you announce that you are going to reward it, and the proof is in history. Last time, Mr. Kennedy, you did this, we had the largest illegal immigration population. 
   And, frankly, I think there are people who are proposing this amnesty who know what it will do but will not come clean with the American people. And I think the one thing we saw this week, and I think all of us will agree, is that the elite in Washington think that the American people don't understand this issue. Well, the American people understood it. Within 45 minutes after Mr. Kennedy and the Senators were doing their press conference, the American people started making phone calls, they started e-mailing, they started faxing. They sent a signal to the Senators and they sent a signal to us that, Washington, we are watching and we are not going to fall for it this time. We are going to stand up and defend our grandchildren's birthright, and we are going to start demanding that you start doing the right thing. 
   And I think the guilt goes both ways. The public is fed up with the Republicans and Democrats, because they have not seen an administration enforce the law. We have to gain credibility that we really can be trusted with the security of this country by being willing to do the right thing and enforce the immigration laws here. And not until we do that, no matter who is President, no matter what party is in power, will the American public trust us to move on with a lot of other agendas.

   Mr. BILBRAY. I appreciate that. And actually, I guess we've got to remember that 11 months ago, I was standing exactly where you are and gave my acceptance speech for being sworn into Congress. And there were 18 candidates for the 50th District in California. And the people of San Diego wanted to send a clear message to Washington that this illegal immigration issue is something that people need to address. And I think today you're hearing not just one district scream loud and clear that they want the illegal immigration issue addressed, but you're seeing people calling from all the districts, calling their Representatives and demanding that we finally do the right thing and not sell out on this issue. 
   I'd like yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Reclaiming my time. I mean, the American people are such a patient, humanitarian people that maybe sometimes we forget there's a fine line between being the nice guy and being a patsy. My mother immigrated from Australia. She got her citizenship, and she's very proud that she was one of the first Australian war brides to get her citizenship, April 1946. And when she sees that there are not only illegals in the country saying they want to be legalized, they want amnesty, what shocks her is that the United States allows people to be here illegally and demand, demand that America change its laws to accommodate them because they do not want to play by the rules. 
   What other Nation on Earth would allow people to be illegally in their country and then demand that their duly elected representative government modify its statutes to accommodate them because they do not want to be bothered by following the laws of their host country? 
   What kind of relationship do we expect to come from a situation to where we accommodate people who come to this country illegally, while we tell those patiently that want to come here legally, sorry, you get put on the back of the list? 
   And, you know, I'm very impressed. Learning a new language is always a big challenge, and your wife did that. My wife didn't immigrate from a foreign country. She came from New Orleans, and we're still trying to understand some of the things she says. My mother immigrated from Australia, and the Australians are going to have to learn English someday themselves. 
   But I think the real sad fact is that there are actually people that think that there's some good that can come out of this not only for America, but for the immigrants and immigrants around the world if we think breaking the law is now going to be a standard. If you want to live in a country where their law is bought and sold and shifted around by politicians just for political expediency, there's a lot of countries you can go to. Those countries tend to be poor, downtrodden, and poverty-stricken, and, by the way, happen to be the places that a lot of these illegal immigrants are coming 
   from. But why transfer that corruption from those Third World countries into this country and destroy the mother's milk of freedom, the concept of the rule of law, while at the same time you're saying that the economic backbone of freedom, the middle class, is expendable at the same time? 
   In fact, there are people that try to accommodate illegal immigration to such a point that this bill that the Senate is proposing will say that an illegal alien qualifies for in-State tuition, even though a United States citizen doesn't qualify. And this really hits me personally, because in the State of California, where I have been a resident since the day I was born, I have paid taxes my entire adult life, I was told that my children, to get in-State tuition, I had to show a personal tax return. But somebody that they suspect is an illegal alien doesn't have to show their personal records; they just have to show utility bills. And when I said, I'll show you my utility bills, I'll show you all the way back to the '70s; oh, excuse me, sir, you don't qualify because we don't think you're illegal. 
   So if the American people think this is just about illegals and just about, you know, 12- to 20 million, they've got to remember that they are going to be put in a position of having to prove more than somebody who is illegally in this country; that American citizens will become second-class citizens to those who are not even citizens and not even legal. This is how absurd this line goes if you follow Mr. Kennedy off the edge. 
   And remember, this is the same man, in 1986, that said no more amnesties anymore. I guarantee it. That is a sad state of affairs that the American people are facing, that same big lie, 20 years later. And it's time we say no. 
   And I'm so proud, I am so proud to be an American, knowing that the American people called those Senators, e-mailed them, faxed them and wrote them to where the Senate, rather than trying to cram this through this week, were forced to back off and give some time. And now this next week the American people will have more time to read the fine print, read about things like in-State tuition and loans to illegal aliens, and read about what is really in this bill and how bad it really is. 
   And I'd like to yield back to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Congressman, you hit on the real point. In a Republic where the governed get to choose the government, trust is an essential component. And there isn't any trust in the American people when it comes to the Federal Government enforcing our immigration laws. There isn't any credibility in the Federal Government when it comes to stopping illegal immigration. 
   The American people believe, and rightfully so, that special interests manipulate the Federal Government to stop illegal immigration from being controlled in the past, and that unless they really scream loud and start holding elected officials accountable at the polling box, that they are going to continue to have that type of corruption delivered to them when it comes to the immigration issue. 
   I want to just say clearly, a lot of people say why am I feeling so strong on this concept of amnesty? Why can't we just do it one more time? Let me tell you something. I have talked to people south of the border and in Third World countries all over the world. And if people would take the time to listen. 
   To give an example, a congressman in Zacatecas, Mexico, a Mexican congressman, says to me, Look, BRIAN, you know you have got to educate these people because we all down here know you are going to give amnesty again. They are all going to be U.S. citizens. Why do you think they are coming up illegally? They know you are going to reward them. 
   You go down to places like Central America. They say, Look, we are told come on up now. America is going to give us amnesty. We are going to become citizens. The way to America is come illegal. That message is being heard around the world. We need to send a clear and defined message that says no more amnesty, no more rewards for illegal behavior. You want to be an American? You follow the law and play by the rules. If you are not willing to do it, we will never give amnesty again. And, believe me, if we send that clear message, if we stop this amnesty, people around world will finally understand, no, it is no longer the option to come here illegally. You have got to play by the rules. 
   And then and only then will we see the ability to control not just our border; but our neighborhoods, our jobs, our parks, our hospitals, our schools, are finally going to be ours, and those that we choose to be our neighbors, not somebody who snuck in and stole away in the middle of the night. 
   I am so honored to stand here today with you, sir. I appreciate the hard work that you have given the people of Texas and your district, and I look forward to working with you to make sure that we present a workable, enforceable immigration policy that will stop illegal immigration and not allow this proposal in the Senate to move in and allow another illegal immigration wave being caused by another ill-fated amnesty scheme. Thank you very much.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Madam Chairman, I had the privilege to serve 10 years as a county supervisor in the County of San Diego serving a community that desperately needed help with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and I also happened to have been privileged enough to serve on Interstate and Commerce on the Health Committee that reauthorized the Ryan White Act. 
   The biggest issue here that is being discussed by the Member from Texas (Mr. Barton) is the fact that the need should follow the patient. I am sure the gentleman from Chicago recognizes that all of these agencies and all of this money is supposed to be to service the people, not to groups, not to cities. It is human beings we are talking about in need. His motion is a compromise. It doesn't say don't strike the need on everything, but it says let's take half of it or take a portion and give priority to those who need it. 
   Madam Chairman, this would be like somebody thinking that it would be appropriate to send as much money to an empty hospital that used to serve patients as it is to send it to the new hospital that is full of patients. All he is saying is, let's take a portion of this and commit it totally to need. Not all of it, but a portion of it. How can we go back to our districts and say the agency in a certain city was more important than the patients and the people who are sick who just happen not to be sick in that same area? 
   The fact is having a formula that puts weight to those who used to be served is an inappropriate formula, and we all agreed in the 1990s that we were going to phase that out. The gentleman's motion only moves forward that agreement we have always had when we talked about Ryan White, that Ryan White was a young man, not an agency. Ryan White was a human being who had AIDS. 
   This grant, this program was never meant to serve groups, cities, or agencies except if they were the victims of this hideous disease called AIDS/HIV. 
   And so I think, let's stop a second. These groups and people that want us to send them money because they used to serve a large number of patients and realize that they may have to move or they might have to change their employment, that is not what this fund is for. It is for serving patients. And so all the gentleman is saying is, please, let's follow the need, and let's not say that it is for treating those who are sick if we are going to send it to agencies that are not serving. Let's send it to those agencies that are serving. At  least let's start moving towards the total amount of this fund. And the honor of Ryan White is to make these funds totally committed to serving patients that are ill today, the patients that need the service today, not patients of the past. We can't solve the problems of the past, but we can solve the problems that face us today, this year, and in the future, and that is by making sure funds are committed to those who are actually sick today. 
   And I would support all of the funds going to only those based on a formula of today's service, because we are talking about this year that these funds are supposed to be sent. The gentleman has accepted a compromise; I am willing to accept that compromise. We should be able to go this far, and common decency says the gentleman should get a chance to be able to have this compromise worked out. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Madam Chairman, many people in this country would think the compromise being proposed doesn't go far enough. I think most people would say that the money for AIDS should follow the patient, not a bureaucracy. But it's equal protection. 
   Does somebody with AIDS in Fort Worth have any more or less of a right to Federal funds to take care of AIDS than somebody who lives in San Francisco? How about equal protection here? 
   Does an AIDS patient in Fort Worth have equal rights with an AIDS patient in San Francisco? That's the question here. 
   The compromise gives 75 percent preference to San Francisco. How much more preference do you want? And let's not talk about equal protection any more if you want to do this. 
   He has bent over backwards to try to cooperate and meet the people from San Francisco halfway at phasing this out. All we're asking for is stick to the compromise rather than continue to go. And I don't think that anybody that believes in equal protection can honestly say that an AIDS patient who happens to be in Fort Worth doesn't have the same rights and shouldn't be given the same protection and just as much money per capita as somebody in San Francisco.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, as a former member of the Air Resources Board in the State of California and working on air pollution issues for decades, I was looking at the text that said this bill was going to move America forward. 
   This text is not moving America forward; it's moving us back to a 1970's agenda. This agenda is the same agenda we had in the environmental community in the 1970s. In the 1970s, we were doing the best we could then. But this is the best America can expect from this Congress, is 30-year-old ideas that have been proven false, and the example, this bill is going to pick winners and losers in the industry. 
   It is going to mandate not only the inclusion of poisons in our gasoline in places like California where in 1992 we warned you about MTBE, we warned you that ethanol was going to cause problems, but this place was bought off by special interest groups that claimed to be environmentally sensitive and forced MTBE into the fuel of America. 
   Later, when you realized we were right, you said, sorry. Just last, a few months ago, Harvard came out with another study about ethanol. All we are asking is, don't mandate that this poison is put in the fuel. 
   If you can't believe CARB, then why are the States around the north using our standards at CARB to clean up the environment? Look before you leap, but this technology that we are talking about doesn't even include zero mission generators like high pressure gas reactors, doesn't include. 
   The only way we are going to beat greenhouse gases is to go nuclear, but you don't have the political guts to look our friends in the eye and say we have got to move beyond the 1970s. We have got to move forward. We have got to be willing to do what is right for the environment. 
   If that tells Archer Daniels Midland or the extreme wackos who are always going to be against nuclear that, sorry, guys, the environment comes first, if you don't have the guts to do that, don't claim this is a green proposal. 1970 cars are polluting and wasteful. This bill is polluting and wasteful.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the exemptions in this motion. I find it hard to believe that anyone who wants to really fight greenhouse gases is going to try to have winners and losers and allow these major exemptions that are in this bill. 
   The City of Los Angeles is going to continue to go without the same mandates and requirements and standards that the City of San Diego would have. Why are public utilities exempt in this bill, as if their emissions are not going to affect the environment, as if government is somehow immune? Government should be leading, not being exempted. 
   Mr. Chairman, as many surfers know, like myself, Hawaii has some of the most sun, wind and surf of any State in America. Why are Hawaii emissions exempt from this mandate when the rest are included? These exemptions are irresponsible and do not justify the environmental intention of this motion. 
   I have strongly supported the intention, but it is too bad that special interests, special lobbying and the back-room deals have snuck in these exemptions that should not have ever existed.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Chairman, in San Diego County today, the consumers are paying over $3.50 for gasoline, and people point fingers at the oil companies when, in fact, Washington, DC, has mandated that we put in our gasoline corn-based ethanol that costs $4 a gallon. And considering that you need 1 1/2  gallons of ethanol to equal the mileage you get with gasoline, that equals $6 a gallon that is mandated by the Congress of the United States for a product that not only is driving up the price of gasoline but is polluting our air, as identified by the Air Resources Board of California. 
   Now, if you are a constituent that is making money off of corn-based oil, that's fine. But do not allow anyone who claims to be an environmentalist and claims to be a consumer in California to support the corn-based ethanol proposal here. 
   I do not agree with Mr. McCain of Arizona very often, but, as quoted by Mr. McCain all the way back in 2003, he stated that the corn-based ethanol mandate that Congress is perpetuating on the United States is highway robbery perpetuated on the American people by Congress. 
   Please let's eliminate the corn-based mandate, save the environment, and save the consumers.

   One of the sanctity of life concepts is to make sure that if you are going to lose a loved one, you respect the life and try to maximize the benefit from that loss. I think this bill is trying to address that. I would ask both sides not to point fingers, but to try to find that sanctity of life is something that is interpreted in many ways.  
   One of them is to make sure that if a life is going to be lost, we have a moral obligation to maximize the potential benefit from that loss. That is a respect for sanctity of life that is not discussed enough.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Chairman, I find it hard to believe my dear colleague from California can really believe that an unmanned observation platform like the Predator is not more cost effective than having a rotor wing with twin crews that have to switch off at least every 6 hours. Where you are able to do an unmanned observation, you can switch off crews while they're on site. You don't have to take the vehicles off station to be able to do the transformation from one crew to the other. 
   And I don't know what data, where you're getting the saying that the unmanned vehicle is somehow not as cost effective as having rotor-winged manned vehicles on site in very remote areas. It just doesn't pencil out. This is the same kind of argument we heard 5 years ago in the military saying unmanned vehicles would never work in some place like Afghanistan, where you and I know the great hero of the Afghan war was the Predator. So I've just got to say sincerely, you've been in government long enough to understand that putting a rotor wing, a major helicopter up with two individuals to do aerial observations compared to an unmanned vehicle that has proven its technology over time and time again, that is able to stay on station, and this is one key along the border that most people won't talk about, they are able to stay on station so that the smugglers don't know when they're coming off station to switch crews to go down. A crew actually switches in the trailer on site. One guy says, you've got it now, Joe, I have it now, and the smugglers never know when you're going through. And to do the same kind of test to your manned vehicles and other aerial observations that you are proposing for this technology, this technology is the greatest success in the world.

   The fact is, this technology has been the breakthrough that has shocked the world. And it is absolutely astonishing that we would pick out the hero and the technology that opened the eyes to the fact that remote technology was a great break through for effectiveness and cost effectiveness.

And the fact is, history has proven, and even though you may not like to admit it, the things like the fence in San Diego that some people thought wouldn't work and the so-called experts said wouldn't work have worked extraordinarily well because we gave it a chance to work before we started cutting it off.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Chairman, after the tragedy of 9/11, the 9/11 Commission came forth with some very distinct recommendations. And one of their most distinct recommendations was that we need to have a secure minimum standard for identification within the United States. The REAL ID bill was our answer to that and it was a bipartisan effort to make sure that we correct a deficiency that was identified by the 9/11 Commission. My amendment is very clear. It strikes $150 million out of the integrated Deepwater system program which has been identified with major problems, moves it over to a program that we all admit is underfunded and needs to be addressed and aids in the implementation of this most essential program. 
   All it says is that we now are going to commit $150 million to the program which will raise it up to $200 million to help our States fulfill their responsibility to provide viable, verifiable identification for every American and every legal resident within the United States. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Chairman, there have already been three States that have opted out of REAL ID because they say they don't have the money to implement it. The terrorists of 9/11 did not slip through the Coast Guard along our coastline. I represent a coastal district. The fact is we need to make some priority decisions here. What is the real threat to the American people? The threat is the use of false identification to get on airplanes, to get access into government buildings, to do other types of wrongful deeds against the American people is because we do not have a secure ID today. The 9/11 report did not say a critical national defense purpose to defend our Nation from terrorism is that we need Deepwater. But they did say we absolutely need to have secure documentation within this country. 
   So we have to make a priority decision. And as somebody of a naval family, somebody of a coastal community, I understand the Coast Guard is important, but this is a priority decision. REAL ID not only should and needs to be implemented now, it should have been implemented years ago. But the lack of funding should not be an excuse for us to do the right thing that is essential. If you're not going to follow the 9/11 report, then why the heck even have the committee report? If you're going to follow the bureaucracy that says let's keep defending America the way we did for the last hundred years and not upgrade to the realities of today? 
   The 9/11 report has said, one of the first priorities must be securing our documentation. With this amendment, we will be saying we will not only be economically viable, we will be intellectually smart in the way we defend our country. 
   This amendment is quite simple. It says, you have problems with the Deepwater project right now, let's talk about it and work those problems out, but we know right now we do not have the time to delay at implementing a secure identification system for this country. Let's work with our States, let's give them the grants so they don't have an excuse not to do the right thing, to make sure that when our citizens get on an airplane, we know that everyone who got on that airplane got on with a secure document and that they can be reassured that it's safe to fly in America and that America is safe because the Congress did the right thing and gave the resources for secure identification so we can have a secure Nation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

It is a time-sensitive issue. I understand Deepwater needs to be addressed. But you have to admit, there are major problems with Deepwater. But right now, there is a major crisis in getting the resources to the local States to implement the REAL ID bill. 
   You may not agree with the REAL ID bill, but our own Governor and the Fraternal Order of Police understand. This is one of those little things that don't seem important, but law enforcement and the Governor say please, this is one of the things that local government can do to fulfill.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say thank you very much to Mr. Deal for taking a leadership role on this issue. It is quite appropriate you are pointing out how broad the problem is of this automatic citizenship given to people that have no obligations, no responsibilities, and are leveraging the fact that some people think that everyone born on U.S. soil somehow gets automatic citizenship. The fact is I think that the Korean parents are a good example. 
   The subject to the jurisdiction clause of the 14th amendment does not only mean that you can be arrested. It means that you must, according to common law, be totally obligated. You must be able to be tried for treason and be forced into the military. 
   Can you imagine if these terrorists from Korea were told, sorry, you are now going to be drafted into the United States Army? People would come unglued. They would say that is inhumane, that is outrageous, how can you do that. Well, it is just as outrageous to give automatic citizenship to the people that have no obligations and no responsibility to the Federal Government, to give them citizenship, as it is to require them to be tried for treason against the United States or to serve in the military when they are not, quote, unquote, subject to the jurisdiction in a manner that applies to the 14th amendment. 
   This thing we have to understand, that rights and responsibilities come together, and as these legal Korean tourists come to our country, they have certain rights and certain responsibilities, but they do not have total responsibility, and thus they do not have birthright citizenship. 
   I think that is a clause to get into. I just wish that the people who would be as outraged about us drafting a Korean tourist or trying them for treason will be just as outraged about the people leveraging and taking advantage of our hospitality and then trying to demand rights where the rights obviously do not exist historically or in fact. 
   I appreciate the fact that you took a leadership role on this after I got my 5-year sabbatical that the voters gave me from Congress. You picked up the baby and actually carried it, and I really appreciate that and your leadership will be appreciated. 
   It is astonishing that back in the 1990s when we first brought up this issue, some people were saying, well, what is this issue. But more and more when you go talk to the American people, they want to know what has kind of been tagged this, what they call it, ``anchor baby'' issue because they see this huge open door for abuse. 
   In California alone, I want you to know and I just say this to the people, how big a problem, how big a price tag can automatic citizenship to foreign nationals and illegal aliens can be. How big can it be? Just in California, it costs the State of California to pay for the births of the children of illegal aliens $400 million a year, and that is a price tag to people who are illegally in the country. 
   Let us face it, that $400 million could sure provide a lot of basic health care to legal Americans, both immigrants and U.S. citizens, that is being denied those people of need, while we accommodate those who have broken our laws and their families and encouraged them to emigrate. 
   So I thank you very much for taking this leadership role, and I greatly appreciate the fact that Georgia is represented on the Immigration Caucus, and that is a great advantage for us. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege to serve on the Immigration Caucus, and as someone who grew up on the Mexican border between San Diego and Tijuana, I saw this issue as it has evolved over the last 45 years. 
   I grew up in an area where illegal immigration was just sort of a matter of fact. You saw people going north, and I got to tell you, as a young man, you never knew where they were going. They were all going to a place called L.A. or norte, norte, and you never understood what was the impact in the communities beyond the border. 
   But, seriously, I think the one thing that I would ask those of you that live beyond the border, you do not see on the border, like those of us that grew up there, I happen to have had the privilege to serve as a life guard in a small community on the border called Imperial Beach. In that job, I had the experience of rescuing illegals when they were drowning in the Tijuana River. I recovered their bodies when they did not make it, and in the 1980s, some of you may not remember a thing called the bonsai charges, where the coyotes, the smugglers, would organize illegals into huge groups at the border and rush them up the freeway. 
   I would just ask any of you to consider what your reaction would be if you were driving along at 65 miles an hour, 55, and you saw massive pedestrians running at you on the freeway in a manner that you do not have a chance to stop. Well, let me tell you something. After seeing what happens when somebody gets hit by a vehicle at 55, 60 miles an hour, I became committed as a member of the county board of supervisors in San Diego to finally say stand up and say this is wrong, this is immoral, this is outrageous. 
   Americans should be ashamed that we do not control our frontier, that we do not guarantee our sovereignty on U.S. soil. And the immigration issue is an issue of sovereignty. It is a concept of protecting the land that our forefathers have given to us and also protecting those rights and those privileges that should and can be rendered to those who are citizens and legal residents. 
   But, sadly, we have found excuses to look the other way. Be it political correctness or some sick concept that encouraging illegal activity somehow is going to be good for America, it is sad that we allow not only illegal immigration but all the illegal activity that happens along the border. 
   I am really encouraged, though, to see colleagues like the gentleman from Georgia and Mr. King, people from the interior, that get it, that understand that the immigration problem is not something at the border that can only be addressed at the border, but is something that is in our neighborhoods every day; that it is on the street corners, we see it every day; and that the American people, though they have been ignored on this issue for too long, are saying we are going to hold both parties accountable if you do not address that. 
   I think in all fairness, as a Republican, I think we can all agree that a  degree of the problems in the last election was that voters did not believe Republicans were doing enough and are going to demand that Democrats and Republicans put their partisanship on the side and take care of this problem. 
   I am glad to see the kind of general support that we have seen working on this issue and the community support on this; and at this time, if I may, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield to Mr. King.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. King, first of all, I have to say I am so proud that you are our ranking member on the Immigration Committee. With you on that, leading the Republican side of that committee. Hopefully you will be able, and I know it is a tough sell; I am going to meet with your chairman and try to point out what is the obsession that the Senate and some Members of the House of Representatives have to give amnesty and reward 12 to 13 to 15 million people for breaking the law? 
   Do they really think we can defend the concept, the rule of law, by having up to 60 million people in this country celebrating the fact that they are here because they broke the law? You know, I am thankful that I was able to listen to you tonight, because I keep saying, and I was saying to a couple of Senators this week, what is the obsession, what is the motivation for giving amnesty and rewarding people for breaking our laws? What message have you seen? What agenda are you fulfilling? What political group are you fulfilling? 
   Now that you brought it up, you are right, you point out you gave amnesty to a group that originally was proposed to be 300,000, ended up with all the delays in the agenda to be 3 million; then you get all of their relatives coming in. This is the group that is lobbying and able to vote to encourage more people to come in, and this downward spiral has started. If we don't stop it now with the American people that really believe in the rule of law, that really believe in the concept of common decency that you do not punish somebody for waiting patiently to immigrate legally while you reward somebody who breaks the law, if we are not willing to stop this downward spiral now, it will continue to grow larger and faster down the line. 
   I think the American people here know this is not a Republican or Democratic issue; this is an American issue. If anybody doesn't believe that the rule of law is important, I can take you to a lot of places I spent a lot of time in other countries where people can buy off the law by politics or by money. 
   This amnesty, it just seems like the most un-American concept I heard. Let me tell you something, my son was sitting there, 19 or 20 years old, and he brought up the interesting issue, and I guess from the mouths of babes, he said, Dad, let me get this straight, Mr. Kennedy says that if you break the law for 5 years, you now get rewarded for it? Does this mean that if I am willing to testify that I have driven without a license for 5 years, I get a license for free?     
   Because that is what people think they can do with immigration and make it work. It won't work with the traffic situation; it won't work with an immigration issue. 
   I am glad you bring this up, and just seeing a self-made special interest group that is driving us toward an abyss of the destruction of the entire concept of what this greatest Republic we call the ``American experience.'' I yield to Mr. King.

   Mr. BILBRAY. I thank you for that. Because before the fence, as somebody that grew up down there and watched this game being played, any criminal on either side of the border could jump  across the border and avoid enforcement on the other. Even in Mexico, they had the area called the Zona Norte, the northern zone, and everyone knew that it was a criminal hideout because they could always jump onto the American side if the Mexican officials came. So this issue of creating a barrier is common sense and common decency. 
   As Governor Ruffo of Baja, California, once said, he said something in Spanish and said in Mexico, we have a saying, Good fences make good neighbors. Frankly, I think those people that always attacked the concept of having secure borders should just listen to Ruffo's advice that common sense does go a long way.

   Mr. BILBRAY. I appreciate that. The fact is most Americans may not understand that it is so out of control that they have had over 30 police officers murdered in Tijuana and over nine Federal prosecutors assassinated in Tijuana. In fact, it was so bad that the Mexican government 10 years ago sent their army to the American border. You hear an outcry here when we talk about the possibility of sending our troops or our National Guard down to the border. I wonder where these people are that are so outraged about America exercising our sovereignty, using our resources, when they ignored the fact that Mexico did the right thing by bringing their troops up. 
   I appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your work on this and look forward to working with you. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are talking about border control, but I want to make sure that the American people and everybody recognizes, in your district, the real problem exists that those who hire illegals are the ones who are creating the number one source of illegal immigration. When we talk about the violence at the border, when we talk about people dying, drowning at the border trying to come into this country illegally, the people that are at fault for that are those employers who provide the incentive for people to break our immigration laws and those who are profiteering off illegal immigration, and that is the illegal employers. 
   I would ask you and I would ask every Member of Congress and I would ask everyone who is listening across the United States to take a look at H.R. 98 which is a bill that Silvestre Reyes, a very respected Democrat from El Paso, who is a former Border Patrol agent, and David Dreier, a Republican, former chairman of the Rules Committee, put together working with the men and women who actually have to control our frontier and control immigration, the immigration agents themselves. They put together a bill called H.R. 98, and it is so simple that there is no excuse for anybody not to support it, unless they think that there is an advantage to encourage illegal immigration. 
   In this bill, it says one thing. It says, let's get rid of the 37 different documents that anybody can prove they are legal to be in the country to work. Let's go down to one simple document, a tamper-resistant Social Security card to allow Americans and foreign nationals alike to prove that a Social Security number that they are required by law to provide for employment is actually their number and not one that they have taken or 20 of their buddies have taken from somebody else and are using because they have stolen a Social Security number. One document for any employer to know to check, to be able to verify electronically that whoever is in front of them is qualified to work in the United States. Because it is essential that we give employers a simple, verifiable way of knowing who is legal and who is not legal so that we can do what I think Democrats and Republicans who really care about America can do together and, that is, crack down on the employers who knowingly hire illegals. We all know who they are, we know where they are, and we need to eliminate the excuse for hiring illegals. We need to start cracking down on that. 
   I just ask that when we get into this issue, let's not talk about amnesty, let's not talk about excuses for rewarding people for illegal immigration, let's talk about working together and cracking down on the illegal employers, making it clear that if you want to come to this country and work, then you come here legally, you play by the rules, you get rewarded for that.     
   So, Mr. Speaker, a lot of people may not know, but I am privileged to have a mother who is a legal immigrant who came back to this country back in the 1940s. And as she reminds me so often, everyone who rewards illegal immigration is insulting those immigrants who came here and played by the rules. Anybody who talks about giving amnesty or any reward to those who have violated our immigration law is insulting the hard work, the patience, and the perseverance to be a legal immigrant and everyone who has played by the rules and stayed within the law. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say tonight that every Wednesday night we are going to try as the Immigration Caucus to give a report to the American people about what is going on with the immigration issue. It is something that politicians have ignored for too long, but it is something that the American people are demanding that we finally address if we want to stay in this city representing the people. 
   So tonight I appreciate the time to be able to address this issue.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, the gentlelady from California pointed out rightly that a barrel of oil has come up to $100. But what if I told you of an industry or a group that wanted the consumer to have to pay $330 for a comparable barrel of oil? 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule is protecting an industry and a plot to pick the pockets of the American consumer, while polluting our air. And what I am talking about is the fact that in California today, the Federal Government is mandating that we put an additive into our gasoline. We're being required to have corn ethanol put into our gasoline, what is costing a comparable $6 a gallon. 
   So when someone stands on the floor and says they're outraged at the price of gasoline, let me just ask you, you either have to confront the fact that this rule is protecting a bill that is protecting the picking of our pockets and the polluting of our air with corn ethanol. And everyone knows that it's a sham. They know that it's out there costing more. 
   And those of us that have worked on the air pollution issue, as myself, the California Air Resources Board is telling you, not only don't mandate this stuff, outlaw this stuff. It is polluting our air and costing a comparable $6 a gallon. 
   So I hope the American people remember, when someone stands up here and says, this is a green bill, this bill stinks to high heaven. It's polluting our air and picking our pockets under the guise of protecting the environment and protecting the consumer. 
   The group that is working together to cause this rip-off and this pollution is the United States Congress. The blame goes on both sides. But the majority has the chance now to address this issue. 
   Now I understand those who may have corn producers in their district justifying this kind of action. But what about all of us that don't have that? 
   I ask you today, stand up for the environment, stand up for the consumer, vote against this rule and bring it back without corn subsidies.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak in favor of H.R. 3179, the Local Preparedness Acquisition Act. I am pleased to serve as the original cosponsor of this legislation. I also want thank Congressman TOWNS for his leadership in sponsoring and advancing this important idea. 
   H.R. 3179 will allow State and local governments to purchase homeland security products and services at more reasonable prices by providing them access to the General Services Administration schedules. Following the attacks on September 11, our local and State governments have taken on more responsibility for emergency preparedness and homeland security. With this added responsibility, these local governments need to purchase a wider array of goods and services. 
   Under this legislation, these localities will be able to purchase many products such as access control and perimeter security systems, fire detection and suppression equipment, firefighting clothing and marine craft from the GSA schedules. With this option, the cost of many of these products will be less than the cost of purchasing them from State-approved purchasing lists or the open marketplace, saving these local governments valuable tax dollars. 
   Importantly, this legislation does not impose any requirements on States and localities to utilize the GSA schedules, instead offering an additional voluntary purchasing method. 
   This legislation has strong bipartisan support and was passed out of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee by voice vote. Additionally, it has gained the endorsement of the National Association of Counties and many other outside organizations. 
   Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak in favor of this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILBRAY. I thank the gentleman. It's Solano Beach, California. I know one beach is like the other. I was raised in one, but live in Carlsbad. But I would just like to clarify. 
   This resolution is recognizing the men and women who were fighting on the front line. And I think there are two big advantages we had in San Diego. San Diego County lost over 1,500 homes. Many of those homes could have been saved under all kinds of different theories. But the fact is we had one great advantage that we did not lose more. And it was not just the men and women who were fighting on the line that you saw on television, but it was the men and women who serve in a very unique California experience called the Unified Disaster Council, where San Diego County itself houses the chairman of the county, and every mayor, police chief and fire chief in a system of networks, with a common communications system, with a common planning system toward the local providers who were able to provide the base and the foundation for State and Federal agencies to come in and build upon. And that was essential. 
   And if there was any lesson that I would hope the people of the United States would take from our tragedy that we had in our county was that preparedness starts at the local level, and that you can never expect a State or Federal agency to replace the needed foundation and the networking that you have at the local level. 
   So get your act together locally, communicate and build a system, because a crisis in one way or the other is coming your way. And San Diego, I was very proud, as the former chairman of the Disaster Preparedness Council, I was proud to see how far they have come along and how well they are organized. 
   A lot of people may not know that a lot of the great savings we had, when the fires were moving towards my home in Carlsbad, my mother got the call over her phone through a thing called ``Reverse 911'' that notified her that she was in a warning area, needed to pack up and be ready to leave at a moment's notice. She was assured that if her area was becoming a danger zone, she would be notified by the same phone communication that had told her to prepare for that. This is the kind of local networks that we need to continue to build, not just in California, where we have historically done it through the county system, but throughout this Nation. 
   I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that we also recognize that this infrastructure gave our men and women, the firefighters not just from San Diego County or Southern California, but from the entire State, from the north down to the south, gave us the capability to respond to this crisis in a way that I think those of us in California should be very proud of. 
   The crisis has not passed totally; we still have threats out there. But the fact is I think we can build on building better communication between the Federal, State and local community. But the foundation has been set. And I would invite anyone who is interested in preparing their community for their crisis to try to learn from our mistakes and our successes in California and San Diego so that we can all build for a safer neighborhood. And when we do that preparation, we not only make ourselves safer, we protect those men and women that are firefighters to avoid their exposure to risk by us doing the right thing ahead of the fires.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia for yielding, and Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate you in holding the Chair tonight and thank you very much for the courtesy of allowing us to speak tonight. I appreciate the privilege. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the things that the American people have not only asked, they have demanded, is that the Federal Government live up to its responsibility of defending our neighborhoods from forces from afar that may be entering this country with harm in their hearts and weapons and viciousness in their hands. I think that one of the things that we've really recognized in the past is the review and the oversight of who we allow to come into this country is one of our big responsibilities. 
   Let's face it, it doesn't take an act of Congress for a community to hire a teacher or hire police officers, but it takes an act of Congress and it takes the Federal Government to make sure that the people that are allowed into this country are people that are going to be friendly to us, to help us, to actually add to the quality and security of America rather than threaten it. 
   The visa system has always been sort of the minimum we've done in the past, and the visa waiver actually is an extraordinary concept of saying we are so sure that these countries are so secure and so safe that we're willing to waive the traditional international policy of having people kind of report in and prove that they are who they are and we allow them into the country. 
   And we've allowed this with many countries like Britain, my mother's home country, and Australia, and we've allowed it with many countries. But it's almost as if we've taken this concept that a little is good, a whole bunch must be great, where the political pressure is to expand this program to such a force that there's no counter-balance of saying, no, wait a minute, who's there really checking and keeping a tab on what is reasonable from a security point of view. 
   And I think what's important tonight for us to say is tonight is a way for the Immigration Caucus to sort of push back and balance. And I don't mind people that are wanting to have this waiver expanded, but I do mind that when we do not balance the perception, that those who may for business reasons or for their own special reasons want to throw away the paperwork, throw away the procedure for security and say it'd just be easier to do without it, they can say that but then there should be those of us who are willing to stand up and say, yes, but it's there for a reason and that reason is very important, the protection of our families and our homes and our neighborhoods. And only the Federal Government can provide this protection. 
   Remember, if we allow somebody with harm in their heart to enter this country, there is no defense once they're in this country from gaining access to those neighborhoods, those playgrounds, those schools, those hospitals that we take for granted are protected. 
   Local government cannot check a visa once the United States Federal Government allows them into the country. A county sheriff cannot check a visa once we've allowed them through that port of entry at the airport or at that seaport. 
   So it is incumbent on us that we're extraordinarily vigilant to make sure that only those that we are sure should be in this country are in this country, and it is extremely important that we only allow the waiver process in those extraordinary situations where we can look the American people in the eye and say we really believe this is a safe and prudent way of treating our immigration policy. 
   I think people will say then, well, why is there debate here? And I think that the gentleman from Georgia understands, there's people that want for business reasons, for personal reasons, to have people coming, going from all kinds of different countries, and they have their personal reasons to do that. Some may be profit and some may be convenience, but those reasons and those pressures need to be counter-balanced. 
   And the Federal Government must be reminded again and again that there's not just one agenda here, convenience of people coming into the country. There's not one agenda here, people making money by tourists coming and going. There's not one agenda, just business wanting to be able to have their partners come and go as they want. There is the major agenda that needs to be introduced into the formula, and that is the defense of the communities.

   Mr. BILBRAY. I think the real key there, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that the outcome does matter when you talk about the security of our Nation, and we forget sometimes when we talk about the security of the Nation that we're talking about the security of our neighborhoods and our homes. 
   I had the privilege of serving as mayor and chairman of San Diego County and mayor of a small county on the border, and I know and I think any mayor will tell you that those of us in local government just assume the Federal Government's going to do its part. The trouble is the mayor and the police chiefs and the county sheriffs end up having to take on these responsibilities, and they don't have the right to  do what is the Federal Government's responsibility and, that is, check these documents and make sure that the right type of people are coming into the country. 
   Local government, the mayors, the city council members, the county supervisors, county commissioners, sheriffs, police chiefs, they have to live with the repercussions and the challenges once someone's here, but they don't get the chance to be able to review and approve this. And so that's why it's essential that the Federal Government, which is the only agency that can do this, the one line of defense that we have over inappropriate entry in this country, has to be strong and vigilant and effective.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BILBRAY. Thank you. I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia's kind words, and let me just say that in the words of the former Inspector General of Homeland Security, specifically said that we should be abolishing the waiver system, not expanding it. So, on a minimum, we've got to stop the expansion. 
   I think that it just shows a lack of understanding of just how far the pressure's going to back off on our due diligence when it comes to border security by those people that don't see the big picture, and to think that at this time where we're talking about threats, especially what just happened in England, where somebody who they thought was a safe immigrant, literally drove a fire bomb into the front door of a terminal, if I remember right, and what will happen when we allow somebody to do that? 
   Frankly, I haven't spoke a lot about this, but on 9/11, I was in the immigration commissioner's office the day the plane started crashing into American buildings.     
   I was actually in the office, and we watched the second plane crash into the second tower. That commissioner said, can you imagine being the agents who let these guys into the country. Now, we didn't know who did this. We didn't know who was responsible. We had no idea. 
   But the immigration commissioner had the foresight of saying, my God, somehow I know I am responsible, and you imagine being the agent who personally let these people in. 
   I don't think we think about this, but tightening up and controlling the waiver process is going to be one of the things we have got to do so we don't look back and say, my God, we were warned, we knew this was coming, and why didn't we do more. Why weren't we there to stop this from happening? 
   All I have got to say is that I was out of politics. I was just meeting with them about immigration issues, but I saw the anguish and the frustration in his eyes and his voice realizing that somehow he knew the immigration agency that he was in charge of somehow contributed to this disaster. 
   The fact is, I hope all of us start looking at this as being what are we doing today to make sure that we are not faced off in saying, my God, why didn't I do more. Why didn't I push harder? Why wasn't I the bothersome one that told the administration, I know you are being pressured by these guys, but I am going to pressure you back? I am going to give some balance to the process here in Washington? 
   I think that's all the American people have asked for, a little balance. Again, as the Inspector General said, now is not the time to expand this program. If the President and the administration honestly believes that this country is under a threat, that this country must do extraordinary things to defend our neighborhoods, then the minimum is not to expand this program. 
   I think reasonable people should say the administration, rather than looking into expanding this program, should be looking to reduce it, at least temporarily, and ratcheting down and reducing the opportunities for people to come in here unreviewed. Because for every country, for every person  that we allow in this country that we have not done our due diligence, we are exposing the Nation to that threat, and we are exposing ourselves to a lifetime of regrets that we did not do the right thing by the American people.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Just a couple of weeks ago, the Senate was shocked, the White House was shocked at what they saw was a groundswell from America against a proposal that America rightfully thought was amnesty. They wonder why is there so much animosity against Washington on the immigration issue. 
   It's exactly because of things like the US-Visit system. The American people think that the political leaders of Washington just don't get it and aren't willing to do the heavy lifting. It has been how many years that since, is it 1996, that the US-Visit system was supposed to be implemented. It still hasn't been implemented. Now we have people at a point where they say let's just forget about it. 
   This is much like the commitments and promises, much like building the fence that the American people have heard so many promises and seen their promises broken so often that they assume this town just does not care or, worse, has been enticed by whatever forces for whatever reason not to do the right thing. 
   I think when it comes down to developing confidence on the immigration issue, the American people are saying, before you ask us to trust you one more time, we want you to prove to us that you deserve to be trusted. 
   Go back to the things that you have been promising us for 20 years and do those, get your House in order and take care of it. Things like finish the visit system to where you know who has come into the country and who has gone out of the country. Without that, both, you don't know who stayed in the country. 
   What's your excuse, Washington? Why are you doing all of these other things that everybody talks about? You can talk about health care. It doesn't take an act of Congress to hire a doctor. It does take an act of Congress to stop a terrorist from crossing the border. 
   I want to say that it was very scary in February that the Senate was actually looking at expanding the visa waiver. Frankly, I was very proud of one move my Senators, Senator Feinstein, for standing up and saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, we are going a little faster. I want to thank her for that. 
   It's important that we have bipartisan effort here. The American people are tired of both parties finding excuses and not doing the right thing. They want both parties working together to protect their neighborhoods. When a neighborhood gets blown up, it's Democrats, Republicans and independents whose lives are at stake. 
   It doesn't draw political lines where the threat is. 
   Frankly, the issue of being able to address these commonsense things like implementing the US-Visit system, to implement or reduce the impact of the waiver system is something that we need to work together. I want to publicly thank Senator Feinstein for standing up on that issue. I think that we need to push more on that. 
   But this one right now is that if we can't get the visit system in, what are we doing expanding the visa waiver? That's an extraordinary, extraordinary challenge. 
   Again, this is why the American people are saying, I don't understand it. How can you ask me to trust you with another law that could be 300 or 1,000 pages when you haven't taken care of the promises you have made over the last 20 years?

   Mr. BILBRAY. I appreciate that. And, Mr. Speaker, when we talk about a visa and we talk about a proposal to go to a $10 visa processing fee, I go to Latin America on most of my family's casual time; it is kind of the untold story that the chairman of the Immigration Caucus spends so much time in Latin America. But they charge $10 for a visa and you go through a process down there. And as a visitor, I don't feel put upon to participate in their security in places like El Salvador or Nicaragua or Mexico. But here, when you talk about these countries that are under the visa, you are talking about some of them with massive amounts of immigration. So somebody could come in from Iran, immigrate to Australia, like I said, my mother's former country, could immigrate from 
   Morocco into France, and then once they get their citizenship in that country then use that citizenship as being a free ride into the United States. So in reality, because immigration has become so fluid and nationalization of foreign nationals has become so easy in so many countries, that the issue of allowing some countries to be exempt from review and oversight and others not really are becoming antiquated, and we  need to get back there. If you do not want a terrorist coming in from the West Bank, going through France and coming into this country, then we have to review everyone who comes into this country. 
   So, in reality, we should be reducing the visa waiver, because we are not talking about people who have come from those countries, born in those countries, and have long term loyalty to those countries. We are also talking about people who have moved to those countries and might have moved there just a few years ago with the intention of getting their citizenship or getting legal residency to use that residency for the next move. And I think the doctors that tried to kill so many in England this last few months is an example that we really do have to be careful how we get it. Who would have thought that doctors from England could be terrorists. History has proven that those assumptions are wrong. And how many other assumptions are we making today that could be proven wrong in a much more graphic way? 
   I appreciate the chance, Mr. Speaker, for your patience of allowing us to address you here tonight and the American people here tonight, and I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his leadership on this issue. And I do thank the Georgia delegation for standing so strong and so firm and defending our national sovereignty and defending our neighborhoods by standing strongly for immigration control and proper regulation.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, I want to say I appreciate the bipartisan support for the concept that people should not be rewarded for breaking our immigration laws. I appreciate the ranking member and the chairman agreeing on this. 
   I would just ask both of you to take a look at the leadership that the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Shuler) has made with a piece of legislation that I feel should be the enforcement part of this direction, and that is that the e-verification be used before people benefit from public funds. That is a very simple system to allow anyone to check that Social Security numbers and names match. It's not an onerous check system to use, and it is one that many of us are looking forward to not only Federal Government but all employers using in the future. 
   I just ask that you consider the fact that to fulfill the intent of this motion, that the e-verification specifically try to be considered here as the vehicle that before anyone gets these benefits that we check that they are legally here as verified by the e-verification. 
   If anybody has any questions about that, I am sure Congressman Shuler can brief you extensively on it. But it is sort of the consensus of most of us working on these issues that this is a simple, clear way to allow everyone, including those who are providing public benefit, the assurance that those benefits are not going to somebody who's not qualified to be able to provide it. 
   So I would raise that as a discussion, that the e-verification be used to verify this motion.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, FDR made a statement about why he was giving aid to England to fight Nazi Germany, and that statement was, when your neighbor's home is burning, only a fool would not let them borrow your hose to put out the fire. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, our border is burning. Mexico is in flames with violence. We are not taking on a war on drugs down at the border; we are taking on the battle against narco-terrorism. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have taken a lot of positions about the fact that the boarders are out of control, but now is the time the American people have to wake up and this Congress has to wake up and realize that the people in Mexico are fighting desperately for their republic. They are being murdered in the streets. Police chiefs on the day they do a press conference stating that they caught a cartel smuggling drugs into San Diego County through a tunnel, the day that they do that press conference, that night that police chief is murdered by the cartel. The head of their law enforcement, who is comparable to our FBI, was murdered in their capital. 
   You may say, but is Mexico doing enough? I have a lot of disagreements with Mr. Calderon. The justification for ignoring the cartel when they smuggle aliens is one of them. But the same cartel that is smuggling aliens and drugs into the United States are killing law enforcement and judges and politicians in Mexico. 
   And do not think that this is a problem far away from us. This problem is in our front yard, in our backyard, in our lap right now. Washington can ignore it, but they are already starting to kidnap and kill people in San Diego County in the south. We have an obligation to make sure that we fight this battle on Mexican soil before it becomes a battle in the main streets of the United States. 
   I ask us to join now. The fact is if there is anything that we can do, we need to defend our American freedom and our security when and where we find the threat, and the threat today is in Mexico. Calderon has been brave enough to export criminals to the United States. He has judges being killed right and left down there. Mexico is willing to work with us on this and desperately asking for our help, and only a fool would not give them the help to fight the battle on Mexican soil before we are fighting it on U.S. soil.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Madam Chairman, I would like to thank and congratulate the gentlelady from the great State of Texas for this amendment. As she knows, it really reflects a strategy that has worked since 2000 when we did the original bill. And I want to thank her as the original author of this bill. 
   And with this amendment, it brings in that cooperative effort between the local government and the Federal Government. Both the gentlelady from Texas and my background show that that kind of cooperative effort has been essential for the success of the BEACH bill for these last 7 years, 8 years now. 
   The bill really does, with the amendment, talk about the fact that the best people to take care of the local environment are the local people, that Washington needs to be here supporting and encouraging local people to take control of their own environment. 
   I think of the old statement that we used back in the sixties and seventies of ``acting locally.'' It was essential for any success that we're going to have with environmental activities. This bill actually builds on that success that we have had in the past. 
   A note of personal interest, Madam Chairman, is that you never know when and how your own legislation may affect you. And as the author of this bill from 2000, it was interesting to see that when my children were on the computer, they were not just checking out the water quality and if the beaches were open. They were also looking at real-time cameras to see how the surf was that day. How we would have loved to have had that in the sixties when we were growing up that you could actually look out on the water to see not only how good the surf was, but to also see how clean the water was. And with this bill, that is possible. 
   And so I appreciate the amendment by the gentlelady from Texas. I strongly support it. And hopefully we will be able to get this bill back to the President and get it signed as soon as possible.

   Mr. BILBRAY. Madam Chairman, this is an amendment that we've worked out with Chairman Oberstar and the gentlelady from Texas. It is really an implementation for the new step for the BEACH bill, and that is to go beyond the existing system we used in the last 7 years where public health officials have to wait 3 days to be able to know if a beach has a water quality problem or does not. 
   Scientists all over the world have been working on what is very close to a real-time response to this concern and be able to empower our local health officials to be able to know, within a few hours, rather than a few days, if it is safe for water contact activity along our beaches. 
   My amendment just simply allows the administration to do a study within the next 2 years to be able to develop the system that local governments can use to implement the BEACH bill so we don't have to wait 3 days in New Jersey or 3 days in California to know if our beaches are polluted or if they are clean. 
   With this study, with cooperation between the Federal Government, the local governments and the private sector, we can actually make this system effective so our children and our families know if it is safe to go in that day and not have to wait 3 days to find out if there is a problem. 
   So, Madam Chairman, my amendment 13 stands. I would ask for support for it. And I think in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation that this bill has carried since the year 2000, I think we can move forward with a system that keeps our families safe and our waters clean.

   Mr. Speaker, the history of man is measured on a timeline of exploration, and for Walter Schirra, it was his life. Pushing the limits of discovery, determined to work harder and go farther than anyone before him, Wally had the distinction of being the fifth American in space and the third American in orbit on an adventure that includes six circlings of the globe that lasted more than 9 hours. 
   He led a lifetime built on breaking barriers, laying the groundwork for future lunar landings. On December 15, 1965, he piloted the Gemini 6 in what was to be the first attempted rendezvous by two-manned spacecraft in space. Three years later, in October of 1968, he concluded his third and final mission when he was launched as commander of Apollo 7, the first manned Apollo mission. This flight made Commander Schirra the only Mercury astronaut to fly aboard Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spacecrafts. 
   His lifetime of achievement also included a decorated record of service in the United States military. In Korea, he flew 90 combat missions and was credited with downing at least one MIG fighter. His courage and valor was eventually recognized with three distinguished flying crosses, two air medals and two NASA Distinguished Service Medals and induction into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. 
   While he was remembered most for his contributions in the United States space program, Wally also made tremendous strides in advancing the efforts of the Reuben H. Fleet Aerospace Museum in San Diego. 
   While he was no longer to venture out into outer space, Wally took off on his 35-foot sailboat. I guess he figured if the skies were no longer available to him, he would instead canvass the oceans. 
   Astronaut ``Wally'' Schirra will always have a place in our Nation's history, an inspiring figure of humble beginnings with daring dreams, a pioneer of our space program who helped the United States win the race against the Soviet Union in the space race. 
   While we mourn the loss of this remarkable man, we should celebrate his great life of achievements. We can rest assured that his legacy will be long felt by many generations yet to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILBRAY. (HONORING THE LIFE OF SENIOR BORDER PATROL AGENT LUIS A. AGUILAR -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, Agent Aguilar, like myself, was born and raised on the border. He knew the challenges that faced the border. He understood the risks, and sadly, his life, as documented, was the price he paid for out-of-control borders. 
   I just hope that everyone today, when they vote on this bill and support this bill, recognizes that for all too long Border Patrol agents have not only faced the threat of life-and-death situations along the border while they're enforcing our laws, protecting our neighborhoods, and protecting the lives of illegal immigrants crossing the border every day. A story that's not told enough about when somebody crossing the border illegally needs to be saved while they're dying in the desert, drowning in rivers, being attacked by coyotes, it's the Border Patrol agents who are the last straw of survival for so many of these illegals. 
   Border Patrol Aguilar proved his loyalty to America with his life, and sadly, I just ask all of us to remember that there are Aguilars up and down the border, north and south, all over this country, doing a tough job and, frankly, not getting very much credit, in fact, getting attacked personally and viciously just because they're doing the tough job that the American people want. 
   I just hope that we understand that our job today is to recognize the sacrifice of the Aguilar family and remember that when Mrs. Aguilar passed away after finding out about her son, I'm sure she would want to send a message of do what you can, Congress, to make sure my other son is safe, protected, and well-provided for in his duties of serving the American people. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I'd ask that we recognize the service of not only Agent Aguilar but his mother, his brother, and his entire family, and by doing that, let's be brave enough to send them the resources, both in physical equipment and in the proper laws, that the Border Patrol agents have been asking us to do for a long time so that they do not have to continue to function in this killing zone that we call the border area. 
   And so I ask strongly the Democrats and Republicans to join together and let's do what we can to avoid this situation in the future. That may mean taking some hits from our friends about building fences or cracking down on illegal employers, doing all those things that we have not done enough in the past, and that, Mr. Speaker, would truly be a good recognition of the service of Agent Aguilar and an appropriate memorial by this Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. BILBRAY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Speaker, in the 230-year history of our country, the United States has fought in conflicts both at home and abroad that have tested the resolve and unity of the American people. During that time, the purview of the Commander in Chief has justly been scrutinized and questioned. These debates are a part of our past and will be a part of our future as long as we send our men and women into battlefields to fight for our country.  
   Today's debate is no exception. The question we must answer for ourselves is a fundamental one that speaks not to our approval of the War in Iraq but rather to our commitment to the men and women fighting this war. It is a commitment we must reaffirm without question or doubt. With commitment and unity. 
   Now it seems to me that we have two courses of action we can take regarding the War in Iraq. We can pull our troops out immediately and leave the stability of the region up to an increasingly violent insurgency, thereby admitting defeat, or we can send in further reinforcements to work with Iraqi Security Forces to seize control of their country. 
   We can all agree that a change in the status quo must be made. With an increased level of violence between Sunni and Shia insurgent groups, an escalating cost, and the loss of American lives, it is imperative that we have a legitimate and substantive debate on the direction of this war. 
   However, if we are to succeed in Iraq and complete the mission, then the United States House of Representatives should not waste its time debating a nonbinding resolution criticizing the Commander in Chief. This resolution offers no real policy alternatives for Iraq and does not bring our men and women home any sooner. It is a political shot aimed at the President, but it is really our troops who suffer most from these grandstanding tactics. 
   I recently visited Walter Reed Hospital to hear from the wounded who have been to Iraq and sacrificed so much for their country. I talked to a wounded soldier who had a bone infection that prohibited him from returning to Iraq. He was not concerned about his physical well-being but instead he was upset that he could not go to finish the job that he had started. His feelings reflected the thoughts of many of the soldiers that I had the privilege to sit and talk with that day. 
   The fact is we face a moment of unparalleled opportunity to, in voice, in one vote, fulfill our promise to our troops--the promise that we will give them the resources, the armor, the manpower and reinforcements they need so that they may safely and effectively win the War on Terror and come back home.
