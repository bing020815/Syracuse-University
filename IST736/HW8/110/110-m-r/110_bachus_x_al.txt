<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of the bipartisan economic stimulus package, and let me share with the Members a conversation I had yesterday. 
   I traveled to New York City, and there I met with 20 to 25 of the financial leaders of our country. The executives were from some of the largest banks and other lending institutions, insurance companies, in America. And almost to the person they told me that they had been talking to businesses all over the United States, and the message they continue to get from the majority of those business leaders is our business is good, we're making the money, we are receiving new orders, we want to expand, we want to hire people, we want to invest in new equipment, we want to invest in new technology. But we're holding back because we hear that things are getting worse, we hear that things may get worse, we're reading that in the newspaper, and we're not sure. 
   So I believe that what we have here in America today, and let's not minimize the problems. I'm going to speak about the housing market in a minute, and as Chairman Frank said, I'll not minimize the difficulties that we have in the housing market or subprime, but let me say to the Members, let's not talk ourselves and the American people into a recession. And I'm not saying that any of us are. This is not directed at any Member. I say it this way: I want to encourage the Members and all Americans to have confidence in this country, have confidence in our market, because I will tell you that people in New York that are looking out there in America are saying that a lot of businesses are good, they want to invest, they want to hire people. 
   So part of what I think is so good about this stimulus package is that I believe it will encourage people to have confidence. It will encourage people to invest or spend. 
   The Financial Services Committee, as Chairman Frank said, was responsible for the housing portion of the stimulus package, and I will direct some statements to those portions in a minute. 
   Before I do, I want to add a few words in strong support of the tax cuts contained in this stimulus package, and they are tax cuts. The stimulus package that we're considering today recognizes the basic economic reality that getting money back in the hands of people who earned it is the best way to help our economy. 
   The tax element of this package has been called a rebate, but in essence, it's a tax cut, a tax cut for millions of low- and middle-income Americans, those who need it the most, those with a moderate income. 
   I believe this will be immediate tax relief for hardworking taxpayers, and the improvement into our economy that always results from allowing taxpayers to decide how their hard-earned money will be spent will be beneficial. 
   Some have said not all Americans will spend this money. Some will save it. I think our answer to that ought to be, yes, some will spend it, most economists tell us that the vast majority. Some will save it, but that's their choice, not our choice. That's America. I am confident that whether they save it, whether they spend it, whether they pay down their bills, whether they invest as businesses will in new equipment, that it will all be good for America. 
   Hopefully, it will stimulate not only the economy but it will also prompt my colleagues to enact additional tax cuts in the future and make the Bush tax cuts that have worked so well permanent. 
   It is widely recognized that the troubled housing market is a significant contributor to the current downturn in our economy. It is not contributing to our economy as it has in the past. We all know housing prices are down. This stimulus package includes several provisions designed to address that lack of liquidity, that weak market in certain segments of the mortgage market. The bill increases, but only on a temporary basis, the loan limits that apply to mortgages that can be purchased by the housing GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, and by ensuring that the Federal Housing Administration and those that are insured by the Federal Housing Administration, most people refer to as FHA, it will increase the size of those mortgages and mortgages that they can insure and offer. 
   Greater availability of higher-cost mortgages and FHA-insured loans will help get prospective homebuyers off the sidelines and into the housing market. We're hearing that today from the national Realtors. In those markets, there have been price declines. In some they have been particularly severe. 
   This legislation will assist existing homeowners to refinance loans that they're struggling with. It will also allow those who want to buy and are on the sidelines now to begin making offers and to restore our housing market.     
   The combined changes, I believe, will help restore confidence to our economy, and we need that confidence. The higher GSE and FHA loan limits, like the other provisions of the package, are both targeted and temporary, they expire at the end of this year, thereby addressing the concerns of those who fear that expanding the eligibility for the GSEs and FHA loan products will unduly increase Federal housing subsidies. I share those concerns. 
   While I would have preferred that the increases be implemented as part of a comprehensive GSE and FHA reform, I'm encouraged, very encouraged, by the commitments that Chairman Frank and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee have made to us that achievement of those broader reforms in the GSEs and FHA are a priority for them, also, and that achievement of those broader reforms will be among the highest priorities of this congressional session. I look forward to that important work. 
   As the GSEs purchase larger mortgages and take on more risk, it is incumbent that this Congress produce legislation that creates a world-class  regulator for these enterprises and fully protects U.S. taxpayers. We have heard from both the Treasury Secretary and the President about the need for this reform. This House has passed legislation making that reform law. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to follow our example. 
   Let me close by saying the bottom line, I believe, is we must not only take the measures we do today, which are going to offer real solutions, but also do whatever we can to increase and encourage optimism among Americans. That's what we need. Hope has been mentioned very often in this Presidential campaign. Our message needs to be to the American people that our economy is strong. There are businesses that are ready to hire, ready to invest, ready to buy new technology. There is a legitimate reason for optimism today, and we should promote that optimism. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by commending President Bush, Chairman Frank, Chairman Rangel, Ranking Member McCrery, and all the Republican and Democratic leadership of the House for coming together so quickly for this stimulus package. There is hope for America. There is reason for optimism. This package, I believe, will contribute to that optimism and that hope. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Speaker, let me say this to the membership on both sides. I believe that we've come together in a bipartisan way to pass this legislation today because we have confidence in America. We have confidence in the American people. We believe the American people have a right to have confidence. 
   And I would say whether we're Members or Americans, I would say to all of us, you have every reason to have confidence in this country. You have every reason to have confidence in the workers of this country, their innovative ability and their ability to produce and compete in the world economy. You have every reason to be confident in the American economic system.     
   That's the message that I heard in New York City from many institutions that said they had money to loan. There are companies out there who are making money, that want to hire people, that want to build new plants, that want to expand, that want to buy equipment, that want to invest in new technology, but because of what they read in the paper, not because of their balance sheet, but because of what they're hearing is that things may get worse, there is a lack of confidence out there. I don't believe that it is entirely justified. 
   This country has challenges. This economy has weaknesses, and we've talked about those. But our underlying fundamental economic system and our financial system is sound. And I hope by us today joining together in a bipartisan way to pass this legislation we'll be saying to the American people, your Congress has confidence in you and the economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, as one of the original authors of the first TRIA legislation back in 2002, which passed this House with a strong vote, and also as a supporter of the extension in 2005, which I also cosponsored, I am disappointed that I have to rise today in opposition to the present bill. But I do so sincerely. 
   The whole idea of TRIA, the 2002 bill, the 2005 extension, was to create a short-term government backstop which would allow the insurance industry, the private market to adjust to the 9/11 reality. 
   By any objective measure, people on both sides of the aisle have said TRIA has been a success. Secretary Hank Paulson supported a TRIA which was a government backstop as the government continued to process the stepping back. 
   The terrorist insurance markets have stabilized. We have heard this debate, this word today of the gentleman from New York and the leadership and the Democratic Party and some of their differences. Even in correspondence which I have seen, he said terrorist insurance, the approach we have has been working. It is giving us insurance. The markets have stabilized. Policyholders are requesting and they are receiving coverage. Prices have declined. Reinsurance has become more available. The private marketplace is diversifying, and it is absorbing additional risk exposure every day. 
   This past July, Secretary Paulson, which, as I said, he supported TRIA, he doesn't support this legislation because it essentially preempts the private market. But he made this statement to me: It is my belief that the most efficient, lowest cost, and most innovative methods of providing terrorist risk insurance will come from the private sector. 
   I agree, and it is therefore that reason that I must oppose the bill before us today, because it works at cross-purposes with that whole philosophy of allowing a temporary backstop as the private market fills in and meets the need for terrorist risk insurance. 
   We presently have a TRIA program in place that relies on that private sector first and the government only as a backstop and, as I said, it is working very well. It is effectively creating what is a temporary assistance or a hand up, not a permanent handout. However, this bill replaces what has been a successful and temporary mechanism which has worked so well to allow the insurance marketplace to adopt to the 9/11 realities. It replaces it with legislation that, instead of scaling back the Federal backstop, it expands it greatly. It increases the government growth greatly. It increases taxpayers' exposure tremendously, so much so that we are not going to pay for it here today. We are going to disregard PAYGO. And I understand there is some private deal that may have been agreed to out of the public domain and unknown to Members. That is not how legislation should function. But it is a flawed bill that is, unfortunately, a departure from what has heretofore been a very successful bipartisan consensus effort on behalf of this Congress that we have all come together and adopted in the past. 
   TRIA should not be a partisan issue. Our division on this legislation reflects a philosophical difference and disagreement over how, how much and for how long middle-class America should subsidize the cost of terrorist insurance for both insurers and for urban developers.     
   And what is the taxpayer role? 
   I had hoped that we could consider a number of important amendments today to scale back these new Federal subsidies; i.e., taxpayer-supported guaranteed benefits. I had hoped that we could ask that the insurance companies pay a greater percentage; that they collect an increased amount. Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership has decided not to even allow a fair and free debate on these amendments. 
   The expanded Federal subsidies provided for in this bill are so expensive that they violate the House's budget rules. But, as I said, instead of admitting this violation, or even waiving it, which would be a more honest approach, or finding a way to pay for the costs to the taxpayers, the majority has turned to what I call a ``fantasy fix'' that mandates various terrorist coverage, but removes any certainty in the Federal payment.  
   Even the most ardent proponents of TRIA are opposed to this so-called solution to the PAYGO problem. One Democratic colleague that's on the floor today has made this statement which I associate myself with: ``Making the entire program contingent on Congress passing a second piece of legislation completely undermines the intent and desired effect of the legislation.'' He went on to say, and I quote, ``It would render the legislation almost completely useless.'' That's the legislation we have before us. That's it. That's what we're considering today. 
   We heard as we debated the rule that there have been some assurances given in a letter which none of us have seen from the majority leader to the Member that they're going to fix this, that they're going to fix it in conference. We're just asked to take a leap of faith. To me, that violates not only the promises that the Democratic majority made in this campaign to have an open, honest process with full disclosure, not back-room agreements. We don't even know what we're voting on. We're told, vote for something on blind faith. It'll be fixed. Yes, it's flawed. Yes, it won't work. Yes, we know we're not paying for it, but we'll do that later. Trust us. 
   You know, it's one thing to ask Members of Congress, it's another thing to ask the American people for their representatives to pass something they have no idea entirely what it is; to act on the assurance of a letter that 433 Members have not seen, surely not the 210 in the minority. 
   Policyholders are also shortchanged in this legislation. If an insurance company's losses exceed a certain level, the new bill that Members saw for the first time last night says that the consumer gets no more money until a later Congress acts, regardless of what the insurance policy says or what the company agreed to pay. In other words, they're writing a policy, the company is agreeing to pay a certain amount, but all of it is contingent upon Congress then coming in and paying for it. I'm not sure that's even constitutional, that we as a legislative body would say, go out and write insurance policies, tell policyholders this is their coverage, and another legislative body, 5, 10, 15 years down the road, they'll come in and they'll pay for it. How do we know that? What will the policy read? It will be interesting to see what the policy says. All this is contingent upon an act of Congress. How about all of this is contingent upon the ability of the United States to write such a check, or the willingness of the people to do that? What if these policies are extended and then we have a new Congress and that Congress says ``no''? The policyholders have paid for something and they have no assurance they'll ever receive a dime. 
   While I am a strong supporter of what has to this date been the approach of Congress for short-term extensions of this program that continues down the road of phasing out the government backstop, the taxpayer funding, and phases in greater private sector participation, and by private sector participation, I simply mean that those who are provided the coverage pay for the coverage, not someone in rural Kansas or New Mexico or Georgia, but that who's getting the benefit pays the price, not the American people. 
   I cannot support this bill. It extends the program for 15 years, in other words, more or less basically permanent. It writes a blank check, asks the taxpayers to pay it, but doesn't pay for it now. It makes no provisions for paying for it, other than a letter from the majority leader to a member of the New York delegation saying, in a month or two, we know this is a flawed bill, it's a no go, but we'll fix it. But vote for it right now. I cannot do that. I cannot ask the Members of the minority to do that. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me just say in closing that Members on this side of the aisle are prepared and we have been prepared to strongly support an extension of the TRIA program that is fiscally responsible, that does the right thing for taxpayers. But we're not going to vote for something we have no idea what we have, other than an assurance in a letter we have not seen. 
   While we have complete bipartisan agreement on the merits of the current TRIA program, we know that in the aftermath of 9/11 there was a need to act. We acted. We've been successful. Let's not change something that's proven to work well with a blank check from the taxpayers. This bill is a gimmick. It increases government subsidies without providing greater certainty in the marketplace. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

You will notice that some of the absences were the Consumer Federation of America, which said that this bill was not good for consumers, i.e. taxpayers. The National Taxpayers Association obviously wasn't on that list, because it is a great deal for the insurance companies, and we all acknowledge that. It merely subsidizes them at the expense of taxpayers. The one name missing is taxpayers. They will pay for this legislation.

   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Chairman, throughout this debate, the Bear  Stearns matter has been invoked by Members of the majority who have called forth the bailout of the Bear Stearns counterparties, not of Bear Stearns but of the counterparties, as a reason to bail out lenders in this case. And basically, what they said time and time again, my colleagues, many of them my friends in the majority, they have said, You Republicans had no problem when the Federal Reserve bailed out Bear Stearns. Now, although you had no problem with that $30 billion, you've got a big problem with the $15 billion under the gentlewoman, the chairman of the subcommittee from California. You have got a big problem with this $15 billion. In fact, that's not the case. I would like to clarify what I think is a misconception. 
   Immediately following the Bear Stearns, whether you call it a bailout or intervention, it was a $30 billion potential loss to the American taxpayers, I agree with the gentlelady from California. One of our Members, and I think it shows the importance that one Member can make a difference, and that Member was Representative Scott Garrett from New Jersey. Representative Garrett immediately penned a letter to Chairman Frank, and I commend Chairman Frank; he gave a very prompt response to that letter. But in that letter, Scott Garrett raised some questions. 
   One of the questions was, Should we use taxpayers' money or expose taxpayers to laws to intervene in these situations. He wrote a very carefully crafted letter. He said, I have serious concerns about this, serious concerns about the taxpayer standing behind a $29 billion guarantee. I think these are extraordinary actions that we're taking, and we ought to have a full investigation. 
   Now, that letter was signed by 17 Members of this body. Now, who were those Members? Were they the Democratic Members who are expressing concerns tonight? Let's see. 
   There was Scott Garrett; there was Spencer Bachus, yours truly; there was Don Manzullo from Illinois, I believe he is a Republican; Walter Jones from North Carolina. I congratulate Walter on his fine victory last night. Michele Bachmann, she is a Minnesota Republican; Ginny Brown-Waite, she's from Florida, she's a Republican; Randy Neugebauer, vice chairman of our side, or vice ranking member; Tom Feeney, last time I checked he was a Republican unless he switched parties. Tom Price. Is there any debate among any of us that he's a very conservative Republican? Ron Paul. Now there's a debate. There's a debate. He may not be a Republican; he may be a Libertarian; certainly not a Democrat. Mr. Putnam, member of the Republican leadership. Thad McCotter. He signed his name. We had to do some investigation. He really used his chicken scratch here, but we've identified him as Thad McCotter after some investigation. Mr. Hensarling. Boy, that's a conservative Republican. Mr. Pearce from New Mexico; Jeff Davis, Kentucky; Judy Biggert, esteemed subcommittee ranking member, and Dean Heller. 
   Seventeen Members, all Republicans, who express real concerns. And I do want to congratulate the chairman of the full committee, because he almost responded yes, we need to look into this; we need to have hearings. He did say, I don't think it's necessary to do it at this time. I think we can postpone it because we need to talk about something that's quite different, and that's the foreclosure prices. 
   But tonight on this floor, the Democrats have linked the two as bailouts. 
   Let me tell you what the chairman said. The chairman of the full committee, and I agree with him, I think he's absolutely right. He said we should check into this matter because when you use taxpayer money to guarantee something, here is what he said, ``It sets a precedent that could lead to future instances of companies ..... expecting the same assistance.'' A precedent that could lead to future instances of companies expecting the same assistance. And we shouldn't obligate the taxpayers to make those sort of expenditures because people will begin to think that they will be bailed out. 
   Absolutely what we face tonight. Madam Chairman, Members of this body, we are creating an expectation tonight on this floor by bailing out irresponsible speculators and lenders. 
   I thank the Chairman.

   Mr. BACHUS. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   And responding to the chairman, first of all, I would say the letter that came back to Mr. Garrett from the chairman expressed the chairman's opinion that he had much more confidence in this bailout than the Republican Members. 
   But secondly, he pointed out only 17 Members. In fact, that is the majority of the Financial Services Committee, and as Mr. Garrett asked earlier of the majority party, how many Democrats signed a letter demanding an investigation into the Bear Stearns matter? The response was none. All Members that have publicly in writing demanded an investigation were Republican Members, the majority of the Financial Services Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Vermont, who is leading the debate of the opposition, I would like to appeal to the gentleman from Vermont. 
   Our constituents today are under a lot of stress because of the high cost of energy, gasoline prices, heating bills this winter. And Vermont, and I congratulate Vermont. Seventy-three percent of their electricity is powered by nuclear energy. Seventy-three percent. That compares to 19 percent in all other States. So I congratulate y'all. 
   Nuclear energy is a source of very cheap energy, very cheap electricity. It could really wean us off our dependency on foreign oil. I would appeal to the Vermont delegation, both Mr. Sanders, Senator Sanders, yourself, we need more nuclear power plants. And we would just urge our representatives from Vermont to stop voting ``no'' and allowing other States to have a source of low-cost energy. So just on a personal basis, I'd appeal to you. 
   Now we find ourselves in a very serious situation, a crisis--it's not too strong a word--in America. We have high food prices. We have high energy prices. And many of our citizens are under stress in paying their mortgages. Fifty-four million American families make a mortgage payment each month. An additional 34 million American families make a rent payment every month. I would say that a great percentage of those are under stress. There's 25 million Americans who own their own home or don't have a mortgage, and some of them are under stress. 
   Now we all agree that foreclosures are serious. They're bad for the community. But we fundamentally disagree in how we address the problem. I, for one, most of my colleagues, say let's not take from the 34 million American families who are renting, let's not take their tax dollars. Let's not take from the 51 million American families who are paying a mortgage payment. Many of them struggling under high gas prices, high food prices. Let's not take from those other 25 million American families who don't have a mortgage on their home, let's not take from them and reward lenders who unwisely extended credit, because that's what this bill is about. It's not about benefiting borrowers because the guarantee doesn't go to borrowers. It goes to lenders. 
   Three years ago we started an effort to rein in subprime lending abuses, and the lenders came before us and they lobbied and they killed our efforts to bring some structure and some control over the mortgage market. They said, thanks but no thanks. You stay out. 
   But, now, now that the chickens have come home to roost, they've come back in and said, bail us out. And they're turning to 110 million American families and saying, we need $300 billion. These are speculators. Many of them speculated. Many of them are investors on Wall Street who bought high-risk, high-yield, structured investment vehicles containing these mortgages. And now they're saying, we're in trouble. And they're saying, we want to offload these bad loans on to the government. 
   And we'll decide today whether we take from 110 million American families, take their hard-earned money, and we bail out these lenders and these speculators, many of which are guilty of criminal, fraudulent acts. They trapped people into these loans, and when the loans have become illiquid, they've asked for the taxpayers to come in and stand behind it. 
   This program is, and y'all have said to us, or you have said, it's a voluntary program. Absolutely, it's voluntary. The lender can choose which loans he offloads on the Federal Government. Which loans will he offload? He'll offload his bad loans. He'll offload the very worst of the loans.     
   And the American taxpayers, those I represent who are making those rent payments, who are making those mortgage payments, and don't assume that those 51 million American families who are making their mortgage payment, don't assume they're not under stress. When you say, We're going to share the pain, why would you ask a renter or an American family that's paying their bills to share the pain? They have enough pain.

Let me introduce into the Record a letter that 16 Republicans, including myself and Scott Garrett, sent to Chairman Frank asking for hearings on the Bear Stearns matter and his response in which he said that he had much greater confidence in the decision to fund the bailout of the counterparties of Bear Stearns. So the chairman at that time expressed his support, and we expressed our concern.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me commend the chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It's been a pleasure working with Congressman Adam Smith on this legislation, and I commend you, Adam. 
   This is a bipartisan bill with a goal that should bring all of us together. And that goal is the reduction of extreme poverty and to make that reduction of extreme poverty a foreign policy priority for the United States. 
   Today, in dozens of poor countries all over the world, little boys and girls are born into poverty, disease, and hunger. Hopelessness and despair are their daily companions. Their burdens are day-to-day; they're painful and they're heavy. 
   In debating debt relief, I quoted Sister Rebecca Trujillo. She was asked,  How do they make it? How do they get through the day? Her answer was: ``How do they survive? Since being in Nicaragua I have taken to answer in a matter of fact way. Often they do not. Often they do not survive the day.'' 
   Each day, even on our bad days, and we're fond of saying we've had a really bad day, but we ought to be reminded that for billions of people throughout the world, that even on our worst days, we have more food, more shelter, more clothes, more security, more health care, more of everything than our poor brothers and sisters have on their best days. 
   And, finally, a lot of people said, well, the reality is overwhelming. Half the world lives on $2 a day. But we can make a difference and we can do so at a very small cost. 
   We've had successes. We have made a difference. Debt relief has been a success. It has improved the lives of millions of people for almost no monetary cost to this country. Since the Millennium Development Goals were set 7 years ago, the poverty rate in sub-Saharan Africa is down 6 percent. There are more children receiving health care, in fact, over a million more children in that area alone, and medical treatment. Vaccinations are up throughout Africa. The percentage of students enrolled in primary schools has gone up considerably. 
   So, in closing, let me simply say this: cost should never be the overriding consideration. But when we consider cost, and doing the right thing is the imperative, but when we consider the cost, let us realize that the cost of not acting is not only hopelessness and unrest throughout the world, but is also terrorism and confrontation and wars that can be avoided if these programs work.     
   Global poverty is in our economic interest. It is in our national security interest as well. This bill will focus our battle against global poverty, and it is a powerful statement that Americans are committed to making this world a better place for all.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1227, GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Speaker, I have come down here this morning not to really speak about the process. It is to discuss with all my fellow Members something that I think we need to make a commitment to going forward. 
   Hurricane Katrina was a terrible tragedy for the gulf coast. It was a terrible tragedy for New Orleans. In fact, it was the greatest tragedy that we have had as far as a natural disaster in the history of our country. As far as loss of property and loss of life, it is somewhere between five and six times greater than anything we had ever experienced before. When you talk property loss, uninsured property loss, because a lot of the flooding was in New Orleans where there was not flood insurance, or along the coast where they  had wind insurance but not for the surge, the storm surge, the losses are even greater. 
   But out of a tragedy, there ought to always be opportunities. And the opportunity that we have let slip by today, and, as I said, I am more concerned about the future, and I hope that the chairman of the full committee will work with me, is for us to go back and make sure that we do right by the people of New Orleans in public housing.     
   The New Orleans public housing was a failure. It was dysfunctional, and it had been so for 40 or 50 years. 
   There is a philanthropist in Atlanta who has helped build a community in Atlanta called East Lake. It was the highest crime area in the State of Georgia. Today it is one of the safest precincts in the State of Georgia. He did it not by replacing one-on-one public housing units, as we are going to do in this bill. He did it by making a mixed community of renters, subsidized renters, owners and public housing units. 
   In the State of New York, almost half of the prisoners in the State penitentiary in New York State come from public housing projects in seven ZIP codes in New York. 
   We owe it to our citizens all over the United States, not just in New Orleans, to try to make a model, a vision in New Orleans, and correct what is a community of public housing where children actually hide in bathtubs and sleep in bathtubs at night because that is the only safe place to be. That ought not to be in America. 
   We can change this. We know how to do it. Some of these HOPE VI projects are amazing. We didn't do this in this bill. We owe it to the American people to do it going forward.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Hurricane Katrina was a terrible tragedy for people all along the gulf coast, for the people of New Orleans, but it was a greater tragedy for those who already were living with a sense of hopelessness and despair in the public housing projects of New Orleans. For them the tragedy did not start with Katrina. It preexisted Katrina. In those housing projects, children actually slept in bathtubs for their own protection. Elderly citizens, 10 and 15 years ago, were hiding in closets. 
   But out of what was this despair in the housing projects of New Orleans, and really in many housing projects throughout the United States, we can use New Orleans and other models throughout this country to do something better than we have done. We have a moral imperative to change the standard of public housing in New Orleans, and not only in New Orleans but throughout this country. We can do better than simply warehousing families in failed large housing projects in crime-ridden communities. Our vision should be vibrant mixed-use communities with good housing, safe streets, and strong schools. 
   Consider these facts about what happens when you concentrate and change the face and the environment of public housing: several years ago, the New York Times reported that 70 percent of the inmates in the New York prison system came from just seven ZIP codes with large concentrations of public housing. In other words, where you are born and the environment you are born into may put you, in all likelihood, on the road to the penitentiary. When you live in a neighborhood where poverty and hopelessness prevail, it becomes a breeding ground for crime, drug use, and all that goes with it. 
   It was the same not only in New Orleans but it was the same sense of hopelessness, despair, and high crime in the East Lake community in downtown Atlanta. The East Lake public housing project was considered so dangerous that police refused to go on patrol there. Then a visionary named Tom Cousins, an Atlanta developer, came up with an idea: Why not replace a failed project with a 21st-century approach to housing, very similar to what we have done with HOPE VI? The answer was to create a public-private partnership emphasizing mixed use. With the help of HUD, the Atlanta housing authority and Tom Cousins and others totally transformed East Lake. They tore down the old projects. Yes, they tore down the old projects. They had to demolish some of those units. 
   This bill restricts our ability to tear down old units. There are 2,000 units in New Orleans that were not habitable that we have said we are going to go in and instead of replacing them with something new, something modern, something that offers hope, we are simply going to replace what existed there. 
   They tore down the old projects. They built new housing, and they  opened a new school. Now doctors and lawyers live next door to those whose housing is subsidized. In the old projects, there was only about a two-thirds' occupancy level. The occupancy level in New Orleans is very low because of the shoddy condition of the housing. Now 100 percent of the subsidized units are occupied, and the overall occupancy rate is 93.5 percent. 
   But something much greater than that, occupancy levels shouldn't be our main concern. It should be the condition of the people that are living there, their standard of living. Crime in the neighborhood has gone from the worst in Atlanta, 56 out of 56, the worst of 56 precincts, down to the 11th best precinct. Now, this is an area of mixed-use public housing which is actually one of the safest areas of Atlanta. The neighborhood has literally come back from the dead. But it wouldn't have happened if we had simply gone in like we propose to do in New Orleans and put it back exactly like it existed. In the end we are serving more low-income residents than we would if we had just replaced one on one. 
   But it isn't just happening in East Lake. Centennial Place in Atlanta is another success story, and the same transformation took place in Birmingham, and is taking place, with the Metropolitan Gardens development, a neighborhood that is now brightened by a new school, new housing, and a new YMCA. 
   It can be done. The Housing Authority of New Orleans has been dysfunctional for nearly 50 years. There is understandably a lot of anger and mistrust among the residents of New Orleans public housing after so many broken promises. But the anger, their anger and ours, should be channeled into moving forward in the direction of decent houses and safe communities. 
   HUD has a design for mixed-use communities similar to East Lake, Centennial, and Metropolitan Gardens. But that approach was rejected by the committee majority in favor of the one-to-one replacement of the old houses, in the same place, in the same location, in the same conditions. It is time to do better and we must. 
   This bill does not meet our imperative to the people of New Orleans public housing. If the concern is that some residents who want to return to New Orleans may not have a home to come back to, we can make provisions for that, but not into the old communities of high crime and hopelessness and despair. One-to-one is not the only way to bring people back, nor is it the best way or the more imaginative or innovative way. What will bring people back is a good place to live where crime and fear have been replaced by hope and opportunity. 
   Let me close simply by saying no matter what your party is, no matter what your political philosophy is, New Orleans can serve all of us as a model for improving our inner-city areas, those areas throughout America today, high-crime areas, widespread drug use, high unemployment. But more important than all those statistics, let us improve the standard of living for those people in those communities, not only in New Orleans but throughout this country. And our obligation should not end with this bill today. It ought to continue next week. We ought to continue to look at it until we do it right.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, in my earlier statement I said that the one-for-one replacement is not the best way to rebuild public housing in New Orleans. In fact, it is not only not the best way, it is the wrong way, because what we are doing here is we are saying before we replace these units, before we tear them down and build a community like Centennial, or East Lake, we are going to renovate the existing structures with taxpayers' money. What that does, oh, yes, it may get people back, but it gets them back into the same failed system. 
   They are out there. They have homes now. Let's continue to give them vouchers, let them stay, and then when we build a community that is safe, that they can be proud of, that is mixed-use, then we bring them back. 
   I mentioned East Lake. And East Lake was, as I said earlier, was the highest crime area in the entire State of Georgia. Today it is the 11th safest precinct out of 56. 
   One thing I didn't tell you about East Lake, the school in East Lake, prior to this development, only 31 percent of the children in that school were performing up to the State standardized testing. Today, two-thirds are, and they say within 2 years they will be at three-fourths. That is as good as any school in just about any school in Atlanta. 
   The director of the East Lake Community Foundation, Carol Naughton, said, while East Lake did not provide one-to-one replacement, it actually ends up serving more low-income families than are served under the previous arrangement. The occupancy rate at the old East Lake was 67 percent. Today it is 93 percent, and for subsidized homes it is 100 percent.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to take this time during this amendment to publicly thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Frank, for his graciousness during the markup and the hearings on this bill and for his willingness to give us real input into this bill. 
   There are 13 components of this legislation that we are not out here on the floor asking for an amendment to because the chairman consented to their inclusion. I believe that those matters which separate us are less than those that we agree on. 
   This was a major disaster. It is the largest natural disaster this country has faced by many times.     
   That we are struggling on some consensus on what we do going forward is predictable, and I will say in the defense of my colleagues, we are simply saying that we don't want some of the units replaced on a one-on-one basis. We know of 2,000 units that were either vacant or slated for demolition at the time of the hurricane. It is particularly those units that Mrs. Biggert has said in her amendment do not need to be replaced. 
   There are many displaced New Orleans residents who may choose not to come back. Others like the flexibility of the section 8 voucher. We have also not said that we want folks that are displaced off these vouchers. We are simply saying it should not be a permanent situation. 
   The gentleman from North Carolina mentioned the word ``housing.'' We do not see this as a housing issue. We see this as a quality-of-life issue. We do not want to recreate housing projects like the one in Atlanta where 70 percent----

   Mr. BACHUS. What I am speaking about, and I think there is agreement on both sides of the aisle, that when you have a housing project where a large percentage, even a majority of the young men that grow up in that housing project end up in a State penitentiary, we need to do something different. 
   We don't need to delay. Whether it is by renovating a unit that 2 years from now is slated for demolition, we just don't think that is the wisest use of taxpayer money. 
   And I do see that to do that, we are going to have to have vouchers and continue people on section 8 if we are to do long-term solutions. I think the gentleman from North Carolina made a valid point when he said that. That is something that should not be rejected out of hand.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 556, the National Security FIRST Act. It makes important  reforms to the process by which we ensure our national security is protected, while maintaining and welcoming a healthy flow of foreign investment into the United States. 
   Reform of the Nation's foreign investment vetting process became an issue last year, as we all know, when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS, received criticism for failing to question the safety and security implications stemming from the Dubai Ports World's purchase of commercial operations of American ports. 
   The bipartisan legislation we have before us today makes needed changes in the CFIUS process, changes that were highlighted by the Dubai Ports deal. 
   It promotes executive branch accountability enforced by a requirement that the chairman and vice chairman of CFIUS sign every decision. It increases interagency coordination within CFIUS and ensures that the Director of National Intelligence does a thorough analysis of any proposed transaction without becoming part of the policy-making aspects of the review. It dramatically improves CFIUS reporting to Congress on its activities so that Congress can perform regular and much-needed oversight of the process to ensure that the CFIUS process remains vigilant, but does not unnecessarily interfere with foreign investment or discourage foreign investment. 
   But, Mr. Chairman, of everything I would say here today, I would like to stress that the key issues we face here today transcend the Dubai Ports deal. They transcend CFIUS. They are more important than the CFIUS process. 
   H.R. 556 meets our challenges by advancing three important objectives, while leaving the essential sound foundation of CFIUS intact. 
   The first objective of this legislation is to continue to encourage opportunities for foreign investment in our economy. The surest way to ensure America remains strong and secure is to strengthen our economy and maintain global competitiveness. While we should never underestimate the threat to U.S. interests from economic espionage or from critical technologies falling into the wrong hands, we must also recognize that discouraging foreign investment or otherwise restricting global capital flows poses a very serious threat to our economic security and prosperity as well. The welcome mat for foreign investment must be out. 
   In fact, last year, and we hear lots about American capital going overseas and American companies investing overseas, but last year alone, over a half a trillion, $500 billion, net inflow of foreign capital in our country, more than foreign outflows of capital. 
   Because of the Dubai Ports situation, we have seen a fall-off on a lot of these inflows. We talk about our deficit. We talk about the need to export more. Well, in fact, foreign investment in this country, if you took away the foreign investment in this country, the recent foreign investment, it would reduce our exports by between 15 and 20 percent. The foreign-owned companies or foreign investments have created jobs in this country which result in about one-fifth of our exports today. 
   Also, the majority of a lot of those companies are actually owned by Americans. The Wall Street Journal talks about a company today in an editorial that 55 percent of it is owned by Americans, a Swedish company. I believe it was a Swedish company. 
   The second objective of this legislation, while we want to continue to say to foreigners investment in the United States, it is a good market, America is a good investment, we also want transparency in the process when they do invest. Many Members of Congress learned of the Dubai Ports deal when they picked up the newspaper or turned on the TV. This bill will ensure that as a matter of policy that does not happen again. CFIUS keeps Congress informed, this CFIUS legislation. 
   Third, we need empowerment of experts best qualified to assess national security issues. To that end, this bill ensures that the Director of National Intelligence can provide important and timely input into the CFIUS process based on the most current intelligence available, and guarantees the Department of Homeland Security will be a full participant in the process. 
   Mr. Chairman, we moved legislation very similar to this in the last session of Congress. The gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) constructed that legislation, led that effort along with the former chairman of the committee, Mr. Oxley, and Ms. Pryce from Ohio, and I would like to acknowledge at this time their contributions last year. This Congress, this body, passed that legislation last year because we wanted nothing to stand in the way of people investing in our country, creating jobs here, creating capital here, and that legislation passed unanimously. 
   This legislation is even stronger than that legislation, and I commend Chairman Frank for having the insight and the intellect to make this one of his first priorities in the new Congress because, as we saw yesterday, when the stock market in Shanghai fell, we are in a global economy, and the worst thing that can happen in that global economy is outflows of capital from the United States. This legislation will ensure that those outflows continue to come to America to create jobs here in America. 
   I will comment during the manager's amendment on some important changes in this legislation that have been proposed by the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), which I believe greatly strengthens this legislation, but let me close simply by saying this. 
   Mr. Chairman, the world is a lot different than it was back in 1975 when President Ford first created CFIUS, and it is far different than 1988 when the outline of the current review process was established. Terrorism requires us to exercise increased vigilance, while the demands of the global economy necessitate that America compete aggressively for foreign investment capital. 
   The siren song of protectionism is one that must be resisted if we are to be serious about maintaining America's competitive standing in the world. 
   This bill modernizes the way CFIUS does business, ensuring that both our security and economic needs are met, but without fundamental changes which make this country a protectionist country. 
   The foreign markets and people wanting to invest in America are watching us today, waiting to see what we do. For this reason, Mr. Chairman, I congratulate the sponsors of this legislation, and I urge the Members of this body to unanimously join together and pass this legislation and send it to the other body. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute to simply say that as we close this debate on the main text of H.R. 556, I hope that all Members of this body recognize the benefits to our economy from the robust level of foreign investment that is coming into this country. A few minutes ago, I mentioned a company that 55 percent of it was owned by one American company, and it is Nokia, which is a Finnish company, yet 55 percent of the stock in that company is owned by American companies. 
   So even those foreign companies are making investments in the United States. A large percentage of those companies are American-owned. You have these foreign investments in our country, foreign-owned companies, the subsidiaries of them employ 5.5 million Americans, and the average wage for those workers is $60,000.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to commend Chairman Frank for the manager's amendment. It makes a number of changes to the bill that was passed unanimously by the Financial Services Committee 2 weeks ago. 
   Formerly, I thanked Mr. Blunt and Ms. Pryce for their leadership on the bill. I omitted at that time to include the lady from New York (Mrs. Maloney) who obviously has been a key Member in maintaining this legislation in a proinvestment stance and ensuring that flows of capital investment are not restricted. So I thank her. 
   As I said, the manager's amendment makes several key changes to the legislation we passed 2 weeks ago, and they are all designed to clarify existing provisions. They are made at the suggestion, as the chairman said, of the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) with the consent, cooperation, and assistance of the chairman of that committee, Chairman Skelton. They dramatically strengthen both the way CFIUS assures itself that companies are complying with mitigation agreements imposed as a condition of permitting a transaction and the way that CFIUS assures Congress that it is staying on top of compliance. 
   Every single one of these changes is designed to protect national security, and it is a significant strengthening of the bill for which we all can thank Mr. Hunter and Chairman Skelton. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge strong support for the passage of the amendment.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, during this debate we have talked about, and I think correctly so, the need to attract foreign investment. And that is one thing that we bipartisanly agree on, that it is very, very important. 
   There are barriers to foreign investment today, and I do believe it is appropriate in this legislation because this is the committee for foreign investment in the United States to look to see if there are not barriers to that foreign investment, which is chilling those investments that are so important for the economy. For that reason, I am supporting the gentleman's amendment. 
   Now, I do want to say this, not about the gentleman's amendment, and I rise to say at this time we, in the CFIUS bill as it moves forward, have got to resist the temptation to load this bill up like a Christmas tree, and I am not talking about the gentleman from Texas' legislation, because every requirement that we put on foreign investment has a tendency to alienate those making those foreign investments. And most of the time they are our allies. 
   In fact, even with Dubai Ports, Dubai is one of our strongest allies in the Middle East, and anyone that thinks that terminating that transaction is not without risk in the Middle East is simply naive because we took a country that welcomes our Armed Forces and is one of our strongest allies, and we basically told them, We don't trust you. 
   And that is a problem. Alienating one's allies, scaring away investors. And as this bill moves forward, my point is national security and foreign investment are not mutually exclusive. We can have both, but we should not use this mantra of national security to undermine our economy, whether it is through a CFIUS process that foreign investors just throw up their hands and walk away from to our detriment or through regulations over excessive taxation because this money is going to go into competitive markets. 
   So I think the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Massachusetts are both right in that we need to take a serious look at anything which says to foreign investors, who are basically financing our economy today, anything that is said to them that has a chilling effect on their investments.     
   I yield to the gentleman from Texas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Congresswoman Lee has, I think appropriately, mentioned several Members who have worked hard on this legislation. And historically in this Congress the House has come together to work very hard in a bipartisan way, not always successfully. Several years ago, we passed a capital market sanction unanimously out of the House. It went to the Senate, and unfortunately it died there. 
   We're voting on legislation that passed the House this last July with a vote of 418-1. It supports the decisions of State and local legislatures and fund managers to divest from companies doing business in Sudan. However, the bill before us today does not require the government to create or be the source of a ``black list'' for such companies. We all know the SEC had some problems with maintaining such a list, and at times was inaccurate. For this reason, the Senate version is more acceptable to the administration and to many of us in the House. 
   Some have said today's legislation is too little, too late, but that certainly is not the case for more than 1 million innocent men, women and children who have somehow survived the genocide and slaughter in Sudan. We can't rewrite history or save lives already lost in Darfur; however, we can and we must resolve to do better going forward. This legislation has the potential to give hundreds of thousands of peaceful and unarmed men, women and children in Darfur an increased chance of surviving the genocide. 
   Economic and financial considerations in the past have halted some of us in the House from using our efforts against the Sudan Government. They've been used to block and water down our Sudan capital markets legislation in the past. 
   Economic and financial considerations are important, but in a loving Nation, such considerations can never be used as a justification for turning a blind eye to genocide. Closing our financial markets to those who participate directly or indirectly in the slaughter of innocent human beings is well within our ability and ought to be a bedrock principle of our Nation. 
   America is a loving Nation, and allowing our financial markets to be utilized by an evil, and that's a strong word, but in this case it fits, an evil regime which conducts religious and racial genocide is inconsistent with our values and our principles. 
   This legislation will help put strong pressure on the Government of Sudan that has consistently engaged in genocidal actions both directly and as an enabler of paramilitary factions that are harassing and killing people in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan on a daily basis. 
   It is vital to keep the pressure on Khartoum, both because of the bait-and-switch games it regularly plays with the rest of the world, and has done so for years, pretending to make strides to end the genocide, and then going back on its word when the world's outrage is temporarily spent. The latest outrage involves refusing to allow the deployment of non-African United Nations peacekeeping troops, due in two weeks, which it previously had agreed to accept. 
   The objective of this legislation is one that those of us on our side wholeheartedly embrace. In fact, three of our Members who have been to Sudan and have consistently for years worked in the slaughter there will speak in support of the legislation. Their advice and counsel on the legislative proposal has been invaluable. 
   Passage of this legislation will give a strong expression of Congress' outrage over the continued genocide in Darfur. 
   At this time, I would like to recognize the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), who really has been a passionate crusader against the outrage that we now know as Darfur, and I recognize him for such time as he may consume.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 2761, the Terrorist Insurance Revision Extension Act of 2007. I think the legislation is critical to our Nation's economic security and the proper functioning of the insurance marketplace. 
   Let me thank Chairman Frank and his staff and Representatives Capuano, Price, Kanjorski and Baker for all their leadership and hard work on TRIA this year. We would not have enacted TRIA this year had the House not acted several months ago before the Senate and set the stage for this current compromise. 
   I would also like to acknowledge the strong contributions of Mr. Ackerman and the New York City delegation, Mr. King and Mr. Fossella. I would also like to acknowledge their concern with regard to this bill. We all remember the attack on New York City more than 6 years ago. We are grateful that we have not suffered another attack on the homeland. I think there is recognition among many Members of this body that New York City is a symbol of our financial strength.     
   It is not only that it is a symbol; it is a gateway to our country for many immigrants and it quite naturally was on September 11, and could be, again, chief among the targets. So I would say to Mr. Ackerman, I appreciate your passion and your participation, and we are dealing with a compromise here. 
   In the absence of further attacks, it would be easy to forget the chaos and the economic disruption that followed in the wake of 9/11 and, more importantly, the loss of life that we all witnessed in a very personal way, but New York City's residents in an even more personal and deadly experience for them. 
   In 2002, it was fresh in our minds, and we created TRIA, which did help to settle the markets and made possible the strong economic recovery that followed, and TRIA was and remains a central element of our commitment to the American people to do all that we can to ensure the stability of our economy in the event the unthinkable happens again. 
   In a moment I am going to call on Mr. King, the gentleman from New York, who worked very hard on this bill. Terrorist acts are aimed at our Nation as a whole. The resulting damage and suffering inevitably fall on a relative few of our communities and citizens. We know that New York City is a primary target of these terrorists. And although I am an ardent supporter of free markets, I believe it is entirely appropriate for our government to minimize economic fallout and disruption sure to arise from any new attack. Terrorism is a relatively new phenomenon in America, and we are dealing with terrorist organizations which have both the intent and the potential to deliver deadly strikes against our homeland. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King), and I would like to acknowledge to him, publicly, and to the New York delegation that most of us in America probably do not realize the contribution and the special nature of the City of New York and its contributions, both financially and I think socially, to the United States. To many around the world, it does represent our leading city and is truly a target. When they target New York City, they target all of us.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge the concerns of many of my House colleagues, the New York delegation, concerning certain aspects of this bill. It is not a perfect bill. It is the bill the Senate sent back over. I believe, despite the circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is a reasonable measure. I believe it will ensure the continued vitality of our commercial insurance markets as they operate under the threat of global terrorism. I believe it is fiscally responsible. 
   Many on my side would have preferred a 3-year bill, as the gentleman from Louisiana talked about. Originally, it was a 3-year bill. I believe the New York delegation can take satisfaction from the fact that it was a 7-year extension and that it does cover domestic acts of terrorism. I applaud them for that. 
   But I think, on the other hand, it does offer limits and improves taxpayer protections and prevents further intrusions by the government into a market-based system. For that, I thank many of my colleagues on my side, Mr. Hensarling, Mr. Campbell and others, who voiced their concerns. 
   Mr. Speaker, I again applaud the hard work and the willingness of the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services, Mr. Frank, to work with Members on both sides of the aisle and to bring the bill here today before the House. He faced a hard decision. He has worked hard on this. He made, I think, a very passionate and, I think, in many respects, reasoned defense of his position. 
   We do know going forward that we need to pay particular attention, if the terrorists continue to threaten our largest city and target it, that we are fully supportive of the people of New York City. 
   I thank all of my colleagues in both the House and the Senate who worked on TRIA for a long time. Whatever else has happened, we have come together today. It may have been an emotional journey, but we are going to pass legislation that I believe will be effective, and I urge adoption of the legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will surrender any time I have left to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman).

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me start by saying that the minority is not opposed to a debate on section 8 vouchers for evacuees. We understand, and we have said on this floor that they have left New Orleans, they are in other cities, and there is a temporary need. We don't know how long that temporary need is. There is a temporary need for housing. Some of them will drop off in eligibility, and we are hearing that may be 8 percent. But this is a 10-year permanent program. 
   One of my concerns is they won't want to return to New Orleans with this section 302 housing that we are creating, a more or less permanent program where they can stay in Houston or they can move from Houston to Dallas. 
   Now, yesterday we talked about what I consider is a rush to go back and take some of these dilapidated units, units that weren't habitable even before the hurricane, and fix them up. We say we need to do that because we needed to get everybody back to New Orleans as soon as we could. 
   What we said yesterday, we talked about East Lake in Atlanta, where they took a large public housing project which was, as I said, 56th out of 56. It was the most dangerous precinct in the city of Atlanta. Seventy percent of the youth in some of these public housing projects ended up in the State penitentiary. There was an article in the New York Times about that in New York. We wanted to replace that with mixed-income units. That is going to take time. For that to happen, we will have to have some people stay in other cities. 
   But we don't think that we can determine right now what we need 10 years from now and commit to spending $735 million. At the same time, if we are  going to do that, why do we go back and replace all these units? These people are either going to come back, or they are not. They are not going to do both. But it seems as if we are creating public housing for everyone in New Orleans that has a potential of coming back, and, at the same time, we are creating a program over here where everybody can stay away from New Orleans. 
   The end result is, I think, a lack of planning. I think we ought to, instead of replacing the failed public housing in New Orleans that we all agree was a disaster, we ought to replace it with something where people have a safer home, a better community, more quality of life. While we do that, we determine how long that is going to take and fashion this program around what we think is a better day for people in New Orleans, a better public housing system there. 
   Instead, I think we are creating two stand-alone programs, both designed for the same group of evacuees. It simply is going to create a disincentive to come back. At the same time, we are creating housing in New Orleans that is really not suitable for anyone, replacing units that need to be torn down and replaced with better units. 
   As I have said, this is the greatest natural catastrophe this Nation has faced. That, if anything, ought to lead us to do this right, and not just throw money at it, but to spend it wisely.     
   This amendment by Mr. Neugebauer is a way to do that. Section 302 is a duplication of effort, and I think it is ill conceived. 
   I will close with this: Yesterday, if I heard it once, I heard it a hundred times. And we agree, we want people to come back to New Orleans as long as there is suitable housing there and to do so as soon as possible. This section 302, which the gentleman from Texas would strike, is a disincentive to New Orleans recovering as soon as possible.

   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, Thomas Paine on December 23, 1776, said, ``These are times that try men's souls.'' 
   What was a problem at one time on Wall Street has become a problem for Main Street. What was a problem for this Congress and financial experts has become a problem for America. 
   As late as last night, Mr. LaTourette, Mr. Latham, and I were at the Rules Committee for 2 1/2 minutes urging the Rules Committee to only appropriate $250 billion, an enormous amount; yet they turned down our request. I want to thank my Republican colleagues on the Rules Committee for voting ``yes.'' 
   Our amendment said we would come back in November and we would give careful consideration to this. And if we needed more, if the program was working--and believe you me, it's been announced that it won't start for another 15 days whether we pass this bill today or tomorrow or the day after. And we could have all judged by then how it was working. 
   But that's past. And today is today. And I will be voting today for this bill because it's about the pensioner and his retirement check, it's about the small businessman and his ability to buy materials or make a payroll, and it's about that student, either in school or having to leave school, or that student preparing for school. 
   Whatever the problem was before, however you disagree with certain parts of this bill, our only choice is ``yes'' or ``no.'' And when a problem becomes an American problem, and it is, then it is time for Congress to take decisive action. 
   I will be voting ``yes'' on this bill; not a perfect bill, but a bill that I am not willing to pass up because I'm not willing to risk capitalism and a decline into socialism if our financial markets and our economy collapses.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CONGRESSIONAL CLUB -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H. Res. 1026, a resolution recognizing the 100th Anniversary of the founding of the Congressional Club. 
   From its very start, the Congressional Club has helped the spouses of Members to come together on a nonpartisan basis to form friendships and perform public service. 
   The role of the Congressional Club is as essential now as it was when the club was formed in 1908. Back then, Members and spouses often had to spend a long time travelling to Washington. Once here, spouses in particular faced the challenge of developing acquaintances and friendships in a new city and finding ways to share their talents to benefit the community and their country. 
   The club provided a refreshing nonpolitical atmosphere for friendships and charitable activities, a hallmark that continues to this day. Its headquarters at New Hampshire Avenue and U Street is listed on the National Registry of Historic Places and serves as an architectural anchor for the neighborhood. 
   Today, the Congressional Club continues to be a haven of civility and culture where the spouses of Members can meet outside of a political world that sometimes can be all-consuming and far too partisan. It is a testament to the positive things that happen in this town when creative and talented people get together for the sole purpose of serving the public good. 
   The Congressional Club has provided charitable support to literacy programs, domestic shelters, child care and seniors citizens, the White House library and United National Indian Tribal Youth. It brightens the holidays every December by delivering cookies to our local police and fire departments and hosting luncheons for nursing home residents and neighborhood children.  
   One of its best-known events is the First Ladies luncheon, which funds charitable activities. My wife Linda was chair of the First Ladies luncheon in 2007, so I well appreciate the tremendous amount of planning and organization that goes into making this such an anticipated and successful event. 
   The vital role that the Congressional Club plays in the life of the Capitol Hill community and this city at large is evident by the fact that it is the only club in the Nation founded by an act of Congress. 
   With its tradition of civility and service, the Congressional Club remains as important to the life of the U.S. Congress as it was when it was founded 100 years ago. I extend my sincere commendations to all of its members, past and present, and wish the club all the best on this memorable centennial.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio. 
   We have heard words about Paul Gillmor, our friend, and one word we keep hearing over and over is ``caring.'' He really cared. He cared about his family. You would go in his office and you would see the pictures of his family. 
   He cared about his staff. Mark Wellman, his chief of staff; Dave Oxner, great guys. They were sort of a reflection and extension of Paul. They were gentlemen. They really did not care about who got the credit. They were hard workers. I say to Mark and Dave, I know that you are grieving right now. 
   Mr. Obey mentioned that he cared about this institution. He truly did. He cared about every Member. I never heard him insult another Member. I never heard him say something unkind. 
   He talked about issues. He felt strongly about issues. The brownfields legislation was a great example of how he was very tenacious, had very strong feelings. He did that earlier this year on the industrial loan companies when, as a small town banker, mainstream banker, he felt very strongly that small town banks were being disadvantaged. But he never said anything unkind about those who opposed his position. 
   To his credit, I think part of that kindness, that caring, and also his capable leadership, that legislation passed the House 371-16. I think brownfields will be part of his legacy, particularly to the industrial States, the people of Ohio that he loved; as will the industrial loan company legislation, that really will help preserve small town mainstream banking. 
   He was a banker. I had the privilege of appointing Paul as the ranking member of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee. I never regretted that decision. I knew that what Paul cared about was not himself or not the glory, but doing what was right for the American people. He never disappointed me. I will miss him deeply.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan). 
   Mr RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank our distinguished ranking member of the Financial Services Committee for all the work he has done this week. A lot of us have lost a lot of sleep, a lot of us who have looked at this situation. 
   When Secretary Paulson came to us about a week ago, he gave us a three-page bill that said give me a blank checkbook and put $700 billion in it. I was offended at that time. 
   So what happened since then? We added 107 pages of taxpayer protection to that bill. We understand the gravity of this situation, and we worked with our colleagues on the other side to make this bill a better bill. 
   We made sure that there is an upside for the taxpayer so that when this happens, when profits come to these companies, we get their stock warrants, so the first person in line to get those profits is the American taxpayers so they can get their money back. We made sure that there is an insurance program that makes sure that Wall Street shares in the cost of this recovery plan. And we also made sure that the executives of these companies that made these bad bets don't profit from this rescue recovery plan. We cut the initial cost in half of this bill. Congress will have to approve the second half of this next year. 
   Why did we do all of this? Because this Wall Street crisis is quickly becoming a Main Street crisis. It is quickly becoming a banking crisis. 
   What does that mean? Why does that matter to us? Why does that matter to Janesville, Wisconsin? If it goes the way it could go, that means credit shuts down; businesses can't get money to pay their payroll, to pay their employees; students can't get student loans for next semester; people can't get car loans; seniors may not have access to their savings. Are we standing at the edge of this abyss? Nobody knows. But maybe. It is very probable. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill offends my principles. But I am going to vote for this bill in order to preserve my principles, in order to preserve this free enterprise system. 
   This is a Herbert Hoover moment. He made some big mistakes after the Great Depression, and we lived those consequences for decades. Let's not make that mistake. There is a lot of fear and a lot of panic out there. A lot of what this is about is getting that fear and panic out of the market. 
   I think the White House bumbled this thing. They have brought this issue up to a crescendo, to a crisis, so that all eyes of the world markets are here on Congress. It is a heavy load to bear. We have to deal with this panic. We have to deal with this fear. 
   Colleagues, we are in the moment. This bill doesn't have everything I want in it. It has a lot of good things it. But we are here. We are in this moment. And if we fail to do the right thing, heaven help us. If we fail to pass this, I fear the worst is yet to come. 
   The problem we have here is we are one month away from an election. We are all worried about losing our jobs, and all of us, most of us, say this thing needs to pass, but I want you to vote for it, not me. 
   Unfortunately, a majority of us are going to have to vote for this, and we are going to have to do that because we have a chance of arresting that crash. Just maybe this will work. 
   And so for me and for my own conscience, so I can look at myself in the mirror tonight, so I can go to sleep with a clear conscience, I want to know that I did everything I could to stop it from getting worse, to stop this Wall Street problem from infecting Main Street. 
   I want to get on my airplane and go home and see my three kids and my wife that I haven't seen in a week, and look them in the eye and know that I did what I thought was right for them and their future. And I believe with all my heart, as bad as this is, it could get a whole lot worse, and that is why I think we have to pass this bill.

   It's 11 days later, and our time has run out. We're going to have a vote. We're going to make a decision. There are no more alternatives. There are no other choices--just this one choice. I don't know about you. I believe every Member of this body feels as if there is an awesome responsibility on our shoulders. This will be the most difficult decision I make in my 16 years in this body, and I have decided that the cost of not acting outweighs the cost of acting. 
   I've been able to calculate the financial cost of acting, and I know that it's something less than $700 billion. I could go into a long explanation, but I am actually optimistic that almost all of that money will be recovered by the taxpayer. But I'll tell you, like an explorer in uncharted territory, none of us in this body has any really good judgment or insight into what happens if we fail to pass this bill. 
   It could mean companies will go out of business. We've been told it would. It could mean more bank failures. It probably will. It will mean the impairment of our parents' and grandparents' pensions. I'm not willing to put that bullet in the revolver and spin it. I'm not willing to take that gamble. I'm not willing to pull that trigger because I am not willing to subject the American people to the worst case scenario. 
   I don't have a crystal ball. That is one reason that I'll be voting ``yes.'' I will take the political risk, but I will not take a risk on the American people and their future, and on the prosperity of my children and of my grandchildren. 
   Thank you very much.

   Mr. BACHUS. I thank the Chairman, and let me attempt to answer the question. 
   The question is really not whether the gentleman from North Carolina objects to an earmark. It's not whether the gentleman from New York is for an earmark. 
   Really, this is the people's House, and it's really up to the people to make the final judgment on each and every  one of these earmarks, and the people simply don't know what these earmarks are. This is the people's House, and we've been told there are earmarks in this bill, there will be earmarks added in conference. We're told that the professionals on the Appropriations Committee are reviewing these earmarks. They're making a determination. That's what it's about. 
   I grew up in Birmingham, and there was a Scripps Howard newspaper in Birmingham, and it had a searchlight on the front page. I'm sure some of you had a Scripps Howard newspaper in your community, and that was the truth going out, the light. 
   The gentleman from North Carolina says he doesn't know anything about these earmarks. I don't know anything about these earmarks. The gentleman from New York may know all about them. The chairman of the committee may know about them. But really, the truth is that who ought to know, and who has a right to know and a right to make that judgment in each and every case is the people we represent, the people of the United States. It's their money. It's not our money. 
   And that's what's so wrong with this process tonight. We are arguing among ourselves that this Member doesn't have the right, or this Member knows more than this Member, when the truth is it's the American people that have the right to know. They have the right to disclosure. This is their House. This is their money. And they have the right to make decisions about each and every one of these earmarks that some of us know about and some of us don't know about. 
   Now, I would say this. The American people don't know how many earmarks are in this bill or how many earmarks will be in this bill. We're going to be asked to pass, we represent, we each represent, 6-, 700,000 citizens, and we're going to be asked tomorrow or the next day to vote on this bill, to vote ``yes'' or ``no.'' 
   We've already been told there will be earmarks added to the appropriation bill, but it won't be until all the bills are passed that they'll go to conference, and a few select Members, representing probably 10 percent of the American people, they will add the earmarks. The American people will not ever know what these earmarks are until they're passed into law. 
   Now, you know, I will tell the gentleman from New York, I don't care if you tell me about the earmarks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have a question I think the American people would like answered. It is a question that has not been asked tonight. We know Chairman Obey, and we know he has taken a position that he is not going to publish or disclose these earmarks. He has expressed his opinion. 
   What we don't know, Mr. Chairman, is, the Speaker is not sitting in the Chair and we don't know where the Speaker stands on this whole procedure. We do know that the majority leader said that all earmarks would be published, there would be complete transparency. We know that he said in committee they would be debated. We know that the Speaker on a number of occasions, I think we have all seen those quotes, we have heard a few tonight, the Speaker make it clear during the campaign and after the campaign that all earmarks would be disclosed prior to any vote on the House floor. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I believe it is incumbent on the Speaker to come before this body and address the body and tell the body whether or not the procedure that we are witnessing, whether it is chairman of the Appropriations Committee has taken this on himself, whether he is doing it on his own accord, whether he has polled the Democrat Members to see where they stand. 
   But more important, we want to know where the Speaker stands. We want to know whether the Speaker consulted with the chairman, whether she has blessed this. We know what she said in USA Today. We know what she said in the Christian Science Monitor and what she said in a news conference just last month. We know that in a press conference on March 13, 2007, she specifically said that all earmarks would be made public before a vote on the House floor. We know that, so it is a mystery to us why we are going through this process. 
   Now, the chairman of the full committee said back in 1999 there was a bill, one bill, that the Republican majority did not publish the earmarks before the vote on the floor. We know that is part of his reason for doing this. But we also know that the Speaker of the House told the American people that this would never happen as long as she was Speaker. And she, as a late as a month ago, said there would be no votes on the House floor on an appropriations bill where earmarks were not published. 
   In fact, the gentleman from Illinois, the majority whip, says, if possible, we are going to put them on the Internet weeks before we vote on them on the House floor. They are not on the Internet. We don't know how many earmarks there will be, what earmarks are under consideration, the total amount of those earmarks. 
   But more importantly, we do know one thing, Mr. Chairman, we know that the Speaker of this House, the Speaker of this House said that this wouldn't happen. She said it many times on many occasions, both during the campaign when she asked the American people to turn the Republicans out and put the Democrats in. 
   And we know that from exit polls that many people went to the polls on election day with that promise in mind; and they voted for Democrats who now serve in this body under the assurance that this wouldn't happen, and it is happening. 
   Now, we know that the chairman of the full committee, we know his position. He said we just have to do. He talks about what we have done and what they have done. The important thing is the American people. 
   In fact, earlier tonight on one of the news network, it was not Fox, they asked: Where does Speaker Pelosi stand on this? The American people are asking, where does the leadership of the majority stand on this issue? 
   That is my question, Mr. Chairman. I would ask that before we proceed in this body, that the Speaker of this House come before this body and not tell, I don't care if she tells Republicans, I don't care if she further explains to Democrats, I want her to tell the American people why, only 3 weeks after promising that earmarks would be fully disclosed both in committee and on the floor of this House, that we backed away from this.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, this is a gas receipt. All of us have seen our constituents give us these gas receipts. This is for $89. It's what Boone Pickens says is the largest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. 
   Now I'm going to show you where that money is going. A lot of it is going to Dubai. Dubai, they're our allies. If you had gone to Dubai before the cost of gasoline went up, you would have seen this picture. This is the main street in Dubai, a dirt road; and the only thing higher than two stories was a mosque. 
   Now let me show you Dubai today. That's where the infrastructure is being built. It's not in the United States. There are more construction cranes in Dubai than there are in the United States, 25 percent of them in the world. 
   Now here's my point: Do you know what Dubai is doing? Do you know what Abu Dhabi--do you know what the United Emirates are doing at this very moment? They are building or plan to build 14 nuclear power plants. They're building nuclear power plants. They're going to generate their electricity exclusively from nuclear power. Why? Because we don't get it; they get it. They're going to sell oil to us because we're not going to develop nuclear power. China is building 30. India is building 17. 
   This bill doesn't get it. Senator Obama, Senator Biden, they're opposed to nuclear power. They're not doing what the oil-rich Arabs are doing. Thank goodness Senator McCain and Governor Palin, they get it. The Republicans get it. This bill has no nuclear power in it. This bill is not going to stop the largest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. You can't do it without nuclear power. 
   Let's come back with a real energy solution. And I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, your bill doesn't get it. Dubai and Abu Dhabi will continue to build their nuclear power plants; we will build none. 
   And energy is the number one factor in manufacturing. We're going to lose our manufacturing. They're going to get it because they get it and you don't.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, the number one cost in manufacturing is energy. The number one cost of job loss in America is the high cost of energy. 
   Now, the Chinese get that. The Chinese are building 32 nuclear power plants. 
   The country of India, they get it. Seventeen new nuclear power plants. 
   Even Abu Dhabi and Dubai, oil rich Arab countries, United Emirates, they sell us their oil and they're building nuclear power plants so they don't have to use their oil, they can sell it to us. 
   Listen, all these countries get it. The Republican bill gets it. It has nuclear energy. But Joe Biden, Senator Obama, they don't get it. The Democrats don't get it. There's no nuclear energy in their bill. 
   We'll continue to lose jobs. We'll continue to have high cost of energy, and most importantly, we will not be able to compete with the world because they are building nuclear power and cheap energy while we're not. 
   We need to vote for a real bill, not this sham.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Chairman, the Federal Housing Administration, which we today call FHA, was created in 1934; and it is a very important source of support for first-time home buyers and for low- and middle-income borrowers. FHA provides mortgage insurance that protects lenders against losses when homeowners default on their mortgage obligations, as many of them are doing today. It also allows the lenders to offer their customers, American homeowners, low interest rates and low closing costs. 
   Since its inception, the FHA has insured nearly 35 million loans. That makes it the largest insurer of mortgages in the world. FHA's share of the mortgage market, however, has been steadily declining in recent years, falling from almost 20 percent 10 years ago, of the total mortgage market in America, to 5 percent today. 
   This sharp drop in FHA's market share resulted largely from the growing popularity of subprime mortgages, as more borrowers opted for loans featuring zero down payments and introductory teaser rates far lower than what was available from FHA. 
   The difficulties we are experiencing today by many subprime borrowers is as their initial low interest rates reset at a much higher level, it offers FHA an opportunity to reestablish its standing in the marketplace as a safe, low-cost alternative for American homeowners. It is also another reason that we should be here today reforming FHA, to ensure that that happens. 
   For that to happen, Congress does need to pass the reforms that we are considering today. I want to say that right upfront. There are important reforms in this bill. These same reforms were contained in legislation that Ranking Member Biggert of the Housing Committee and myself and others in a bipartisan way introduced in the 109th Congress. In fact, that legislation, Comprehensive FHA Reform, and that is in this bill today, and is very good provisions, passed with over 400 votes on the House floor, only to die in the Senate. I am sorry that happened. 
   Earlier this year, Congresswoman Biggert and I reintroduced legislation identical to that legislation. However, and I am sorry to say that rather than embracing last year's bipartisan approach, the majority has chosen to go in a different direction. I think they do that from honest philosophical reasons. We disagree with those reasons. 
   They have included provisions which we believe will divert surpluses generated by the FHA program to a new affordable housing fund established in separate legislation which this House and our committee passed earlier this year. 
   While a strong bipartisan consensus exists regarding the need for FHA reform, the reforms in this bill, the majority is insistent on linking the enactment of these reforms to the creation of yet a new multi-billion dollar housing fund has caused many of us on this  side of the aisle to hesitate from strongly supporting this legislation.     
   I admit, most of our Members are in a quandary. We like the reforms in this bill. We know that those reforms will go a long way towards addressing the crisis that we face today, the Affordable Housing Fund. And we realize at the same time that there is legitimate purpose behind Chairman Frank's Affordable Housing Fund, and one of those is to offer affordable low income rental property for Americans. And we understand that he honestly believes, and we have an honest disagreement as to the need for this. 
   We simply believe that a better approach is to dedicate the FHA surplus to shoring up the financial solvency of the FHA mortgage program, which was only recently removed from GAO's list of government programs at high risk for waste, fraud and abuse. 
   A portion of that surplus could also be returned to beneficiaries of the program. Who are they? They are the many people who have taken out FHA-insured reverse mortgages, many of them senior citizens, and we could do that in the form of lower insurance premiums for all Americans who have FHA mortgages. 
   Madam Chairman, the key reforms included in this legislation, lowering down payment requirements, increasing loan limits and mortgages that FHA is authorized to ensure, giving FHA more pricing flexibility, command broad consensus among Republicans, Democrats, the Bush administration, consumer groups and the industry, the realtors, the home builders and others. Indeed, in announcing several of these initiatives last month designed to contain the damage caused by the problem in subprime, President Bush stressed the critical role that FHA can play in assisting homeowners facing sharply higher mortgage payments and possibly foreclosure in reaffirming the administration's support for the FHA modernization legislation and many of the provisions contained in this bill. 
   However, the administration, as have many on our side of the aisle, also is strongly opposed to using FHA surplus as seed money for an untested, unrelated government housing program, one that is estimated to cost $3 billion or more. 
   Thus, by insisting that this bill carry that controversial provision, we feel like the majority is delaying, if not jeopardizing, the enforcement of important reforms that we need now to provide a lifeline for seeking to refinance out of high cost subprime loans. 
   Madam Chairman, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support Republicans' amendments to strike the extraneous Affordable Housing Fund provisions opposed by the administration and allow us to move forward quickly with badly needed and long overdue reforms in the FHA program. If we are not successful in those amendments, many of the Members will vote for this underlying legislation, some will not. But, again, I want to acknowledge the sincerity and the good faith that the majority has worked throughout this process with the minority; and, Chairman Waters and Chairman Frank, we very much appreciate that. We appreciate the many fine provisions in this bill.

   But I also want to acknowledge what you said. There are many important reforms in this bill. In fact, from last year's bill, much of what the chairman has said, I think we have worked together, groups have worked together, and as a result of the subprime crisis we have got an even better bill, and I acknowledge all that. There are many good things about this bill, and I commend him for his knowledge of the subject and his fine work. Thank you.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (PROVIDING NEW EFFECTIVE DATE FOR APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF LAW -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Speaker, I am happy to rise today in strong support of H.R. 188, legislation ``to provide a new effective date for certain provisions of law in Public Law 105-331,'' introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. PALLONE. 
   Enacted in 1998, Public Law 105-331 provided for the issuance in 2004 of the Thomas Alva Edison Commemorative Coin, commemorating the 125th anniversary of Edison's invention of the light bulb. 
   In the years between the passage of that legislation and now, leadership of the group that operates the Edison Memorial Tower in Edison, New Jersey made plans to comply with statutory requirements to raise funds to match one-eighth of the surcharges raised from the sales of the coins--about $380,000--and thus claim the surcharge funds. Unfortunately, through a series of miscom-munications, it was not made clear to the board that these must be non-governmental funds. 
   When the error was discovered, the group moved quickly, seeking an extension of the 2-year time limit to raise those funds. Madam Speaker, on November 16 of last year, the House passed legislation similar to that which we are considering today that would have permitted an extension until the end of June. Unfortunately, during the wrap-up of the 109th Congress, the other body did not consider the legislation. However, I am confident that when the House sends this version of the bill to the Senate, it will quickly pass. 
   It is for these reasons, and because the invention of the light bulb is as good a thing to commemorate as I can imagine, that I urge immediate passage of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE TO INSURE HOME EQUITY CONVERSION MORTGAGES -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 391, sponsored by my colleagues Congresswoman GINNY BROWN-WAITE and Congressman JIM MATHESON, which would temporarily remove the cap on the number of reverse mortgages that may be insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). 
   The FHA reverse mortgage program, known as HUD's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program, or ``HECM,'' is the oldest and most popular reverse mortgage program in the country, accounting for 90 percent of the total market. It has been available since 1989 to  homeowners age 62 and older and is an important tool providing seniors with much-needed cash flow. 
   By 2010, the number of elderly Americans is expected to top 40 million. Over the next 35 years, the expected number of older seniors--those age 85 and older--will quadruple from 3.5 million to 14 million. Besides finding safe and affordable housing, seniors face the challenge of paying for daily expenditures and rising healthcare costs. These growing financial responsibilities are coupled with a diminishing income and cash flow. 
   The reverse mortgage product fills in this gap by enabling senior homeowners to remain in their homes and maintain financial independence. Through this program, seniors convert part of the equity in their homes into tax-free income without having to sell the home, give up title, or take on a new monthly mortgage payment. Previously, the only way for a homeowner to extract cash from their home was to sell it, or to borrow against it and begin making monthly payments. 
   The HECM program was created to serve our seniors who are ``cash poor'' but ``equity rich,'' and the majority of loan recipients are elderly widows. The funds from a reverse mortgage can be used for anything: daily living expenses; home repairs or modifications; health care expenses, including prescription drugs or in-home care; existing debts; prevention of foreclosure; and other needs. 
   For example, a 75-year-old with a home worth $100,000 could receive a reverse mortgage loan that could payout $500 per month for almost 12 years. This loan is then repaid when the borrower dies or the home is sold. 
   Not only do seniors face a shortage of affordable housing, but surveys show that most seniors prefer to live out their lives in the own homes. According to a study by AARP, over 80 percent of respondents indicated that they wanted to stay in their current residence as long as possible. Further, according to the National Council on the Aging, of the over 27 million households in the U.S. over 62 years of age, 82 percent live in homes that they own and over 74 percent own those homes free and clear. 
   In 1998, Congress adopted legislation making the HECM program permanent, but set a cap of 150,000 loans that could be outstanding at any one time. Because production of HECM loans began to bump up against that cap, Congress first increased the authorization cap to 250,000 in 2005 and then to 275,000 in late 2006. However, there are indications that this increase may not be sufficient, and that this cap will stifle the ability of seniors to tap into this important equity as a way of addressing everyday needs. According to the Wall Street Journal, in Fiscal Year 2006, homeowners took out a record 76,351 reverse mortgages, which represents an increase of 77 percent over the previous year. 
   This legislation will remove the cap on the number of reverse mortgages that can be insured by the HECM program through February 15, the date on which the current Continuing Resolution expires. This measure is similar to H.R. 2892, the ``Reverse Mortgages to Help America's Seniors Act,'' which was passed by the House by voice vote in the last Congress. While only a temporary fix, today's bill will pave the way for removal of the cap through the end of 2007. 
   For most seniors, and most Americans, a home represents more than just a place to live. It holds treasured memories and provides economic security to support increasingly longer lives. I urge Members to unanimously support this bill so that seniors can maintain their independence and stay in their homes.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding. 
   The gentleman on the other side from Kansas City said that he had a problem with excessive executive compensation. And let me say this: I don't think there is a Member of this body in the majority or the minority who hasn't been outraged by what we judge by looking in the paper is a lavish, uncalled-for executive pay compensation. Some of them are indefensible. I would never try to defend them; nor should they be defended. And that is not what we are doing today. 
   At the start of this debate some 3 hours ago, I said, this debate is not about excessive executive compensation because by its very term, ``excessive executive compensation'' is excessive. The gentleman from Georgia said it. The gentleman from Kansas City said it. Our constituents are upset about it. And, in fact, last year, this Congress responded to concerns of shareholders, investors and our constituents and voters. And working with the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, we said, you are going to have to disclose these salary compensations. You are going to have to put them out for public scrutiny. And those regulations are just now going into effect. And many of us look at it, and we are dismayed. 
   Now, we all have a problem with excessive executive compensation. But I think most of my constituents and I think most Americans also have a problem with something else. They have a problem with the Congress micromanaging or mandating what private corporations do. This debate is not about excessive executive compensation, which we all condemn. This bill is not about income inequities, which we all are concerned about. This legislation is about this Congress beginning to tinker and mandate and obligate corporate governance with a vote, not a vote that we say they can take, because today they can take such a vote. A shareholder can ask for such a vote on executive compensation. What this legislation does is it mandates, it requires, it obligates every publicly held corporation in this country to take a vote on their top executives, not just the CEO but the CFO and on down the line. Each shareholder, if this legislation passes, will each year vote on the compensation of all these executives. 
   And as so often happens in this body, when Congress begins to substitute its judgment for someone else's judgment, we have all kinds of problems that are created. I will predict today one of the problems will be that more companies will become privately held or closely held corporations. I will predict that hedge funds will grow, and they are already doing that, but this will just be gas on the fire. Publicly held corporations will be taken private by hedge funds. We will have private equity offerings. And all of a sudden, we don't have shareholders. We don't have a right to vote on compensation. We don't even have a right to own the assets of most American corporations. 
   Now, today I have all kinds of rights. One of the rights that the gentleman from California mentioned, and I have done this, I have owned stock in companies, and I have seen those companies, those boards of directors and those CEOs, capture most of the profits of those companies. I have seen them award excessive option awards. And what I have done is I have sold my stock, and I have gone on and owned another company where that didn't happen. I voted with my feet. 
   Now, the most successful corporations across this world are not in Australia. They are not in England. They are right here in America. And for over 100 years, we have allowed shareholders to bring proxies and ask for votes when they wanted to and by a certain majority get those votes. We have allowed that if the board of directors vote for excessive compensation today, shareholders have a right to put that board of directors on the road, and they have done that on cases. They have rescinded compensation packages. But whatever else you may disagree or agree with me, certainly you ought to be skeptical of the Congress of the United States, a Congress which does not allow the voters or our constituents to set our pay. They don't set our pay, but all of a sudden, we want the shareholders of corporations to actually vote on the pay of every executive. And we are mandating it. We are not just simply making it possible. It is possible today. It is more government intrusion. And, unfortunately, every time the government overreaches, the consequences don't come back to us in Congress. We will continue to earn a salary. We will continue to be up here. The consequences will be in these corporations, which are the drivers of our economy. 
   So, in closing, let's not confuse this as a debate on excessive executive compensation. Let's just all agree we don't like it. Let's all agree that we have given the SEC the right, and they publish these salaries. And as we have seen so often, there is criticism in the papers, criticism by shareholders and boards of directors taking action. But let's not substitute our decision, and let's not second guess. Let's not interject the Congress and have the Congress start telling shareholders that they have to, have to pass judgment on the salaries of all top management in every public corporation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, as has been said during this debate, this legislation amends the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act, and it seeks to amend section 16. Section 16 covers reports by officers, directors and owners of 10 percent or more of the equity of a corporation and requires them to disclose certain equity positions. Section 14 of that act, on the other hand, deals with proxy statements and shareholder votes. 
   Quite simply, this legislation requires a corporation, the shareholders of a corporation, to take a vote on the executive compensation of the top five or six executives, and therefore this legislation more appropriately ought to be placed under section 14. 
   I want to thank Chairman Frank. I noted that it was more appropriately placed in section 14. He offered an identical amendment moving it to section 14 also, and has allowed me the courtesy of actually offering my amendment, as opposed to his amendment, which I think is just further evidence during the committee hearing on this issue and in the floor debate of his willingness and openness to fully discuss, fully debate and allow the minority to have participation in this debate. So I commend him for doing that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would simply move that we reorder this legislation and place it more properly in section 14 of the act. 
   The SEC supports my amendment, and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1257, SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity on the rule to simply clarify what we're debating here today. 
   Now, we are not debating executive compensation, because the Congress does not set executive compensation. There have been many examples just in the past month or two of what we would judge to be outrageous CEO pay packages. There have been many occasions when our constituents have said to us, isn't that $200 million going to some executive, isn't that outrageous? People hear about these pay packages which, quite frankly, I'm not here to defend. One thing they say is, you know, are the shareholders being taken advantage of? Are the rank and file being taken advantage of? And in many cases, the answer is probably ``yes.'' There is no justification for many of these pay packages, these executive pay packages. Sometimes they are based on performance and value added to the corporation and to the shareholders and to the employees, but many times they're not. Many times they're not linked to performance. 
   Now, having said that, why would I have said that and then come down and oppose this legislation? Because, in fact, this is a mandate. This is Congress beginning to intrude on corporations. 
   Now, many of my colleagues on the other side would say, this is a nonbinding resolution. But it is a mandated resolution. If we pass this resolution, every publicly traded corporation, both large and small, the shareholders in those corporations must take a position on corporate executive pay for every top executive. In every case, every shareholder must vote on every executive and say your compensation is adequate or it's not. It's not justified. 
   How many times has this Congress substituted its judgment for the American people? For people in business? And that is again what we're doing by telling shareholders you must have this vote. This is a mandate. 
   Now, there is another reason that we ought to oppose this. Congress should never rush in and begin to change the free enterprise system, our system of competition between companies. What we have required through the SEC in the last year and we just now mandated this and to come back now with something more intrusive until we see that it works is our instruction and the SEC's instruction to public corporations that you must publish the pay, the salary, the compensation, the perks, the benefits that you give your top corporate executives.     
   And the reason we did that is, once that's published and shareholders know exactly what these top executives are doing, shareholders have the right today. And today they can bring a motion before the corporation, and if the majority of shareholders agree, they can take a position on executive compensation. 
   Now, that is not something we oppose, and in many cases these corporations are doing it. Morgan Stanley, just last week, the shareholders came forward with a proposal the shareholders took to do exactly what this  resolution wants to do. And guess what? The shareholders at Morgan Stanley said ``no''; the majority of shareholders said ``no,'' we are not going to get involved in something that might affect the excellent performance of this company, of this corporation. 
   We have had a system of corporate governance that is second to none in the world. It has made us the leader in the free world. It has evolved over centuries. It has involved over decades. It is part of our statutes. 
   Let me say this. The gentleman from Mississippi, the gentlelady from Florida, you have come up and you have said, look at some of these outrageous pay packages. I agree with you, I agree with you. I have picked up the paper. I have said, what is going on here. 
   But let me say, on many occasions I have picked up the paper a month later and seen where shareholders acted to address these issues. But let me say this, how many times have we been approached by constituents and we have said, well, when that law was passed, we didn't intend to do this, it wasn't our intention to do this. Unintended consequences. 
   Let me tell you something. When Congress becomes a second-guesser and a judge of executive pay for every corporation in America, every public corporation, ladies and gentlemen, we are getting on a slippery slope.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, first let me thank the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Frank, for his openness throughout this whole process. We have engaged in committee, in both hearings and in markup, in quite a long discussion. On most occasions, we came together; there was a consensus. And that's good. On other issues in this legislation we parted company, we had disagreements. That was the bad. There were one or two occasions where we had strong disagreements. Let's first talk about the things we agree as a body, both Republicans and Democrats. 
   I think we all agree that the government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Federal home loan banks, that they play an important role in the American economy, and more importantly and more specifically, in homeownership. 
   Homeownership in America is at an all-time high. You go to any country in the world and homeownership rates come nowhere near what they are in America. I think it was the legislation that this Congress, many, many years ago, passed in setting up these GSEs that has resulted in more affordable housing, readily available opportunities to own a home and realize the American Dream. 
   Now, in recent years, the growth of our government-sponsored entities has been astounding. In fact, let me give you three figures. And if you hear nothing else that I say out here today in support of establishing a strong independent regulator over these entities, it is this fact: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, excluding the Federal home loan banks, but those two entities hold $3 trillion worth of debt. When you add mortgage base security obligations, it is $5.2 trillion. Now, you may say well, what is $5.2 trillion? I can't visualize that. And I don't know any of us that could get our arms around that. I'm not sure any of us appreciate how big that is. But let me compare it to the public debt held by the U.S. Treasury. The entire public debt of the U.S. treasure is $4.9 billion. In other words, the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is greater than the debt of the U.S. Treasury. That is an astounding number. 
   We came together, both in 2005 and again this year, and we said we must establish a strong, independent regulator with power to make changes and oversight, and if necessary, forbid it to ever be the case that these entities became illiquid, to step in and prevent what would be, in either occasion, a devastating blow to the U.S. economy. 
   In 2005, we brought a bill to the floor and we passed a bill establishing a small regulator. Now, the chairman has pointed out that this is almost the same bill that we had in 2005, yet many Republicans who are going to vote no today voted yes then. That appears to be a contradiction. He has pointed that out. The lady from California has mentioned 2 years ago I was in support of the bill that came out of this floor. I voted to send it to the Senate. They pointed out earlier today, in debate on the rule, that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), he voted for the bill, now he is voting against the bill. There are differences. 
   Now, the gentleman from Massachusetts says there are no differences. If you are voting against the bill today, why did you vote for it 2 years ago? He asked that question a few minutes ago. Why did we? Why did we vote for it 2 years ago and vote against it today? Different circumstances. 
   Two years ago, I will remind the chairman, the gentleman from Massachusetts, the gentlelady from California, the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman sitting there from Texas, Mr. Green, Mrs. Maloney, who is here, the gentlelady from New York, they have all said why in the world are you changing your vote? Well, let me say to the entire body, there is a change in circumstances. And let me offer this as proof. 
   Two years ago, this was ``the same bill.'' The chairman, the gentleman from Massachusetts, voted against the bill 2 years ago. The gentlelady from California, who says why are you changing your position, she voted against the bill 2 years ago. The gentleman from Texas voted against the bill. The gentlewoman from New York voted against the bill. Let me tell you what some of those circumstances are. 
   Let me say this to the gentleman: This bill, in many respects, is better than the bill 2 years ago, and we need to pass this bill. And I predict, the gentleman from Massachusetts, the gentlelady, the subcommittee chair from California, this bill is going to go to the Senate. But we do have objections to this bill, and we are going to protest those objections by voting against the bill.  
   Two years ago, this is exactly, when you all were in the minority, the reason you voted against it. You voted against it. It's not the same bill. 
   Now, what is it that we find uncomfortable about this bill? It is not that we are establishing a strong regulator. It's that we are doing things that run contradictory, counter to what we are trying to do here today. And what are we trying to do? We are trying to assure the safety and the soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We are also trying to make them more independent and not beholding on the government. We are saying, quote, this implicit guarantee that the government will stand behind the GSEs, that we are going to establish an independent regulator and we are going to try to move in a direction where they are more independent and they function more like a private corporation, which was as originally conceived. But then, right in the midst of saying that, we established additional costs on Fannie and Freddie. And they are opposed to that, they are opposed to the additional costs. 
   We say we are going to make them sounder, more independent, more stable, and then we put on them an obligation of $3 billion, a cost. We say that we are going to take this occasion, the reason for this bill is because we are going to establish a strong regulator. We are going to do that to make them safer. And yet at the same time you say, we're going to increase their costs by $3 billion over the next 5 years.     
   We are going to make them pay a part of their profits into a fund. 
   Yes, let me say this: There is a problem in our country, a problem of the lowest income Americans, and I have said this, I have said this in committee, I will say it on the floor of the House; probably the group of Americans most in need of shelter are the lowest income Americans. And they, and the chairman and I are in agreement on this, are the ones who need affordable rental properties. We need to do something about that. We need to address that. We have presently 50 or 60 housing programs, and part of their responsibility is to address that need. 
   Now, what we ought to do before we establish yet another Affordable Housing Fund, we ought to see why the 50 or 60 that we have that are spending hundreds of billions of dollars, why they are not meeting this need, why money is being wasted, why there is still an unacceptable amount of fraud. Why don't we clean up and make more effective and efficient those housing programs that address those needs, instead of turning around and creating yet another housing program? 
   Not only do we address a goal that we have 50 or 60 other Federal programs which are supposed to address this, but how do we address it? First, we talk about how important the financial stability of the GSEs are, but yet we say that over the next 5 years we are going to make you pay $3 billion, $500 million a year, into yet another Federal housing program. 
   Then we do something else, because there is a chain reaction. Where does this money come from? Well, it comes from middle and low income American homeowners that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are holding their mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. So where do Fannie and Freddie get that money? Because they don't print money. Well, they will have to get it from only one place, and that is their customers, their clients. That is every low and middle income American that takes out a mortgage. They will pay into this fund. 
   Now, who won't pay into this fund? Upper class Americans, and many upper-middle class Americans, they won't. There will be no obligation on their part on this $3 billion. In fact, what is the mission of Fannie and Freddie? It is to promote affordable housing for low and middle income Americans. And yet those are the very Americans that you are going to make it not quite as affordable for, because you create a $3 billion obligation. 
   Mr. Blunt, the gentleman from Missouri, calls it a tax on middle class Americans. Now, I would say it is not a tax on all middle class Americans, it is a tax on middle class American homeowners, and he has said that. But we probably should, in fairness, include the low income Americans who will pay into this fund. We probably ought to include them. 
   Because we are establishing a $3 billion obligation, on behalf of American homeowners, low and middle income, we are going to offer an amendment to take out what is really an extraneous provision in this bill, and that is a bill to create yet another Federal Affordable Housing Fund. 
   We are going to do a second thing. We are going to offer amendments that say if there are benefits to this Affordable Housing Fund, and if it does pass, it ought to inure to the benefit of American citizens, those who live in America and who are citizens of America. There will be four or five amendments to do that. 
   We are going to oppose this fund. We are going to lose later tonight when the vote is taken. It will move over to the Senate, and, if it passes the Senate, there will be another $3 billion Federal housing program. 
   We are particularly concerned about, because when the FHA bill came up 3 weeks after this bill came up and we created in committee a $3 billion new Federal housing program, we raised FHA fees and we created another placeholder in that bill that will move out here, we created another Federal housing program to add to the tens of programs we have, or maybe it is over 100 programs. I am not sure. I have quit counting. 
   But in every bill that we bring out of the Financial Services Committee, are we going to establish a new multi-billion dollar plan to help low income Americans with affordable housing? And if we do, if we do, are we going to raise the cost to low and middle income Americans to purchase a home, the cost of that mortgage? Or are we going to increase their FHA fees when they do use and utilize FHA, have an FHA-backed mortgage? 
   What we said in committee during this whole subprime situation, and I will say the chairman and I tried to address that last year, and I really wish we had, we both have seen this coming for a long time. He and I are both happy that the regulators have started moving, and we will just see if that is enough. 
   But with all these problems in subprime lending and a reduction in liquidity in the mortgage market, we have said many times people are going to need to avail themselves of the FHA. But yet, just like we did in this bill, we increase the cost to those homeowners. It simply does not make sense. 
   Now, the chairman from Massachusetts says, oh, no, we are not increasing the cost to those who avail themselves of an FHA mortgage. We are not increasing the cost for the tens of millions of Americans who depend on Fannie and Freddie to reduce the cost of their mortgage. We are not getting it from them. We are getting it from Fannie. We are getting it from Freddie. We are getting it from the FHA. 
   Where do they get their money? They get it all from the homeowners. They don't get it from the Treasury. They get it from the homeowners, and these are the people we are going to tax when we pass this bill today. 
   So we are opposed to this bill. We are protesting the inclusion in this bill of yet another Federal housing assistance program, and we are taxing low and middle income Americans. 
   Now, in fairness to the chairman, a lot of this money will go to Louisiana and Mississippi over the first 2 or 3 years. In fact, because of that, there were Republicans, particularly 2 years ago, that rushed into helping on this bill because a lot of it was going to Katrina. But just 3 months ago we passed a massive bill in this House in Katrina relief. We agreed on the number it would take and we passed it. 
   Yet, here we go again with more money for Katrina, if we need more money for Katrina relief, and that relief is going to go into 2009 now, we are going to pay for years in the future for people who are displaced by that to continue to have shelter. We keep saying, well, 6 more months. Then we extend it another 6 months and another 6 months. And here we go again. Three months ago we passed what we said would probably be an amount we pretty much all agreed on, I thought, for Katrina relief. But yet here we go again. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, I said earlier in the debate, we do not need another housing program. If we determine that the 90 some-odd housing programs are not being effective in addressing the needs of low-income and middle-income Americans, then we need to first reform those programs. 
   But, in passing legislation to strengthen the financial stability of our GSEs, we do not need at the same time to impose a $3 billion cost on them. Those are opposing actions. 
   If we are to do it, we certainly don't need to do what we are doing in this bill, and that's impose it on those who depend on Freddie and Fannie. Those are low- and middle-income American homeowners. In fact, regrettably, that's what we do in this fund. While we do a lot of great things, we do that.

   I would like to briefly respond to two things that the chairman said. But before I do, I would like to acknowledge and thank the chairman. He said, in voting against this bill 2 years ago, I was not promoting and voting for it, I was not promoting socialism. Let me also acknowledge that 2 years ago, when the chairman voted for this bill, he was not opposing socialism. So, I think we both acknowledge that I was not promoting socialism, and you certainly weren't opposing socialism, nor are you today. 
   Now, the chairman has said that this isn't going to cost anything. It's out of the profits. It's not going to come from homeowners, it's not going to come from Fannie Mae, it's not going to come from Freddie Mac.

   Mr. BACHUS. Let me say this, the shareholders, that's the profits of the company, and the profits have to be generated somewhere. This idea that it doesn't cost anybody anything, and there is not a cost to the customers of the corporations, who are homeowners, it would be, indeed, a historic moment in this body if we passed legislation that cost billions of dollars, but it didn't cost anybody anything.     
   It would probably be the first time in the history of this universe. And if it does happen, we should pause, because we will have figured out basically how to defy the principles of mathematics and economics. 
   Third, the chairman mentioned Katrina, and I mentioned Katrina earlier in this debate, and let me point out, and I think this is probably conclusive evidence of why we do not need to pass a $3 billion additional housing fund. 
   The chairman correctly said that we passed this bill before, and I voted for it and it had money in there for Katrina. Well, this bill creates $3 billion, much of which will go to Katrina. Well, it was only 2 months ago that we appropriated $3 billion for Katrina. That is the 3 billion that we voted for; and there is no reason to pass legislation, which actually passed this body, went to the President and passed appropriating $3 billion, and here we come appropriating another $3 billion. 
   So I will continue to say we determined we needed $3 billion when I voted for this bill before, and I stand by that. We didn't need $6 billion, we needed $3 billion. That is why we voted for $3 billion. That is why 2 months ago we said this is what it will cost.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   What we've said on both sides of the aisle tonight, one thing we ought to be able to agree on is that last year we took $185 billion from the Social Security surplus, including everything that  we've paid in and all the interest earned last year, and we spent it. 
   This year, Republicans, Democrats, we passed a budget earlier today that takes $190 billion, every bit of it, every bit of the FICA taxes paid in by all of us, citizens, young and old, we spent it. We spent the interest owed from previous years on the surplus. We spent every dime of it. Next year we're going to do $200 billion. 
   And we can play the blame game. But I don't think the American people are interested in how much the majority is at fault, how much the minority is at fault. I think what the American people want is they want it to stop. It's, you can call it borrowing, that's a nice word. You can call it raiding. You can call it taking. But the long and short of it is we're taking money every day that the American people, the people we represent, are paying into Social Security, and they're expecting, upon their retirement, to start drawing that money out. And we all know it's not going to be there unless we change our behavior. Not you, not us, we. 
   In 2017, 10 years from now, 10 years from now, we're going to start having to reduce our benefits on Social Security.

   Mr. BACHUS. Let me explain what it has to do. And I think it's a good point the tape. You said, well this doesn't come to that. Let me tell you, if there is validity in taking $3 billion, there's $3 billion over there that we can take from the GSEs and we can do it without affecting their stability, and let's just presuppose for the sake of argument that we can do it without increasing the cost to middle and lower income home owners. Let's just suppose we can do all that, or shareholders. Let's suppose we can take it from the shareholders, take it from the profits and it won't cost us anything. If we can do it, if we can do it, why don't we put it in Social Security? Why don't we start a new program? 
   No matter how much need there is, and the gentleman from Georgia continues to talk about the need. And I, listen, I agree with you. There is a need for affordable housing for low income Americans. I'm with you. There are 90 programs right now. A lot of them don't work, and for that reason, there is a need. 
   And so we're passing another $3 billion over 5 years. I understand that. I understand there's a need. But you know, before we start addressing that need, let's keep our promises to the American people. 
   Isn't Social Security a sacred promise? How many of us, if we would raise our hands, how many of us would say no? And it is a sacred promise, why don't we start tonight with this amendment and keep that promise to the American people? 
   We're going to, you know, the FHA bill was in committee. We made an amendment. Okay. If we can take some of the surplus fees, the chairman, others felt like it ought to go on to housing programs. 
   We said, let's start putting it all in Social Security. Let's start tonight. We said 2 weeks ago, let's start 2 weeks ago and let's start putting it in to the Social Security until we reach a situation where we're not taking everything out. And once we get to, and this is what this amendment says. It says once we get to the situation where we're not borrowing, then this money can go into this new housing program. But until the day that this Congress gets to the point where we can honor our promise to seniors and not have to borrow their money from them, instead of letting it earn interest and a return, until that day to where we quit borrowing from the Social Security trust fund no new programs, no new programs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, as we start this discussion or debate about this new program, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund program, I think it is important to distinguish between what we disagree on and what we agree on. 
   The first thing that we agree on is that Chairman Frank and the members of the majority have a sincere commitment to meeting the housing needs of  low-income Americans, to make housing more affordable for low-income Americans, and we share that need. What we debated in committee, what we have debated on the floor of this House on two previous occasions and now, is how we meet those needs. 
   What this legislation does is it creates a new National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. This is a new Federal program. In fact, Chairman Frank has said this is the largest expansion of a housing program I think in the last 30 years. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a multi-billion dollar program. We say that this is not the way to do it. If we are to address the unmet needs of low-income Americans for affordable housing, this is not the way to go. 
   Why do we say that? Because presently there are over 30 Federal programs addressing affordable housing for low-income Americans. In addition to those 30-something programs at HUD, we have FHA and we have the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. What this legislation proposes to do is not reform any of those programs. What it proposes to do is take money from FHA and from the GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, and transfer that money into a new program. 
   So we end up with all the programs we presently have, which it ought to be obvious to everyone apparently are not working. You are talking about the majority of the $35 billion. And when I say ``not working,'' let me say this to the chairman: They are not meeting the needs, or we wouldn't need to create a new program. 
   But what we are saying is if there is something wrong with the existing program, if there is something wrong with the $35 billion we are presently committing under the HUD programs, if FHA or the GSEs are not doing their job, why come along and create another program? And then if FHA and the GSEs are doing their job, why take money from FHA and the GSEs, particularly because at the same time we are saying to those programs, we want you to play a larger role in the mortgage crisis, the subprime mortgage crisis in America, but at the same time we are taking money from those programs. 
   So that is what we are debating. We are debating whether or not with all these programs, with the large Federal role in creating low-income affordable housing, why it is necessary to create another large program. As Chairman Frank actually says, this is one of the most significant expansions of Federal programs for low-income Americans. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert).

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield to myself because I would like to make one statement. 
   Mr. Chairman, as I said at the start of this debate, the trust fund will be the largest expansion in Federal housing programs in decades. That is what we are debating. 
   Also at this time I would like to introduce, and I asked back in July for  HUD to produce the list of programs which today promote affordable housing. They sent me a list, and it has actually 34 programs which in some way assist low-income Americans with their housing needs. That is not my list; that is their list. 
   But let's again focus on, we have all of these programs. Do we rehabilitate these programs or do we shift money from one program to another? And if we are shifting money from one program to another, I don't see how this is the largest expansion of Federal housing programs in decades, or as the gentlewoman from California said, the most significant new program in over 11 years. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

I believe that it is very significant. I don't believe that what we're debating here is insignificant at all. In fact, I want to yield the chairman 15 seconds to respond, but I believe the chairman himself has said, my recollection, that this trust fund would be the largest expansion of a Federal housing program in decades, and I yield to the chairman because when I said that before, he shook his head and I don't know if he was shaking his head at that.

   Mr. BACHUS. What we're doing here is we're taking money to fund this large expansion of Federal housing, we're not taking it from the 30 existing programs that specifically address low-income housing, elderly, disabled, AIDS, senior citizens. 
   We're taking it from FHA and from the GSEs which actually that money presently today promotes an affordable mortgage for all Americans. So we're taking from low-income, middle-income Americans, we're taking from programs which promote affordable housing for them, and we're transferring it to other Americans. 
   In doing it, we're not reforming. There are 80-something programs. The gentleman had said how many programs, are there 80 or 30. There's 80 housing programs, 34 of which specifically address low-income Americans. 
   At this time I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito).

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield to another of our Members. 
   Let me say this about Members. Two Members on our side have spoken in favor of this program. It is very difficult for Members to oppose a program that actually creates or has at its purpose creating affordable housing. You will see that by the two Members who are speaking. 
   Again, I will say that the majority of our Members believe that if you have 80-something programs and they are not working, you have a program, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program which, actually, this program actually says that if HUD doesn't adopt regulations, just simply adopt the regulations and the distribution of that program. So they almost mirror each other. 
   If those programs aren't working, why take money from FHA, which is one of the most successful affordable housing programs in America? Why take money away from middle- and low-income Americans to create yet another program? In fact, if you think about that, you are creating two bureaucracies, two programs with all the Federal employees that go into those programs, and you are putting money in one program, and then you are taking it out of that program and you are putting it in another program. That, in itself, involves a cost to the taxpayers. 
   In fact, when you take from one Federal program and put it in another, as opposed to appropriate money, to me that's the worst of all worlds from an efficiency standpoint.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Members of the body, first let me address the practicalities of where we are. I am going to talk about the policies in a few minutes after others have had an opportunity to speak, but let's just talk about where we are. 
   The chairman has talked about the Senate this, the House this. But the truth is that the present legislation expires December 31. That is in 19 days. Businesses across the country are trying to arrange their insurance coverages for next year, and they have no certainty as to whether or how much there will be a Federal safety net in place. Nineteen days. 
   Even if Congress were to act today, there is hardly time enough for insurance companies to develop new policy forms, to obtain approval from 50 State regulators, to get them in the marketplace for review by the brokers, and to finish negotiating coverage with their policyholders. There is just not time. 
   Now, it can be the Senate problem. The House passed a bill earlier this year. That is all true, but that doesn't change the facts. Nineteen days. Nineteen days. Each additional day that we fail to get a bill on the President's desk means less ability in the marketplace to adjust and to respond to the new mandates in this program, or the Senate program, particularly the mandates on domestic terrorism. Policies are going to have to be rewritten. And both the House and the Senate bill does that, so it doesn't really matter which bill ultimately passes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I share Chairman Frank's frustration with the Senate. He described this ping pong, back and forth. A House-Senate conference would have been nice to work out our differences, although in a minute I will say why I personally believe the Senate bill is more in keeping with our original intention. The chairman of the full committee and I were two of the authors of the original legislation. And it says in that legislation it was intended as a very temporary Federal backstop until the private market could fill in, and I will talk about that and why I support the Senate bill later. 
   But as a practical matter, whether I supported the Senate or the House bill, there is only one bill that is going to pass. I think the chairman knows that, I know that, Members of this body know that. That's the Senate bill. 
   The administration has indicated they are going to veto anything but the Senate bill. If we pass this bill, they will veto it. The Senate has agreed unanimously to their bill. They came together unanimously. I regret we weren't able to do that. But it was, at that time, a 15-year permanent bill. So we didn't come together. But we have got to put this behind us and adopt legislation that has a realistic possibility of becoming law, and to do it right now. We need to do that on the alternate minimum tax. It is staring us in the face. 
   I don't think the American people, the taxpayers, I don't think the accounting industry care whether or not the Senate did this to the House or the  House did this to the Senate. On terrorist insurance, I don't think the insurance companies, the developers, the policyholders, I am not sure they care about all the internal fights between this body and that body. They are caught in the middle, and you do have a bill available. It's a Senate bill that will go to the President to be signed and take away this uncertainty. 
   The Senate has made it clear that they are not going to pass the legislation that the chairman is offering. It is not me; that is the Senate. The White House has issued a Statement of Administrative Policy indicating that if presented with the bill we are going to vote on today, the President will veto it. That's with less. The Senate is not going to take it up, so it won't ever get to the President. So that is just theoretical because the Senate said they are not going to pass it. And we have got 3 weeks left before the program expires. 
   Now, some of our Members think that the private market, that the TRIA 5 years after 9/11, a 3-year bill and a 2-year extension, that TRIA has served its purpose. And in a few minutes I am going to talk about the Treasury and that they believe that it has fulfilled its purpose and from now on it just retards the private market. 
   But we can vote this bill down, we can bring up the Senate bill, and we can put a bipartisan TRIA extension on the President's desk. We can do it this week. The time for further deliberation or argument has passed. Time has run out on us. 
   With all due respect to the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, I recommend we vote down this legislation, we bring up the Senate legislation, we do it in a motion to recommit, we do it in a unanimous consent, we do it in a suspension. We move it, we pass it over to the Senate, and we end the uncertainty. 
   If it is such a vital program that many Members think it is, why don't we need it in place? Why would we wait until a week or two or even after it expires to reauthorize it? 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, TRIA, provides a free Federal backstop to private insurers to protect them against acts of terrorism in the United States so they can have insurance. It was enacted, as all of us recall, right after 9/11 for 3 years as a very temporary measure. It was intended to give the insurance industry developers a 3-year period of transition to a private market, allow them to stabilize, to price terrorism insurance, and the third goal was to rebuild capacity. 
   Now, in 2005, Republicans agreed. We came together bipartisanly and extended it for 2 years. However, that same year, the Treasury did a study on TRIA, and here's what they said. They said, by 2005, 2 years ago, the program had achieved all its purposes. The insurance market had stabilized. They were pricing terrorism insurance, and they were rebuilding capacity.

We've talked about the importance, particularly on that side of the aisle, and many Members on our side, the importance, if we are going to have a bill, let's have a bill. If the program is important, let's have the program. Let's not let it expire. 
   If terrorist risk insurance will shut down New York, if in the absence of this bill you can't build a hotdog stand in New York, why would we let a bill expire that will, quote, shut down the economy of New York? We have an alternative. The alternative is to pass a bill that passed unanimously in the Senate.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, we have 19 days till this program expires. Now, if, as you have said, this is such an essential program, we need to pass a bill today. The industry needed 6 months. They've only got 19 days. Policies have to be written. We can continue to talk about not letting the Senate run over the House. We can continue to say we're going to stand up for our version of the bill, but ask yourself this question: How could 100 Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, come up with a unanimous bill, which many of us in this bill support, and the President said he will take it up and sign it, why are we here today delaying the extension of what many of you have argued on the floor today is a very important bill? 
   I'm going to say it again. Even if Congress were to act today, there's not enough time for insurance companies to develop new policy forms. There's not enough time for 50 State regulators to approve those forms. There's not time to get the finished product to the marketplace. There's not time to negotiate with policyholders. 
   So this idea that we don't have to pass it today, no, we don't have to pass it today. No, we don't have to pass it tomorrow. We should have passed it 6 months ago. We did. The Senate passed a different version, and we are arguing at the end of this session, 19 days before this program expires, as to differences between the Senate and the House version. 
   And quite frankly, as I have said, the Senate version, which is the version the Treasury Department urged on the House, the version the President has said he will sign, the insurance industry's happy with. It extends the TRIA program. Why are we here delaying? As I said, we're delaying this. We're putting this program at jeopardy. We're postponing a decision on AMT. The IRS is not going to have time to react to that, and here we are as if we have all the time in the world. 
   The American people are not interested in differences between the House and the Senate bill. I believe the American people, you know, if a bill can pass unanimously out of the Senate, which it did, and the President take it up, why does this House continue to debate long after the time to act and pass legislation? It should have happened 6 months ago. It can happen today. It should happen today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to myself such time as I may consume. 
   It's all come down to this. We can continue to debate the Senate, we can continue to try to change this bill, or we can pass a bill, send it to the President, which extends this vitally important program as so many speakers on the majority side have said. Let's be honest with ourselves. We know that this bill should have passed 6 months ago. We know it probably should have passed 9 months ago. We know that it will not pass in time for new coverage to be written January 1. We know that. 
   So here we are, arguing differences with the Senate, but I think the first thing we ought to acknowledge is the Senate unanimously passed this bill. Now, the chairman says that two people got together, agreed on everything and the other 98 waved good-bye. Well, let me say this. We, the majority of this body, almost all the Members on your side, if not all, and a good number of the Members on our side have said we need to extend this program and we needed to do it 6 months ago. It's time for us to pass the Senate language, send this bill to the President. You know, there comes a time when if what the Senate did is wave this bill good-bye, it's time for us to wave this bill good-bye. 
   We have engaged in a debate. The Senate has been unfair to us. Quite frankly, policyholders don't care whether the Senate's unfair to the  House. They don't care whether the House didn't get its way and the Senate did. The bill the Senate passed, I'm not supporting it because it's not only the only thing available today, although it is. Let me again read to you what the statement of the administration is. 
   The administration continues to believe that any TRIA reauthorization should satisfy these three key elements: The program should be temporary and short-term, there should be no expansion of the program, and private sector retention should be increased. That was the original policies and the original bill we passed. However, the administration will not oppose the version of H.R. 2761 passed by the Senate on November 16, but the administration strongly opposes any amendments to the Senate-passed version of the bill away from the administration's key elements. 
   And the only thing underlined in this statement to us is, accordingly, if H.R. 2761 passes, that's the bill before us, if it's presented to the President to be considered, his senior advisers will recommend him veto the bill. A very important program. 
   It's already too late for insurance companies and policyholders to adopt the provisions as of January 1. State regulators don't have time to print the forms. It's time for us to pass the bill. It's time for us to say, Okay, we didn't settle all our differences with the Senate, and we can do that. And, quite frankly, I am very happy that it is the Senate bill we'll be passing, because the Senate bill is very, very close to what we Republicans some year ago proposed. And we've gone through a year. 
   Provisions, the House has not gotten its way on certain provisions. It's time to act. It's past time to act, and we're going to have that opportunity today. We're going to have the opportunity to extend what you say is a vital program, what some of us say, well, actually we're not getting what we want because we believe that this program continues to be a free Federal backstop for private insurers and developers, and that's okay. 
   We want development, just like you do. We don't believe, as the Treasury does, many of us, that the program has served its purpose and it is actually impeding the private market, but we don't have to get there. We have compromised our beliefs and are willing to vote for a 7-year extension. The Senate unanimously came together and compromised their various differences and voted unanimously for a version the President has said he will sign. 
   The only thing that remains is on this side, the House side, that some in the majority have not gotten their way on certain provisions. And listen, I'm all for advocating a House position, but we've done that, and in the interests of the American people, in the interests of getting legislation, in the interests of closure, let's vote for the Senate version.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, whom I have great respect for, indicated several times that we are here today because of the Senate's inaction and intransigence. Now, I'm not going to argue that point. The Senate, what they didn't do is they didn't take action on our bill, but what they did do is they came together and they unanimously passed legislation, and that legislation is very close to what House Republicans advocated from day one. They did take action. They passed legislation. The President said he'll sign it. It's legislation that Treasury said is consistent with the original declarations of the TRIA bill. 
   I share the chairman's frustration on the predicament we find ourselves in. I wish the Senate had been willing to engage in a conference to allow Members the opportunity to work out their differences on the extension of this program. However, I will tell the chairman this: The House Republicans, many of us on that conference committee, would have voted to adopt the Senate language. So the Senate bill, in my opinion, had we conferenced, we would have still passed the Senate bill. 
   Now, the chairman has expressed his frustration with the Senate that they are holding a gun to our head. I'm not going to characterize it in that regard. Whether it is or isn't, I wish it wasn't so. But the clock has run out on this Congress and the opportunity to get anything done on TRIA has, as a practical matter, gone by. But if it is so important, and most Members of this body believe it is, it's important to pass legislation today, and that's the Senate legislation. 
   The motion to recommit removes additions in the bill offered by the majority and returns the TRIA language to that passed by the Senate last month by unanimous consent. The Senate bill reflects a bipartisan compromise with the administration. It extends the TRIA program for 7 years, the same amount of time that we advocated in a bipartisan bill in the House. We didn't get a bipartisan bill in the House. It wasn't a bad bill. It wasn't a bad bill. But that bill when it passed and the bill today, the bill that was just offered, is not going to become law. 
   The Senate bill includes coverage for domestic terrorism. Many in this body felt like it ought to include that. It imposes a liability cap for the marketplace. That's good. I think it's a responsible, measured approach to extending a vital program, as many have characterized it. Not all on this side agree. But the majority on this side will come together, the majority of the minority, and pass what you say is a vital program and we'll do it today. The administration has said they will veto the House bill. Both sides of the aisle and the Senate have indicated that the Senate is unwilling to consider it. We have a gripe against the Senate, but let's take that up with the Senate. A large number of Members in the House may continue to oppose the Senate bill. You have an opportunity to vote on it in just a minute. 
   The only TRIA extension that can get enacted is the Senate compromise. Many say I wish it wasn't so. It is. The only responsible course for this House to take is to accept the Senate bill and move on. My motion is the Senate compromise.  
   We have 19 days until TRIA expires. Let me say it again. That's not a practical time left for the industry to comply with legislation. In a reasoned society, a deliberative body would never pass a bill and ask the American people to adopt all that in 5 days. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot risk TRIA's expiration. We need to get the job done now. A vote for this motion to recommit is a vote to promote economic vitality in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (CJ'S HOME PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of CJ's Home Protection Act of 2007. 
   Congressman Ellsworth said a picture is worth a thousand words, and he held up a picture of CJ Martin. When the Congressman brought CJ's mother, Kathryn Martin, to my office, he brought that picture with him. It brought back memories to me of another picture, of not a little boy but of a little girl, and I have that picture with me today. 
   This is a picture of Whitney Crowder. Now, unlike CJ, I am happy to say that today she is an eighth grader in a Tuscaloosa city school. She is doing well, but she has had a lot to overcome. Just like CJ, she and her family lived in manufactured housing. 
   Let me tell you, manufactured housing in the South has replaced a lot of substandard housing. It provides affordable housing for a lot of Alabamians. As many as one out of five Alabamians lives in a manufactured house. It is affordable. It is clean, and it provides a very good home. 
   Whitney was living in one of these manufactured houses. An alert went out that said a tornado was 30 miles off. She had approximately 20 minutes; but the TV wasn't on. She didn't have a weather alert radio. And although the TV stations were able to track that storm and to tell within a quarter mile where it was going and when it would arrive there, she and her grandmother and the rest of her family didn't have the TV on. Some people say why don't you require these in cars. Why just manufactured housing? Well, in fact studies show when people are in cars they have the radio on and more often than not they receive an alert. 
   But as is the case in Alabama with this storm and another storm that took 32 lives a few years before that, people were asleep. I think the Martins were asleep. They had no idea that a killer tornado was bearing down on them, even though warnings were going out. 
   As I said, although I am happy to say that Whitney survived the tornado, her brother Wesley, 16-month-old, and her father did not. They were killed. 
   We have come to a time in our country where we really have no excuse not to do the few elementary things we can do to prevent the death or at least lessen the likelihood of the death of CJ Martin in Indiana or Wesley Crowder and his dad, Whitney's father, in Alabama. Technology today in an F-5 or F-4 storm gives 30 to 40 minutes' warning. With that warning you only need two things: You need shelter from the storm, you need a place to go, and you need to receive that warning. 
   Now, in 2003 this Congress passed the Tornado Shelters Act, which allows communities to use community block grant money to build shelters, a shelter from the storm, a shelter that could exist for the Martins or the Crowder family, and a mobile community. 
   I am happy to report in my district, the Sixth Congressional District of Alabama, we now have six of these shelters in or near manufactured housing communities. But people don't have to go to those. If they are in manufactured housing, they can go to a nearby building with a basement or interior room. Manufactured housing, a mobile home as some of us call them, they don't have basements and interior rooms. It is not wrong; it is just something they are not designed to have. But there are permanent structures nearby, whether it be a school, a tornado shelter that we authorized in 2003, or maybe even their parents' house. The Crowders had an aunt and uncle that lived only about 400 yards away in a site-built house with a basement. They would have been safe from that storm. The technology was there to warn them. The shelter was there to receive them, but there was no weather radio. 
   Now, what's the cost of a radio? Some people have talked about the cost that you are imposing, although the manufactured housing industry as far as I know has said they support this bill. Well, Wal-Mart just came out with a weather radio for $12. So that's the cost if you buy them in bulk. You can put them in for $12 in a mobile home, manufactured housing. $12. What is the cost of not acting? For the Crowder family there are all sorts of costs. The greatest cost was the loss of two individuals, a little 16-month-old boy, Whitney's little brother, and her father. Also the cost to Whitney and her mother and the 12 other people injured by this storm. The cost was several million dollars in health care costs. 
   Now, we are not here to save money; we are here to save lives. But this bill will not only save lives; it will save money. A killer tornado like this hit Oak Grove at night, and among the things it did was paralyze a man. That man is still paralyzed to this day and his cost of treatment is, as we all know, hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. One radio in that gentleman's manufactured housing home could have saved him a life of paralysis. But, instead, it took 30 lives and denied him mobility for the rest of his life.  
   As the Congressman from Indiana said, this is not about Republicans or Democrats. There are certain things we ought to say, it is time to do this; and technology has reached that time. When 40 percent to 50 percent to sometimes as many as 60 percent of the deaths every year from these killer tornadoes are in mobile homes, manufactured housing, and families live in these houses, whether they be our grandparents, our parents, our children, our neighbors, our loved ones, or people we don't even know, you see the devastation here. There were site-built homes here. This is a manufactured house. Twenty-seven manufactured housing units in this area, a mobile home community, no longer existed. 
   As the gentleman from Indiana said, looking at this picture really doesn't do it justice. People actually commented when they came upon this area which was about half a mile long and 400 yards wide, it looked like a garbage dump. You couldn't tell there had been a community there. It looked like there were a few junk cars because the cars were rolled over and over. 
   We can rebuild these communities; but CJ, we can't bring him back. We can't bring Whitney's little brother and father back, but we can do our best for literally pennies to prevent some of these deaths. 
   I think that is why 55 TV stations throughout this Nation have made this their cause. They visited us in Washington last year. They said, Look, we will get the warning out and there are shelters available. But please require the installation of a $12 radio so we can bridge that gap between warning and safe shelter. 
   That is what we are here to do today. In this House where we sometimes are in conflict and at loggerheads, can't we this time come together in a united way in an effort that will cost almost nothing and which the manufactured housing industry said we are willing to do this, and require these radios. And not only when a tornado comes or when a devastating flood comes like came to Texas and people were asleep in a mobile home community and several of those homes were swept away. This will save lives. 
   So I commend CJ Martin's mother. That's what America is about, someone saying I lost my son but I don't want it to happen again. It is about the Crowder family who wrote me a letter, a grandmother saying please push this bill. 
   We will never go back and know whether CJ could have survived had this legislation been passed. We will never know whether Wesley Crowder and his father would survive, but we do know by talking to people throughout the United States that these radios have in many, many cases already saved lives and will save lives if we install them in manufactured housing.     
   We have a shot at significantly reducing over half the deaths from tornados simply by taking the step together united, Republicans and Democrats, and passing this legislation. 
   I commend Chairman Frank for expeditiously moving this legislation, and I commend the Member from Indiana for his thoughtfulness and his care and dedication to this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD RECEIPT CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4008 and commend the primary sponsors of the legislation, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Mahoney, and the gentlewoman from Minnesota, Mrs. Bachmann, for bringing it forward. 
   In 2003, Congress passed the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, FACT Act, to  improve our nationwide credit reporting system and provide consumers with important new protections against identity theft, including the right to a free annual credit report. As the principal House author of the FACT Act, I can personally attest that when Congress passed that landmark legislation, it was never our intent to create opportunities for frivolous litigation. Because H.R. 4008 helps to clarify and underscore that intent, I am proud to cosponsor it. 
   One of the many consumer protections we included in the FACT Act was a provision that prohibited merchants from 
   printing ``more than the last 5 digits of the card number or the expiration date upon any receipt provided to the card holder at the point of the sale or transaction.'' Unfortunately, enterprising trial lawyers have sought to exploit this provision by bringing hundreds of lawsuits against businesses, large and small, for failing to redact the expiration date from credit and debit card receipts. The suits allege that this failure constitutes a willful violation of the FACT Act, even though many retailers believed they complied with the law by truncating account numbers on receipts. And a ``willful violation'' can put a company out of business: penalties for such violations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act are statutory damages of not less than $100 and not more than $1000 dollars per consumer, as well as punitive damages and attorney's fees. 
   Thankfully, we can fix this problem, and it is fair and reasonable for us to do so. Truncating the account number is sufficient in almost every instance to protect consumers against identity theft and credit card fraud, and there are no reported cases of consumers suffering harm from the appearance of account expiration dates on their receipts. Common sense alone should tell us that there are no grounds for these punitive suits, but common sense is sometimes not enough. Representatives Bachmann and Mahoney have offered a simple, technical fix that will address this problem where common sense has failed. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support their legislative solution and urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (HAWAIIAN HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   And the first thing I would like to acknowledge is both my respect and friendship with my colleague from Hawaii, Mr. Abercrombie. I have enjoyed a long friendship with him, have the utmost respect for him, and I associate myself with the remarks he made. I believe his remarks were fair and accurate. Not to parrot the Fox News network, but also fair and accurate. 
   He has, I think, correctly pointed out, colleagues on my side of the aisle, some are supportive of this legislation. Others have concerns about the legislation. And it is for that reason that we have asked for time on the floor just to express some of those concerns. 
   At the same time, as the gentleman from Hawaii has said, we have some Members that strongly support this legislation. He mentioned the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi), also the gentleman, Don Young, from Alaska, is a strong supporter of this legislation. And a number of my colleagues also voted for the legislation. 
   Others of my colleagues are concerned about some of the statements made in the Rice v. Cayetano case, that some of these benefits, and there are some 160 benefits that go to Native Hawaiians. And some of these benefits actually date back to statehood and, I think, the founding of the State of Hawaii. So there is some historical basis for these.      
   But, as I have said, some of my colleagues are concerned about that. 
   Some of them have pointed out the words of Justice Kennedy in that decision where he said this: ``America is a melting pot of cultures from around the world.'' And he said, ``As the State of Hawaii attempts to address these realities, it must, as always, seek the political consensus that begins with a shared purpose. One of the necessary beginning points is this principle: The Constitution of the United States too has become the heritage of all the citizens of Hawaii.'' 
   And that Constitution, as we know, in almost all cases is opposed to racial set-asides. So this disturbs many of my colleagues on my side of the aisle. 
   At the same time, as I said, there is some historical context for these, and I think probably utmost is that I think most people in Hawaii, several Republicans, officeholders as well as both members of the present Hawaii delegation, support these programs and believe they greatly have benefited the people of Hawaii. 
   Let me simply close by saying we had hoped to come united together in supporting this legislation. Mr. Campbell in committee had offered an amendment, and in closing I will read that amendment. Had this amendment been accepted, we would have been prepared, I think, to almost unanimously to have supported this bill. 
   Mr. Campbell's amendment said: ``Nothing in this title shall be construed to confer a constitutionally special political or legal relationship based on Native Hawaiian race or ancestry between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people for purposes of establishing a government-to-government relationship. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, as I said, with great respect for Congressman Abercrombie and also Congresswoman Hirono, I appreciate the civility and the spirit of cooperation in which we come here tonight. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Let me say that I appreciate Congresswoman Hirono's discussing the bill and the different components of the bill and also Congressman Abercrombie. And let me say that I do acknowledge that low-income Native Hawaiians living on the Hawaiian homelands, that they are under some restraints in building homes and financing those homes; and, because of that, there is support on my side of the aisle for some of these programs, and there are some differences of opinion. So I do acknowledge that for them, because it is on Native Hawaiian lands, it is almost impossible for them to get private financing; and that is at least the basis for some of these programs. And I do believe and I am hopeful that some of the discussions we have heard tonight will enlighten Members on both sides. It is not the intent of the minority to obstruct the passage of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, in my opening statement I talked about the fact that we had had negotiations over the past 2 years trying to really gain a balance in this legislation between lender and borrower to ensure that credit is still available to borrowers, to ensure that there was proper incentive for lenders to make loans which did not violate this act. And I believe, in fact, we have done that. It's a careful balance. And I must say that I think the sense of proportionality in the amount of damages to be awarded that we have it right. But I believe this amendment would increase potential damages and is not warranted. 
   We are not trying to create a right of actions in this lawsuit. We are trying to discourage lenders from making predatory loans. And if they do make predatory loans, then our function here is for them to pay reasonable compensation and also to cure that loan or to make things right. And I believe that the underlying bill, not this amendment, strikes the right balance between consumers and originators. 
   I also believe that this amendment might unknowingly remove the incentive for an originator to originate a loan. As some of my colleagues on this side have cautioned, they believe the bill already does that. And I believe this would just be additional evidence to those who are already opposed to the bill that we have the right set of incentives and rights and liabilities under the bill. 
   At this time I would like to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation. I believe that it does, in fact, address abusive practices which, unfortunately, are in our mortgage lending market today. I believe it brings some needed oversight to the mortgage industry. 
   The legislation that we are considering today is the product, and everyone acknowledges this, industry acknowledges it, consumer groups, Members on both sides, the membership has engaged for over 2 years in an attempt to come together to span political differences, philosophical differences, and to address the very serious problem in the housing finance market. 
   I want to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts. He has allowed us to fully express our opinions. I believe that this long dialogue which we have had has resulted in consensus legislation which, though not perfect, I believe will achieve two very important, very necessary goals. One is to implement reforms that will offer consumers needed protection against predatory lending practices; and two, I believe, and I sincerely believe, that this legislation will preserve working Americans' access to consumer credit. 
   I believe that the Members most closely involved in the negotiations which led to the manager's amendment sincerely believe we have achieved these goals. We need not let the perfect be an enemy to the good. Members from both sides will address provisions of this bill which they believe do not satisfy the goal I have described above. 
   I believe the fact that this legislation fully satisfies neither side is an indication that we are in about the right place in achieving a nonpolitical, legislative remedy to address this issue of such great impact to our economy and our families, both now and moving forward. 
   In closing, let me say it has always been my view that when faced with serious issues like this one impacting millions of families across America, that Congress has both the privilege and the responsibility of rising above partisanship and acting in the public's interest. With this legislation today, I believe we have done just that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bipartisan manager's amendment. It makes both technical and substantive changes in the legislation, and I think significant contributions. For example, the amendment incorporates language authored by the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller). His amendment clarifies the bill's anti-steering provisions to ensure that consumers retain the ability to finance points and fees in connection with a mortgage transaction. It also corrects certain problems in the provisions dealing with renters and foreclosed properties that Mr. Marchant from Texas raised during the markup. And it addresses some of those problems. 
   The amendment also includes provisions drafted by the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. Pryce) that will give consumers regular updates on the term of their mortgages and advance notice of any impending interest rate adjustments. Now, these are important improvements in the bill. And I again thank Chairman Frank and the other members who contributed to the manager's amendment, and urge support for the manager's amendment.

These are two glaring problems in today's subprime market, and I think both these requirements will go a long way towards making these loans sounder and reducing the number of foreclosures and delinquencies. 
   These issues are ones that the gentleman from Pennsylvania has worked on for many years. He deserves credit for an amendment that will improve many key aspects of the mortgage origination, servicing, and appraisal process; and I compliment him. 
   Chairman Kanjorski worked closely with my colleagues, Ranking Members JUDY BIGGERT and SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, in crafting the amendment. And the three of them actually offered the amendment that addresses legitimate administrative and operational concerns that have been raised, not only by consumer groups, but by the industry itself. And the mortgage appraisers, or the Appraisers Institute, actually endorsed this measure. And it maintains the underlying bill's strong consumer protection.     
   And this amendment offers additional strong protections. 
   I commend all three of our colleagues for their efforts and urge support for the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Chairman, as has been discussed both in committee and on the floor of the House this morning, this legislation is a result of Democrats joining with Republicans. Not all. I mean, many Republicans are opposed to this legislation. 
   But after 2 years of trying to address the subprime lending crisis, many Members of this body came together to craft legislation. That legislation is not perfect, nor will it be. I have concerns about it. 
   My Members, many of them, are particularly concerned about the liability provisions. And this amendment fundamentally unravels, at least a consensus that some of us have reached with the other part by gutting the safe harbor contained in the legislation that is critical to the functioning of the secondary mortgage market. Without liquidity provided by the secondary market, the homeownership dreams of millions of Americans, particularly low- and middle-income Americans, will simply not be realized. 
   If this amendment is enacted, the safe harbor for the secondary market would disappear because notwithstanding the satisfaction of the statutory elements of the safe harbor, securitizers would be required to cure any violations of the bill's minimum standards by a creditor. This would effectively eliminate any benefit from the conduct of due diligence by secondary market participants that this bill is intended to promote. Deprived of that safe harbor, securitizers would simply stop purchasing loans. The effect on the availability of mortgage credit and on the housing market across the country would be devastating. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from Ohio obviously points out a significant problem with foreclosures in Cleveland. It is actually a heart-breaking experience that the people of Cleveland are going through when one out of every five or six houses are undergoing foreclosures. You hear some pretty devastating figures. I know, I used to be an attorney for the FOP, Fraternal Order of Police, in Birmingham; and there is absolutely nothing more problematic in a community than a vacant house from a crime standpoint as well as from a property value standpoint. 
   The notice she requires, I think some of that is addressed by Mr. Green and Mr. McHenry, but it is at an earlier time. I would say this, I personally am not going to ask for a roll call on this. 
   Going forward, I think parts of this amendment are very good. I think stating what the new interest rate will be, giving somebody a notice. The Federal Reserve said some folks sort of, you know, this is something that they don't always see or focus on. But explaining what the new interest rate is going to be and how it is going to be determined, that could be somewhat problematic, but it could be worked in a range as long as the regulators are given some discretion. Offering the borrower the best estimate of what the new monthly payment will be could also, as long as there was some range or discretion in there. 
   The last two things I think are very good, offering alternatives that the consumer could pursue. That might be very valuable, as would providing information on HUD-approved house counseling. I think that would be very valuable. I personally am not going to ask for a roll call on this. Other Members might. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Florida because, as you know, on this side, as with this whole body, we come with different perspectives.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (HOMEOWNERS' DEFENSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, many of us are sympathetic to the insurance rate increases coastal catastrophe-prone areas have experienced recently, but there is no consensus that H.R. 3355 would offer any long-term help. Instead of granting long-term relief for middle-income coastal homeowners confronted with rising insurance costs, this bill would stick taxpayers wiith the tab of bailing out insolvent State insurance companies. In the past few years since some of the largest hurricanes on record tore through the gulf coast and coastal Florida, affected States have tried to protect their local markets, to limit rates increases, force coverage, or restrict market freedom. Competition is reduced  and homeowners are left with fewer choices--State efforts to secure more coverage for their constituents have ironically resulted in less affordability. 
   The Florida members on the minority side of the Financial Services Committee--GINNY BROWN-WAITE, TOM FEENEY, and ADAM PUTNAM--have been very attentive to the needs of their constituents and have constantly kept us updated on the problems there. We commend them for their service. 
   Of the two primary titles, the first does nothing that States can't already do under current law. The second is nothing more creative then giving cheap federally-subsidized loans to State insurance companies that are driving out the private market. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over the next 5 years, implementing this bill would cost $75 million. But even this number grossly underestimates the true cost for American taxpayers. CBO apparently finds little value in Title II of this bill, finding 
   that the federally subsidized loans would be made ``very rarely,'' as CBO does not expect any states would even bother applying for a loan following a disaster. In essence, they agreed this provision is of little value. However, taxpayers could potentially be on the hook for tens of billions of dollars, stuck with an enormous cost of capital for the loan's duration, and subject to the inevitable pressure to forgive the loans on the taxpayers' dime. This is the old two step ``ask for'' by people borrowing from government--ask for the money now and then ask for debt forgiveness later. 
   Because private insurers don't want to provide underpriced, risky coastal insurance, Florida created Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in 2002. While Citizens was supposed to be an insurer of last resort, it is now Florida's largest insurer with over 1.3 million policyholders and total exposure of more than $434 billion, yet only enough funding to pay approximately $9.4 billion in claims. This undercapitalization means that if a major hurricane hits Florida, Citizens could be bankrupt by hundreds of billions of dollars. To bring down the cost of insurance even more, Florida created a state reinsurance fund to sell cheap reinsurance to private companies to encourage them to write business in the state. This fund is chronically undercapitalized and has driven out the global reinsurance market, recouping losses through taxpayer assessments. According to a Georgetown University report released last summer, the Florida cat fund offers $32 billion in coverage despite having only $1 billion in hand [or, according to the Florida Cat Fund staff, around $28 billion in liabilities and $2.2 billion in non-debt cash assets]. 
   Mr. Chairman, the federally-headed consortium, while novel, likely offers nothing but an implicit federal backing for any issued securities, much like a GSE. According to the President's Statement of Administration Policy for this bill, ``there is no need for a federal role because states are currently 
   free to associate to address catastrophe risk.'' It is also questionable whether such securitization represents any significant advantages over the sophisticated private reinsurance markets. According to the Georgetown Environmental Law & Policy Institute, ``the mere creation of the consortium would likely skew insurance premiums and encourage unwise development.'' Masking the true cost of insurance puts homeowners in harm's way while subsidizing state cat funds and developers. 
   Perhaps most troubling are the provisions of the bill that would mandate cheap Treasury loans to state catastrophe programs. Today, Florida is the only state with a reinsurance fund that would qualify for these loans, but there is no doubt this bill would spur the creation of other state programs based on the Florida ``model.'' One property and casualty insurance trade association stated that that these loans would ``impede private markets and would send the wrong signals to states.'' H.R. 3355 even allows an interim period where other state-run insurers--such as the bankrupt Citizens in Florida--could receive these loans. We should question the wisdom of bankrolling state insurance companies like Citizens. Congress should also consider whether a Federal loan to an insolvent state catastrophe fund would be like the Federal Government's ongoing ``loan'' to the National Flood Insurance Program, which is currently carrying $18 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury that is unlikely to ever be repaid. 
   Republicans will offer a number of important amendments today to steer this debate towards fiscal responsibility, taxpayer protection, and free market competition. We will also consider an amendment by Congressman SHAYS to replace the text of this bill with a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission to report to Congress specific proposals to improve the affordability and availability of natural catastrophe insurance. We need to look more closely at the various solutions proposed by members on both sides of the aisle that could help homeowners access more coverage through the private market. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have an obligation to be thoughtful and deliberate when confronting this complex issue affecting millions of homeowners. The problem has many root causes, namely overregulation, overbuilding, and overreaching by state insurance entities. This bill, nor any one proposal, is the silver bullet. Congress should craft meaningful bipartisan reforms that address market dysfunction and the growing threat excessive coastal development poses. The Nation's homeowners and taxpayers deserve better than a scramble to rush a partisan bill through Congress. If the amendments are not accepted, we should vote it down but keep working.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (WE NEED NUCLEAR POWER AND WE NEED IT NOW -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, when I visited my district in August, people had one thing on their mind and one thing only, and that was the high gas prices, exactly, what a hardship they were on the people of Alabama, and I think people throughout the Nation. 
   One of my constituents in Bibb County, Alabama, handed me at a townhall meeting his gas receipt. As you can see, he paid $90, $89 to fill up his truck. Now, Bibb County, Alabama, the average resident of that county makes $312 gross a week. Now, imagine a county where the average income is $312. Now, further imagine that 59 percent of people in that county commute out of town to work; 59 percent of them have to drive 40 and 50 miles to work every day. And they're like this gentleman, $90 a day out of a paycheck of less than $300. 
   They told me of stories of how they pay their gas bill, they struggle to pay their rent or their mortgage, they struggle to put food on the table, they struggle with all sorts of financial hardships. Is it any wonder that 9 percent of the people in this country are behind on their mortgage when they're putting hundreds of dollars on their gas bills? 
   They're also angry about something else. They're angry because we're not doing anything about it. Not only is this money coming out of the United States and out of our citizens' pockets, but let me tell you where it's going. 
   I recently went to a country--many countries in the world that we're getting oil from, they don't like us. They hate us. But one country that is actually our friend is Dubai. And I went to Dubai recently. 
   First, I want to show you a picture of Dubai in 1976. This was before oil prices went up. That's the main street in Dubai in 1976. It's a dirt road. The highest structure in Dubai is that mosque that many are in, about three stories high. 
   When I went to Dubai, it didn't look anything like a small coastal village. It looked quite different. 
   The next picture that I am going to show you is a picture of when I went there. Now, you saw that $89 gas bill. You're wondering where that money is going? This is where it's going. And this is what it's accomplishing for Dubai. 
   That's where our money is. The Highway Trust Fund will run out of money next week. The people of Dubai are not running out of money. That's why the Highway Trust Fund has no money in it. 
   You see all of the construction there? I was in Minneapolis this week. I saw very little construction. You go to cities around America, you see very little construction. You see very few of these high-rise cranes. But let me show you what you're seeing in Dubai. Let me show you another picture of Dubai. 
   This is a picture I took from a five-star hotel that we toured. Look at the construction frames. Those are construction frames that if we would solve our energy dependency, they would be in Minneapolis, they would be in Denver, they would be in Atlanta. But 15 to 25 percent of them are in Dubai. That's where our money is going. 
   Not only should our people be angry about what they're paying--they should be angry--and these are our friends. This is a country that is our friend. Most of our money goes to countries that are not our friends. 
   Let me tell you what Dubai is doing. They've got plenty of oil, and they've got a lot of money. Do you know what they're spending their money on? Let me show you. 
   China, India, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi, they get it. They're doing something about their energy problem. China is building 32 nuclear power plants. India is building 17. The slide I just showed you of Dubai, an oil rich country, and Abu Dhabi, they're building nuclear power plants. They're going to build 14 nuclear power plants. We're building none. And let me tell you the people in Alabama and this Nation are upset that they are building, China is building, India is building, and we are standing still. That's another thing they're angry about. 
   We need nuclear power, and we need it now.  
   Mr. Speaker, during my energy presentation on the House floor this evening, I received assistance from our congressional page, John Brinkerhoff. John is a junior at Spain Park High School in Hoover. He is an accomplished young man who will reflect well on the page program and on his family, school, and community during his time in Congress. My sincere thanks go to John for his help on the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, because I believe that this legislation represents a missed opportunity to modernize the regulation of our Nation's futures and securities markets, I am unable to sign this conference report. 
   Section 13106 of the conference report directs the members of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, to work to ensure that by September 30, 2009, the SEC and CFTC take action under their existing authorities to permit risk-based portfolio margining for security options and security futures products. Depending on when this bill is approved and signed into law, the agencies would have roughly 16 months to achieve this directive. Because the SEC and CFTC have a fundamental disagreement over how to proceed, there is no guarantee that a legislative directive to reconcile their differences will yield a breakthrough in what has become a long-standing turf battle between the two agencies over this issue. 
   Chairman FRANK, Mr. KANJORSKI and I proffered a solution to this regulatory impasse during conference that would create a clear pathway the agencies must follow in order to realize a state-of-the-art portfolio-based margining system for customers of broker-dealers. Our targeted amendment to the Securities Investor Protection Act, SIPA, would extend Securities Investor Protection Corporation, SIPC, insurance to futures positions held in a portfolio margining account under an SEC-approved program, thereby significantly advancing the goal of risk-based portfolio margining. 
   Our amendment is consistent with recent recommendations by the Treasury Department in its Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure, which found that ``the realities of the current marketplace have significantly diminished the original reason for the regulatory bifurcation between the futures and securities markets.'' As Treasury has recognized, there are many policy issues--portfolio margining included--where a lack of action has placed U.S. markets at a competitive disadvantage to other markets that do not draw the same artificial distinctions between securities and futures products. 
   Portfolio margining recognizes the risk-reducing effects of offsetting or hedged positions in calculating customer margin. Thus, a portfolio margin system should align a customer's total margin requirement, the amount of money they have to put up in order to fund their investment positions, with the actual risk the customer is taking. 
   Today, the portfolio margin rules already allow futures positions on broad-based securities indexes such as the S&P 500 to be used to hedge offsetting securities positions such as options and exchange traded funds on the same index. There is uncertainty about how these existing portfolio margin rules fit within the regime that protects investors in the event of the liquidation of their broker-dealer. SIPA governs such liquidations, which specifically excludes futures from the definition of a ``security.'' Single stock securities futures are not excluded as they are both futures and securities. 
   Consequently, if a broker-dealer carrying portfolio margin accounts failed, its customers' net equity claims would not include the value of futures positions in a portfolio margin account. This could result in situations where gains in the futures positions are not allowed to offset losses in the securities positions, thereby reducing the protection the customer would be entitled to under SIPA. It also would create severe operational challenges as the customers' futures positions would need to be unwound separately from the offsetting securities positions. 
   Some have argued that the Financial Services Committee's approach to solving this problem would somehow prejudice the so-called ``one-pot/two-pot'' debate over whether futures should be allowed to be kept in a securities account. It does not. Allowing futures into a securities account would still require action by the CFTC. Our language would simply provide uniform investor protection in the event of a liquidation of a broker-dealer with portfolio margin accounts for whatever assets are in the securities account. 
   I am disappointed that the CFTC and the Agriculture Committee rejected the Financial Services Committee's proposal, the adoption of which would enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. markets and streamline financial services regulation. While I will not be able to sign a conference report that does not incorporate our language, I will continue to work with Mr. KANJORSKI and other members of the Financial Services Committee to eliminate inefficiencies and redundancies in our current financial regulatory regime that place U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage internationally.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (JUBILEE ACT FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING AND EXPANDED DEBT CANCELLATION OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I ask for such time as I may consume. 
   I speak in support of the legislation. First of all, let me thank Chairman Frank and Subcommittee Chairman Waters for the bipartisan cooperation they've shown in bringing this bill to the floor. 
   Mr. Chairman, this legislation is very good legislation. I would urge all Members to support it. What the legislation does, as Congresswoman Waters said, it allows the administration to negotiate debt relief arrangements with the 25 poorest countries of the world. It does not require them to enter into any specific agreement. It simply gives them that authorization. 
   Once they have gone to those countries and negotiated debt relief, that  agreement then has to come back to the Senate and the House for our approval. So we're not approving any specific action today. We're simply authorizing them to do what most of us in this body believe is the right thing to do, and that's debt relief for the poorest people of the world. 
   Alexander Solzhenitsyn said that a disaster is defined by magnitude and distance. We hear about a million and a half citizens of Darfur starving to death, and it is halfway around the world. It somehow does not grip us like seeing someone in our own community starve to death on the streets. But in reality, 1.5 million people have died in Darfur, and they're dying in Sub-Saharan Africa. They're dying in these 25 countries. 
   And people say, how do they die? You hear of 25,000, but what we're really talking about is one child at a time, one young person at a time, one older lady or grandmother that simply dies because there is nothing to eat or because there is no clean water or because there is no vaccinations. 
   Now, let me give you three reasons why we should support it. People say let me answer this first, and I'm going to answer it by submitting for the RECORD, and I would ask the Members, if you're trying to decide whether to support this legislation or not, I'm going to introduce the remarks of Ward Brehm, who is the chairman of the U.S. Africa Development Fund. He spoke at this year's prayer breakfast. I wish every Member could have been there. 
   Remarks of Ward Brehm, Chairman of U.S. African Development Board, National Prayer Breakfast, Thursday, February 7, 2008 
   Thank you, Senator Enzi. I am deeply humbled by your introduction and proud to be able to call you my friend. 
   Most of you were probably surprised when you picked up the program and saw a speaker you've never heard of before. Me too ..... One month ago, I sent in my registration ..... and was just hoping for a good seat! 
   My thanks also to the members of the Senate group for this opportunity. A good friend emailed me last night and said that if God was going to speak through me I didn't need to be nervous....... 
   God is the one who should be nervous! 
   My wife read to me from Scripture last night that Jesus said when two or more gather in His name He will be there. That's good enough for me! 
   My work has given me the high privilege of serving you, Mr. President, the American people, and above all, the poor in Africa. 
   The best way to help the poor is to help them not be poor anymore. The only way I know how to do that is through job creation, and the very best form of sustainable development is a steady paycheck. 
   It's been said that if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime. But that's not the full story. If you want to eat for a lifetime, you need to own the pond. 
   So a bit of background ..... Despite that eloquent introduction, I am a recovering Type-A controlling businessman. I've been described even by people who like me as someone who is often wrong but seldom in doubt. I was a bit of a problem child growing up. In fact, my pastor since childhood, Arthur Rouner, recently referred to me as a ministerial long shot! 
   They say that if God wants to get your attention He will toss a pebble into your life. If that doesn't work He'll throw a rock. As a last resort He'll heave a brick! 
   Africa was my brick. 
   In 1994, Africa was not on my personal radar screen. 
   In fact, the only thing on that radar screen was me. 
   In the Los Angeles Airport I bought a copy of Stephen Covey's book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. 
   I didn't buy it to learn anything, but just wanted to make sure he got them all right! 
   I was intrigued by Covey's notion of paradigms: identical sets of facts can mean something totally different because of your world view. 
   Somalia was in the news at the time, and countless numbers of Africans were dying from starvation. I felt no real connection to this humanitarian crisis. My radar screen was full. 
   Paradigms usually change because of shock or trauma, but I wondered if it might be possible for someone to change their paradigm on purpose. I supposed that if I were to see people starving, it would change that paradigm and perhaps much more. The thought left me nearly as quickly as it came. 
   But God sent me a reminder ..... One week later, I made one of my occasional stops at church ..... My pastor, out of the blue, took me aside and said, ``Ward, I'm going to Africa in two months, and I would like you to go with me.'' 
   I told him I couldn't believe the coincidence of his invitation given my recent reflections on Somalia. Then I said ..... ``No!'' 
   He looked at me in a strange way, and he said, ``Would you at least pray about it?'' I looked at him and said, ``You're the pastor; you pray about it. I will think about it but suspect my answer will still be no.'' 
   He must have prayed hard ..... because two months later, I found myself in the Minneapolis airport with a ticket to Ethiopia in my hand. I was surrounded (for lack of a better word) by church ladies. And they were hugging me ..... Then someone suggested we pray before we departed, so I found myself outside Gate 8A, holding hands with a group of strangers. And as I stand here before the National Prayer Breakfast I can honestly say I uttered my first heartfelt and sincere prayer ..... 
   ``Lord ..... Don't let any of my clients see me!'' 
   And then we flew. 12,000 miles to Africa, and a million miles from my comfort zone. I had the high privilege of having my heart broken. I saw poverty on an obscene level. 
   Children with flies on their eyes and for the lack of a 50 cent medicine doomed to blindness, the emaciated faces of famine, families shattered by civil war. And in Masaka, Uganda, I held the hand of a 22-year-old Mother as she died of AIDS and then turned and looked directly into the eyes of four brand new orphans. 
   I was an eyewitness. 
   It put a face on the statistics. I always believed that those statistics were true, but now they were real. It got personal....... 
   More recently, I took a long walk with a warrior turned pastor friend deep into an unknown wilderness along the northern Rift Valley that divides Northwest Kenya with Uganda. He took me to where they had never seen a person with white skin. When they first spotted me, they thought I was a ghost ..... a dead man walking. For a while, I thought they'd be right. 
   I fasted for five days on this walk to experience real hunger, but had brought along protein bars in the case of (as Lodinyo put it) an ``emergency''. At the end of the walk, I collapsed in a borrowed sleeping hut; when I awoke 13 hours later, I saw a little boy peeking through the door. While he was initially terrified, curiosity eventually got the best of him, and I noticed he was concentrating more on my stash of power bars than he was on me. He succeeded in snatching a bar, and immediately ran away. ``Kids are the same everywhere,'' I thought, until I stepped outside the hut, and found a little boy kneeling over his two-year-old sister with a terribly distended stomach, feeding her tiny pieces of protein....... 
   I found out 3 months later that she had died ..... another paradigm shift. 
   Now after more than 30 trips to Africa, the question I have been asked more than any other by my African friends is ``What do you pray for?'' 
   Most of us among the affluent have too many things. Too much food, multiple cars, great health care, retirement plans, insurance....... 
   It's only when things fall completely apart, and we're totally out of control that we feel totally dependent, and thus closest to God. Death, cancer, business failure, addiction, divorce, crises; these are the things that drop us to our knees. 
   All across the world including America things are continually falling apart for the truly poor ..... They are always out of control, constantly living in a crisis mode, and thus dependent and faithful to God's own commandment that we love Him with all our hearts. God is often all the poor have. 
   The leaders that God anoints are their only hope. And despite the often-horrific conditions they live in, the poor are thankful for their very existence. 
   Scripture asks, ``Hasn't God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and inherit the Kingdom?'' Yes, He has. I've seen it with my own eyes. 
   The question I'm asked the most by my American friends is, ``Why cross an ocean to help people when you need only cross the street, to help your own?'' It's a great question, and the answer is, of course, that we need to do both. 
   Solzhenitsyn said that disaster is defined by two things: magnitude and distance. So a small disaster close to home or a huge disaster faraway, results in what he describes as ``bearable disasters of bearable proportions.'' We've become too good at ``bearing.'' Our hearts should be broken by the things that break the heart of God. 
   Specifically in Africa, there are many faraway disasters of epic proportions. In 1994 ..... In Rwanda, a country the size of Maryland, the political genocide claimed over 800,000 lives. Nine thousand lives per day for 90 days. That's two World Trade Center disasters per day for 3 months. 
   Today ..... in Darfur, Sudan, 1.5 million homeless. Thousands terrorized, raped and killed. AIDS is killing 4,400 people per day in Africa, and even more are dying from curable malaria. Epic disasters of epic proportions, far from home for most of us. We have hundreds right here in this room from all around the world, our neighbors this morning ..... who experience these epic disasters close to home. 
   I do want to say this while I have the chance with the President sitting right here. Very few people are aware that due to President Bush's commitment and the resulting partnership with Congress there has been an absolutely historic four-fold increase in American assistance to fight poverty and AIDS in Africa. 
   In 2003 there were 50,000 Africans on Anti Viral medication and today there are over 1.5 million. I have not met a single person who hasn't agreed with this high calling.  
   Proverbs, the book of Wisdom says, ``speak up for those who can't speak for themselves and defend the rights of the poor and destitute.'' You have been that voice and on behalf of the ``least of these'' in Africa as well as the collective American conscience, I want to say ..... ``Thank you Mr. President.'' 
   Do you remember when Jesus was talking to His disciples, and asked them when He was hungry, why they didn't give Him any food, and when He was naked, why they didn't give Him any clothes? And the disciples said something like, ``Lord, we never did any of those things to You.'' I always thought (like most folks) that Jesus replied ``Whenever you did this to the least of these, you did this unto Me.'' 
   Except He didn't say that. What He said was, ``Whenever you did this to one of the least of these, you did this unto Me.'' 
   How often do we forget the word ``one.'' 
   It changes the meaning of what Jesus said completely. In our quest to be helpful, we can rob the poor of their dignity. In order to be of any help to the poor, we need to understand them, we need to know them, and we need to Love them. They are not a group. The poor is not a species. They are identical to us in their hopes and dreams. They love their families and long for a better life. The only difference is that they are poor. 
   And people don't stiffer and die in groups. It's one at a time. And each one of those deaths leaves an identical wake of agony to what you and I and our families would experience. 
   So what are we supposed to do with all of this? How does this fit with our own world, so different and so faraway? Frankly, I'm not sure, but we do have some clues ..... Jesus said, ``The poor will always be with you.'' What an odd thing to say. ..... especially coming from Him! 
   Jesus also said, ``To whom much has been given, much will be expected.'' So maybe This is a test of sorts. If so ..... how are we doing? 
   I have heard stories similar to mine of peoples' lives being changed: from orphanages in Russia to inner-city schools in Minneapolis, from the slums of Calcutta to remote medical clinics in the mountains of Afghanistan, from the streets of Washington, DC, to wretched prisons in East Asia. Indeed, all across the world people are answering Jesus' question, ``Who is my neighbor?'' 
   And these people are finding themselves changed, engaged, and discovering meaning and relevance by being involved in things much bigger than themselves....... 
   I believe that, deep down, most people would love to have God change their lives. Here's the thing: If asked, He will, every time, guaranteed. And while these changes may initially seem scary, they ultimately lay a foundation for a life lived on purpose rather than by default. 
   I will be forever indebted to Africa. Africa awakened me when I didn't even know I was asleep. I pray that everyone who seeks one will find a similar path. 
   I pray that each of you will find your own Africa....... 
   A few years ago my good friend, Gary Haugen, asked me the most important question of all....... 
   For those four orphans I was with in Uganda who watched their mother die of AIDS and were suddenly completely on their own ..... For a twelve year old girl kidnapped and sold into slavery in rural India ..... For a single mom evicted and homeless on the streets of DC ..... For each one of them: 
   What is God's strategy for letting them know that He is good? 
   The mother in Ethiopia sees her baby die of malnutrition. Why would she think God is good? And what is God's strategy For allowing her to know that He loves her? 
   The answer is astounding. The answer is ..... us. 
   Even more astonishing ..... He has no plan B....... 
   God bless you One and all.  
   And what he said is, and I'm going to quote him: ``The question I have been asked by most of my American friends, `Why cross an ocean to help people when you need only cross the street to help your own?' '' He said, ``It's a great question.'' And the answer is, of course, that we need to do both. 
   He goes on to quote many people that we look to for directions, many spiritual leaders of all different religions, including Christ Jesus. And that is the answer. Yes, we have an obligation to our nextdoor neighbor, but I do believe that we should have at least compassion and the desire to help people in other countries. We can do that easily and almost without effort, and when you say ``almost without effort,'' aren't we talking about money? 
   The first round of debt relief for seven countries cost every American citizen 50 cents. Fifty cents. But what did that 50 cents do? It reduced infant mortality in those countries by 9 percent. Nine percent. What is 9 percent? Well, in some of those countries, it was literally hundreds of children surviving that wouldn't have survived. It also included many little girls, millions, millions of little girls that were able to go to school who were never afforded that opportunity before, all for a cost of 50 cents. 
   This next round of debt relief is estimated to cost $2 for every American citizen. Now, how often could you reach in your pocket, could you put $2 down, and could you see hundreds of thousands of children being given an opportunity to read and write? How many times could you reach in your pocket and offer $2 and know that thousands of people would survive the night? 
   There was a Catholic priest, a nun, Sister Trujillo in Nicaragua, and she was asked sometime, how do these people survive? How do they survive in such conditions? And she said, I came to say often they don't. They don't survive. 
   And whether we pass this legislation or not, all over the world in these poor countries, tens of thousands of people won't make it through the night tonight. They will die. They won't see another day. But if we pass this legislation, we can be assured, because we have a track record of success, we can be assured that hundreds of thousands will survive. 
   In some of these countries, and these are stories that are phenomenal to me, in many countries for special-needs children, people with Down Syndrome, people with severe physical limitations, there was absolutely no services, no services. They were basically born into total hopelessness. In those countries where we've afforded debt relief and their debt services have dropped, there are actually, today, services for those children, for handicapped children. 
   Anyone who has children, little boys or girls or grandchildren, don't you take pride when they start learning how to read, when they start learning how to write? If for almost nothing you could ensure that little children all over the world have that same right, would you do something? I think you would, and you would vote for this legislation. 
   Let me give you three reasons again why this is the right thing to do not from a moral standpoint but from even from a good government economic standpoint. 
   First, it's yielded results. Wherever we have done this, we have benefited. The United States of America has benefited, these countries have benefited, the citizens of these countries have benefited. As I said, the poverty rate in the Sub-Saharan African countries which we gave debt relief is down 6 percent. Over 1 million children a day are receiving health care that weren't receiving it, all for almost no cost to us.     
   Second, and I think this is essentially important and I want to try to find this. This is a quote from the 9/11 Commission. And if you don't hear anything else that I say today, you're concerned about our country, you're concerned about our security, then realize that debt relief is, I believe, dollar for dollar the most effective program in assuring our national security because it helps to combat poverty, and it is poverty that leads to instability and hopelessness. It creates terrorism and terrorist factions to breed and thrive. 
   The 9/11 Commission, in talking just about programs such as this, said, ``Terrorism is not caused by poverty. Indeed, many terrorists come from relatively well-off backgrounds. Yet when people lose hope, when societies break down, when countries fragment, the breeding ground for terrorism is created.'' They go on to say, ``Where there is not basic education, where the children are not afforded an education, those are the very countries that the next terrorist threat will come from.'' 
   It's no accident that the U.N. listed Afghanistan prior to the Taliban taking over as the country with the fewest number of children attending public education, or any education. Now, we have a choice that we can stand aside and let these children go to madrassas where they're taught to hate America, or we can help these countries help their own future generations by allowing them to go into public education systems which will not brainwash their children. 
   And the beneficiaries will not only be them, it will be us. It will be those of us who have had children in the military. I can tell you, as the father of a young marine, this bill is very important to me. I believe that this bill, as much as anything else, allows, long  term, in our next generations, us to keep more of our children from having to go over and try to combat these terrorist activities. 
   Third, it's cost efficient. The U.S. share of the expected first round of debt relief under this act, as I said, will cost no more than 50 cents a piece for every man, woman and child in this country. 
   During the debate on this bill, we Republicans asked for and were readily joined by the Democrats in asking for some changes in this debt modification from the ones that went on in prior years. One, we asked the President not to grant debt relief to countries that are not moving in the direction of democracy, that are not committed to the rules of law which are committed to improving human rights and the constitutional rights and the fundamental rights of their citizens. Second, there are countries that engage in human trafficking. Under this legislation, they are not eligible for debt relief. They will either have to turn from those practices or they will be denied even an opportunity to negotiate. And third, they cannot harbor or promote terrorism. 
   Let me simply close by urging the Members; we all want a safer country, we want a freer America. And for America to be secure in the present global economy we really cannot ignore the rest of the world. We cannot just simply watch as these countries slip into chaos and discord. 
   This legislation, as much as anything we will bring forward this year, for almost no money, will, I believe, fundamentally improve lives all over this world, all over the globe, but will also be a very good investment for the United States of America, both economically, militarily and morally. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (JUBILEE ACT FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING AND EXPANDED DEBT CANCELLATION OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, in a minute, I'm going to yield to the gentleman from California, but at this time I yield myself such additional time as I may use. 
   In recognizing the bipartisan nature of our efforts here on the floor today and in committee and over the past few years, this has been an issue that I think has brought the Congress together. That's not to say that Members are not concerned about certain parts. Members have expressed, will this work? This may not work, I'm not sure  it will work. Well, it did work, it did work. We now have a proven track record of accomplishment. 
   Did we have failures? Yes. Did it work better in certain places than others? Yes. Were there places where perhaps it didn't work very well at all? Yes. Were there places that it amazed us as to how well it worked? And the answer again is yes. 
   Let me tell a story that completely blind-sided me. I was in Namibia with BOB GOODLATTE and STEVE KING, and we were on an agriculture mission. We met with the President. And Namibia, by the way, they were not accorded debt relief. They don't have that much debt, so they were not one of the countries that we extended debt relief to. So I was surprised when the President of that country sat down with us and one of the first things he said is, please express our country's gratitude. And this is one of the largest countries, geographically, and most strategic countries in Africa, right above South Africa. And he said, please express to the Congress and the people of the United States my thanks for debt relief and the blessings it has brought to this country. And I said, well, Mr. President, you didn't receive debt relief. He said no, but Namibia is much better off today because of debt relief because some of our neighbors did, and those neighbors were trying to destabilize our democracy. They were trying to send rebels into our country. And it stabilized our borders. And we've been able to take money from troops that we had positioned on the border, and also money that the United States had supported to help them do that, they no longer spend that money because their neighbors are more stable, and they are not sending rebels across the border. 
   So here is an ally of ours that we've not had to spend money on to help defend them from anti-democratic movements simply because the countries where those movements came from are more stable. So again, in places where we didn't even extend debt relief, we've seen tremendously beneficial things.     
   I want to recognize Mrs. Biggert, the gentlewoman from Illinois. Mrs. Biggert, as ranking member of the subcommittee over the past few years, has really taken a leadership role in debt relief. She's knowledgeable on the issues. She has been a real asset, and I thank her. 
   Recently, she and I asked two members of the Republican Caucus who had been opposed to debt relief issues in the past to travel on a delegation to Africa. They did. They came back, and both of them immediately within a week called our office, and I think they expressed to Chairman Frank, now I've seen with my own eyes many things that Members of this body had talked about. I've seen what a little bit of money can do and how far it can go. I see not only the great need, but I see the ability to address that need for what we in America call an almost inconsequential amount. 
   And I wish every Member, before they took this vote, could travel to Latin America, could travel to Africa, could travel to these countries in the Middle East or Asia, and they could witness for themselves many of the amazing success stories, countries whose people are better off today than they were yesterday. Not because we gave them money because this is not what debt relief is about. Debt relief is not about giving them foreign aid; it's about allowing them to help themselves, taking their money and spending it on their own people so that they won't be coming to us for a handout. This is about a hand up, a totally different approach, an approach that's working. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).

   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Chairman, the Farm Credit System does fulfill a valuable service to the farmers of America, and we have no argument with that. But we all need to recognize that the Farm Credit System is a government-sponsored entity. It has the benefits and privileges of a government-sponsored entity, and the taxpayers underwrite its operation. 
   Now, traditionally they have made what we call farm loans, agricultural loans. There is much concern in the private lending market, independent bankers, small-town bankers, credit unions and thrifts that this role has been expanding. In fact, over half the loans made by the Farm Credit System are to farmers or corporations valued at over $1 million.     
   Where they were making agricultural loans, agricultural mortgages, now they're lending money to Cargill, ADM, Jack-in-the-Box, and retail businesses.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (HOPE VI IMPROVEMENT AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Since HOPE VI, we've had a lot of success. I think the program is a success. How the program has been a success is not as simple as simply replacing units on-site. In fact, most of the residents of these housing projects have actually moved to other communities through vouchers. The main thing, I think, to remember is that it has eliminated some of the most dangerous and distressed public housing in the country and created livable, mixed-income communities; and that's very good. 
   To date, there have been over 200 HOPE VI grants, and to various housing agencies. Almost all of them have been a success. These grants have been used to fund public/private partnerships that have changed landscapes once populated by failed housing projects and crime-ridden neighborhoods into vibrant mixed-income, mixed-use communities, providing quality, affordable housing for those in need. 
   I think anybody on the Financial Services Committee who's attended these public hearings has heard the testimony of the living conditions that  these tenants in public housing were living under. High crime areas, vandalism, dilapidated conditions, paint peeling off, lead, plumbing that didn't work, electricity that didn't work, heating that was inadequate, areas where there was such a concentration of crime that many of the youth growing up in those communities really had no or very few role models. 
   In my home State of Alabama, there are several examples of projects where HOPE VI has made a tremendous difference. For example, Park Place is a 12-block section of downtown Birmingham that a HOPE VI grant has transformed into an attractive, mixed-income housing development. Not only has it decreased the concentration of low-income residents living in a crime-infested area with very few prospects of jobs, but it's also improved the surrounding communities. The surrounding communities, the property values were going down. It was more dangerous. And those areas have been improved. The commercial district downtown has improved. One of the stories that we need to realize is not only the improvement that we see in the community that was replaced or rehabilitated, but the community around it. 
   But most residents, if you track where they've gone, they have chosen, through vouchers, and a lot of them just by simply turning down housing assistance, they've moved to other communities, and they're doing quite well. They've moved to communities where they think there are better schools. The students of those residents who have actually moved and not returned, they're doing better, on the average, than those residents who chose to return. 
   In New Orleans, we actually found a lot of people chose not to go back to the original community because they did not trust the public housing authority. And that's one reason that we've tried to advocate not simply replacing these units on a one-by-one basis, and re-duplicating a bad situation. 
   The Tuxedo Court project in Birmingham is going to replace 488 obsolete units of aging buildings with 331 modern, for-purchase rental homes. All the residents who are not going to relocate there have been given vouchers, or if they qualify, public assistance, and many of them have chosen to move to communities across town. 
   Our vision, and I think the vision of both Democrats and Republicans on this committee, should be for the residents of those communities to better themselves and better their living conditions, their housing. It should be vibrant, mixed-use communities with good housing, safe streets, strong schools. 
   In a previous debate, I mentioned a public housing project in downtown Atlanta called East Lake. East Lake was so dangerous that the police refused to patrol it. And it's not alone. Children slept in bathtubs or closets for fear of being hit by random gunfire. 
   A developer by the name of Tom Cousins proposed replacing this crime-ridden project, where there was very little hope for the residents, very little future for the youth, with a mixed-income community. And that's been done. Today, professionals, accountants, doctors, lawyers, people with good income, are living side by side with families still on subsidized and on public assistance. The end result is a sharp reduction in crime in East Lake. But the more important result is a sharp increase in the level of academic achievement and success among the youth living in that community. 
   Now, for all the good, we are concerned about this bill. First of all, it eliminates the Main Street Revitalization program, which was for the benefit of smaller communities.

   Mr. BACHUS. I thank the chairman for that. 
   Another problem that we have with it is eliminating the demolition-only grants, because on certain occasions we feel like public housing, there may be adequate housing other places, or vouchers or a better system. But I think one of the main causes of concerns we have, and the gentlelady from West Virginia, is the green requirements. While some of the provisions have merit, we believe that they have, number one, the unintended result of reducing the number of affordable housing units that can actually be constructed under HOPE VI. 
   In fact, I have a letter I would like to introduce from the homebuilders, but also a coalition of National Affordable Housing Management Association. And basically what they say here is that the additional cost burdens of these particular green compliances will greatly discourage the development of these projects and drive up the cost substantially.

   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Chairman, Members of this body, let me say that there is a difference of opinion on our side and different opinions on our side. But I do believe that one thing ought to be clarified, and I believe I share this opinion with all my colleagues on this side. We believe the purpose of HOPE VI is not simply to replace a failed housing project model with another public housing project or community. We believe the purpose that all of us have, Republicans and Democrats, is to help those families in those communities have a better life and a better future, and hope. 
   As I think the Urban Institute and others have found, the majority of those residents, and I don't dispute what the gentleman from Texas said, there are and there will be residents that will say I want to go back to that community. But, hopefully, and one thing HOPE VI does, that community is replaced by a much better community, a much better mixed-income community where there is more hope, there is less crime, there is less poverty, and there are residents in those communities that can actually help those children get jobs. But most, and every study that has looked at this, and maybe someone on your side will correct me, most, if not every, study has shown that the average resident of that community is going to choose not to come back to that same location, but to relocate to another area because in most cases the area they would relocate to is closer to their job, it's closer to a school, or if not a school, it's closer to a higher performing school, and they choose, through a voucher, to relocate. In fact, a substantial minority of those residents relocate to another community, get a better job, get a better income, and move totally off public assistance. 
   There are a lot of fond memories in those communities, but there are a lot of people trapped in a circle of poverty in those communities and surrounded by criminal elements. And when we do this one-for-one model, I believe we are taking resources where we could give people the choice of relocating elsewhere and reestablishing what we had that we tore down.

   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the manager's amendment, and I would like to commend the majority on addressing several of our concerns. I think particularly the developmental timeline is very significant. I think it's a much more practical way of dealing with notifying tenants about changes, eligibility standards are much improved, and the provision on illegal aliens. 
   I do think that the one-on-one replacement provision, and I very much appreciate you, I think, making a good change, and I think it allows more of our Members to support the underlying bill. I do intend to continue to support doing away with the one-on-one replacement for the reasons I said in earlier debate, because I still believe that for most people the best option is for them to move out of this concentrated housing. I also think it has an unintended consequence of restricting the ability to create a mixed-income community that you attract a mix of individuals into. 
   So I will support the Neugebauer amendment. I think the green building requirement, it does do away with some specific references to the LEED rating standard. However, the Green Communities rating system for residential construction remains in the bill, and I believe that we have got to give more flexibility. Let's be environmentally sound, but let's don't adopt one standard, particularly as expressed by the Carpenters Union, the Laborers Union, also the National Home Builders. Let's not discriminate against American wood products. 
   As we continue to move forward, I am sure that the cooperation you all have shown today will manifest itself, and we will continue to work on that. I will support, and I believe very much we need Mrs. Capito's amendments on the green building requirement.

   Mr. BACHUS. Madam Chairman, the activities of Planned Parenthood are a concern for many of us. In Alabama, there was an unsuccessful abortion at a Planned Parenthood clinic, and the baby was born with severe injuries including a hole in her heart. Planned Parenthood has always been a glaring exception to the long-standing policy in the House of not allowing taxpayer money to be used to provide abortions. It claims that Title Ten money is not being used for abortions. The reality is that any Federal dollar that goes to a clinic where abortions are being performed, ends up facilitating an abortion. 
   The Pence Amendment is a simple way to clear up whether Federal tax dollars are being used properly. Title Ten money should not go to any organization that provides abortions. This is an issue of being accountable to taxpayers and consistent with the Hyde Amendment that we have passed on a bipartisan basis for 31 consecutive years. Therefore, I urge support for the Pence Amendment.

I congratulate you on your appointment to that important position, Mr. Frank.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (SEASONED CUSTOMER CTR EXEMPTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. That sounds very good to me. 
   I do want to thank you for this piece of legislation because I think it is both a predictor of the past in that this committee has worked in a bipartisan way to do the right thing for both the customers of financial services and for the financial services institutions. And I am very optimistic that we will continue to work together. 
   I am going to yield back the balance of my time. I have about a five-page statement that I will spare the body having to listen to. 
   I do want to say this: last year this legislation came up, a similar legislation to this, both in March and July of last year; so this is basically our third shot in less than a year. It amends the Bank Secrecy Act; it amends specifically the part of that act dealing with currency transaction reports. It does not amend the part dealing with suspicious activity reports. They will continue to report to the different law enforcement agencies. What this will affect is your drug stores, your grocery stores, your retail outlets, who every day are filing these reports. 
   It is estimated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that the cost of these alone is 25 minutes spent filing each one of these reports. So this is going to be a tremendous burden taken away from them. The American Banking Association said that it will result in a savings of $187 million annually.  
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 323, The Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act of 2007. 
   H.R. 323, which I introduced with Chairman FRANK, simplifies the process by which financial institutions may be exempted from filing currency transaction reports, CTRs, for seasoned customers while still ensuring valuable information is passed on to law enforcement. 
   Twice last year, legislation similar to H.R. 323 passed the House overwhelmingly: H.R. 5341, the Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act of 2006 passed the House by voice vote last July. In addition, the language was included in the House-passed version of regulatory relief legislation--H.R. 3505--which passed the House last March by a vote of 415-2. 
   H.R. 323 seeks to reduce regulatory burden caused by the Bank Secrecy Act. Specifically, the legislation requires regulators to promulgate new regulations and streamline the process by which financial institutions may be exempted from filing CTRs for seasoned customers. CTRs are required to be filed for cash transactions of $10,000 and above. This filing is required even in the case of seasoned customers--long-time bank customers that routinely deal in large volumes of cash, but whose business dealings are well-enough understood to rule out the possibility of money laundering or the financing of terror. 
   The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN, which administers the Bank Secrecy Act, received over 12 million CTRs in 2005. According to a survey conducted by the Treasury Department, more than 30 percent of  these CTRs were on recurring customer transactions that were eligible for exemption for filing under existing rules. 
   Unfortunately, the current process by which a financial institution can exempt seasoned customers is rarely invoked because it is difficult to understand, needlessly cumbersome, and subject to redundant renewals. 
   The filing of these superfluous forms imposes an unnecessary cost on both the financial services industry and the law enforcement community. 
   With respect to the financial services industry, according to data released last year the number of CTRs filed on an annual basis now tops 13.1 million. Even FinCEN's conservative estimate of around 25 minutes per report for filing and recordkeeping indicates the banking industry as a whole devoted about 5.5 million staff hours to handling CTRs in 2005. 
   Based on a survey by the American Bankers Association, the industry paid around $187 million in wages for this staff time. 
   A typical bank with $2 billion of assets filed 1,400 CTRs in 2005. These filings took 583 staff-hours, with 438 of the staffhours simply to report on long-standing customers. 
   With respect to the law enforcement community, not only do these superfluous reports add nothing to its efforts, they actually 
   make it more difficult for the law enforcement community to track suspicious activity by requiring it to wade through millions of pages of unnecessary paperwork. 
   The Government Accountability Office, GAO, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, and FinCEN have all recommended that the number of CTRs be reduced by 30 to 40 percent by simply exempting large well-established customers or so-called seasoned customers. 
   In 1994, the GAO published a report which concluded, based upon an extensive analysis of CTRs, that the volume of reports could be substantially reduced without jeopardizing law enforcement priorities. According to that report, in 1993 the IRS, which administers the CTR program, stated that 30 to 40 percent of these reports of routine deposits by large, well-established retail businesses have no likelihood of identifying potential money laundering or other currency violations. 
   William Fox, who headed up FinCEN from 2003 to 2006, testified as follows before our Committee:   
   We know that some of the currency transaction reports filed by financial institutions are of little relevance in the investigation of financial crimes. We also know that depository institutions, especially our community banks, identify the time and expense of filing CTRs as the number one regulatory expense. It is clear that our efforts to encourage the exemption of routine filings on certain customers has not brought about the reductions of filings that were sought.   
   H.R. 323 will reduce the number of CTRs by clarifying the exemption process, thereby freeing financial institutions from having to file CTRs for routine cash transactions with their long- time customers, i.e. supermarkets, fast food restaurants or warehouse stores. This will enable law enforcement to target its resources on CTRs where criminal or terrorist activity is suspected. Moreover, under the legislation, banks will still be required to report suspicious transactions engaged in by exempted businesses pursuant to the Suspicious Activity Reporting regime administered by FinCEN. 
   Let me close by thanking Chairman FRANK, Congressman HENSARLING, Congressman MOORE, Congressman RENZI, Congresswoman HOOLEY, and Congresswoman MALONEY for all of their work on this legislation. Since this is the first bill that the gentleman from Massachusetts has brought to the floor in his capacity as Chairman of the Financial Services Committee, I want to congratulate him on his appointment, and tell him that I look forward to working with him to build on the record of bipartisan legislative accomplishments that our Committee has compiled over the past several Congresses. 
   Finally, let me also thank Former FinCEN Director Fox, who deserves a lot of credit for his work on this issue. I look forward to working with the Senate and the new FinCEN Director to ensure that this important legislation is signed into law.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (PRIVATE JOHNATHON MILLICAN LULA POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to express my full support for H.R. 3532, naming the Federal post office in Lula, Georgia, in honor of PFC Johnathon Millican. It is a fitting tribute to a brave solider. 
   This recognition from the community where Johnathon spent his boyhood comes in addition to the inspiring ceremony held last July 28 at Locust Fork High School in Alabama, where Johnathon received his diploma. It was my great privilege to participate in the ceremony, in which Johnathon's wife and father were presented with his posthumous Silver Star award. 
   Johnathon's actions during the raid on Karbala on January 20, 2007 are the embodiment of the scriptural passage that says there is no greater love for a man than to lay down his life for his friends. His valor saved the lives of his fellow soldiers, and he died defending freedom. 
   At this time, allow me to introduce the remarks I made during the ceremony into the RECORD.   
   The actions of Johnathon Millican embody the same scriptural passage that we've heard at funerals of many of our veterans. It is: Greater love has no man than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. 
   Johnathon's life was short, but his legacy will stand. 
   His father shared with me a conversation he had with Johnathon just before he graduated here. Many of Johnathon's classmates were planning for college. Others had lined up a job. Still others were talking about how they were going to spend their summers, the things they were going to do. 
   Johnathon had already made another decision. He was going to enlist in the Army. The call to duty to serve his country was strong in the aftermath of 9/11. 
   Johnathon knew there would be personal sacrifices involved. He knew the fight would not be easy. In fact, his father reminded him that it could be dangerous. Johnathon accepted that. But Johnathon believed in the mission. From Iraq, he posted an observation on the Internet which I wish everyone in this country would observe. 
   The quote is, ``You don't have to love the war but you have to love the warrior.'' 
   One definition of warrior is ``someone notable strength of spirit.'' 
   Johnathon resoundingly demonstrated those qualities this past January 20th, when insurgents broke into the government compound in Karbala. 
   I think it is Johnathon's valor and our concern for all our young men and women in the field that brings us together. The Silver Star Award has given each and every one of us an opportunity to thank Johnathon and his family in a tangible way for his service and his courage. I very much appreciate each and every one of you who have come out this morning to show your love, your compassion, and your gratitude to Johnathon and his family. 
   It's a struggle to find the right words at a time like this. I think it's best to go to the soldiers in the field. Let me read from the email sent to me this week from Iraq by Captain Tom Morris, who was Johnathon's commanding officer. 
   ``As a commander of troops in combat, losing your soldiers is harder than losing family members. Speaking at Johnathon's memorial service was the hardest thing I ever had to do. 
   ``It brings me great pleasure to know that he is being awarded the Silver Star and that there will be a memorial at his high school in his honor. I believe the most important thing to do is to tell his story to those who do not know it, especially those who attend his school. 
   ``I will always remember him, especially his deep southern accent and that he was a country boy who was the toughest there was and that nothing really bothered him. I can only hope that I can be as strong, both mentally and physically, as he was. 
   ``He will be missed, but never forgotten. He was my soldier, friend, and fellow paratrooper.'' 
   ``Hero'' is an overused word these days. It's used to describe a TV actor or football player. There is a difference between fame and worthy accomplishment. 
   The reason we need to tell Johnathon's story is so people, especially our young men and women and boys and girls, do understand the difference between celebrity and heroism. The students who go past the memorial here at Locust Fork High School will know that a real hero walked their halls. 
   To conclude, a passage from Corinthians (16:13) is appropriate for Johnathon and all of the soldiers who protect us. It reads: 
   ``Be on your guard, stand firm in the faith, be men of courage, be strong.'' 
   These words apply perfectly to Johnathon, and why he is deserving of the Silver Star being presented to his family today.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (INDUSTRIAL BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I really believe that we do need enhanced regulatory supervisions over the ILCs, and this legislation does that. The Federal Reserve and other Federal regulators have urged us to enhance the regulation, and that is what this does. 
   It also does two things; and every year that we wait to pass this, it becomes a bigger problem. But we grandfather the existing ILCs. If we had done this bill 2 or 3 years ago, we would have had much fewer of these and we wouldn't have the problems that we have today, talking about, well, this commercial firm has one, this commercial doesn't. 
   But it was through no fault of the chairman of the full committee. Mr. Frank, when he was ranking member, pushed this very hard as a solution to this problem, as did the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Gillmor, and I want to commend both of them for their hard work over the past several years. 
   I also want to particularly commend the chairman of the committee, Mr. Frank. He has really made this a collaborative effort. It has been a bipartisan effort; and I hope the bill, because of that, is a better bill. 
   I think we are going to have a good vote here. I do think, because it is a bipartisan effort and it is a compromise, that we will have, hopefully, better success in not only passing this bill out of the House but seeing it ultimately enacted into law. 
   These ILCs, and they are ILCs, industrial loan companies, now they are industrial bank holding. This is the Industrial Bank Holding Company Act, because they really have evolved into bank holding companies; and what these started out primarily as is just a small loan company where industrial employees were able to borrow money. It is very similar to a credit union. The only difference is they didn't join as members. They just borrowed money, because they really didn't have access to a commercial bank at that time, and that was the whole reason for these. 
   As the chairman said and as the subcommittee Chair said, all of these exist in six States. The vast majority of the assets of ILCs are chartered in Utah; California and Nevada being the other States that have significant numbers of them. 
   As the subcommittee Chair has said, these things have grown 3,500 percent just since we started focusing on this.  It is really growing out of control. And what it does, we made a policy decision several years ago in this Congress that we would not allow commercial firms to operate banks, and this will really enforce that policy decision that we made. 
   As they have grown in size and nature and complexity, several not only regulatory but policy issues have been presented, not only to the Congress, but to the regulators. One of the concerns, as the subcommittee Chair and the chairman have both referred to, is a concern over mixing banking and commerce, which is really not what the American financial system is all about. Japan and other systems have allowed a mixing of commerce and banking, and we are evolving, but they have run into problems. We would like to avoid those problems. 
   An exemption in the current law permits any type of company, including a commercial firm, to acquire an ILC in six States. We want to close that loophole. We want to stop that. 
   Let me conclude by saying I do have one concern, and I am going to have a colloquy with the chairman in a moment. But I am concerned that this bill, and it is not intended and I know the chairman has said previously we hope to address this in the Senate or in conference, but I am concerned that it may discriminate against our domestic automobile manufacturing dealers. 
   The reason I say that is most automobile companies today, including the large foreign automobile manufacturers, have set up ILCs. General Motors has set up an ILC. But Chrysler and Ford do not have ILCs. And, as drafted today, the bill would allow the foreign automobile manufacturers as well as GM, and I am going to clarify that in the colloquy, to continue their ILCs. However, Ford and Chrysler, or DaimlerChrysler, which may end up to be Chrysler, does not have an ILC. 
   I am concerned not only that that is a disadvantage to the automobile companies but to the Nation's dealers that sell Ford and Chrysler products. People are going into this every day, they are thinking ILCs give them a competitive advantage, and I don't want to see Chrysler and Ford shut out of having an opportunity to have this advantage. 
   As the process moves forward, I would like to work with both the chairman and the ranking member to ensure the legislation does not create an unlevel playing field that harms our domestic automobile industry. 
   At this time, I would like to pose a question to the chairman. 
   Under the committee reported bill, Chairman Frank, a number of firms that already controlled industrial banks before January 29, 2007, are grandfathered from the new prohibition on control of industrial banks by commercial firms. The grandfathered firms that control a particular industrial bank are subject to a disposition agreement with the FDIC that is affected by the outcome of this legislation. Under the agreement, the FDIC has the power to waive the disposition requirement, depending on the state of the law, in 2008. 
   My question is whether it is the committee's intention that the decision to grandfather these firms supercedes this particular prior agreement and makes a waiver unnecessary, provided the grandfathered firms abide by all of the limitations imposed on grandfathered firms and operate under the supervision of the appropriate Federal supervisory agency.

   I would also like to join with you. You have both praised Chairman Bair, and I think she has done an exceptional job of trying to sort through this difficult situation. And I would also like to commend the OTS and the Federal Reserve for working a compromise on some of the supervisory questions that were presented by this bill. Late last week, they came to an agreement between themselves.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are here today because we all recognize the importance of our domestic automobile industry. We understand that the bankruptcy of either GM or Chrysler would have a cascading effect on the other manufacturers. We understand that the suppliers, the auto part manufacturers could fail. We also understand that dealerships are at risk, millions of jobs, families in jeopardy.     
   And even though we all want the industry to succeed, I cannot support this plan because this plan is a plan to spend taxpayer money without any real promise or ability to return the industry to profitability. In my view, any aid for the automobile industry should be limited to transitional assistance as a part of a fundamental restructuring plan and should fully protect the taxpayer, and this legislation does not meet that standard. 
   Some of the worst bills to come out of Congress are when we rush to judgment, and I fear that is exactly what we are doing here. Members have only had one or two hours to examine the text of this legislation. It was a measure which was the product of a closed-door negotiation between the Democratic Congress and the administration. It occurred outside the normal legislative process and the watchful eyes of the American people. 
   I see several glaring omissions or flaws in my cursory examination. We are creating a new car czar to manage these three companies from Washington; not a CEO, but a car czar. 
   Second, and this probably is the most troubling, this legislation actually imposes new and expensive mandates on our automobile companies. If they are in such bad shape that they need billions of dollars of taxpayer help, and we acknowledge that they are in bad shape, why are we imposing new, expensive mandates? This legislation, for instance, mandates that the companies comply with State laws that imposed inefficient and potentially excessive emissions standards instead of the more reasonable Federal laws. That cries in the face of logic under the circumstances. 
   Third, this legislation imposes Federal Government management on the Big Three, the wisdom of Washington. It is clear that the management of these companies have made mistakes, many mistakes, but a solution to that to set up a command and control in Washington D.C. with a Federal bureaucrat attempting to run the domestic automobile industry is exactly the wrong solution. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a bad process and it is a bad bill and one I fear, as we have so often done with these bailouts, we will come to regret. I urge a no vote.

   They are not lending. They should lend. They were given money to lend. They have signed a document that they will lend, and this will go a long way towards ensuring that. So I rise in support of the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, is the question to negotiate or not negotiate? Is that the question? No, that is not the question. The question is, will the government do the negotiating, or will the private companies do it. And what will the result be? 
   Well, we already know. We don't have to speculate. In Alabama, we have 17 companies that have negotiated and provide over 2,000 drugs to Alabamians under the present plan. Under the VA, they negotiate and they provide less than 1,300 drugs. We have all heard about Lipitor. Look at the drugs in Alabama that VA seniors cannot get. They are the most modern drugs, they are the cutting-edge drugs, they are the drugs that most seniors want. 
   CBO says it won't bring down the cost, but it might inhibit the delivery of new drugs. You need to read that before you vote. 
   The question is not about cost; the question is about choice. And I can tell you in Alabama, with the VA, the veterans don't have the choices our seniors have.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (ECONOMIC STIMULUS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. I thank the ranking member. 
   First of all, I'd like to commend Chairman Rangel, Chairman Frank, the leadership of both the Democratic and Republican leadership, and Ranking Member McCrery. I think that what we have here is good legislation. I supported it for three reasons when it passed the House. 
   Most importantly, and I repeat the words of Ranking Member McCrery, we're getting money back in the hands of American citizens. We're letting them make the decision on how to spend the money and not this Congress. It's a tax cut. It's a tax cut for many low- and middle-income Americans. I particularly like the tax cuts we've given to seniors, to veterans, and the disabled, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania pointed out. 
   Secondly, the Financial Services Committee tried to address the much publicized and very important problems with our housing market by increasing liquidity in our housing market for mortgages. There are people that are ready to buy houses, there are institutions that are ready to loan, but there is a lack of confidence in some of those mortgages and in that financing. And I believe the new limits we've given the GSEs and FHAs will help that market. We've done it short term. We'll revisit it if it needs to be for a longer period of time. 
   Third, I believe what is lacking most of all in our economy and our country today is a lack of confidence, a lack of optimism.     
   There has been a lot of expression of the importance of hope, the importance of optimism and confidence. And I believe, at least short term, this package will at least say to the American people, we have confidence in you. There is need for optimism. And, hopefully, in some small way, it will promote optimism and confidence. 
   I will say this as I close: until and unless we balance the budget, until government begins to spend what it brings in, we're going to have problems. Until we address entitlement reform, we're going to have problems. This government cannot continue to run deficits. If it does, the economy will not, over the long term, recover. 
   We have a spending problem in this Congress. We need to recognize that. We've recognized in this bill that we spend too much money, that instead the people ought to do it. We ought to continue that.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this economic stimulus package. 
   The version of the stimulus plan we vote on tonight is very similar to the version passed by the House last month. It includes a number of changes--including tax relief for seniors, veterans, and the disabled--that will extend the package's benefits to millions more Americans. 
   Madam Speaker, I support this package for three reasons. 
   First, it recognizes the basic economic reality that getting money back in the hands of people who earned it is the best way to help our economy. The tax element of this package has been called a rebate, but in essence, it's a tax cut for millions of low- and middle-income Americans who need it the most. 
   Second, it will help struggling homeowners. It includes several provisions designed to address the lack of liquidity in certain segments of the mortgage market. It temporarily increases the loan limits that apply to mortgages that can be purchased by the housing GSEs,  and increases the size of mortgages which the Federal Housing Administration can insure. 
   Third, quick enactment of this plan will encourage optimism among Americans concerned about the economy. Madam Speaker, hope has been mentioned very often in this Presidential campaign. Tonight we should send a message to the American people that our economy is strong. There are businesses that are ready to hire, ready to invest, ready to buy new technology. There is a legitimate reason for optimism today, and we should promote that optimism. This package, I believe, will contribute to that optimism and that hope. 
   Madam Speaker, let me conclude by commending President Bush, Chairman Frank, Chairman Rangel, Ranking Member McCrery, and the Republican and Democratic leadership of this House for coming together so quickly to assemble this stimulus package. I urge all my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BACHUS. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation and recognize myself for such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do rise in opposition and I do so reluctantly because I acknowledge that we are faced with a crisis, and because there are provisions in this bill that I strongly support. 
   The bill strengthens GSE capital requirements, it enhances the government's receivership authority if they get in trouble. These are significant improvements over the current regime. Even more importantly, the legislation contains a measure I introduced over a year ago to create a comprehensive system for licensing and registration of mortgage originators. This provision will do more to protect consumers and prevent many of the abuses that caused the subprime crisis in the first place than just about any other reform we can make. 
   The problem, Mr. Speaker, is that, rather than bringing up a clean bill to the floor to improve GSE regulation, to modernize the FHA and to crack down on rogue elements in the mortgage industry, the majority has brought us something else entirely, and they prohibited any amendments, it's a ``take it or leave it.'' 
   The bill before us today includes provisions that actually would undermine GSE safety and soundness and fiscal discipline by diverting billions of dollars from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and from homeowners and taxpayers to pay for three big new government programs. It does so at a time when we should instead be doing everything within our power to stabilize the GSEs and our housing markets and avoid the need for an even bigger taxpayer bailout down the road. 
   Mr. Speaker, the most troubling aspect of this legislation remains the affordable housing fund, which would siphon $9 million from the GSEs over a 10-year period to fund State and local initiatives. One of the primary beneficiaries of these funds will be political advocacy groups across the country that claim as some part of their mission the promotion of affordable housing. 
   When the affordable housing fund was first introduced in GSE reform legislation that the House considered in May of last year, I cautioned that this would be an additional cost on the GSEs; I said that on the floor of this House. At that time, their combined capitalization was roughly $106 billion. Today, their market capitalization is roughly $20 billion. One year and $86 billion in lost market capitalization later, a plan now to divert billions of dollars from the GSEs to fund another expensive government housing program is not only just bad policy, it's irresponsible. 
   Also, I believe unwise are provisions of this bill authorizing--and let me say this: The chairman of the full committee said that I have referred to this as a ``$300 billion program.'' I do that again today without apology. Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes $300 billion in new FHA loan guarantees. Now, the chairman said that I said it would cost that in my letter to the Members. But, in fact, I said the $300 billion program would do little to help struggling homeowners. I said a $300 billion program. I didn't say that would be the ultimate cost. In fact, it authorizes $300 billion in guarantee. If anybody doubts that, 412 of the bill, line 19, it says, ``The aggregate original principal obligation of all mortgages insured under this section may not exceed $300 billion.'' At no time have I said that the ultimate cost would be $300 billion. 
   In fact, in another letter to the Members I quoted the Washington Post and what they said about the cost. And that cost will be in excess of $1 billion in all likelihood. So they are three new  programs, all of them costing more than $1 billion. 
   And as I said, this new FHA loan guarantee program would have the effect of bailing out lenders and investors seeking to offload their riskiest loans on an FHA already close to being overwhelmed by the larger role that it's being asked to play in the mortgage market. 
   Many of us on this side of the aisle have questioned the fairness of asking 110 million Americans who are paying their mortgages on time, renting or owning their homes outright to subsidize those who make different choices. 
   The version of this legislation that the House approved last May at least had the virtue of being upfront. It required taxpayers to foot the bill directly for this ill-conceived Federal program. The version we are considering today purports to protect taxpayers by changing and shifting those costs over on the GSEs--the same GSEs are asked to pick up this cost, but at the same time we authorize the taxpayer to lend them money--by imposing these costs of the bailout on the GSEs through the affordable housing fund. But as we found in the last couple of days, as I said, that's the same thing as asking the taxpayers to foot the bill no matter how circuitous you do it. 
   On this point you don't take my word for it. Look at the editorial of the Washington Post, not a conservative newspaper. Here's what they said: ``The bill would fund the bailout through a fee on Fannie and Freddie, possibly $531 million in 2009. This is rather circuitous, given that government backing subsidizes Fannie and Freddie indirectly (and that they may soon be borrowing directly from the Treasury)''--and they will when this bill passes, or could. ``And it contradicts the purposes of the mortgage bailout, which is to shore up housing prices: Fannie and Freddie will pass the fees along to their customers, thus decreasing housing liquidity and depressing the residential real estate market.'' Despite that, despite liberal newspapers agreeing with conservatives, it's in the bill, and we won't have an opportunity to get it out. 
   The editorial concludes by asking the question, and I asked the same question: ``Wouldn't it be simpler and safer to let a new regulator address the GSEs' capital needs before plunging them even deeper into the housing quagmire?'' Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more. 
   In addition to asking taxpayers to bail out the GSEs and lenders and investors seeking to rid their portfolios of their most toxic mortgages, this bill goes a step further. It establishes yet a third government program, this one a $4 billion grant program--paid for by the taxpayers--to fund the purchase of foreclosed properties by States and local governments. This is nothing more than a bailout of investors and real estate speculators who made risky investments but who will now be able to dump their foreclosed properties on State and local governments. 
   This approach invites more, not fewer, foreclosures by providing incentives to lenders to foreclose on properties rather than attempt to work with struggling homeowners to keep their houses or property. Besides, setting the government up as a landlord is not my idea of a wise use of taxpayer dollars or an answer to the housing crisis. What in the world it is doing in a bill purportedly designed to avert foreclosures and assist troubled homeowners is anyone's guess. 
   This legislation unfortunately contains yet another--despite all that--irresponsible, in my opinion, provision from the Senate-passed bill, one that establishes a moratorium on the FHA's authority to engage in risk-based pricing. At a time when we're asking the FHA to play a greater role in assisting troubled homeowners seeking to refinance, barring the agency from pricing its product according to risk is a serious mistake. Not only will this moratorium prevent the FHA from serving more homeowners, it will lead to higher mortgage costs for everyone as the FHA is forced to raise its upfront and annual premiums to compensate for its inability to charge premiums based on risk. 
   If we've learned anything in the last 2 or 3 years it's that there's risk out there, and we ought to price for that risk. We don't do that in this bill; in fact, we establish a moratorium to stop that. 
   This legislation--the entire legislation--presents us with extremely tough choices. It includes long-needed reforms, as I said, but it also adds costly and unnecessary programs that make it impossible for many of us to support. It takes money from the GSEs when they're already in trouble. It creates two big new government housing programs even though there's an abundance of housing programs already existing. If they are not doing the job, let's reform the ones we have. And it places a moratorium on risk-based pricing. 
   If that weren't enough, the bill now includes a proposal to support the GSEs by direct government investment of taxpayer dollars in the common stock of these privately held companies. 
   When the Treasury proposals were announced last week, we were told it was essential to avoid a catastrophic failure of Fannie and Freddie and the turmoil in global capital markets. We were told we needed to pass it within 48 hours. Confusingly, at the same time we were told that the Treasury needed blank check authority, we were assured that it would never be used. We were told it must be voted on immediately, even though we were told at the same time the Federal Reserve had agreed to provide liquidity in the event of an emergency if there was one. 
   Those assurances notwithstanding, giving unlimited authority to a government agency for unprecedented action is a serious matter in a system that's based on checks and balances. Deciding this issue without hearings and within a 1-week span with virtually no deliberation and no opportunity to amend is a surrender of congressional responsibility. Congress did not do that with Chrysler, Lockheed or Conrail, which all were extensively studied and debated before action taken. 
   It is likely that the concept of ``If you build it, they will come'' applies here; if we give them this authority, it will be used, and I believe not only to provide liquidity, but to purchase an equity stake in these private, stockholder-owned companies. 
   Even a small government investment in Fannie and Freddie is incremental nationalization, let's be honest, a path our government should not go down without serious consideration of the consequences. One is crowding out the private mortgage market as we give them ever larger sources of cheap money. How do private lenders compete? They don't. Not fairly. 
   We should hesitate to saddle taxpayers with losses in tough times that should be absorbed by those who took the risks and reaped the billions in profits when times were good. 
   By raising concerns, those of us who questioned a rush to judgment on a blank check request were able to delay the consideration last week and to make some beneficial changes in the bill. As a result, even Senators Dodd and Shelby have now acknowledged--and I think Senator Shelby has thought all along--that the blank check needs to be examined very carefully. 
   Mr. Speaker, we can do better than this bill. Given the high stakes, we must do better. We should reject this legislation and immediately substitute it with a clean bill that reforms the GSEs, modernizes FHA, and increases the Treasury lending authority by a set amount. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
