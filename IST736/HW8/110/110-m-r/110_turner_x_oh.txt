<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (WELCOMING PASTOR KELLY <b>MCINERNEY </b> -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to welcome today our guest chaplain, Pastor Kelly McInerney, from Wilmington, Ohio, and I thank him for leading the House in prayer. 
   Paster McInerney has led the congregation at Bible Baptist Church in Wilmington since its inception in 1995. The church began as a mission project of the Hillsboro Bible Baptist Church. Before the construction of its first facility in 2001, the congregation met in a storefront, a former bank building, and a historic theater in the heart of downtown Wilmington. The church's membership and attendance have grown steadily each year from a group of 40 charter members to a congregation whose average Sunday morning attendance currently averages over 1,000 persons. 
   Pastor McInerney is a respected community leader who is devoted to his congregation and his family and his faith. He is currently the chaplain for the Southwest District of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, the Clinton County Sheriff's Office, and the Wilmington City Fire Department. As part of his service to the first responders of our community, Pastor McInerney also holds annual Law Enforcement Appreciation Day at his church. The event recognizes outstanding members of the law enforcement community and pays tribute to all the officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty in the history of Clinton County. 
   His family includes his wife Theresa, and his sons Kenton and Kaden. It is with great pleasure that I welcome Pastor McInerney and his family to Washington, and I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking our guest chaplain for his thoughtful and inspirational words.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, today Iraq remains the most important issue facing our Nation. The American people want congressional action in a bipartisan fashion. The rhetoric of the last 6 months has left the American people saddened that the work on this  House floor has been focused upon partisan division. The most important action this House of Representatives could take today is to support our troops by coming together in a bipartisan effort. 
   I want to thank Chairman Skelton, and I also want to thank subcommittee Chairman Abercrombie for his leadership on H.R. 3087, which gives us an opportunity for a bipartisan step in the Iraq debate. 
   I am a cosponsor of this bill, which was reported out of the Armed Services Committee by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 55-2. 
   H.R. 3087, as amended, supports our troops, our national interests, and our counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda in Iraq. 
   The bill requires our Department of Defense to undertake robust and comprehensive contingency planning for a redeployment of the Armed Forces from Iraq. The bill recognizes that the role and mission of our Armed Forces in Iraq will change and properly acknowledges that the Government of Iraq must be responsible for Iraq's future. 
   As America's responsibilities shift, our focus must include planning to protect our vital national interests and our troops. 
   In a letter I sent to our Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, on August 1, 2007, I elaborated saying that, for example, this bill states the contingency planning element should include ensuring appropriate protection for the Armed Forces in Iraq, providing appropriate protection in Iraq for United States civilians, contractors and third-party nationals, and Iraqi nationals who have assisted the United States mission in Iraq, maintaining and enhancing the ability of the United States Government to eliminate and disrupt al Qaeda, and affiliated terrorist organizations and preserving military equipment necessary to defend the national security interests of the United States. 
   I want to thank Chairman Abercrombie for his leadership on this bill and for his insistence that this bill come to the House floor for a vote. I urge all of my colleagues in the House to support this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (WRIGHT BROTHERS-DUNBAR NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands Subcommittee Chairman  Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop, as well as Natural Resources full committee Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young, for their support in bringing this bill to the floor today. 
   H.R. 4191, the Wright Brothers-Dunbar National Historical Park Designation Act, is identical to H.R. 4612 from the 109th Congress which passed the House Committee on Resources by unanimous consent on June 21, 2006. It renames the Dayton Aviation National Historic Park as the Wright Brothers-Dunbar National Historical Park. 
   In 2002, Chairman and Federal Judge Walter Rice of the Dayton Aviation Heritage Commission appointed a committee made up of commission members to make recommendations regarding the name of the Dayton Aviation National Historic Park. 
   The committee held several hearings and solicited comments from businesses, government, stakeholders, neighborhood and citizens groups on the name change. Based on the public comments, the committee recommended to the commission that the name of the park, Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, be changed to the Wright Brothers-Dunbar National Historical Park. 
   Following input from the community, that committee recommended to the commission that the name of the park be changed to the Wright Brothers-Dunbar National Historical Park, which was approved by the full commission and the National Park Service in 2003. 
   The commission recognized a number of reasons for the name change. The new name establishes a clear connection to the universally recognized Wright brothers, the inventors of the airplane, and the new name also creates a better link between the park and the primary park assets. All four of the park sites, a majority of interpretive exhibits and media at the park sites describe the accomplishments of the Wright brothers and the first recognized African American Poet Laureate, Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
   Finally, the new name also establishes a better distinction between the park and the new National Aviation Heritage Area. 
   The new name of this park will truly be a reflection of Dayton's heritage, that of innovation and creativity. The Wright brothers' airplane and Dunbar's famous poems are two historic assets which make Dayton a great place to call home. It is fitting that the new park name pays homage to Dayton's hometown heroes, Paul Laurence Dunbar and Orville and Wilbur Wright. 
   It is also important to note that the National Heritage Park in Dayton is unique in that it is a scattered site national park and it works with regional partners to advance the park's mission. The Park Service partners with ``Dayton History'' at Carillon Park and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to provide maintenance and program assistance for park assets. 
   Both entities contain different parts of the national park. The Wright Flyer III, the world's first practical airplane, is located at Carillon Park, and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field, where the Wright brothers perfected flight, is located on the grounds of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This bill authorizes grant funding to these partner organizations to ensure their continued cooperation with the Park Service in fulfilling the mission of the park. 
   Mr. Speaker, today's bill is the result of a community process which has resulted in an improved and more appropriate name to a regional asset, a name which reflects Dayton's true heritage. While Ohio is the birthplace of aviation, Dayton is the birthplace of the first airplane and the birthplace of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where 1 million people every year visit the National Museum of the United States Air Force. 
   Dayton's future is bright, with over 1,000 jobs headed to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as a result of 2005 BRAC process, and it will continue to be a leader in American innovation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Wright brothers and Paul Laurence Dunbar would be proud of the accomplishments in their hometown, and I am proud today to speak for this bill, which will honor their legacies.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   When it comes to the records of a President, we need to ensure that the public's interest remains paramount. As I noted in the subcommittee, it is important that we distinguish the Nation's interest from that of a former President's interest. We need to achieve that critical balance between the President's constitutional privilege and the public's right to know. 
   The bill is one step toward preserving and protecting the constitutional prerogatives of Presidents while preserving public access to important and historic Presidential records. The legislation before us established a process whereby incumbent and former Presidents could, within specified time limits, review records prior to their release and determine whether to assert constitutional privilege claims against release of the records. 
   This legislation is identical to H.R. 4187, introduced in the 107th Congress and approved by the committee under the leadership of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton). I want to commend him for his work in this area. 
   In addition, I want to highlight an amendment which was approved by the full committee. This provision will close a loophole in the Presidential Records Act which would have allowed individuals previously convicted of a crime relating to the mishandling of Archives records to continue to have special access to Presidential records. The amendment to the bill states that the Archivist shall not make available any Presidential records to any individual claiming access as a designated representative under section 2205(3) of title 44 if that individual has been convicted of a crime relating to the review, retention, removal or destruction of Archives records. 
   If you are convicted of mishandling Archives records, you should not have special access to original Presidential records. You are a proven risk, and we are obligated to mitigate this type of risk. Given the critical importance of Presidential records to the public, to researchers and to the press, we must ensure no one is able to tamper with history. This bill today includes this important amendment.  
   I also want to commend the Chair of our subcommittee, Mr. Clay, for his leadership on the subcommittee, and his thoughtful hearings held by the subcommittee in support of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a bit of irony in play here on the House floor. This week the Democratic leadership has declared it Open Government Week, Open Government Week as we take up amendments to the Freedom of Information Act, an act that is incredibly important as a tool for us to hold our government accountable because it gives people the opportunity to access information that can be reviewed by people to determine what action needs to be taken. 
   But, unfortunately, in the middle of this Open Government Week we have a bill that is coming to the floor, not the bill that went to the committee, not the bill that went through the subcommittee hearings, but an amended bill that has not been reviewed, and was handed to us 10 minutes ago. 
   Now, the reason why bills come on the Suspension Calendar where we agree to suspend the rules is because they are bills that have been fully vetted, that have openness to them, and that people are aware of what they are and have the opportunity to review them when we have an understanding that more than a majority of this House supports what is in that bill. 
   But today, without prior notice, and 10-minute amendments to the bill, we have a bill that we are currently reviewing to determine what changes have been made and what the implications would be. 
   Some of the speakers on the other side of the aisle talked about in Open Government Week that we wanted to make certain that there weren't backroom deals that were being made. Well, clearly the bill, unfortunately, that comes before us on the Freedom of Information Act is the product of a backroom deal where the majority of this House is going to be left with reviewing it to determine what is in it after it had come through our committee and subcommittee. 
   So my comments about this bill will be about the one that came from the committee and the subcommittee that the subcommittee Chair and the chairman worked so hard in a bipartisan way to bring to this floor. 
   I know others on this side of the aisle will be reserving their comments for the areas of the bill where it has been modified, where the backroom deals have been made. And we are all unaware of its impact. 
   The Freedom of Information Act is a popular tool for inquiry for the press, researchers, business, attorneys, activists. But most importantly, it remains a tool for the citizen. Improving the procedural aspects of the act is certainly a worthy goal. 
   Legislation designed to streamline and improve the Freedom of Information Act process was introduced last Congress by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith). His bill, H.R. 867, has moved through subcommittee to the full committee. This was a solid bipartisanship bill that Republicans introduced and guided through the legislative process. This year the majority took that bipartisanship bill and made a few changes. 
   Republicans offered two amendments that were not included in the reported  bill. First, the attorneys' fee provision appears to significantly lower the bar for the recovery of fees, making it easier for those seeking information from the Federal Government to recover legal fees. 
   The language in this bill differs from that in H.R. 867. The Supreme Court has ruled on this matter in the Buckhannon case, and now some fear the effect of this decision, what it might have on their ability to get attorneys' fees. 
   The language of section 4 of this bill would make plaintiffs eligible for attorneys' fees in almost any case, so long as they can show that the defending government agency somehow changed its position once the case had commenced. I hope we can closely consider the rationale behind this provision, and its implications for the numerous Federal statutes providing for attorneys' fee awards where the United States or a Federal agency or official is a party. You have to assume that if this is the provision that passes, everyone litigating under any private right of action will clamor for the same favorable legislative treatment. 
   An amendment was offered in committee to strike section 4 to preserve settled judicial precedent regarding attorneys' fees and highlight this issue. I hope my colleagues in the House and the other body will take a close look at this section as the legislation moves forward. 
   Second, the majority has taken to heart various groups' concerns about the so-called Ashcroft memo. During President Clinton's administration, Attorney General Janet Reno issued a memorandum establishing a presumption of disclosure if no foreseeable harm would result from the release of information. 
   Shortly after 9/11, and recognizing the challenges of the standard and the challenges that we face in the global war on terror, Attorney General Ashcroft issued a memorandum that encouraged agencies to carefully consider the protection of the values of interest embodied in the statutory exemptions to FOIA when making disclosure determinations. 
   I understand that there are serious concerns with this section, and I understand the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) will speak on this bill and this provision. 
   Nevertheless, I hope that we continue to balance the need for open government with the need to protect information vital to national security and homeland security, and I hope we keep in mind the importance of individual privacy throughout this debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I want to commend the Chair of our subcommittee, Mr. Clay, for his thoughtful approach to hearings on this matter and his leadership in shepherding this bill. I want to thank Chairman Waxman for his efforts in having a very bipartisan discussion in the committee on the bill. He was very welcoming of the input from all of the committee members. 
   Unfortunately, though, here, right in the middle of Open Government Week, we have the irony that this is not the bill that both of these gentlemen worked so diligently on a bipartisan basis for in the committee and subcommittee. It has been amended, unfortunately, as the other side of the aisle decried, in a back room by Democratic leadership in order to make the bill conform to the rules of the House for it to be able to move forward. 
   In the middle of Open Government Week, what does that mean? Well, it means that while we all stand up here and talk about the importance of freedom of information, and freedom of information is important because it gives people the ability to hold their government accountable; but as we all discuss that, we have a bill that is going to be moving forward and come before this House that the members of the committee did not see, the members of the subcommittee did not see, that each of them is going to have to review and have to have their staff review, that members of the public at large who may have been following this bill in the professional community or average citizens who had an interest in it will go to a Web site and look at a bill that was approved by the committee and approved by the subcommittee, but unfortunately, is not the bill that is before us. 
   And it is not before us because in the middle of Open Government Week, the bill that was placed before us was amended without the participation of the committee, without the participation of the subcommittee, and without the participation of this body. We will all come to vote on a bill that has been amended in a back room by Democratic leadership. 
   You have heard that there are a number of concerns that people on this side of the aisle have about the bill. As you are aware, this bill began as a Republican bill offered by Mr. Smith of Texas, H.R. 867. It has been modified in several ways about which individuals do have concern. But the underlying principle, freedom of information, that encourages effective government and encourages government to be responsive, is one that we all support and hold dear and certainly we should continue to support the Freedom of Information Act.

   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's Presidential libraries attract millions of visitors each year, and serve as an important resource for researchers and historians, and provide inspiration for generations. 
   Over time, the cost of building and maintaining these facilities has risen significantly. Presidential libraries are built with private funds, then turned over to the Archivist for operation. An endowment covers some of the cost of operating a library, usually met through the establishment of a charitable organization. Funding for construction and the endowment come from private sources. Under current law, there is no requirement to disclose the source of these contributions. 
   There is a great deal of interest in enhancing disclosure on both sides of the aisle. Under the leadership of the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan), a Republican, Congress passed bipartisan legislation to require the disclosure of contributions to organizations that raise funds for Presidential libraries and related facilities.     
   His bill, H.R. 577, from the 107th Congress passed the House with strong bipartisan support by a vote of 392-3. When we consider enhanced disclosure, it is important to treat everyone equally. We need a sensible, even-handed approach to disclosure, one that applies equally to Democrats and Republicans. 
   The gentleman from Tennessee has had the right approach, one that was supported by the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman) and many others across the aisle. I think it is of utmost importance that we avoid any temptation to politicize this important issue. 
   An amendment offered in committee would add the reasonable step of applying the disclosure steps of this legislation to Presidents elected after the enactment of this act. It is my hope that we can take politics out of disclosure, which is an important issue. 
   I also commend the Chair of our subcommittee, Mr. Clay, for his leadership on our subcommittee and in this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment, coauthored by Representative Biggert of Illinois and Mr. Gillmor of Ohio, seeks to help families who are potential victims of lending practices that could lead to foreclosure. The amendment increases the amount of funds available for housing counseling under section 106 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. 
   The amendment would increase the program's funding by $6.7 million. The increase is offset by reducing the Office of Inspector General account by $6.7 million. The CBO has scored this amendment as budget-neutral. 
   Funding for housing counseling has increased by only $2 million since fiscal year 2003. 
   Mr. Chairman, as a former mayor of the city of Dayton, Ohio, I have seen directly the detrimental impact that predatory lending and the practice of unwarranted subprime loans have had on urban families and communities. In 2001, the University of Dayton released a study of how mortgage foreclosures were affecting urban areas in Ohio. My community of Dayton had 1 foreclosure for every 43 households. Similar findings were seen in Cleveland, Akron, Columbus, and Cincinnati. 
   The problem of home foreclosures isn't limited to Ohio and the Midwest. According to a June 12, 2007, Bloomberg article, national home foreclosure rates in May soared 90 percent from last year. Many of these are tied to the subprime loan industry. 
   Many foreclosed homes sit vacant and boarded up for long periods of time. These properties go beyond just being an eyesore and become a threat to public health and safety. These properties are a blight to our neighborhoods and result in falling property values and increased crime, lead to an eroded tax base, and impair a city's ability to provide important services to families. 
   Beyond the individual impact these practices have on our neighborhoods, the subprime foreclosure crisis is resulting in the loss of capital in the financial market, a market that, if not righted, could threaten our growing robust economy. 
   Today we are seeing headlines from all across the country showing the growing concerns of financial markets regarding predatory and subprime lending practices that have resulted in a record number of foreclosures. 
   Recently, members of the Ohio delegation, led by Representatives GILLMOR, PRYCE, LATOURETTE, and Senator Brown, held a forum on the predatory lending crisis in Ohio. At this forum we heard from a variety of groups, from banks to fair housing groups. All of these groups shared a mutual concern over the issue of  predatory and subprime lending, and many agreed that an increased focus on housing counseling was a key component to fighting this problem. 
   It is my hope that increased funding possible through this amendment will allow housing counseling agencies the ability to provide vital counseling services to families in need. These services will give families the assistance they need to protect themselves from practices and circumstances that could lead to foreclosure. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe that homeownership is a privilege that everyone should enjoy. We must give all American families the tools they need to be successful homeowners. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. TURNER. I certainly appreciate your description of the needs for the Inspector General. And I support, of course, the chairman's description of searching for additional offsets for this in order to find additional monies for housing counseling. And in that, I'm certain that after the amendment passes the House, that there would be a great deal of effort by the chairman in conference to seek, perhaps, an additional offset where the Inspector General amount could be restored. 
   But as you have heard from so many of the Members that are here, this is an issue that strikes at the very heart of the fabric of our neighborhoods and our families. I have so many families who have come to me to tell me the stories of what they have experienced. There are nonprofit organizations in my community who are every day working with families who have faced this issue of foreclosure, and they want to know that we support the services that are being provided to them and that might be available to them.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I oppose H.R. 1424 today because it does not address the real problems that caused this current financial crisis. 
   Madam Speaker, I voted against the financial bailout legislation that failed on Monday, with the hope that Congress could then work on different ideas for how to solve this problem. Instead, we have been given nearly the exact same proposal, with little modification, but with a much larger price tag. Although I support taking action to help correct the damage done to our markets, I believe that making the wrong choice today places a risky and heavy burden on American taxpayers. Today's legislation does not provide adequate assistance to homeowners, does not provide assistance to communities with large quantities of foreclosures, and does not prohibit the predatory lending practices that got us into the current crisis. 
   Madam Speaker, the Treasury Secretary and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve have both indicated that this may not work. Further, there is no backup plan if this proposal does not work. When discussing this bailout, it is important that people keep in mind that agreeing to the $700 billion price tag could be only the beginning. This bailout would transfer billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities to the federal government and provide no roadmap for what comes next. If these properties are foreclosed, the federal government is not prepared to become the Nation's largest homeowner without seriously considering how it will handle these mortgaged properties. If the Federal Government takes possession of these mortgages, questions like ``who will replace the roofs and windows,'' will abound. 
   That is why I have introduced H.R. 7113, the Preserve our Neighborhoods Act, a bill which would allow communities who have been hit hardest by the foreclosure crisis to purchase the mortgages acquired by the Treasury during the course of the bailout. This would allow these local governments to take abandoned, blighted properties, and redevelop them for more productive use. 
   Additionally Madam Speaker, I have joined my Ohio colleague Congressman Steve LaTourette in attempting to amend the current package to reduce the amount of the initial bailout payment, and increase Congress's role in allocating additional funds. Both of these provisions would provide some commonsense reforms to this bill--these provisions would add accountability to the bailout  payment, and address a real problem that's facing local communities. 
   Congressman Representing Ohio's Statement H.R. 1424 Concurring to the Senate A Speaker, 
   But sadly Madam Speaker, these reforms are not a part of this package. Instead, we have essentially the same package we had before, only with tax credits and earmark spending. Any legislation that we bring forward should hold the right people accountable and prohibit the bad lending actions that led to this crisis. Today's bill fails in this respect and therefore leaves us vulnerable to the same situation in the future. 
   While I am in favor of the tax extenders and have voted in favor of mental health parity, both of which are included in the current package, the underlying problem still remains: how does the federal government address the foreclosures that have led to this mess. Something should be done Madam Speaker. Something should be done to fix this problem. Unfortunately, H.R. 1424 is not the solution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the dean of our delegation, Ralph Regula, for bringing this resolution forward to honor the life of Paul Gillmor. We are all deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend, Paul Gillmor. 
   I want to tell you one story from when I first got to Congress. Mr. Gillmor, as I referred to him, as many have said, had a gentle spirit and an informal way and a very accepting way. When I referred to him as ``Mr. Gillmor,'' he corrected me and said, You're to call me Paul. You will hear, as almost everyone comes forward today and eulogizes him, as they honor him, they refer to him as he had us refer to him, and that is Paul. 
   One time we were having dinner and he was talking about some of his accomplishments. Brownfields is an area that is very important to me. When you look across Ohio and see the number of abandoned factory sites and the potential that they represent, Paul told about his work on the Brownfields Remediation Act that changed the laws that made it easier for those sites to be remediated, and provided tax benefits so that capital would be brought to them. 
   As you go throughout Ohio today and see abandoned factory sites where buildings are being demolished and new buildings and businesses are being built, it is to Paul's credit and one of the things he was most proud of, that he was able to work to change the laws to help make it easier for their sites to be developed. 
   He talked about the number of jobs that it brought, not just in construction but the jobs that it brought to communities, recognizing the impact on families. 
   Most recently, Ohio has been plagued by scandals arising from predatory  lending, and Paul was a leader in trying to help families and communities that had been subject to predatory lending, pulling together the Ohio delegation to talk about ways we can impact our neighborhoods and support laws that could impact families that had been subject to predatory lending. 
   Paul will be remembered as an effective legislator, and as someone who cared deeply for Ohio and for this institution and for his country, and had an impact on the lives of Ohioans.

   Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank House leadership, the House Armed Services Committee chairman, Chairman Skelton, Ranking Member Hunter, as well as the leaders from House Judiciary, Chairman JOHN CONYERS, and the Veterans Affairs Committee Chair and ranking member for their assistance in bringing H.R. 6048 to the floor today. I would like to thank our presiding Chair, ELLEN TAUSCHER, also for her support of this bipartisan bill. 
   This bill was originally included as an amendment to the House version of last year's National Defense Authorization Act when it passed the House by voice vote. The purpose of this bill is straightforward. It provides certainty to servicemembers deployed in a contingency operation that their child custody arrangements will be protected. 
   Imagine the stress and conflict in serving your country and fearing that a court will take your children away because of your service. In some cases, courts have overturned established custody arrangements because a custodial parent has served our country in a contingency operation such as Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   Recently, many cases have come to light where servicemembers who have been deployed have had their military service used against them in custody hearings. One such case was that of Eva Slusher. Eva spent nearly $25,000 and years trying to regain custody of her daughter after fighting courts that used her deployment as a factor against her. 
   We have heard from other servicemembers who have had similar court battles. In fact, recently my office learned about a servicemember who during her custody proceedings was told by a judge that the mere possibility of her deployment weighed against the best interests of the child in denying her custody.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (EXPRESSING APPRECIATION AND THANKS FOR THE SERVICE OF MEMBERS OF THE 303RD BOMBARDMENT GROUP (HEAVY) UPON THE OCCASION OF THE FINAL REUNION OF THE 303RD BOMB GROUP (H) ASSOCIATION -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I speak in support of House Resolution 604, which expresses the Nation's appreciation and thanks for the servicemembers of the 303rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) upon the occasion of the final reunion of the 303rd Bomb Group Association. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate to learn that the 303rd Bomb Group Association will dissolve following their final reunion this week in Arlington, Virginia. The declining number of these courageous veterans makes it difficult for the association to continue their annual reunions. 
   With that being said, Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to pay tribute to the valiant men of the 303rd Bombardment Group known as ``Hell's Angels.'' 
   Activated in February 1942 at Pendleton, Oregon, the 303rd was an Eighth Air Force Bomber Group that flew the mighty B-17 Flying Fortress out of Molesworth, England. Living up to their adopted motto, ``Might in Flight,'' the air crews flew a record 364 combat missions against enemy targets, the most of any B-17 Bomb Group in the Eighth Air Force during World War II. 
   For its actions in the skies over Europe, the group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation in January 1944, two of the heroic crew men of the 303rd were awarded with Congressional Medal of Honor, and four earned the Distinguished Service Cross. 
   For all of their accomplishments, the members of the Bomb Group paid a heavy price in casualties, aircraft losses, and capture by the enemy. Their determination to complete the mission regardless of the opposition or the odds carried them through their losses and on to victory in the air. 
   Mr. Speaker, given the history of outstanding service by the 303rd Bombardment Group during World War II, as well as the last reunion of the veterans of the 303rd taking place this week, it is fitting that we take the time today to recognize and honor their service. I therefore strongly urge all my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AS AN INDEPENDENT MILITARY SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I represent the Third District of Ohio, which includes both the historic birthplace of aviation, home of the Wright brothers, as well as the home of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and I am honored to speak today in favor of H. Con. Res. 207. 
   The bill remembers, honors, and commends the achievements of the United States Air Force in serving and defending the United States on this 60th anniversary of the creation of the United States Air Force as an independent military service. 
   I would like to also recognize and thank my colleagues Mr. Spratt from South Carolina and Mrs. WILSON from New Mexico for their efforts in writing this bill and ushering it to the floor. 
   The United States Air Force is the largest modern Air Force in the world, with over 7,000 aircraft in service and about 358,600 men and women on active duty. The numerous airmen, technicians, and support staff through the years have served in the Air Force with honor, courage, and dignity. 
   Throughout history, the Air Force has adapted and designed new aircraft to meet the threats faced by the military, such as designing long-range bombers, more advanced tactical fighters, and eventually stealth aircraft. The humanitarian operations in Berlin after World War II, the Berlin Airlift, would not have happened was it not for the accuracy and dedication of the pilots of the Air Force. Today, the United States Air Force continues to be on the cutting edge of technology, pushing the envelope of aircraft and pilot to new bounds.     
   The F-22A and F-35 are the world's only fifth-generation fighters. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the 60th anniversary of the Air Force for its impact that it has had on my community of Dayton, Ohio. Wright Patterson Air Force Base in my district is the largest stand-alone base in the world, as well as being the home to the National Museum of the United States Air Force. Wright Pat has a strong tradition as a research and development hub, which started with Wright Pat when it was known as Huffman Prairie. Huffman Prairie is the location where the Wright brothers developed the first practical airplane that was able to sustain flight. During the early years of flight, the Wright brothers used Huffman Prairie as a research and development facility. The tradition continues, as the research conducted at Wright Pat today will provide U.S. troops with advantages on the battlefields of tomorrow. For example, the F-22A fighter, considered the most advanced fighting plane ever  built, was significantly developed, in part, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. 
   Again, I am honored to recognize the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force and all of those who have served, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, when the Wright brothers first accomplished flight, when they stretched out the wings of their airplane and began to fly and then returned to continue their work at Huffman Prairie in Dayton, Ohio, which later became Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, they could not have known the importance of their invention to preserving our freedoms and to preserving liberty. But they could imagine the bravery of the pilots that were to follow. 
   With this resolution, we honor the men and women who have served in the United States Air Force.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 5975, designating the post office in Waterville, New York, as the Corporal John P. Sigsbee Post Office. 
   In October 2005, Corporal Sigsbee joined the 101st Airborne Division 32nd Cavalry Unit, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, famously known as the home of the Screaming Eagles. After being deployed to Iraq, he was injured by a roadside bomb in July 2006. For his action, he was honored with the Purple Heart. After recovering at Brooke Army Medical Center, he insisted on returning to Iraq. Steve English, one of Corporal Sigsbee's high school teachers, said, ``John was doing something he knew was important. After being injured, he could have chosen to be assigned anywhere. He chose Iraq.'' English noted that it was indeed Corporal Sigsbee's commitment to his fellow soldiers that drove him to return to Iraq. 
   Sadly, during his second deployment, Corporal Sigsbee was killed in action on January 16, 2008, along with two other American soldiers when they came under small arms fire and grenade attack in Balad. He was posthumously honored with a bronze star for his service and a promotion to the rank of corporal. 
   Corporal John Patrick Sigsbee's life and tragic death have served as a rallying point for his community of Waterville, New York. By naming the new post office in his hometown after this brave young American, we will establish not only a permanent monument for this fallen soldier, but a permanent reminder of his example. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (PRESERVE AMERICA AND SAVE AMERICA'S TREASURES ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, today I speak in favor of H.R. 3981, the Save America's Treasures/Preserve America Authorization Act of 2008. 
   I want to thank Representative Miller, the co-chair of the Historic Preservation Caucus, for his collaboration on this bill, as well as Senator Domenici and Senator Clinton for their work in moving this bill forward in the Senate. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young of the House Natural Resources Committee, as well as Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands for their work on this bill. 
   Finally, I want to commend the work of the national historic preservation advocacy groups, many of which have collaborated with our offices in crafting this bill. 
   To this date, the Save America's Treasures and Preserve America Programs have been authorized through executive order, and I want to point out that through both First Lady Laura Bush's and former First Lady Hillary Clinton's efforts and commitment to historic preservation, these programs have been a success for many local communities. 
   H.R. 3981 would ensure that these two important programs continue by codifying them into law. 
   Both the Save America's Treasures and Preserve America Programs have had an enormous impact on historic preservation nationally, as well as in Ohio. Ohio is home to nine Preserve America communities, Dayton, my hometown, being one. In fact, Dayton recently received a Preserve America Grant that will help analyze heritage tourism in the area. 
   Additionally, since 1999, Ohio has been the home of 45 Save America's Treasures Projects. These projects total nearly $11 million in funding toward bricks and mortar restoration of important Ohio historic assets such as the Paul Lawrence Dunbar House in Dayton; Cincinnati's Union Terminal; the Wright Flyer III in Dayton, Ohio; the Palace Theatre in Columbus; and last, but not least, The National First Ladies Library in Canton, Ohio. 
   It's certainly interesting to note that the First Ladies Library was a recipient of the two programs started by these two First Ladies. 
   H.R. 3981 will ensure a stable and continuous funding source is authorized to assist in funding these important projects. 
   Additionally, the bill ensures that public-private partnerships remain a key aspect to the preservation of important historic assets by requiring non-Federal funds be used in collaboration with these Federal grants. 
   The authorization of these programs will help highlight the importance of historic preservation as an economic development tool, as well as a core national value. 
   It is clear that saving our heritage in these buildings and neighborhoods is not just a way to pay homage to our past. It is also an important way to boost our economy in the present, in addition to the future. 
   This bill enjoys a broad range of support, including many historic preservation organizations and over 55 cosponsors in the House. 
   Again, I want to thank Congressman Miller for being the lead sponsor of this legislation, as well as the leadership of the Resources Committee for ushering this bill through the committee process. 
   This bill is also important because many of the recipients are organizations that are staffed by volunteers. These programs recognize their efforts to preserve the fabric of their community and help tell the story of our Nation's heritage. These programs work. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.  
   July 7, 2008.  Hon. NICK RAHALL,  Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.  Hon. DON YOUNG,  Ranking Member, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.

   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill designating the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 101 Tallapoosa Street in Bremen, Georgia, as the ``Sergeant Paul Saylor Post Office Building.'' 
   Friendly. Dedicated. Hardworking. These are but a few of the magnificent words of praise that arise when friends and family speak of the memory of Sergeant Paul Saylor. 
   A native of Bremen, Georgia, Paul was a shining star in his community. A starter on the football team and committed thespian, Paul was voted ``best personality'' by his graduating class of 2002. After graduation, Paul attended North Georgia College and State University, a military college. 
   Tragically, on August 15, 2005, Sergeant Saylor lost his life while serving as part of the National Guard's 48th Infantry in Al Mahmudiyah, Iraq. 
   Described by his brother, Jamie, as the ``......type who would help you, but he wouldn't let you know it,'' Sergeant Saylor served his family, community, and country with selfless devotion. 
   I rise today in honor of not only a tremendous patriot, but an outstanding citizen. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution in honor of a valiant life that should not, and will not, soon be forgotten by a grateful Nation.  
   I yield back the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (DAYTON AVIATION HERITAGE NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK EXPANSION -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. I speak today in favor of H.R. 4199, which will add two important historic sites into the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Park. I want to thank Natural Resources Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young, as well as Subcommittee Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop for ushering this bill through the Resources Committee process, as well as bringing it to the floor today. I also want to thank the members of the Ohio delegation, many of whom have cosponsored this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, Ohio is the birthplace of aviation, and Dayton is the home of Orville and Wilbur Wright, the two men that invented the airplane. Some consider their invention to be the most important innovation in modern history. When the Wright brothers took flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, our world became connected in a dramatic way, transforming travel, commerce, and communication. 
   Dayton is also the home of Paul Laurence Dunbar. Dunbar was a classmate of Orville Wright, and was a contemporary of the Wrights. Throughout his life, he was known as the poet laureate of African Americans, and achieved national success after his second collection of poems was reviewed in Harper's Weekly in 1896. 
   The Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historic Park is a celebration of the legacies of the Wright brothers, as well as Paul Laurence Dunbar. Currently, many people enjoy our National Historic Park. The park includes the Wright's Cycle Shop, the Wright Flyer Airplane, and the Huffman Prairie, where the Wrights perfected fixed-wing flight, among other sites. 
   However, the Wright's history within the park remains incomplete. Currently, the Wright Company factory buildings and their home, Hawthorn Hill, are not included among the sites at the park. That is why I have introduced H.R. 4199, which will complete the Wright's story told at the park, by adding these two critical sites. 
   The Wright Company factory buildings in west Dayton are the first American facilities specifically designed and built for the manufacture of airplanes. These buildings had a production capability that was greater than any other airplane manufacturing facility at the time. 
   The Wright Company operated at the site from 1910 to 1916, and produced 13 different models of airplanes. This site is currently owned and controlled by the Delphi Corporation, who will operate at this site until later this year. 
   Hawthorn Hill was designed by Wilbur and Orville Wright and was the home of the Wright family until 1948. This historic architectural landmark tells the story of the Wright brothers as inventors. Amanda Wright-Lane, the great-grandniece of the Wright brothers, testified before the Resources Subcommittee on National Parks earlier this year, discussing the Wright's incredible history and the importance of Hawthorn Hill to the Wright's story. 
   Mr. Speaker, the addition of these sites to the existing park is critical to the park's purpose, which was outlined in the Dayton Aviation Heritage Preservation Act of 1992. The purpose is ``to create partnerships among Federal, State and local governments and the private sector to preserve, enhance, and interpret for the present and future generations the historic and cultural structures, districts, and artifacts in Dayton and the Miami Valley in the State of Ohio associated with the Wright brothers, the invention and the development of aviation, or the life and works of Paul Laurence Dunbar.'' Put plainly, the addition of these sites completes the Wright's story at the park. 
   Mr. Speaker, adding these sites to the national park enjoys a wide range of support from both local and national organizations, including the City of Dayton; Montgomery County; the State of Ohio; the Wright family; the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce; the Dayton Development Coalition; the Ohio Historical Society; the Dayton Historical Society; Sinclair Community College; The University of Dayton; the Dayton Foundation, the National Cash Register Corporation; the Delphi Corporation; the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers; and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. 
   H.R. 4199 also includes the exact language from H.R. 4191, which passed the House by a voice vote earlier this year. This language would change the name of the Dayton Aviation National Historic Park to the Wright Brothers-Dunbar National Historic Park. 
   Changing the name of the park has been the result of a community-wide process, led by Federal Judge Walter Rice and the Dayton Aviation Heritage Commission. I want to thank Judge Walter Rice and the other commissioners for their time and dedication to making the name of our park a fitting salute to those for whom it is a tribute. 
   It is clear that this bill is an important priority to the Dayton region. It is also important to the Paul Laurence Dunbar and the Wright brothers' legacy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you again for this opportunity, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4199.

<DOCNO>Mr. TURNER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for accommodating me so I might have some time to speak on this issue this evening. 
   Today, Speaker Pelosi has continued with what is called a debate on the Iraq war, but this is not a debate. The floor here is empty, except for the Members scheduled to come to the floor for the record and comment on the failures or success of the war on terror, the conflict in Iraq, prewar intelligence, the search for weapons of mass destruction, reconstruction efforts, al Qaeda, Saddam Hussein and, yes, George Bush. No real debate. 
   School children across America who are schooled in debate would not recognize what has happened here today, which should be the intellectual process of argument, because to call these series of speeches a debate is fiction, just as to call the nonbinding resolution proposed by the Speaker as congressional action is fiction. 
   This resolution has no binding effect on the administration, and it does not even have any binding effect on this body of Congress. This resolution is not a document from which decisions will be made or any action taken. This is not policy. This is not governance. It is, at best, a press conference. It is just talk. 
   The travesty of this fiction of a debate on the House floor is that there is no plan debated or alternatives for us to consider, only opposition. We do not have on the table a plan, an answer, or an action for us to take. 
   Now, I was not a Member of Congress when this House was asked in October of 2002 to grant the President authority to go into Iraq, and neither were 66 of my Republican Members of Congress. If they were with me they would fill this well, 66 of us that were not here on the Republican side when the President asked for authority to go into Iraq. However, I believe there are 55 Democratic colleagues who voted to send troops to Iraq who are still here today, and yet even those 55 Members who voted to send troops to Iraq offer no alternative plan. At a minimum you would think if you voted ``yes'' to send troops you would feel responsible and have a plan before publicly disapproving of the President's plan. 
   Now, there is certainly enough about the administration's handling of the Iraq conflict to disapprove of if we were to have a real debate. There is no question that serious mistakes have been  made in the execution of the Iraqi conflict. But today we will not debate solutions because, unfortunately, this resolution does not provide any. 
   In the war on terror, we have real enemies who want to kill Americans and our allies. No nonbinding resolution passed on this House floor will change that reality. 
   This is not a debate but it should be. The risks to our country are great. Our enemies and our men and women in uniform are listening. The only proposal brought forth by the Speaker is a statement of opposition and disapproval. 
   The House and the administration should work together on a bipartisan plan for winning the war on terror, a plan with a commitment that is not undermined by political expediency or partisan division.

   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I participated in a Government Reform hearing at Walter Reed Hospital. 
   During that hearing, we heard from soldiers wounded in the defense of our Nation and their families. Like most Americans, I was disappointed and saddened by what we learned. What we heard represents an absolute failure of military leadership and accountability.  
   Defense Secretary Gates has called for a review of all service branch medical facilities. Yesterday, the President announced the creation of a bipartisan commission to examine all U.S. military and veterans care facilities. The commission will be headed by former Senator Bob Dole and former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. 
   In addition to the Government Reform Committee, I serve on the House Armed Services Committee and on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Both committees have upcoming hearings on the care and condition of soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital. 
   We take seriously the health care of those who have provided service to our Nation. There is no excuse for what happened at Walter Reed Hospital. We must live up to our obligations to those who have served our Nation at such personal sacrifice.

   Mr. TURNER. Thank you, Mr. Davis. 
   Yesterday I was on the House floor as part of the discussion concerning the Freedom of Information Act amendments and as we discussed the issue of the dedication of this week of open government. 
   Open government is an important issue because it is one that we all know that by being dedicated to information being available to the public, we can hold our government accountable. Unfortunately, we have an irony once again happening on the House floor, and that is that today's bill that we are considering is one that went through committee, Government Reform Committee, which I serve on, and the Armed Services Committee, which I serve on, and went through hearings where there were amendments that were provided and Members were able to participate. But this bill today is not the bill that came before those two committees. It has been amended in some backroom deal that we are all decrying here on the House floor, with language that has not been through the committee or the subcommittee. If the public were looking at this bill as it went through those two committees, they would not find that this language matches that which went through the committees. Certainly, as we dedicate ourselves to open government, we should dedicate ourselves to a process where the bills that are here are available and open to the public and the members of these two committees.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TURNER. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for their leadership in completing the conference report for FY08 National Defense Authorization Act. 
   On December 6, Chairman Skelton announced that an agreement had been reached on the conference report stating that ``this bill supports the troops, restores readiness, and improves accountability.'' 
   I would like to point out that this bill includes a key policy provision that directly supports our troops. This bill will amend the Service Members Civil Relief Act to protect the children and custody arrangements of servicemembers deployed in a contingency operation. This provision is important because it protects our deployed troops from courts that have been overturning established custody arrangements while a servicemember is serving our country in a contingency operation such as Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   Today, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill because it provides the child custody protection that our deployed troops deserve. Much is asked of our servicemembers, and mobilization can disrupt and strain relationships at home. This additional protection is needed to provide them peace of mind that the courts will not undertake judicial proceedings considering their established custody rights without them. This amendment protects them, and it protects their children.

   Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for including my amendment in this package. 
   My amendment provides certainty to servicemembers deployed in a contingency operation that their child custody arrangements will be protected. 
   In some cases, courts are overturning established custody arrangements while the custodial parent is serving our country in a contingency operation, such as Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   States have become aware of this issue and are looking at what action they can take to support our men and women in uniform. The State of Michigan passed a law in 2005 to provide these protections to military personnel. The amendment offered today is modeled after the established Michigan law. 
   Much is asked of our servicemembers, and mobilizations can disrupt and strain relationships at home. This additional protection is needed to provide them peace of mind that the courts will not take away their children because they answered the country's call to serve. This amendment protects them and it protects their children. 
   Again, I thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for supporting this important amendment.
