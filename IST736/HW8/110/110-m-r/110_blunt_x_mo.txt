<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   In fact, I think the discussion we just had about more time indicates the lack of seriousness on this issue. For the 12 years I have been in the Congress, a House which for the first 10 of it was led by Republicans, we repeatedly sent bills to the Senate that would solve this problem, bills to the Senate that would allow us to explore for oil and gas where oil and gas is. 
   And again today, we have the same people that voted against all of those bills, that stood in the way of that discussion, that took advantage of the fact that the American people at that point said no, we don't really need to have more supply and let's not do the right thing for the future, let's do the right thing for now. And they bring this bill to the floor, as we face a generational problem, that is a 3-day solution. A 3-day solution to a  generational problem. If it wasn't so serious it would be funny, but it is serious. 
   And what we have to ask now, the good thing about this solution is our friends who bring this bill to the floor are admitting that supply matters. If supply matters, let's go after supply. If supply has an impact on price, let's find the oil and gas that we have and really affect the world market. Let's not assume that taking oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the level of 5.6 gallons for every car in America is going to solve any real problem. 
   The real way to solve this problem is to go after our own resources and to look for ways we can conserve energy and look for ways to invest in new alternatives in the future. It is not another gimmick that says let's be 3 days closer to being totally dependent on people who don't like us, instead of using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for what it is and going after the real supply that can make a difference.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my good friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I heard my good friend say we ought to deal with this in the next Congress, and I wonder why, why the next Congress. Why not this Congress? The reason we are having this critical we must vote today, vote right now, is that we haven't taken advantage of this opportunity to move forward on reform. The notice came up weeks ago. In fact, the notice came up months ago, and that's when the majority could have brought a great debate to the floor instead of the debate about whether we should debate or not. 
   Over a decade ago, Congress created the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. One of the recommendations of the commission was to require a trigger so that the Medicare trustees in Congress will have to publicly debate whenever the Medicare program is in danger of becoming insolvent. The trigger is one of the many recommendations of this commission, not ideas just out of thin air, recommendations of this commission that were formally adopted as part of the Medicare prescription drug bill in 2003. 
   But this Congress seems to never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. I am very disappointed that the Democrat leadership has halted consideration of key legislation designed to safeguard the future of Medicare, reconsideration, in fact, that's required by law unless we today vote to say we  are not obeying that law. If not obeying that law is the right thing to do, I don't know what could be more important than having a discussion on the future of Medicare, unless it would be the future of energy, and we are not having that discussion either. 
   Let's debate it, let's talk about it, let's see what we can do. One of the ideas that we have put forward that apparently is particularly fearsome is medical liability reform. If this rule passes, we will avoid being forced to debate and vote on lawsuit abuse and its impact on seniors, taxpayers and doctors. Such a reform will lower health care costs for all Americans and save Medicare $4.8 billion over the next decade.

   Mr. BLUNT. They don't want to debate means testing for wealthy seniors or more competition to serve patients. We could be doing all of those things today. We could be doing none of those things today. We could be debating whatever the majority wants to debate. 
   The point is we could be having a debate about the future of Medicare. First, we are afraid to debate energy. Now we are afraid to debate Medicare. What are we willing to debate on the floor of this House? 
   I want to have that debate. I oppose this vote to run away from those solutions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit in the Record the statement of the Health Coalition on Liability and Access on this legislation. That states that medical liability reforms are a central part of reducing costs and improving access and quality in the Medicare program.  
   Statement From HCLA Chair on Medicare and Medical Liability Reform 
   WASHINGTON, DC.--HCLA Chair Shawn Martin issued the following statement regarding today's Congressional vote on Medicare: 
   ``Today Congress will consider legislation pertaining to the so-called ``trigger'' provision of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Complying with the law's requirements, the President has put forward legislation, which includes medical liability reforms, to address the Medicare funding issue. The Health Coalition on Liability and Access believes that medical liability reforms are a central part of reducing costs and improving access and quality in the Medicare program. 
   ``Medical lawsuit abuse drives up the cost of medicine for everyone. In fact, it's estimated that medical liability reform would save Medicare $4.8 billion annually, not including savings from reductions in the practice of defensive medicine. 
   ``Comprehensive medical liability reforms have a proven track record of success at the state level of reducing health care costs and increasing patient access to quality medical care. Controlling our nation's Medicare costs is one more reason America needs national medical liability reform.''

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for that. 
   In the past, we've had in previous Congresses an open rule on these appropriations bills. I don't recall a prefiling requirement, though I'm sure we will talk about that in the Rules Committee. In appropriations, whatever the amendment is has to be paid for out of the bill so it has always been felt that that provides its own level of constraint. We would certainly argue for that kind of open rule.

   Mr. BLUNT. On the extenders package, I'm hopeful we see that bill back here because it is one of the things we could do that would have energy impact. And I hope we could even consider whatever is the maximum time that we would be able to do there is what we should do. 
   On energy generally, yesterday, Mr. Boehner from Ohio and I, Mr. Cantor, Mr. Putnam and others introduced a bill, the American Energy Act. It's a bill that is broad based and designed to promote American energy, conservation and invest in the future. Is there any opportunity for that act or other acts that we've had discharge petitions on, other bills, coming to the floor? And if not, what kind of energy legislation do you anticipate?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that. 
   We have other bills that we've started discharge petitions on, some sponsored by Democrats, that we think are part of the solution here. Clearly, based on the understood facts that some of this oil and natural gas gets online quicker than others, it seems to me that that is one of the principal reasons to get started everywhere that is reasonable for us to go as quickly as you can. We're the only country in the world that has the potential for offshore drilling, deepwater drilling, that doesn't do it. And I think any proposal that we've advanced through the Senate in previous years or anybody is making now involves the Governors or the State governments of the affected States having to agree. So if Governor Schwarzenegger and the people of California don't want to drill, don't want the revenue, in fact, even if they don't want the Federal Government to have the revenue from that drilling, they wouldn't have to drill. But if the people of Virginia or North Carolina or any other State did, they're part of that decision-making process. 
   And other countries do this. Some of that oil, particularly in the deep water, is going to come online quicker than others. But geologists believe in the deepwater drilling there is roughly an 18-year supply of natural gas and oil. So it doesn't all have to come online at once. Also, my view has been, as my friend knows, that if we just announce that as a country that has some of the most known and plentiful reserves in oil and natural gas that we were going to start in a real effort to go after all of it that was reasonably and safely achievable, that that would have impact on price.

   Mr. BLUNT. Let me say one other thing, and then I will yield. 
   The other thing I would say about a full and fair debate, these bills that come under suspension obviously narrow the debate. I guess I understand that. We have had some discussion on the floor, well, let's have all these ideas out there and just see who a majority is for, but 20 minutes of debate on a side of an issue really isn't the kind of full and fair debate we need. 
   I would like to see a bill come with plenty of debate, with plenty of opportunities for every Democrat that wants to make an amendment to make an amendment, for every Republican, it could be prefiled, it could be anything, and the will of the House would determine which direction the country goes in this real desire for energy, more American energy, American energy created by and producing American jobs. I hope we can get there. There is a real demand in the country for that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that observation. 
   I would say in terms of deep water, I think sometimes I say that rather than make the point that when we talk about drilling on the coast, and the Atlantic and Pacific coast which is where we restrict, and no one else restricts their coastal drilling, I am always talking about something way beyond the line of sight. I can say that as well as deep water. 
   I think there is drilling in the gulf even significantly deeper than the 1,000 feet to the floor and below that. But there is potential there. If, in fact, people of the various States don't want to drill well beyond their shores even though they get part of the revenue,  that is a decision they'd get to make. I do think that is an issue that is dramatically changing. 
   I also believe firmly, and every economist that I have read on this topic agrees, that if we announced we were going to drill, it wouldn't matter if anybody had a drill or not. That one signal from the United States where we have at least twice as much readily available oil shale in the Rockies as Saudi Arabia has in its known reserves, readily available, not to count the other amounts that could be available later, just if we were to announce that we were going after that supply, it would have an impact on price. 
   We had a hearing a couple of weeks ago where we had people from Interior talk about that particular supply, a lot of supply well off the coast on the Atlantic and Pacific coast. And if there is speculation here, I think the best way to deal with speculators would be to get them caught on the wrong side of a market that is going the other way because the United States of America has announced it is going to go after its own resources in a more dramatic way. 
   There are two prohibitions on the appropriations bill. One is coastal drilling on the Atlantic and Pacific coast, no money can be used to issue a lease, which is another way that legislators say you are not going to get a lease, and one in the oil shale in the Rockies. Removing both of those prohibitions would have a huge impact on price. It would start us in the right direction. The idea that some of this oil won't be available for 3 years, some of it for 5, some of it for 10, we are still going to need oil 10 years from now. Oil that is not available for 10 years is not an unacceptable goal because we know we are going to need oil 10 years from now. 
   I am convinced, I will tell my good friend, and we are good friends, I am convinced that if we just announced we were going to take those steps, it would have an immediate impact on price at the pump. We both know the reason there is no line at the pump. I went to 12 gas stations in my district on Friday and Saturday. There was no line anywhere, but every person that I talked to, whether they were traveling to Branson, Missouri, on vacation, or filling their car up in Andersonville or Neosho, Missouri, they all had a story as to how these gas prices were affecting their lives in other ways. Members have those stories. We can do something about them. But to do that, it is going to take more than a 20-minute debate on whether we release oil that we have already bought in the short term. If supply matters, long term going after that supply really matters. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. BLUNT. I just advance the idea that the moment we are in right now is not a Katrina-analogous moment. There is no temporary disruption of supply that you need to do something about. There is a long-term problem that needs to be solved. In fact, you mentioned those gas lines. Those gas lines in the seventies, the embargo in the seventies, that led us to this idea of a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And at the time we set the reserve up, it is the same size it is now, or when Congress set it up, before many of us were here, at least, at the time Congress set it up, it had a 117-day supply. That same amount of oil is now a 56-day supply because of the amount we now use. 
   Taking 3 days out of that 56-day supply only postpones, in the view of many of us, the reality of dealing with the long-term challenge that we face. We would like to have a debate on that. 
   You could bring that bill back to the floor next week under a rule. If a majority wanted to send it to the Senate, they could. But the chance you take is that others with another idea would get at least one amendment on the floor, and that's why we are here with suspension bills as opposed to rule bills because it's a take-it-or-leave-it-this-is-all-of-the-debate kind of approach. 
   I yield back.

Timely and temporary both have to mean that we get this done in a quick way. I am hoping that we can work with our friends on the other side of the building and get that done. 
   The other thing that we worked together on this week was to get an extension until the middle of February on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as it is currently in place, and has been since the first of August.

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate that. I do hope we can find a permanent solution here. I think that the 2 weeks is important. I also think it's important that that law not be allowed to expire, which made this 2 weeks a significant development. At the same time, the question of immunity hasn't been addressed, and I don't think we can continue to put that question off.     
   I did notice last week when we discussed this, an article that I hadn't seen yet, and my good friend the majority leader read from that article to me a section that indicated that the work was in progress could keep on in progress for a long time. That was in the New York Times on January 23. 
   There was another paragraph that I surmised at the time might be there, but was there, that said ``There is risk,'' according to this assistant Attorney General Mr. Weinstein, Weinstein said, ``the officials would not be able to use their broadened authority to identify and focus on new suspects and would have to revert to the more restrictive pre-August standards if they wanted to eavesdrop on someone.'' 
   Those pre-August standards were, in my view, troublesome. I hope we don't revert to them, but we can't put the immunity issue off forever, and I am going to do everything I can, as I believe the majority leader is inclined to do as well, to encourage the Senate to move this process along so we can bring it to some conclusion. 
   I yield.

Hopefully our staff is already and will continue to go through these documents that we were concerned we hadn't had, or the majority was concerned we hadn't had earlier, and look at those. 
   I would suggest that the penetrating analysis in one paragraph probably doesn't totally go away from the individual who was given so much credit in the next paragraph. 
   The only thing I would say about the FISA Court, I would really say two things. I missed some of this debate today, as you might be able to tell, because of another commitment I had to be off the floor as we were debating this. 
   The FISA Court, I believe, in 1978 was created for domestic cases. That is maybe an underlying difference here in the way we view this. And the backlog I would submit would develop again pretty quickly. It might not be a problem for 2 days; it might not even be a  problem for a week. But that backlog of every case from all over the world that suddenly wound up going to the FISA Court because of changes in technology quickly gets the FISA Court to where a 72-hour problem is a big problem because they just can't deal with it. 
   I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I want to rise to follow up on the announcement that my good friend Mr. Skelton from Missouri just made. 
   Of course, all Missourians are proud of President Truman and his family. He was a man of great humility. In fact, one day recently in Washington I happened to be driving by, on Connecticut Avenue, the small apartment that he and Margaret and Mrs. Truman lived in when he was Vice President and for I think the first 3 days of his Presidency. Not the grandeur that anybody would expect, but something that the Trumans, a family who actually never lived in a house that they owned for most of Margaret Truman's life, appreciated. 
   I was just sharing with Mr. Skelton the memory of Margaret Truman when we recommissioned the Battleship Missouri when it went back into active duty in 1985 or 1986, and I had the honor at the recommissioning dinner in San Francisco to introduce Margaret Truman, who had been the principal sponsor of the ship the first time when her father was in the Senate. 
   By that point in the evening, about every speaker had pronounced the name of our State differently. Some said ``Missouri,'' some said ``Missoura,'' and I made a couple of comments about that. And Margaret Truman got up and she said, ``It is `Missoura.' My father always said `Missoura.' My family always said `Missoura.' I was there when this ship was commissioned. We commissioned it the `Battleship Missoura,' and that should settle it.'' 
   But she was a lady that led an interesting life, the truly adored daughter of her father, and she saw politics the way that very few people do. I appreciate her life and her family.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank Mr. Poe for the good work he has done on this legislation and the recognition today to be allowed to speak for a few minutes. 
   On August 7 of 1998, al Qaeda launched a devastating and meticulously coordinated attack on American people residing in foreign countries, but on American soil because they were at our embassies. On that day, 12 Americans and 200 Kenyans were killed at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, and another 11 lives were taken at Dar es Salaam, the former capital of Tanzania. 
   Though other indications existed, these bombings represented the clearest signs to date that Osama bin Laden had declared war on our country and its people. It was a declaration that fell largely on deaf ears, as my good friend, Mr. Jackson, just pointed out and has been acknowledged by our government. Had we been paying closer attention to that declaration, it's possible that we could have been more prepared for the terrible attacks that day and those attacks that came just 3 years later. 
   The legislation before us today speaks to an issue I've been working on since 2002 when, at the time, I introduced and the House passed the Embassy Victims Compensation Act. At that time, my good friend Maxine Waters was my cosponsor and an active advocate in dealing with this issue, and the House as a whole stepped forward and dealt with this issue, now 5 years ago. It was our first effort at that time to recognize the profound sacrifices made by those Americans that have been mentioned here today, and just as important, that their families made and continue to make. 
   Today, we take a step toward completing the work this House started 5 years ago. The families of those who lost so much at the hands of al Qaeda deserve this bill, and I'm proud to have been involved in it. 
   I would also like to especially thank Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., who has helped make this bill happen this year. He took up the mantle of the hard work that needed to be done; he was tireless in insisting that our Nation deal with this issue and deal with it now. 
   Along with Jesse Jackson, I would like to recognize the incredible and patient work of Edith Bartley, who lost her father and her brother in the Nairobi attack. For almost a decade now, she has worked to point out the sacrifices made by our State Department personnel, as well as some of the shortcomings of that agency's treatment of her family and others both before and after the attacks. 
   Obviously, nothing we do today can replace those who were lost nearly a decade ago, but I'm hopeful that this effort, if nothing else, will demonstrate that we have not forgotten those who died in this horrific attack. And we will never forget the enduring lessons that we've learned from it.

   Mr. BLUNT. That's what I thought, the possibility of Tuesday. 
   I would point out to my friend that the bill that the President did sign, the Defense bill, was very close to the amount of money, a reduction in the amount of money that was equal to the increase on the Military Construction and Veterans bill the President said he would sign, which is actually in the context of both what most of the Members on this side of the aisle had hoped for and what the President said he would insist on, which is the obvious ability of the majority, within the 6.5 percent increase that he proposed, to stay below that number. Actually, Military Construction and Defense, while they are not a perfectly balanced outcome, come close to the way that system can work and still be within the President's number and an example of two bills that he said he would be willing to sign, neither of which are the bills he proposed, but the combination of which certainly are within an amount of money that could be adjusted in the other bills. 
   On the military question, those two bills we are talking about, does the gentleman anticipate any opportunity to have funding, either full or partial, for Iraq and Afghanistan without withdrawal language in the bill we would send over to the Senate or at some later time next week?

   In the context of how much money we are really talking about, the President added a 6.5 percent increase, and then the House-passed bill added $23 billion to that, which is more than the individual budgets of more than 35 of the States. So people, as they look at this discussion that this isn't much money, it is more than all of the money spent by 35 or 36 of the States in the country. You know, I think in that context, $23 billion is a significant amount of money.

My view of that and most of our Members' view of that is that those 23 million people are not paying that tax this year, and so the idea that you have to replace that money to keep them from paying it next year is the fallacy of the PAYGO argument generally, as are many of the other extenders that you mentioned, the supplies for teachers and other things that are tax benefits they currently have, but that is obviously a fundamentally different view of how we view noncollected taxes this year that would be collected unless somehow what I consider to be very good tax policies for teachers and others are extended. 
   On those tax extenders, the doctor payment issue is another issue that I am wondering if the gentleman has any information on, and I would yield on that as well. This is the doctor payment issue under Medicare and the fact that they would take an automatic cut.

   You mentioned SCHIP. I know my good friend has worked hard to try to get the votes to override a veto and now perhaps to pass another bill since the President has the bill we had earlier passed. If that does not happen, would you anticipate an extension of SCHIP? My view is that the State programs and the Governors in those States should have some assurance that they can move forward as we continue to work for a better solution than I believe we have found so far. But assuming that has not happened in weeks and doesn't happen in the next 2, would you expect to see an extender, a bill, of the current program while we continue to look for changes in that legislation? Or would that program end on December 14 or 15 when this current CR ends?

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate the gentleman's work on this. I do know that in terms of a bill that would continue this program, that a significant majority of our Members would vote for that; and the bill that would even expand the program, a number of our Members might vote for that. But it has to be the right bill, structured in the right way. 
   I know you've spent a lot of time on that. I hope you can negotiate even further from where you've been. But I also know that my staff and your staff hopefully are even working together on this to determine that exact right number that would continue the existing program to be sure that shortfalls are met, and that the existing program and the impact of that potential guideline on the existing program, and I think I can assure my friend that there will be enough votes in the House, including votes on our side, to easily extend the existing program and cover those shortfalls while we work for a better program. 
   The last question I have is the gentleman's certainty about Friday. I know a few weeks ago we had scheduled that these 2 weeks would be 3-day weeks and the Members would be able to schedule things in their districts on Mondays and Fridays. I think your sense is today that we might very well be here on Friday, and I would appreciate some clarification on that.

   Mr. BLUNT. On the topic of additional energy-related legislation, I know we just had a bill on the floor on energy. It was a heated debate. And while a majority voted for the bill, it didn't pass. I wonder if there is any opportunity that bill might come back next week with a rule.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that. As you mentioned, there is lots of interest in the bill. I appreciate the fact that we were able to extend debate, even on a suspension bill. But I think this is a topic where certainly both sides evidenced a willingness to discuss it. And we need to do that. And I would hope to see more energy legislation on the floor and would hope to have it under a rule if that is at all possible. 
   On appropriations, last week I mentioned that the chairman, the appropriations chairman, had appeared to announce that there would be no appropriations work on the floor. Your comment at the time, if I recall, was that that had not been a decision that you and the other leaders had made yet. 
   Today, the Speaker announced that the House would consider the Defense bill before October. I'm wondering if you have any idea when that might happen and if there is a chance that  the five other bills that are out of committee could also get to the floor before October, and what could happen with the Interior bill which would obviously be the most important bill as it relates to this topic of energy that we just discussed. 
   I would yield.

And obviously I share the sense that it's a primary responsibility of the Federal Government to defend the country. But the Homeland Security bill, the Military Construction and Veterans bill also are particularly important components of that very element of what we do, and other bills that are out such as the Financial Services bill, all the discussions we're having and will have about housing over the next few days, but another bill where if we knew that the regulators were funded and how they were funded and the other things that happened, that is a helpful thing to know. 
   I think that is all the questions I have for today, and I would yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Chairman, I appreciate having the time. I appreciate the leadership that my good friend from California has shown on this issue. 
   Madam Chairman, Members, many of us in this Chamber have been reminded over the years, some of us more frequently than others, that elections don't always yield the most convenient results. But as unpredictable and, at times, disappointing as their outcomes can be, for some reason we keep holding them, and we go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that basic conditions of privacy and integrity are properly observed and protected. The reason we do that is not that we are gluttons for punishment, that we want to go back facing the disappointment of not being successful on election day. It is that, in our democracy, secret ballot elections represent an essential mechanism for establishing legitimacy. We recognize elections as the fabric that holds our democracy together.     
   Lose an election, and you tend to ask yourselves plenty of questions. Most of us, though, after all the soul searching we do, don't decide that one of those questions is answered by the idea that next time we just simply fail to hold the election. We understand that that is not one of the options we have. 
   The advocates of the underlying bill say we should suspend a worker's right to register his or her choice by a secret ballot and replace it with a system in which workers would be forced to publicly declare their preference to friends and to co-workers through a series of cards that would be collected. Mr. McKeon's amendment, before that, the bill introduced in previous Congresses by our friend, Mr. Norwood, says that we must have, in all instances, a secret ballot election. 
   Which system is more vulnerable to peer pressure and intimidation? An anonymous secret ballot election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board, or a public declaration of whether you want a union or not. 
   There was a time in this country when you had to publicly go to every polling place in America and cast your ballot publicly, audibly or visually, so that everybody in the polling place knew how you voted. But over a century ago, one of the great reforms in this country was that that system would never be allowed to happen again. And one by one the States adopted secret ballot elections as one of the great reforms that has protected our democracy. 
   We have already heard, probably more times in this debate than anybody would want, the lead sponsor and his comments about secret ballot elections in Mexico just a few years ago. 
   There was a day when labor advocates like Senator Robert LaFollette and the AFL founder, Samuel Gompers, toured the country in a push for more open, more voluntary standards for joining a union. And in every case, they fought for the right of a secret ballot, the very privileges the sponsors of this bill say today are no longer needed. 
   The former chairman, the ranking member's amendment, says let's defend the secret ballot, let's protect the workers' right to cast their vote in privacy. Support this amendment. Oppose the bill. Stand up for democracy as we vote today.

   Under the rules of the Congress in the Congressional Budget Act, the Budget Act calls for us to have adopted a budget by April 15.

   On the issue of the rules of the House, Mr. Leader, as I understand the rule that sometimes we were able to frankly use and sometimes we weren't, on the rule that we always referred to as the Gephardt rule that was initially put in the rules by Mr. Gephardt when he was the majority leader, if there is a budget resolution adopted by both Houses, that budget resolution vote on the conference becomes the vote on raising the debt limit. I wonder what the majority's plan is on that. Do we intend for that to continue to be the case, or will we expect a vote on the debt limit at some time?

   Also, as we look back into the recent history of the House, I had actually never heard the rule referred to as anything before but the Gephardt rule. But the Gephardt rule, or the Hastert, whatever rule you want to call it, only applies if you actually have an agreed-to budget. And so on more than one occasion in the 12 years we were in the majority, we didn't have, and a couple of times, didn't produce an agreed-to budget by both bodies. And I don't remember anybody on your side of the aisle helping increase the debt limit either. So this is an area where both parties have played over the years a role of you didn't help us, we're not going to help you.

   Mr. BLUNT. Reclaiming my time, I would say that it is a challenge, the budget is a challenge. We look forward to the solutions that the chairman brings forward and having that debate on the budget, having that debate on the size of the debt. We hope we can get to a budget that is balanced in 5 years without a tax increase. I am sure that will be one of the many topics that we will be discussing over the next few weeks as the budget progresses. 
   As I said earlier, the earliest possible access to at least a draft of the supplemental will be helpful to us. And we hope that the majority will work with us to get that supplemental draft to us as soon as possible so that we can begin that important debate that will be on the floor I don't think next week, because clearly, the time would not allow that, but hopefully as soon as the week after that, and we look forward to that debate.

Particularly on this side of the aisle, we appreciated the Speaker's comments about moving towards partnership as opposed to partisanship; and we, of course, are eager to see a little more of that partnership again. 
   We paid close attention during the election and after the election to the commitments to the new majority to have bills available in an earlier way and to have committee and subcommittee markup.

   Mr. BLUNT. As you know, most of our Members voted against the rule which brings these issues to the floor without the chance to offer an alternative. We believe there is a desire to create more opportunities for alternatives, but the sooner that can happen, I think the more effectively we will show to the American people that we are finding ways to work together. 
   We had a pledge also of at least 24 hours of notice on the specifics of legislation. It doesn't seem to me that is quite as onerous a pledge to meet in the context of what my friend just said as going through a subcommittee, going through a committee. We didn't feel like we had that 24-hour access to information this week. We would hope next week to have the specifics of the legislation as early as possible. If in fact this is legislation that doesn't need to go through the committees because it has been so widely discussed and vetted, it would not seem to be unreasonable for everybody in the body, every Member to have a chance to see it even as early as Monday.

   My good friend Mr. Hoyer mentioned the 9/11 Commission report. One of the recommendations of that commission was a realignment of committees.

My only suggestion would be if you do see that it might slip into that later time that that will be helpful to Members who, frankly, are having to decide when to leave their districts and to come a day early just to be here for that 3:30 vote as opposed to a 5:30 vote or 5 o'clock vote that might have allowed them to leave that day.

   This week we voted twice, including one vote yesterday and one vote today, on an unemployment insurance bill. I think the unemployment rate nationwide had gone up one-half of 1 percent. As the gentleman knows, a lot of our concern was that it was widely targeted, instead of States that had a significant unemployment problem. The Speaker said last week that ``America's families and workers can wait no longer, neither will the Congress. This bill will come to the floor of the House,'' and it did; and it did again. 
   With a 75 percent increase in the price of gasoline during this Congress, Republicans have been arguing that we need to have an energy bill that would produce more energy on the House floor.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for that information. There are really two topics there I want to talk about just briefly. One is the refinery capacity itself. I think there's probably more reason than capacity that there's only been one permit in 30 years for refineries. 
   But refineries are really a separate issue from whether the oil is available or not. In fact, you could argue, we'd have more refinery use if we had more oil available. 
   I do know that we imported gas last year. I think importing oil is bad. I think importing gas and paying somebody to take that raw material of oil and turn it into gas is a worse idea. It's hard for me to believe that people that run refineries would be doing that if the refineries were the problem. 
   In terms of the leases, clearly, in the last 7 years, the amount of leased public lands has almost doubled. Most of that drilling has been for gas. In fact,  our natural gas numbers are quite a bit better than they were before that started. 
   Secondly, I think something like 52 percent of the exploration produces no product. It's a 10-year lease. Most of those leases are now beginning to get into the middle of that 10-year period of time. I certainly hope that we're encouraging, without doing anything that violates what we've already agreed to, that we're encouraging that to be done. 
   And I think, frankly, I personally think, and have for a long time, that drilling in the ANWR in the area that was set aside for drilling by President Carter and the Congress in 1980, is part of the solution. But it's only part of the solution. And wherever we have those resources, we're the only country in the world where coastal drilling is possible that doesn't allow it to happen. I think we need to revisit that. And I think the American people are at the point that they want to revisit that as well. 
   But this discussion is exactly the discussion we hope to have, a discussion that leads to more production and looking for the future. 
   My good friend said that many on our side think that drilling's the only solution. I haven't heard that. What I've heard is many on our side think it's part of an immediate, short-term solution. But in the last Congress and the Republican Congresses before that, there was lots of legislation that encouraged alternatives, renewables. We want to still do that. Most of that requires a lot of transition in the economy and will take a while. 
   Announcing that we were going to go vigorously after our own resources, I, at least, believe would have impact on that last topic you brought up, the futures market. If we announced we were going after substantial resources 
   that we have, in fact, resources that are now believed to be significantly more substantial than they were 5 or 10 years ago, that would have impact on the futures market. And we should be looking at that market and see what's driving that and what we could do about it, in addition to thinking we're going to just simply regulate a worldwide market from the United States of America. 
   I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. And two is the numbers I see for the deep water drilling of natural gas indicate that there is an 18-year supply in the deep water. If you're right, and there's four times that supply on public lands that could be drilled on, I suppose that means we have almost a 100-year supply of natural gas if we just go after it. We should find out whatever it takes to go after that, and insist that that happen. 
   My view is both, and wherever the infrastructure is most amenable to getting that natural gas and oil into the energy system the quickest, that's where we should be drilling the quickest. If we've got a leasehold that's 500 miles away from the nearest place you can hook it up to a line, that's probably less appealing than a leasehold somewhere in the deep water or other places that's near a current way to get that gas or that oil into the system. 
   I do know in the 181 area that we opened in 2006 in the gulf, opened for a brief period of time, that there's one 2-acre platform there, at least I'm told there's a 2-acre platform there that's producing roughly 10 percent of all the natural gas that we're producing in the United States of America. 
   I do believe that these resources are greater than we thought they were 5 or 10 years ago. I think we ought to be pursuing that on all fronts. 
   I saw where one of our colleagues in the Senate, the senior Senator from New York, said that if we had a million barrels more of oil every day, that that would reduce pump prices by 50 cents a gallon. I'm not sure how he calculates that, but I'm prepared to accept that. 
   A million barrels is what we'd be getting from ANWR today if we'd started drilling there 12 years ago, or any of the other times that the Republican House sent a bill to the Senate that would have allowed that. There may be other million-barrel locations, as my friend has just suggested there were, that we should vigorously be pursuing, and we are eager to have that discussion on the House floor, see it had on the Senate floor, see something get on the President's desk that encourages American use of American resources for America's future. 
   I yield.

   I believe for those things that look toward better solutions for the future, better conservation now, we all should be focused there. We also should be focused on using American resources, and frankly asking every question why they haven't been used. Again, I will just conclude my remarks by saying I know that these leases have been almost doubled in the last 7 years. And how long it takes to develop, some of them issued only in the last 1 or 2 years for 10 years at a time, I don't know what the planning is on that, but I am absolutely committed to the most efficient and effective use of America's resources for America's future, and I would like to see this Congress work together to get there.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I am here in support of this amendment. This amendment is one of the things that we have to look at, one of the alternatives, to just stop this spending spree that we see ourselves on. 
   In just over 6 months the new majority has passed and paved the way for over $100 billion in increased spending. We already enacted $6.1 billion of new spending in the continuing resolution and $17 billion of new spending in the supplemental.     
   And these appropriations bills have over $80 billion in new spending. As Everett Dirksen once famously said, ``A billion here, a billion there, before you know it you're talking about real money.'' And here we're talking about $100 billion of new spending. 
   Mr. Campbell's amendment only proposes that we reduce this spending in this particular bill to the President's level. This bill increases spending by $1.3 billion over last year, 4.3 percent higher than last year. If you add this increase to the increases already proposed and passed by House Democrats last week, we are spending $20.7 billion, or 15.6 percent, more than last year. Where is all this money going to go? 
   In this bill, $682 million, or a 35 percent increase, for operations and maintenance within the Corps of Engineers; $1 billion, or a 4 percent increase, to the Department of Energy; $108 million, or an increase of 13 percent, for salaries and expenses at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These are excessive changes in spending that this bill doesn't justify. 
   The only thing this amendment does is say let's go back to the President's level. Let's go back to an amount of money that, while it still provides for our immediate advances in energy and water, doesn't do this in a way that American taxpayers can't pay for it. And how does this majority intend to pay for it? The budget that would pay for it has, unarguably, the second biggest tax increase in American history, and arguably, the biggest tax increase in American history. In other words, there is no question that we intend to spend $217 billion more money that has to be raised from new taxes. And it's  still an open question as to how close we're going to let that get to $400 billion. 
   Now, this is the question: Are the American taxpayers going to be asked to provide 217 billion to 400 billion new dollars, or are we going to simply take this bill as the first step back to the President's level? 
   This is a good amendment. This amendment deserves the approval of our friends. I hope our friends on both sides of the aisle, the conservative Democrats, the Blue Dogs, stand up with most of the Republicans to make this amendment happen.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   I, too, share the concerns that, for all the time that the House has dealt with this whole issue of extended unemployment benefits going back to 1981, we have never before left this up to the States to decide how this Federal money would be spent. By, in the past, saying that you had to meet the 20-week requirement, at least every State had the same situation that they dealt with. 
   I would also like to point out, Mr. Speaker, that this bill is being considered under a procedure known as suspension of the rules. Of course you know that, Mr. Speaker, but everyone who listens to this debate may not. Usually that procedure is used for noncontroversial matters. By putting it under a suspension of the rules, the so-called PAYGO requirement that the majority has talked about and trumpeted as fiscal discipline doesn't. That's a requirement where you pay for these benefits with a bill you bring to the floor. The roughly $10 billion cost of this bill is just being added to the deficit. 
   As we're well aware, a group of Democrats known as the ``Blue Dogs'' has been particularly strong in advocating this PAYGO arrangement, yet apparently they're not going to oppose this bill. And the reason appears to me to be quite revealing. This morning's CQ Today quotes one of the Blue Dog leaders as saying that PAYGO should not apply because it's only a temporary bill. The Member said it's not a bill that's forever, like the GI benefits bill, it's a short-term thing. So that means, I guess, that temporary spending increases don't have to be offset. Yet these same Blue Dogs have forced the House to pass billions of dollars in tax increases to extend current temporary tax provisions, like the research provisions, the development provisions, or the alternative minimum tax patch that we've been able to use to prevent more people from falling into that tax trap for some years, or the continuation of being able to deduct local and State sales taxes. 
   As I've said many times, the PAYGO provision is a tool that's used to promote tax increases. But every time the majority wants to figure out how to get around it, they seem to be able to figure out how to get around it, and they have with this bill today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This week, we're in the week before we break for our annual Memorial Day work period. Historically, this has been a time when we recognized those who have served and those who are serving, those who are willing to give even their life to help protect the freedom of this country. This is a time-honored tradition in our country. 
   It's today that we finally come to the floor, after literally months and months of a request for this funding for troops, nearing the deadline where troop withdrawal notices or troop furlough notices and other furlough notices would go out, and we come to the floor with a bill that puts restrictions on the troops. We come to the floor with a bill that does, in fact, finally meet those funding needs of the troops. And we come in a way that doesn't allow us to have any different ideas, have any amendments to these provisions that are brought to us today. 
   This is an extraordinary procedure in the way we have handled supplementals in the past. The only supplementals that have ever been brought to the floor in the last 20 years, with a closed rule, were supplementals where both sides agreed that we had to immediately respond to an immediate emergency, and it was a bipartisan agreement. There is no bipartisan agreement on the way this bill is brought to the floor. And because of that, it does not meet the needs of the troops as it should. The restrictions are wrong. The time line is wrong. Even the GI benefits that all of us believe need to be updated to meet the needs of today's military, as opposed to yesterday's military, doesn't have transferability of those benefits, the thing that spouses and people in the military and dependents in the military would like. It isn't designed for a military that's a volunteer Army. 
   There is a better House provision, but are we allowed to offer that House provision? No.

   Mr. BLUNT. We get to say yes or no because everybody in this building knows that this bill will never become law. We've waited till the week before Memorial Day to bring a bill to the floor that will not become law. The majority leader announced earlier today that maybe it will be the middle of June before we get to a bill that would actually get to the President's desk and become law, when furlough notices have gone out. 
   This is a shameful way for us to meet the needs of our troops, and I hope we'll get down to business next week and see if we can't actually pass a bill that will meet the needs of our troops.

Of course, for the time I have been in the House, and I believe the time my good friend from Maryland has been in the House, the appropriations bills have come to the floor under an open rule. The general exception for that has been, again, under both sides of the leadership, the Legislative Branch bill, which, for its own reasons, often has a structured rule. 
   Does the gentleman anticipate that we will still have the open rules that have been the tradition of the House on these bills?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I would say to my friend that I am sure we do think that undermines a right, and that would be a major problem as we look at this. Let me give you an example why it undermines a right. 
   First of all, this has been the procedure of the House for a long time. In the 12 years of the leadership by my side, we allowed this process to happen for 12 years on virtually all of the bills. One reason you want to do that is in this process where, first of all, the Member is obligated to present a way to, within the structure of that appropriation bill, shift money around, if that Member is successful, you don't know that in advance. 
   I am pausing here because I think it is a very important point. You don't know that in advance. 
   And on the floor under the rules we have used for well over a decade, probably into two decades, another Member could then stand up and say, the cut just made, the adjustment just made, I would like to propose that we restore part of that by taking money from somewhere else previously unmentioned in that debate. And you don't know that as part of a pre-printing requirement. It is a substantial limiting of the minority or the majority, and I suspect that a number of these amendments will come from both sides of the aisle. It is a substantial limiting of the Members' ability to react to what happens during the response to these amendments. 
   I am sure that we want to talk about this in more detail and in more length. Because I believe the Members on our side of the aisle and, frankly, I think the Members on your side of the aisle who have used this process in the past, some with the same amendment every single year, some with the same positive result every single year, will see this as a substantial change if that pre-printing requirement was a requirement.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for his views on that. 
   We do see the pre-printing requirement as not as open as the open rule that we used to describe and use with some frequency, but I am pleased also that the gentleman appears to see my point in terms of the appropriations bill itself. It is a much more fluid process. It involves proposing that money be taken from one place to place in another place, and so if a pre-printing requirement is on a document that you have no idea, frankly, what it looks like, even by the time the amendment you had in mind might be offered, that amendment may no longer be appropriate or valid. 
   If, for instance, all of the money you were hoping to use for your so-called ``paid for'' is gone, your pre-printing requirement meant nothing because your source on how to pay for your better idea is gone. 
   I think we are hearing each other. I hope we continue to discuss this. 
   I would also suggest to my friend who often, and I understand how hard it is to resist this, has pointed out last year's work wasn't done and all that stuff. I will tell my friend that last year the House, under our leadership, passed 11 bills by the 4th of July. 
   Now if at the end of this process, if our friends on the other side of this building, you are as challenged as we were to get it all done, I hope you are prepared to hear for months and months and months how the work was not done. We met the standard that you are setting for yourself. 
   The previous year of that Congress, the first half of that Congress, we passed all 12 bills by the 4th of July. I assume your sensitivity on this issue will only grow if you run into a similar situation, and I am sure we will be glad to remind you of it. But the work of the House was done. 
   Let me tell you one other thing that we did last year that we are developing great concern about and that is on this topic of where the Member-directed  projects, the so-called earmarks, go into the process. 
   Our process, more often than not, included that work being done in the bill with, obviously, a lack of control over the final negotiation with our friends on the other side of the building. But, last year, we had a point of order against a list that wasn't complete. Maybe there is some problem if there is no list, your list doesn't have to be complete, but a bigger problem is this idea that we are at least starting with the first four bills, if it is appropriate for them to have these projects, that the project could not possibly occur until you go to conference. 
   I would say to my good friend that I believe our Members and some of yours share real concern that this removes almost all of the transparency from the process, and I hope we can work together to find a better solution than to put all of these earmarks in at the last possible minute so they can't possibly be looked at to any extent. 
   You want a pre-printing requirement for every amendment and would expect the highly volatile topic of earmarks to be handled in a conference that the Members possibly barely have time to look at and the media has even less time to look at it. It is a huge problem, and I hope we can continue to talk about it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier).

I thank my friend for that response, and I would also say, as I recall how that process has always worked, it's usually negotiated between both sides at some point during that open-rule process, when both sides feel that there's been adequate time given for Members' views to be heard. I think that was the appropriate way to handle that then. I believe it's the appropriate way to handle that now. I hope we're able to continue on that unanimous-consent view of this where both sides are able to achieve a sense that their Members have been heard.

   I don't think that's regular at all, though you were on the Appropriations Committee. I just suggest to my friend, maybe your memory of that is stronger from the previous decade than the last decade, because our appropriators were very resistant to doing that, and I'm  sure our appropriators still will be resistant, though they don't call the meeting or schedule the markup.

   I was concerned about the CR and the way it was handled. I was concerned about this bill. The next logical step, when we get to the appropriations bills, is that they, too, would not have the opportunity for debate and amendment as this was, in violation of long-standing traditions in the House. The last time this happened was when the gentleman's party was in the majority, and I hate to see us revert back to that lack of debate.

On the issue of merit, I suggest that the use of the procedural availability to the minority wouldn't be nearly as necessary if this bill is meritorious and has a majority of votes on the floor to actually have a debate where the bill is amendable, where there are substitutes available, where the other side of this debate has an opportunity to truly offer other ideas. And so far in this year we have not really seen an openness on any bill that was a bill that didn't pass in the last Congress on suspension to competition of real ideas and debate. I think that is what we saw on that bill. That is one of the reasons that that is one of the few alternatives we had to push back a bill that was not adequately debated, that has significant constitutional questions. We look forward to the bill being on the floor again.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and for his hard work on this and other work that we do here. 
   I believe, Mr. Speaker, that the debate on this emergency spending bill has provided the service of reminding Americans exactly what is at stake in Iraq, the prospects of victory, the consequences of defeat, and a better appreciation of how it is we do everything we possibly can to secure and support our men and women in harm's way. 
   House Republicans, Mr. Speaker, asked the Speaker and her colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to produce a clean and straightforward supplemental emergency bill, a package worthy of our troops' hard work and dedication, with help we could deploy to the front lines as quickly as possible. 
   What we got instead was a poorly assembled wish-list of nonemergency spending requests wrapped in a date-certain declaration of defeat, a confirmation to our enemies that if they hang on just a bit longer, we will be out of their way soon. 
   I happen to believe the stakes in Iraq are too high and the sacrifices made by our military personnel and their families too great to be content with anything but success. But the bill brought before us today isn't written with victory in mind. Its prevailing tone is one of defeat, and its abiding premise is that America's mission in Iraq is over and our troops' continued status there is without merit. And just to drive the point home, it forces on General Petraeus and his commanders on the ground constant status and reporting requirements, designed not only to undermine their basic operational authority, but to hasten a withdrawal of troop support from the region. 
   When the leaders of the majority were offered the opportunity for a secure briefing from General Petraeus a few days ago, they said no. When the majority was offered a briefing from Secretary Gates, Secretary Rice and Secretary Pace in the last few days, they said no again. 
   Does anyone think that demoting our best generals to administrative assistants represents our best chance of achieving our goals in this region? Does anyone believe our commanders in the field have been given too much authority and too much flexibility to get the job done? 
   Ultimate victory in Iraq is a proposition that is far from guaranteed, Mr. Speaker, but ultimate failure in Iraq is, if this attempt to co-opt the essential command-and-control responsibilities of our commanders in the field ever actually becomes law. 
   Mr. Speaker, this emergency supplemental includes billions of dollars in nonemergency spending, offered as an excuse to vote for a bill that guarantees our defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill and ask my colleagues to join me in sending a message of strength and resolve to our friends and our enemies and, most importantly, to our troops in the field.

And, of course, when you allow States to enter the Union, as the Constitution provides for, you have the requisite number of Members of the House and two Members of the Senate. 
   And the major question I am sure I will have during that debate and later will be exactly what State is Washington, D.C. part of, since the Constitution specifically says that Members of the House are selected by the various States. 
   I think there is a constitutional question here, and that is one of the reasons that, when we were in the majority, that Mr. Davis' bill didn't come to the floor. And I think there will be, should be, a constitutional remedy, if there is a remedy.

   Mr. BLUNT. I might be for whatever it took to return the voting rights for the Member of Congress to a State that is represented by two Senators which, of course, would be, I would assume, your State. 
   I don't know that I would be for an amendment that would allow somebody to be represented uniquely that doesn't have Senatorial representation, and, of course, you are assuming that it would be inside the Constitution. I do think that would be the way to do it. 
   And while the population of the District may allow it to have a population similar to the districts that are represented by the average Member in terms of population, the Constitution, to me, appears to be very explicit on the question of Representatives of a State. 
   Half of the original District of Columbia, as the gentleman knows, was returned to the State of Virginia in, I believe, the 1840s. They are represented by a Member of Congress, and maybe more than one, and they are represented by two Senators, the Senators from Virginia. That appears to me to be a remedy that would be well within the Constitution. But this proposal that Mr. Davis and others have made, I think, will have a significant constitutional hurdle to overcome. 
   The other question I would direct to the gentleman is on the budget itself. When does the majority expect that we will see a markup in committee of the budget resolution, and when would that resolution be on the floor?

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend. I have several questions. On the last issue that you just raised, that is the first notice that I have had, maybe our staff has had notice, right before coming to the floor on changing the rules for the Committee of the Whole to where Delegates could vote. I would ask my friend, is that only in the Committee of the Whole? Is that what that rule change would be?

   Mr. BLUNT. Okay. 
   This only happened in one Congress, which was the Congress in 1993 and 1994. I wasn't in Congress at the time, but I recall it was very controversial, I believe the gentleman suggested so controversial that there was a 
   court case that determined that these votes, if they had impact on the outcome, immediately would have to be decided by the full House. And I am wondering, is that to give a deceptively large margin in the Committee of the Whole? The majority is in the majority. Four of these five Delegates are on the majority side. Every time it doesn't matter in terms of passage, I guess that means it appears that there are four more votes or maybe five more votes than there would otherwise be. 
   What is the purpose of this? If it made a difference, it would immediately have to go to a vote that they could not participate in. 
   I yield for an answer.

   Mr. BLUNT. Reclaiming my time, it seems to me that the courts must not think it is consistent, or they wouldn't have ruled and determined that if these votes made a difference you have to vote again with a body that doesn't include the votes from those five individuals.  
   I would also suggest that while the gentleman makes the point that the Delegate from the District of Columbia represents essentially the same number of people that everybody else on this floor does, that the Delegate from Guam, for instance, represents about a fourth of that number, about 160,000, 165,000 people. So their vote will be tallied in the Committee in a way that appears that the Committee vote has a substantially different margin than the same issue taken to the floor would have, and I am sure this will be a matter of some concern. It was controversial when it was done. It only lasted for one Congress. And as the gentleman would make the point, appropriately, that when my side became the majority side in 1995, that 2-year period where this existed, that rule was changed back. 
   A little more notice on that would have been helpful, but we have been given notice. We now know that this issue will come up on Wednesday. And in my own mind, I am still unclear why it is so significant for the work of the Committee to be disproportionate in its appearance to the work of the full House. They have maybe four or five extra votes that if they made a difference in essence don't count. But if they don't make a difference, it looks like the margin that the majority has created is bigger than in reality it would be if that was the margin that made the difference in whether an issue passed or not. 
   I would be glad to hear a response to that.

   Mr. BLUNT. Reclaiming my time on that, in the committees my understanding is if the Delegates in the committees, if their vote is the vote that makes the difference in committee work, that vote does not have to be taken again. There is a fundamental difference clearly, the Constitution and the courts believe, in what happens on the House floor and what both majorities have decided happens in committee. 
   I also think there is no analogous situation in terms of the number of people represented. 
   Generally, the single district States now are close to or bigger than. The individual from Montana represents more people than anybody else on the House floor. There is no 160,000-vote in any State. 
   My good friend from American Samoa, we have been friends for over two decades now. We have found many times to work together, and this certainly in no way reflects on my true fondness or long friendship with him. I would be glad for you to make a comment, and if you want to make a comment about the fact that American Samoa was excluded from the minimum wage increase, another issue that we are concerned about, we would like to be consistent in at least that regard in how we treat these Delegate representatives and the people they represent. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from American Samoa.

   Mr. BLUNT. I am sure we will, and I thank my good friend for that point. 
   I would just point out for the purpose of this discussion, Alaska, which the majority leader wondered about the population there, has 626,000 people. Wyoming has about 420,000-some people. 
   In terms of the decision to have the relationship with the Territories, that was not made anticipating that the Territories would be represented as States are represented. That is the plain and simple truth of it. 
   If it had been, there probably would have been a different thought about how you treat both Puerto Rico and American Samoa. This is a debate that I am sure a dozen years ago was widely discussed as a debate that should be had as a constitutional debate. 
   If your vote in the Committee of the Whole is going to matter, it shouldn't be reversible by a vote by the body that doesn't include those five representatives. We have Wednesday to discuss this, and I am sure that we will. 
   I am glad to get the notification, although I think on an issue like this that clearly was a huge issue a dozen years ago, that notification on the floor is a little later than I would have hoped for. 
   The other issue on the schedule, I appreciate the leader trying his best to accommodate the retreat that our Members will have next week. And of course there will be a reciprocal accommodation for the retreat you have the next week. 
   Having scheduled the floor for some period of time, as the majority leader for a while and as the majority whip working with the leader, I sympathize with the leader's challenge of the floor. 
   I would say that on this entire issue of the voting 5 days a week, whether in truth there is anything to vote for or not, I think has been widely taken advantage of, not by the leader but particularly by people who don't prefer to understand how hard our Members work. 
   The late night comedians love the idea that Congress was suddenly going to work 5 days a week. I think that was an unfair view of what our Members do. In fact, I would advance the theory that our problem is not that our Members don't work 5 days a week, our problem is that too many of our Members work 7 days a week. Too many of our Members get so focused on this that they don't focus on the things that the people they work for hope they would, and this makes it even more difficult to get your work done. 
   Here we are today, it was about 11 when we started this discussion. We had a 30-minute debate that when we finished at 6 p.m. last night, I would advance, could have happened then and then Members would have had a day in their district to meet with people who want to meet with Members on occasion during their regular workweek, not on Saturday or Sunday, and under this current schedule the only option is to come to Washington. 
   I know my good friend appreciates how hard the Members work. I know his suggestion that we would start working 5 days a week in Washington was not intended to be an indication that Members somehow don't work as hard as other Americans do because he and I both know that is not the case. 
   I wish our Members would have been able to go home last night or this morning and spend some of this workday at home instead of on an airplane. All of our Members as far as I know have a desk in their district office. If they are not going to be there Monday through Friday, they are not going to need that desk very often, and the only way to see them is right here. I think it is unfortunate that we had to come back today for 30 minutes of debate on a measure that was already agreed to on a vote that not a single person voted the other way. I say that more in sympathy than I do in criticism. I understand the pledge you made.

   Mr. BLUNT. I am reminded of a friend of mine, when I was the Secretary of State in Missouri, who was the leader, the Democratic leader in the State Senate, was fond of saying: If you can't change your mind, you can't change anything. I am absolutely confident that no committees met today. And I understand the work the committees do in the Congress. When the committees aren't working when we could have added 30 minutes onto the schedule last night and been done, not in the middle of the night, by 7 o'clock, I think that would have been a good decision to make. I would hope my friend will remain flexible about that in the future. 
   This has gone on some time today. I appreciate the chance to talk about the work next week. I am also hopeful, and I would ask, will the change in the rules on allowing delegates to vote in the Committee of the Whole, will that go to the Rules Committees, and will there be a chance for Republicans to at least offer amendments?

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, the gentleman is right, we certainly haven't had any discussion on this until the floor today. 
   I would also make the point that last week we did take two bills to the Rules Committee; but before any opportunity was given to even offer an amendment, it was announced that no amendments would be allowed. I think that is unprecedented in the last 12 years, where at least the Rules Committee always heard the amendments and tried to offer amendments and always offered a substitute in every instance that I am aware of.

   Mr. BLUNT. I would be glad to find out the substance of that meeting this morning. I doubt it was very substantive or could not have been done yesterday. I think all the Members understand this discussion. 
   I think the general coverage of Congress meeting for 5 days a week was a disservice to the institution. It is like assuming that a surgeon only does the surgeon's work when they are in the operating room. 
   Another point that I believe I am helping my friend, the majority leader, make is, when we are in committee and not on the floor, that doesn't mean we are not working. When we are at home holding town hall meetings or meeting with constituents, or in my case, seeing how we are doing restoring power to 200,000 people that didn't have power in my district this week in weather that was between 6 and 26 degrees all week, it was impossible for me to be there today because I had to be here to cast a vote that could have been cast last night. 
   I hope we all work hard. Certainly the majority has had the better of this argument so far because it is a lot of fun to talk about Members of Congress that don't work, or suddenly Members are working. Another thing I am going to tell my friend we are going to do, frankly, is keep track of how many hours we worked in essentially a 3- and 4-day week versus a 4- and 5-day week. So far, we are winning in hours of working on the floor. 
   We worked hard; you worked hard. On the appropriations process, I would have liked to have finished that last year. It is clear to me that the unwillingness of the other body to move forward, a thing neither you nor I have a lot of control over, was the real reason we didn't get more of that work done. We had 11 of our 12 bills done by the 4th of July, without tremendous effort to keep Members here on Friday. The year before we had all of our bills done by the 4th of July. I think that is a reasonable target for us, and I hope that we help achieve that target this year. 
   We do want to get our work done. This is a bicameral legislative system. We don't control what happens on the other side. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am here in opposition to this rule. I don't feel as strongly about the bill because I don't really think the bill is a serious piece of legislation. I don't think it addresses the issues that need to be addressed. 
   I think the fact that this bill has come to the floor without going to committee, without any opportunity for debate, without the freshmen Members having any opportunity to ever be part of anything except one vote today is truly outrageous. 
   This should be the premier issue for this Congress. Energy independence and all of that affects everything we are, everything we do as a people. It affects foreign policy, it affects our international situation in so many ways, it affects the economy, it affects the environment. And here we are with a bill today that hopefully is just checking off the list and we really get back to serious discussions of energy legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, energy independence is critically important, and it is not going to be achieved in this bill in this  way. This bill does take a problem, a problem that was created in 1998 and 1999, a problem that was created when the Secretary of the Interior failed to put in a contract, what the laws that we passed clearly allowed the Secretary of the Interior to do. It didn't happen later, it didn't happen in 2000, it never happened in the current administration. It was a problem. It is a problem in a contract. Whether that is worth 3 hours of debate on the House floor or not, I don't know. I do know that contracts are normally dealt with in a court of law, not on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   This is a problem that was created by a past administration that needs to be clarified, but is so far off base from what we ought to be talking about today. We ought to be talking about energy independence for the country. 
   This rule doesn't allow us to have that kind of debate because the process didn't allow that kind of debate. I guess we are going to be told later today that we are at the end of the 100 hours, which is an interesting calculation in and of itself. And maybe when we will get to the end of the 100 hours, we can get this checklist. I wondered for some time why we didn't have an agenda that would last 100 days.     
   Since Franklin Roosevelt that has sort of been a mark of the work of the Congress. I have really decided there is not enough work here to do for 100 days, but these 100 hours are checking a list off that will not produce legislation that results in anything happening. At the end of the day today we hopefully can move on to the real business of this Congress, none of it more important than energy independence. This doesn't solve that problem, doesn't even take a significant step in solving that problem.

   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, I do intend to request a recorded vote. However, I first want to make a point of order that the Chair just failed to properly announce the result of the question of passage by the requisite three-fifths pursuant to clause 5(b) of rule XXI, which requires a three-fifths vote to increase tax rates. 
   Section 102 of H.R. 6 proposes to deny a deduction under section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for an income attributable to domestic production of oil, natural gas or primary products thereof.  
   Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code provides for up to a 9 percent deduction in the amount of corporate income that is taxable under section 11(b) of the Code. 
   As described in the joint statement of managers accompanying H.R. 4520, which created section 199, when enacted section 199 effectively created a lower percentage rate of tax and therefore reduced the amount of tax proposed by such section. Once fully phased in in 2010, section 199 reduces the tax rate under section 11(b) by 3 points. 
   Section 102 of the pending bill proposes to disallow this deduction for certain taxpayers, thus imposing a new, higher percentage of tax, and thereby increasing the amount of tax imposed on a taxpayer under section 11(b). 
   The Joint Committee on Taxation has indicated that section 102 will increase tax receipts by $7.6 billion between 2007 and 2017. 
   Therefore, Madam Speaker, since this bill increases taxes, and since that tax burden will ultimately be passed on to every American consumer who owns or operates an automobile, I insist on my point of order and demand that H.R. 6 not be considered as passed unless agreed to by three-fifths of those Members present and voting.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this resolution. General Petraeus said a resolution like this would discourage the troops. The Secretary of Defense said a resolution like this would embolden the enemy. This Congress should be doing neither of those things. 
   What this resolution will not do is take a position on what we should do as we face the challenge of our generation. 
   President Johnson was criticized a generation ago and still today for choosing bombing sites in Vietnam. He was the Commander in Chief; yet he should have left those tactical choices to the military. 
   But his actions made imminently more sense than this. It is hard to imagine a group less capable of making tactical decisions about specific troop deployments than 535 Members of Congress. 
   The resolution today is about the exact number of troops. Will the one tomorrow or next week be a vote on which block in Baghdad to target or which car to stop? 
   And, of course, today what we debate is a tactic in the greater fight we are in. The new commanding general determined this surge is the right course of action. The Iraq Study Group was supportive of ``a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the training and equipping mission, if the U.S. commander in Iraq determines that such a step would be effective.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we can all agree that the current situation in Iraq cannot continue. That is why the President has advanced a new way forward. 
   Actions do have consequences, and this resolution the Democrats advance today is a vote for the status quo. It is a vote for the current strategy because it is a vote not to change that strategy. The current strategy is not working, and as a southwest Missourian told me yesterday, We are there. He went on to say, It really doesn't matter how we got there or what we thought. We are in a fight that won't stop if we leave. 
   The fact of the matter is that Congress does have the power to end the war if it has the political will to do so. 
   Almost 24 years ago, in November of 1983, the Congress voted to withdraw from Lebanon by March of 1984. Many of the proponents of this resolution voted then, who were Members of Congress then, voted to leave. They lost 153-274, but the message was sent, and we left anyway, and when we left, the myth of American weakness began to take hold in al Qaeda. 
   The language of this nonbinding resolution does not tackle the tough issues of war. It tries to have it both ways: disapproving the tactics but supporting the troops. It does not say we will fund the troops in the future or not fund the troops. It does not say we will supply the troops in the future or not supply the troops. This resolution just says enough not to say anything at all. 
   America should see this move for what it really is, a political first step to cutting off funding to the dangerous mission our troops face. 
   The truth is, we are in a war against a hostile and ferocious enemy that will stop at nothing. Imagine how this debate this week bolsters those radical terrorists whose sole goal is to destroy America because we disprove, as no society ever has, the dogma of religious totalitarianism that they use every day to recruit followers and funders and suicide bombers. 
   Our diversity, our ability to live together, and the prosperity and vitality that are the result have produced the enemies we face today. As long as we live as we do, they must be wrong. 
   This week, the Congress will send the signal to those enemies and to those who fight to protect us from them that America has the will and indeed the courage to continue fighting these Islamic totalitarians or that we do not take the consequences of failure seriously

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I thank the gentleman for the time, and I am particularly pleased to follow my good friend, Mr. Crowley, at this moment in the debate. I want to recognize others later, but he and others, as he just said, made this a real bipartisan effort for many of us in the Chamber. 
   September 11 fundamentally changed the way we looked at the world. It also changed a number of important and substantive ways the way we defend against and react to things that could happen that would be unthinkable. It was really within the context of that change of rural view that Americans expressed the outrage they did over the Dubai Ports World deal last year. 
   The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a previously obscure government agency, known to some and referred to in some debate, often referred to as CFIUS, approved that acquisition, and it didn't take long for the committee to attract all sorts of critical attention. 
   The reason for all the concern is that the CFIUS decision brought to light some very serious national security issues with equally serious implications for the safety and protection of vital points of the American infrastructure. 
   Thankfully, as the Congress set last year to consider ways to shore up security protocols over at CFIUS, we found ourselves agreeing that any reform of CFIUS ought to take great care to both encourage foreign investment in the future of America while balancing the need to maintain a strong program of national security. We can, as this bill does, protect America's families physically while protecting their jobs, their investments, and their pension plans. 
   Congress has no more important responsibility than to ensure the security of the Nation. But I don't believe  that wholesale protectionism either protects our vital national security interest or advances our economic interest in the world. 
   During the last Congress, Congresswoman Pryce, Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman Crowley and I crafted a responsible bipartisan bill that addressed the problems exposed in the CFIUS process during the Dubai Ports World incident. Congressman Frank and Congressman Bachus helped to see that we got that debate on the floor and have done so much to see that we bring that debate back. 
   While the bill we passed didn't have a single dissenting vote, even though we asked for and had a roll call, we weren't able to resolve our differences with the other body before the end of the Congress, and so we didn't get that bill done. Today we come back with essentially an identical bill, I think slightly improved, that Congresswoman Maloney was the principal sponsor of. Our goal is to strike the right balance here between securing the country and open engagement in a global economy. 
   The bill before us today accomplishes these objectives while dealing with the main issues the Dubai Ports World incident exposed.     
   It does this in a couple of ways. First, it reaffirms congressional intent relating to the so-called Byrd rule, which mandates a 45-day investigation for companies controlled by foreign governments. Any state-owned enterprise that poses any type of security risk will trigger an automatic CFIUS investigation. 
   Secondly, it increases accountability in the CFIUS process by establishing CFIUS in statute and adding the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Commerce as vice chairs of the committee. 
   Third, our bill greatly expands congressional oversight and includes important language protecting proprietary business information. 
   The administration has raised some concerns regarding how these things will impact the process operationally. I look forward to working with the administration as we move forward to achieve our shared goal of creating a reasonable framework for approving foreign investments in the United States, while at the same time protecting our national security and ensuring that the mistakes of the Dubai Ports situation are not repeated. 
   The other thing we don't want to do also is make it so hard to invest in this country that American businesses aren't able to invest in other countries. We don't want to start an investment war, and this bill clearly is headed in the right direction to do the things it needs to do. We are fortunate to have the bill on the floor. 
   Congresswomen Pryce and Maloney, Congressmen Frank, Bachus, Crowley, King, Hoekstra and Barton have all been instrumental in coming with a bill that doesn't just respond to the excitement of the moment, but reaches a long-term conclusion that protects Americans and also protects the value of American companies. I am pleased to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL OIL AND GAS LEASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for recognizing me. 
   I would point out to my good friend the conference chairman on the now majority side that we often passed pieces of legislation from this House that are already available to pass again today. Certainly there is no question that on the other side of this building, that legislation was often blocked. But we would like to see a comprehensive solution. 
   My littlest boy and my grandchildren all love Band-aids. In fact, sometimes my little boy, Charlie, will fall and bump his head, and he feels better if we put a band-aid on his arm. 
   I think that is kind of what we are doing here this week. We are bringing band-aids to the floor, rather than dealing with the real problem. We have got bills on the floor that say it is the people who run the service stations, and maybe there is price gouging; or it is the people who participate in the market; or it is the people who look for oil and gas. 
   I would suggest it may very well be the people that don't bring the legislation to the floor that would do the things that my friend from Illinois just said he was for: Production. Those bills are there. We would like to see them discharged. 
   We have got the No More Excuses Energy Act that the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Thornberry, has proposed, that would allow the kinds of production that the majority has just said they are for. 
   We have got a refinery siting bill that Mr. Pitts from Pennsylvania has that would allow more refinery capacity. 
   We have a repeal on a ban that won't let the government buy any of these alternative fuels that we are hearing are such a good idea. The very best way you can get a loan and go to the bank is if you had a government contract for coal-to-liquid jet fuel or oil shale or the tar sands. We have a Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Act that we will be trying to discharge in the future. We would like to see the real solutions come to the floor. 
   And on-use-it-or-lose-it, absolutely you do lose it when the lease is up. Less than 10 percent of the available land is being used now.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I am in opposition to the bill. It goes without saying that the authors of our Nation's founding document understood better than most that freedom to practice one's religion represents one of the most fundamental, most inalienable rights bestowed on us. It was, after all, the reason that many came to America, the reason that many fought to found America. The Founders made sure to include the free exercise of religion among the first rights they included in the Constitution. 
   While the Founders saw the Constitution as a means of ensuring religious freedom and that that be protected at all levels, this bill, innocently enough, named the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, would actually have the effect of rolling back these protections, depending on where you happen to work. Perhaps even worse, it deliberately sets out to create a constitutional conflict between one's right to religious freedom and another's right to sue you for practicing it. 
   Madam Chairman, the tension this bill could create is not difficult to foresee in practice. For instance, if you chose to keep a Bible at your work station or perhaps even display in your cubicle a verse you found particularly meaningful, the legal question is simple created by this legislation: Can one or more of your coworkers seeing that passage, seeing that Bible, understanding there are passages there about homosexuality, bring suit against you and your employer on the grounds that mere presence of religious symbols constitutes a ``hostile workplace'' in which they are being forced to work? 
   The answer, it seems to me, depends more on where you work than whether or not the Bible's position on your desk is offensive. Employees, for example, at Southwest Baptist University, where I was the president before I came to Congress, would be exempt from the standards of this measure because they have a relationship with a specific denomination. But employees of either a Christian bookstore or a Muslim bookstore would be granted no such dispensation, potentially being forced to choose between upholding the faith positions upon which they are based and on which they acquire customers and complying with a law that says the free exercise of religion can be abrogated by a whim of Congress. This is the wrong decision for us to expect them to make. We are told, however, that any of the legal questions here will be decided and settled in court. The very reason the Constitution established this exercise of religion as the first of all the amendments is so these issues would not have to be settled in court. 
   There is really no reason here to create a new protected class. This bill puts this newly protected freedom on a collision course with the oldest of all the protected freedoms, the freedom of religion. The inevitable upshot of pitting two classes of people against each other, one protected by the Constitution, the other by Congress, is litigation, and lots of it. We don't need to create more reasons for litigation in the country. We don't need to create differences from court jurisdiction to court jurisdiction. We need to go back and look at this issue again. We need to defeat this bill today. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his hard work, the hard work of my good friend, the chairman of the committee, Mr. Levin, of Mr. Herger, for working to bring this important bill to the floor. 
   Americans can and do compete all over the world. They can and do compete successfully all over the world. And it's particularly important that we compete in our own neighborhood. 
   Many of us, over the last several years, have begun to look at what's happened in the last two decades to our neighbors to the south and their relationships with us, and we saw those relationships drifting away. One way to strengthen those relationships is to strengthen this opportunity to work together, this opportunity to trade together, this opportunity to have legal systems that encourage investment and trade. And we can do that. 
   The point's been made already by speakers on both sides of the aisle that for some time now, Peru, Colombia, Panama, the CAFTA countries that are now moving in and have moved into a permanent trade relationship with us, for some time now they've been able to ship all of the things into our market without duties that they could possibly ship into our market. 
   In fact, as we've discussed these trade bills in the past, I've had Members on both sides of aisle ask me, well, if they can send everything in here they want to send in, why would they even want this arrangement? 
   Of course, the reason is not the immediate economics to them, because the immediate economics to them are already very good. The reason is the long-term tie and relationship of their economy to our economy, the strength it gives them in this hemisphere to be a partner, a trading partner with the United States. And we see that happen. 
   The projection on this opportunity alone is that U.S. exports to Peru will increase by over $1 billion a year; not much projection on increase early on from Peru, because, remember, they're already sending everything here that they want to without tariffs. This removes the barriers not for them; they've already been removed. This removes the barriers for us. 
   And our neighborhood's important. Our hemisphere is important. The United States has been blessed in many, many ways. And as we see the opportunities grow for people in all of the Americas, that's actually good for us. One billion dollars in exports means $1 billion in manufactured goods from this country, some services from this country going to Peru. And I think that Peru should only be the beginning of what we do over the next few months. 
   Following on CAFTA, Peru, Panama, Colombia, all of which have, at this moment, the access to our markets they would have after the agreement, we need access to their markets.     
   We need that permanence of relationship. We need that reaching out to say that we are in this hemisphere together, we are in a global economy, and the part of that economy that we should all benefit from the most is the economy closest to us. And Mr. McCrery and Mr. Rangel have worked hard to establish a framework here that's the framework for the work we do tonight and tomorrow but also is the framework for what we do in the rest of this Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to look not just at the economic impact of these agreements but also the geopolitical impact, the impact in our neighborhood, the impact in our hemisphere, the opportunity of these countries to work to  eliminate illegal trade and particularly to eliminate illegal drug trade, the opportunity in these countries to open their markets to us as we have opened our markets to them. I urge my colleagues to give support to this agreement as we look at the future of other agreements and other opportunities. 
   Americans can compete. Americans are competing. And this agreement will prove the American ability to compete in yet one more country.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding, Madam Speaker. 
   I'm glad we're here at this work today. I do think that the bill has improved and the situation has clarified from Monday. We need to come together. We need to get this work done. It's incredibly important. It seems to me that two significant things have happened: one, the changes in the bill that others will talk about and I will talk about a little bit; and two, the changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Accounting Standards Board that have set forth a new way to evaluate these assets that are causing so much trouble in the marketplace. 
   Now, where I live, nobody talks about illiquid assets. They talk about mortgages. They talk about how to pay the bills. They talk about whether they can borrow money or not, and at the end of the day, Madam Speaker, that's what this bill is about. 
   It's not about Wall Street. It's about Main Street. It's not a bailout. It's a situation where American taxpayers are going to invest money in a way that ensures they have a return. I think with the work we've done here, we've not only ensured that they're likely is never likely to be a question of return, but beyond that, if at the end of 5 years taxpayers would appear have lost any money, the President will propose and Congress will act on a set of recommendations that go back to the agencies that participated and say we're going to recover whatever was lost. 
   This is a chance where American taxpayers are investing in their own future. This is an opportunity where people are helping stabilize a market. We saw a bank purchase this week where it looked like the government would have to be part of the purchase, but after the government came in and said here's how we're going to work to stabilize the situation, suddenly there's a market and suddenly that purchase is much different than it would have been without government participation. 
   This bill allows that kind of stabilization. This bill protects taxpayers. This bill has every known oversight mechanism ever conceived of by government in it now. None of those were asked for initially by the administration but they're all there now, a special Inspector General, a board that sets policy, a congressional oversight group, GAO with special authority, ultimate transparency. 
   This is a bill the taxpayers can look at and say this is well beyond the proposal that came to the Congress. It has a transparency. It has the oversight. It has the guarantees that taxpayers should ask for, but it also has lots of options, options that weren't in the original proposal, not just to loan money, not just to purchase mortgages and other securities, but to set up an insurance plan so if that's one of the things that would make more sense in certain areas it can be used. 
   It's a critical moment.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (GAS PRICE RELIEF FOR CONSUMERS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I think we've already passed this bill in this Congress 345-76 or something like that. And I'm not surprised we're seeing it again. We're not seeing answers to the energy problems we face. Gas prices reached another high yet today. $3.79 a gallon is the average in the country. American families and small businesses are paying $1.46 per gallon more today than they were paying when Nancy Pelosi became the Speaker. 
   In 2006, the minority leader at that time, Nancy Pelosi, said, Democrats have a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices. Well, for weeks now Republicans have been asking what that commonsense plan was, and we've given up on that; and so we will begin in the next new days going ahead and rolling out our plans as to what we think we could do to do something about these prices. 
   This bill was not an answer last year. It is not an answer this year. NOPEC is no answer. NOPEC is no policy. NOPEC actually means more dependence. Why we would want to continue to head down the road of more dependence on oil from outside the United States is amazing to me. 
   Ninety-one percent of all Americans commute to work using an automobile. And the increase in gasoline costs for the 3.3 million Americans who drive at least 50 miles each day to work has increased by $1,200 since this Congress began its work 16 months ago. 
   I had a roundtable in my district last week with people, a lot of whom probably at the table I was at, the average was a drive of about 45 or 50 miles; and if you're working at a job that pays by the hour and you're driving 45 or 50 miles a day, you really don't have a choice. Where I live and where many of our Members live, there is no mass transit, there is no bus, there is no alternative other than to get there in your own car or to ride with somebody else. 
   And so you're now either paying an extra $100 a month just to get to work or you're somehow sharing that $100 with the person you figured out how to ride with. The average American drives about 15,000 miles per year, and that means the average Americans are now paying almost $700 more for gasoline than they were when this new majority took over. 
   The upcoming Memorial Day weekend is really known as the traditional start of the summer driving season. It's only 4 days away, and 9 out of 10 trips made during that summer travel season are made in an automobile, 9 out of 10 family vacations occur in an automobile; and we're setting record prices every day. In fact, this is the twelfth consecutive day for an all-time record gas price increase. Last week was the ninth consecutive week for an all-time gas price increase record. And we have NOPEC back on the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's time we got bills on the floor that did the things that need to be done to get the country heading in the right direction. Republicans have sponsored those bills, Democrats have sponsored those bills. But where are they? They don't have a hearing in the Energy Committee, they don't have a place on the floor, and gas prices continue to go up. 
   We need to do things that promote clean and reliable power generation.  We need to do things that improve expanding American energy production. We need greater energy efficiency, greater conservation, and in the short term, we could do things like we finally did last week on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and like we've urged this Congress to do which is to abandon the 18 1/2 cent Federal gas tax for the summer driving months and at least have that kind of impact on the driving public as we take another hundred days to try to find a real solution. We are not going to find the solutions by repeating work we did last year. 
   Americans are tired of these gas prices going up. This Congress should do something about it. It can't do something about it without energy bills on the floor that do more than study a problem that we all know only makes the dependence on foreign countries worse. 
   Let's reduce dependence, let's encourage research, and let's do what we can to get America moving again with energy policies that make sense for American families and American workers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank you for that information. It does look like to me that the schedule for next week is incredibly light for 3 days of work. Last week, when Mr. Hoyer and I were talking about the problems of bringing the SCHIP bill to the floor without a conference, without any real opportunity for those of us on this side to see the bill, he said last week one of the reasons for that was the Senate was not able to go to conference. And I'm hoping on the four bills that the Senate has already passed, and we could go to conference on, that we see some action on those bills. 
   I think, particularly, the bill where the new benefits for military families and veterans that could be available as early as next Tuesday, October 1, aren't going to be available because we're not naming conferees. And I wonder if my friend has any sense of when we might be able to have one of those bills, or any appropriation bill, on the House floor now that the fiscal year is essentially, this is the last legislative working day in the fiscal year. 
   Four bills have been ready, one of them, the military quality of life and veterans bill, for some time now, with no apparent interest in going to conference and getting that bill done. And I know we notified the majority before that I'd be asking that question, and so I'm wondering if you have any sense of when any or all of those bills might actually be scheduled, particularly looking at the incredibly light workweek scheduled for next week. 
   And I yield to my friend.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, before we go to one other topic, I'd just say that for bills where we could have started, particularly for military families, the quality of life issues there and for veterans, I think it's a shame that we're not starting those on Tuesday, when they could have started. 
   The other thing that just happened, the President just sent the Peru Free Trade Agreement to the House. The Ways and Means Committee held its markup on the Peru Free Trade Agreement this week, and I've read, at least, that there's an intention, before we go to that trade agreement, to go to a trade adjustment bill that has not yet been written. That trade adjustment bill, when it has passed in the past, has passed with trade promotion authority. With no new trade promotion authority, there's less reason than there might have otherwise been for new trade adjustment authority. And more importantly, it seems, we might run the risk here of slowing the Peru agreement, the clock of which just started, if we wait for a bill that's not yet been written. 
   And I guess my two questions would be, do we plan to do trade adjustment assistance with TPA? And does the gentlelady have any sense of why it's necessary to do that before we do a trade agreement that we've already held the markup on and the President just sent down? 
   And I'd yield.

   And I'd also point out that it's obvious we have not done everything we could have done for military families and veterans, or we'd have a bill that goes into effect next Tuesday instead of some time later this year.

And we would hope to see that bill next week on the floor or as soon as possible because there is some great likelihood from that White House meeting that the gentleman mentioned that there is going to have to be a second bill if we can't resolve these issues that lead toward a veto. 
   On one of those issues we did yesterday, the House voted on the motion to instruct the conferees to sustain the House position. Does the gentleman have any information on the likelihood of the House or Senate view of the deadline issue that we discussed yesterday? 
   I yield to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that answer, Mr. Speaker. I hope we can. I think we do need to continue to talk about how we ultimately resolve this issue. 
   Now, in the information that I am getting from both the Defense Department and our Members that have military installations is that while the war effort, itself, with lots of changing of categories of money and determinations of money around may be very well up through June, that the defense effort generally is impacted because money that would have been spent for National Guard training or money that would have been spent to pay obligations to a contractor are not available in this process. 
   Now, the last time Secretary Gates, at least, who was not Secretary at the time, said that the spend-out was not quite as quick, and he also said that the need was not quite as critical. But the gentleman is absolutely right in pointing out that last time this process took a long time, and one of the reasons it took a long time was that the House leaders, the majority leaders at that time, were in conflict with the Senate about additional spending. I don't see any of those discussions, frankly, going on, but the additional spending last time at $14.5 billion did not occur because the House leaders wouldn't accept that and we passed the bill in the House last time a month after the President sent the request up, and then it was a number of months, almost 4 or 5 months, before we got a final bill because we were fighting that additional spending, and at some point we are going to have to also engage not just on the issues of deadlines and whether or not we are micromanaging the effort, but the additional spending was the real problem last time. I would like to think that there was some effort going on there. I don't know that there is. 
   My next question, though, is that the gentleman's goals for the appropriations process really would require us to pretty quickly move on the budget itself. We missed a deadline that we often miss. I don't want to belabor that point, but that April 15 deadline we normally had to hit if we had a real opportunity to get the bills out of the House by the Fourth of July, which we did in the first part of the last Congress and all but one of the bills in the second part of the last Congress. 
   What is your sense of where we are on the conferees for the budget and a final budget document?

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - April 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for sharing that with me. And certainly there were occasions where we had to do exactly what the gentleman is suggesting, and that is always one option. At some point, based on the meeting the deadlines we hope to meet and you hope to meet on the calendar, you have to decide whether that is the option you have to go to or not, as opposed to a conference report that we can agree to that lets us move forward that way. 
   I would also like to repeat one of the comments the gentleman made simply because we don't get much credit here or didn't get much credit for efforts we did make to control spending. And you are absolutely right, a year ago at this time the fight was between the Senate, which was led by Republicans at the time, and the House that was led by the Republicans on that additional spending. 
   And I just want to make the point that you already made once, but we don't hear it emphasized very often, but that was the fight. House Republicans did win, and we spent $14.5 billion less than our friends on the other side intended to spend, offered to spend, wanted to spend; and that is what that time frame was all about. 
   We do, I believe, have more concerns in overall defense spending just because the spend-down has been quicker this year than last year, and Secretary Gates, not me, would be the source for that view of the difference in the 2 years. But clearly, the process, as the gentleman rightly pointed out, is never as easy as we want, as quick as we want, and there are obstacles there. 
   I would like to, before we conclude today, ask a couple more questions. One is the concern that I have and many of our Members have on the rule that was used this week to waive PAYGO for the D.C. bill and to create a new obstacle for Members who hope to offer a motion to recommit. 
   Twelve years and, now, a few months ago, when Republicans took control of the House, they extended the motion to recommit to the minority at that time and never failed to offer that motion to recommit under the traditions of the House. I believe, while it often was not  allowed the minority in previous years, never in either previous times or the last 12 years was an actual tabling motion put in the rule, which creates a different circumstance intentionally, but a different circumstance than was ever created in this House before. 
   And I wonder really two things: Would that tabling motion be something that we will see again? And also, would we expect to see the PAYGO effort in the future waived for the principal reason to be on the floor and handled in a separate vote and a separate piece of legislation, like we did this time? 
   Is that now the anticipated norm for this process, Mr. Leader?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I thank my friend for that. 
   But I do think in that view of this that there is a significant restriction of the rights available to Members. Members have to defend what they do on the floor. Let me make a couple of points. 
   One is, in the incident you mentioned when the gentleman from Texas offered a motion to recommit well within the rules, and, by the way, in that case and many other cases the only option that the minority has had has been the option of last resort, unless you take that away, which was the motion to recommit. All of our amendments were rejected; no matter how germane they might have been, they were not allowed. 
   The Members of the House are the ones who have the opportunity to decide what is the right vote and what's not. And, in fact, stopping that vote offered under the rules by a Member in good faith I think was a violation of that Member's rights as a Member of the House. 
   Now, you could have had that vote, it might have killed the bill, but you could have started a new bill just like you did anyway. The only difference would have been that the Member of the House that brought the issue to the floor would have had his full rights as a Member to have his issue not only debated, but voted on. And we were literally seconds from actually having that vote, which under the rules of the House would have sent the bill to the committee promptly. 
   There may have been no way to leave the committee with that bill, but you could have started a new bill just like you did. The only difference would have been that the gentleman from Texas would have had his motion voted on, as I believe he had a right to. 
   On the other issue, we did have PAYGO for 8 years of the 12 years we were in the majority. We complied with it. We still never took away the ability of your side to do just what you said we shouldn't be able to do.

   Mr. BLUNT. Let me finish the thought, and then I will. 
   I can give you many instances where not only did your side try to avail themselves of that right, which we never then took away, and it probably did create political concerns for our Members; but the House has been here longer than any Member has been here and will be here longer than any Member will be here. And beginning to change the rules in that way or change the rights of Members to offer their objections, their ideas, their improvements as Members always have is a bigger step than I think the gentleman may realize. 
   And in terms of whether things are germane or not, I very well remember a bill to create the Homeland Security part of our government and the motion to recommit was about corporate inversions. Now, that is every bit as tangential as anything the gentleman just mentioned. But we didn't go back the next week and say, we're never going to allow the minority to have that vote again because it was troublesome for us. Troublesome for us and protecting the rights of Members as they relate to past Members and future Members I think are two different things. 
   I will yield to my friend.

   Mr. BLUNT. I would say to my friend, we do have a disagreement on this and I think we do see what my good friend perceives as a minor change in procedure differently because I don't think it is that at all. 
   I would say a couple of things: one is 18 times at least in the minority our friends on the other side used the same rule that my friend now so vigorously objects to because it would kill the bill. Eighteen times. They never were able to do it, but 18 times used it, many times with the provisions just like the one I cited earlier that were every bit as tangential as the one the gentleman is speaking to. 
   Also I am sure in terms of, I don't know if the word was ``sincerity'' or what, but I do know that our friend from Texas is a sincere and dedicated Member.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, my friend knows as well, if not better than anybody, how to explain exactly how a Member could be motivated to do both of those things and has defended the rights of the minority for a number of years in an extraordinary way on similar kinds of issues. But the point here is that we are about more than the moment, and my friend said that he wants to do everything he can to prevent his Members from being put in a difficult political situation. The truth is, this is a difficult job, and Members who run for it should understand it is a difficult job and there are things that not only have to be decided, but have to be explained as part of that job. And while changing a procedure, a process, in a way that has never been handled before with this tabling inclusion this week may seem insignificant, I don't think it is. 
   Also, on our side during the time we had PAYGO, my friend mentioned spending, we never waived PAYGO for spending. On any spending bill, we always adhered to the PAYGO rule. You always had that available to you. 
   We will move forward. I do appreciate the fact that we are going to continue to talk about these issues before we do anything to change the overall rules of the House. I am concerned, however, when we change what one of our outside observers has referred to recently as the norms of the House. This rule this week was not only outside the norms of the House; it was unique in the way it handled this tabling issue. It was not unique in the way it divided the bills. I am not complaining about that. I am complaining about the potential for a Member to use all the tools previously available to them to actually, frankly, stop legislation that they didn't like if they didn't like it. But you can't do that unless 217 other people join you in that. 
   We are not in the majority on our side, we understand that, and for us to do anything under the rules of the House, with a majority vote, Democrats have to join us. If we make those options too appealing, that is, frankly, not our fault. Changing the rules for the momentary relief of Members has greater long-term consequences than I believe my friend realizes. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. BLUNT. For my friend to understand, it is not a concern about this bill. It is not a concern about what happened on that bill. It is the fact that the tabling addition may be within the rules, but extraordinary. If it is within the rules it has never been done before. The tabling addition changes the consequences of a Member's motion. When you change the consequences of a Member's motion, you take a right away from the Member that the Member previously had.  
   We may have to discuss this. I can see we are still not quite on the same wavelength. It is not about this bill, Mr. Hoyer. It is not about this week. It is about doing something that has never been done before that has consequential impact, and I believe this does. I think you and I should continue to talk about it. I think our Members in the minority are justly concerned about it, as you would have been in the minority if we had done something we never did in the majority, which is change the consequences of your motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding and for managing this recognition of our colleague PAUL GILLMOR. 
   Like so many people in this room, I've had lots of experiences with PAUL, and they were all good, whether they were watching him represent our country in diplomatic situations in his role leading our NATO parliamentary effort, one of the leaders in that effort, or whether it was every Thursday when we had the deputy whip meeting and talked about where we ought to be going as a conference, where we ought to be going as a country. 
   I remember PAUL said to me one time, he said, you know, that's my favorite meeting of the week because that's where we talk about the future, and PAUL GILLMOR was a future-oriented guy who loved his family, who loved his country, who loved the concept of public service. And he performed that public service well, whether it was years in the Ohio State senate or two decades in the U.S. Congress. 
   We will truly miss him. We are surprised at his leaving us way too early. His contributions would have continued to be great here, and the country will suffer from the loss that we feel today. 
   I also want to reach out to his family. And as I said, PAUL loved his country, but he also loved his family. And you didn't have to spend much time with him to find out that deep love he had for his sons, for his daughters, for his wife and for his extended family. And I appreciate him so much, and I'm going to join his family and his friends in missing him. His place here will be hard to fill, and his contributions have been great.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, for his work to bring this bill to the floor, and for the moments the entire House is taking to recognize those who have sacrificed for us and the homecoming 35 years ago of our good friend, Sam  Johnson, and others. Those who have served in this way have served with particular challenges to their courage and have seen their faith and their families' challenged as well. 
   Recently in another ceremony in this building reflecting on the Holocaust, the speaker at that ceremony, the White House chief of staff, mentioned his father, a prisoner in another war, World War II, who all the time he was in a prison camp in Germany refused to take off the dog tag symbol that identified him as a Jew. 
   We all know that story of our colleague in the Senate who saw the guard draw a symbol of a cross on the ground as he had released him from the particular painful way he had been bound to be left overnight and then quickly erased that symbol of his faith. 
   We've read, many of us, our friend Sam's story about not only his challenge and his strength and faith, but also how his own family didn't know for months and months whether he was alive or dead, and that was a story that was all too frequent among our heroes who served us and served in this capacity. They kept the faith, they honored their country. 
   The stories go on and on and on about the flag that was found and destroyed and the man who had pieced that flag together in a Vietnamese prison camp was brutally beaten, and as soon as he could regain enough strength and consciousness, he began to get little pieces of cloth and put a flag back together again. That kind of service, that kind of honor, that kind of courage, that kind of patriotism is what we recognize today; and particularly those of us who serve with Sam Johnson get to recognize it every day as we see him come courageously to the floor serving his country again.

   Mr. BLUNT. That is the way I understand it, my friend, and our agreement at this point is for these appropriations bills, although in our rule last year we also extended that to authorizing bills. As you know, we don't want to continue that discussion, but the agreement we made this week, the majority  leader is fully in compliance with the agreement we made so we can move forward with these appropriations bills with the understanding that while now we will have a significant opportunity to look at the remainder of the specific Member projects or earmarks in the bill, we also would have an opportunity to have a debatable point of order on the conference report if those appear. 
   I would also like to ask about energy. I know in previous discussions on the floor at the end of previous weeks, I believe we discussed the likelihood that there would be an energy bill on the floor by July 4. I know in either this week's schedule or future scheduling that the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Energy and Commerce Committee have all delayed some markups that they had intended, and I am wondering if the leader has a sense of what that means in terms of an energy bill on the floor, and also that bill on the floor in light of the appropriations works we just discussed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his hard work on these issues, and I also appreciate my colleagues from the committee. But I am here to say to my friends that, as we look at this bill, I don't know what this bill does because the bill is so unclear. It didn't go through our committee. Like the other legislation we passed in this Congress, it is not likely to become law. I believe we have put around 21 bills on the President's desk so far this year, a dozen of them to name post offices. And the reason for that is all of the bills we passed in the House don't create a result, they don't create law. 
   Let me just refer to one thing. It says you can't sell fuel in an emergency situation at a price that is, (a), ``unconscionably excessive.'' Of course you shouldn't do that. We shouldn't allow that. But we should define what that means. 
   One of the supporters of the bill has told me, well, every court will decide what that means. I have got to tell you, the mom-and-pop grocery and gasoline station owner can't wonder what every court is going to decide. 
   This bill is unclear. It needs work. It puts an undue hardship on people that are trying to make a living running a  service station, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I certainly don't intend to lecture my good friend from Wisconsin on this process. He works hard. Between him and Mr. Lewis, they probably have forgotten more and have also understood more about this process maybe than any other two Members that have ever served. But the fact is when Congressman Lewis was the chairman, we actually took veterans out of the appropriations bill they had been in for years because we thought they had been used in a way that was not appropriate. 
   We took veterans out of VA-HUD and made it part of Veterans and Military Quality of Life for the specific reason that we didn't want to see that process that had gone on for too long continue. In 2005, the first year we did that, Chairman Lewis and his committee brought that bill and every other bill to the floor one bill at a time. In fact, this is the first time since 1987, 20 years ago, that we have been in this part of October without a single appropriations bill having passed the House floor. 
   Clearly, if we were voting to go to conference on Labor, Health and Human Services, the motion before us, I would have some enthusiasm for getting at least one conference started. I would also be arguing that the conference we should be going on would be the ones for the bills that have been over here the longest, and one of those two bills following Homeland was, I think we call it now Military Construction and Veterans. But it is still a military quality of life bill. It still affects military families. It still affects retirees. It still affects veterans. And it is a bill that not only the President has said he would sign but this House passed 138 days ago. The Senate passed it almost 2 months ago and named their conferees 2 months ago. 
   This is a bill that does have increases for veterans. Every bill in the 10 years I have been here has had significant increases for veterans, none more so than this, to the point that the increases for veterans and military families and military construction in this bill, about $18.5 million a day, so if today we just multiplied that by 31, that is how much money hasn't been spent in the last month on military families, on military retirees, on military veterans, on people serving that would have been affected by military construction. It's high time we went to conference on that bill. 
   But what we don't want to start here is a process where we take our veterans and our military families and our retirees and we use them as a vehicle to have another political debate. As I understand, all I know is what I hear on the floor and read in the paper on this, that the plan is to take three bills, two of which almost every Member of this Congress voted for, add to them a bill that was as divisive in floor debate as any bill we debated, and have this three-car pile-on or this three-car pileup, this three-bill pileup that I think sets an unfortunate precedent for how we use veterans and military families. 
   I wish we were going to conference on a number of bills today, and I wish we were committed to do these bills in the way that both the chairman and the ranking member have argued effectively over years now that we should be doing these bills.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his leadership today and his leadership during this discussion. 
   None of us want to be here today. All of us would rather not be dealing with this situation. None of us wanted to see the worldwide economic news over the weekend, but it all happened. And we see things happening in our country today that have to be dealt with, and this body has an opportunity today to deal with those things. 
   We've reached out to try to compromise on both sides of the aisle on a solution. Now, frankly, I think every speech here today on either side that gets into wanting to allocate blame as part of this vote is not helpful. I do think what could be helpful is this solution. I don't think it is helpful the way we started talking about a ``solution, but it's not this one.'' We started talking about a bailout, and we truly have gotten, with lots of effort, to a program that could be a workout. 
   These are not valueless assets; these are just assets that don't reflect in today's economy the value that they truly have. And this is a program that, through a number of ways, would begin to stabilize and establish that value again. Whether it was going in and purchasing some of these mortgages, whether it was insuring these mortgages and other assets that are out there, you begin to make money available again for families in America; you begin to make money available again for businesses that want to expand; you begin to make money available again for student loans; you begin to make money available again for the person who wants to pave the parking area at the service station. 
   This is not about Wall Street; it's about Main Street. And this is not about the government going in and buying things that don't have value, it's about the government helping establish what that value is. If that's done right, and we believe that all of the transparency that you could possibly hope to have in a government program is here, all of the oversight is here--in fact, if anything, we may have overdone the oversight, but none of us want to have underdone the oversight--and that's all here. 
   And this program would ensure, if administered as I think it now has to be under the protections in it, that taxpayers don't lose money. And if, at the end of the process 5 years from now, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget would say to the President there is still some taxpayer loss here, the President then has to  come back to the Congress and say to the Congress, here's how we, over the next number of years, recover the remaining money from the people who participated in the program, not the entire financial sector, not every person in America, but the people who benefited from, who participated in the program. 
   Taxpayers, unless a future Congress loses its ability to do what the law says they need to do, taxpayers won't lose anything. And, frankly, I think if this is administered the way it almost has to be now, that 5 years from now it will be apparent that taxpayers won't have lost, they will have gained. And while they were gaining, America gets started on the right direction. 
   If you're watching the stock market over the next few days and we don't act, whether you have portfolios that you know about or not, if you have a pension plan, if you have a son or daughter who wants to go to college, if you have a home improvement you would like to make, you're going to be affected if the economy doesn't begin to reflect the true strength that this economy has. 
   This bill helps us re-establish the floor for that strength. This bill helps us ensure that taxpayers don't pay any cost. This bill ensures that everybody can watch all the time to see what's going on. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for it. I thank my colleagues who have worked hard to get it to this point. I encourage my colleagues, too, that this is no time to try to seek partisan advantage; this is the time to try to seek a bipartisan solution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I'm confident that my 3 minutes will go quicker than my good friend's 1 minute just did. 
   I don't hardly know how to respond to what I just heard on the floor from my good friend from Maryland. Whenever we had budget chairmen in those years when we balanced the budget, apparently there is no credit given for that. Mr. Kasich did draft a budget that balanced; certainly Mr. Nussle did; certainly there was a precedent. 
   And I agree with my friend when he said 9/11 did have an impact. 9/11 did have an impact. The defense cost after 9/11 had an impact. The cost after 9/11 of homeland security had an impact. The flat economy coming out of 2000 had an impact and our tax policies had an impact. In fact, in 2005, the largest increase in revenue in the history of the Federal Government, 14.5 percent in 2005, because our tax policies worked and produced more than a shallow recovery. 
   Permanent tax cuts? We would like to see permanent tax cuts, but, as my good friend and others know, unless you have 60 people on the other side of the building in the 100-Member Senate, you can't have permanent tax cuts. 
   We have extended these tax cuts in a way that has extended our economy, extended our growth, increased our global competition in the marketplace. Mr. Ryan's alternative continues to do those things. The overall budget that we are talking about today as the underlying budget doesn't do that. 
   Our friends on the other side, in fact, my very good friend from Maryland just said that they aren't increasing taxes, they are just letting current tax policies expire. When you make the same income and your taxes go up, that explanation rings pretty hollow. Your taxes increase as this budget anticipates they would. 
   And then they say that many of these tax increases don't occur until the third year of this budget, so you're not going to see an immediate tax increase. But of course you're going to see an immediate increase in the spending of the money that those new tax revenues provide. Those tax increases do happen to start for some American families as early as the 1st of January, next year. 
   Take, for example, the line in the Tax Code allowing many of our Nation's veterans and warfighters to collect the earned income tax credit. This budget anticipates that when that expires on December 31, 2007, it does not come back as part of the Tax Code, and the money that is produced by that tax increase is part of what this budget spends. 
   The majority's budget renews the death tax. The majority's budget renews the marriage penalty that we have eliminated, and 48 million couples in 2011 would pay $2,900 more every year in Washington taxes than they did the year before. 
   For that and many other reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge that we stick with the policies that have grown our economy, that let us compete, that appreciate families and support this alternative.

But there was a long markup in committee, lots of amendments, and I am thinking on that bill we're hopeful that we can have the same kind of opportunity for a wide-ranging discussion on the floor that the committee had; and on both that and the Head Start bill, we are hoping for a rule that allows that.

   Mr. BLUNT. This bill has been, of course, very widely debated, pretty divisive in our points of view on it. A couple of our Members voted with you. A number of your Members voted with us against the bill. But I am certainly in agreement with the gentleman's view that we should pursue whatever next steps are there as soon as possible. 
   I'd also like to say to the gentleman that I, and I know others on our side, a significant number of others on our side, are eager to work with the majority and the White House both, and get this issue resolved so that our troops are appropriately funded. We can move on to the other appropriations work. And some of these issues, I am sure, are going to be available to the other appropriations bills as topics of discussion that don't necessarily need to be resolved immediately. 
   On the topic of rules, on the bill that was considered on Tuesday, the science bill, we had an open rule on that. But the deadline to file an amendment, a potential amendment, was last Friday. Obviously, Friday was a travel day. 
   Normally the deadline would have been sometime the day before the bill was taken up, and I am hopeful that we are not seeing that as a pattern; that we'll still give maximum time for Members to look at legislation, to be able to file a bill. And obviously, if you've got a rule that requires looking at the amendments, you have to have the amendments in before the Rules Committee can meet. But a Friday deadline, when no one was here anyway, on a bill to be handled on Tuesday, seemed to me to be outside of the norm.     
   And I hope that the gentleman's response is that it is outside the norm and not a new view of a very limited, needlessly limited, time to file amendments. And I would be glad to hear your response to that.

   And, again, my concern would be that we give Members maximum opportunity to file a bill and not set a deadline on a travel day for a bill that is not going to be on the floor for several days anyway. And I think we have had a discussion that I am comfortable with, and I hope our staff continues to talk about that process meeting everybody's needs, the Rules Committee, the Members that want to file amendments, and understanding that a deadline on a day when Members are trying to get back to their district is really almost a day that the Members themselves may not be able to be engaged in that process. If it is necessary, it is necessary. But when it is not, I would hope we can avoid it. And I believe the gentleman suggested we will continue to view that in that way.

I wonder if the leader has a sense of a couple of items, your sense of what you are hoping as major things to get done during that month, generally; and, specifically, if there is any information about a GSE bill. The committee voted a GSE bill out on March 28. That was a full month ago. I am wondering if there is a sense of when that might be on the floor. And anything else the gentleman has about an appropriation schedule that might involve the next 4 weeks would be helpful. And that would be my final question unless your answer prompts a question. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that. 
   I have a couple of questions on things that we haven't discussed. First of all, the supplemental budget, I know General Petraeus is in Washington next week, and I believe Ambassador Crocker. The President sent up a supplemental request in February of last year. By approximately June of this year we're told that the Army will run out of money, and that by July, their ability to use transfer authority will be exhausted. I wonder at what point, in conjunction with or following the Petraeus visits next week, does the leader think we will be talking about that supplemental request. 
   And I yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that. I think that date is important, and we need to be sure and be aware of it as we move through this process, as you are. 
   The spending bill, I know as this administration comes to an end, I'm confident that the White House has had lots of requests from the administration side for additional spending, which I believe they have held the line on. Does the gentleman have a sense of whether this bill will be able to be contained to the defense supplemental, or will it possibly get bigger than that? 
   And I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I do appreciate that. And I just say for my friend's information that we've certainly discouraged the White House, we're hoping, not only discouraged them from moving forward with any new additions, and I think they have decided not to do that and will be concerned about this going as quickly as possible and meeting these defense needs rather than being tied down. 
   Another topic is housing. On the other side of the building they've been talking about housing this week. I know that Chairman Frank has some proposals on housing. I really have two questions there: One, when do you anticipate some housing legislation on the floor? And two would be, do you expect that that housing legislation will follow the PAYGO rules of this Congress, or will those rules be suspended for that housing discussion? 
   And I would yield.

I think in '05, '06 and '07 we may have set records of increased revenues, percentage over last year. So, you used the term revenue, and I think you meant taxes, because we did see some revenue increases during that time, and they were significant. I think over 14 percent in FY05, and double digits in the next 2 years. 
   I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, while we don't want to enter into this debate too fully, on the projections, even though  we still had deficits in those years, which I regret for a number of reasons, those deficits were always less at the end of the year than we had thought they were going to be at the beginning of the year because revenues exceeded projections. That's why the deficit was less. 
   The third topic, I think my last topic today, is, we're at a point in the congressional calendar where it's at least possible that, under the TPA, the Trade Promotion Authority rules, the President will send the Colombia Trade Agreement up because of the number of days left that under TPA would require a vote during the calendar we've put in place. And I wonder if the gentleman has a sense of whether the Colombia Trade Agreement process will go through the normal Trade Promotion Authority process, or if that process could possibly be shut off.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (TRAVEL PROMOTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3232, the Travel Promotion Act of 2008. As I've stated this month during committee consideration of this bill, I believe this is a good bill that will allow our public and private sectors to cooperate on a strategy to encourage foreign visitors to come to the United States. 
   I also want to extend, once again, my thanks to my friend and colleague, Bill Delahunt, whose primary sponsorship and work on behalf of this legislation has gotten us to where we are today. And to all the other cosponsors and supporters of this bill, let me also offer my appreciation. 
   This legislation is a response to the opportunity costs borne by the travel and tourism industries following reforms that Congress implemented in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Security was tightened at our ports of entry and we have made progress in better coordinating our national security apparatus to be aware of who is coming in and out of the country. Those reforms, though not always perfect, were important and we should be grateful that our country has been made safer as a result of them. 
   But the cost of those reforms has impacted some segments of our economy that were already directly impacted by the 9/11 attacks. Foreign visitors who, for a period of time, were unwilling to get on airplanes due to uncertainty about their safety after 9/11 are now unwilling to get on the same airplanes due to the bureaucratic obstacles to getting into the United States. Multiple agencies have heeded our call for greater security and barriers to entry, but the resulting layers of bureaucratic tape mean that legitimate visitors are often treated in a way none of us should be proud of, simply because they don't possess a United States passport. Millions of foreign travelers who want to visit our country for all the right reasons have received this message loud and clear: KEEP OUT. It isn't worth it to come here. The United States does not welcome you. 
   I've seen some estimates that show the results. Between 2004 and 2005, the United States experienced a decline of 10 percent in business travel. At the same time, Europe experienced an 8-percent increase. In 2005, we lost an estimated $43 billion in visitor spending alone. 
   Increasing unwillingness by foreign visitors to come to the United States since 9/11 translates into a loss of $94 billion in visitor spending; a loss of $16 billion in tax revenue to Federal, state and local governments; and the loss of 200,000 American jobs. 
   Travel and tourism affects every congressional district in America. In my home district in Missouri, tourism in the city of Branson alone produced approximately $1.8 billion for the local economy. Every one of my colleagues have places in their districts that foreign travelers benefit from visiting. We need to encourage that. Getting people to visit our country brings incredible benefits for things that are important to our country. Three specific things come to mind: 
   First, tourists spend and that helps local and regional economies. We all know our nation faces economic challenges today. Support for local businesses and the goods and services they offer is good for our tax base. Those revenues are benefits that our constituents don't have to pay in taxes themselves. And that's a good thing. 
   Second, tourism helps create jobs. Local businesses in support of tourist economies generate and sustain employment at all levels of the economy. At a time of economic challenge for many American families and their communities, these jobs are critical. 
   Finally, people who visit the United States tend to like Americans more. At a time when polling shows that fewer people understand Americans, it shouldn't surprise us that there  is waning support for our policies throughout the world. We know that when people visit us here in our country, they almost always like Americans more and are likely to consider American foreign policy more favorably than those who don't visit us. Members of Congress know better than anyone in the country that our best ambassadors are our constituents, when given the opportunity. 
   The Travel Promotion Act of 2008 is an effort to encourage all of those things, and reverse the dangerous notion that America is an unwelcoming place, not even worth the trouble of visiting. It creates a partnership that combines the resources and willpower of the private sector and the government to generate renewed interest in visiting America. We also took a hard look at what's already on the books and streamlined parts of the government that are supposed to be doing this work but aren't doing it effectively. 
   One area where I wish we'd spent some more time and effort was on updating the language relating to the Electronic System for Traveler Authorization (ESTA). When we originally crafted this bill, the ESTA had not yet been created, so our language included a reference to this on the condition it was authorized. The ESTA was authorized as part of the 9/11 bill that Congress passed last year. Unfortunately that legislation did not provide a mandate for the administration to collect the very fee that will provide the federal matching funds for the Corporation. I had hoped that as a result of the negotiations that got us here today, we would have found a way to create that mandate. I've been told that the Department of Homeland Security intends to create a fee in order to implement the ESTA in the near future. I would encourage the Department to do that and help get this program established. 
   The bill we have in front of us is an amended version of the bill that Mr. Delahunt and I introduced last year. I appreciate the hard work that Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton have put into these amendments, as well as the work that Mr. Rush and Mr. Stearns put into the amendments that cleared the subcommittee last week. I think most of these changes enhance the bill and make it a better product. 
   I'd also like to thank Chairman Bennie Thompson and Ranking Member Peter King from the Homeland Security Committee, and Chairman John Conyers and Ranking Member Lamar Smith from the Judiciary Committee. Without the hard work of these members and their staffs, we wouldn't have this bill up on the floor today. 
   I'm looking forward to passage of the Travel Promotion Act. I'm looking forward to working with the industry experts who eventually will serve on the board of the Corporation for Travel Promotion and with the Department of Commerce to develop a strategy to ensure our country is an attractive market for international travelers. And, of course, I'm looking forward to welcoming as many of those travelers as possible to Branson, Missouri.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (DEMOCRAT ENERGY BILL -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. We're here today to talk about a bill that nobody had seen, or at least no Republican had seen as late as 9:45 last night. 
   No committee has seen the bill. In fact, I asked has this been to the Energy and Commerce Committee? I thought, as a member of that committee I must have missed the hearing. But, no, it hasn't been to the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   And so I asked has it been to the Resources Committee because it deals with our natural resources. No, it hasn't been to the Resources Committee. 
   I asked has it been to the Ways and Means Committee. There's a $1.2 billion project in this bill that the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee has wanted forever to extend subways in New York, so I thought surely it had been to the Ways and Means Committee. But it hadn't been to the Ways and Means Committee. In fact, it's been to no committee anywhere, and it does nothing. 
   Republicans have worked for years in this House to send good legislation to the Senate, joined by Democrats who agree with us on this issue. We worked all of August to call attention to the fact that we weren't dealing with the number one problem facing the American people, and now we have a bill that we find will not produce any more energy and we know will increase energy prices. 
   The renewable portfolio standards that raise everybody's electricity bill are unreasonable. But that really doesn't matter because nobody expects this bill to become law. The drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf can't really occur. But maybe that doesn't matter either because this bill's not about something that would become law. 
   I'm offended, Members of the House are offended, and we should be by this process. And the American people should be offended that we're not doing the job for them that really matters.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   This bill comes to the floor today, this rule comes to the floor without an opportunity to talk about issues that have been before the House for months now. Our Members--even with a 9:45 notice last night that finally there was a bill that nobody had seen on this side of the aisle before 9:45, 10:45 Rules Committee meeting--brought a stack of amendments a foot high to the committee, none of which we're voting on today, amendments and legislation that have been out there for months for people to look at that do most of the things that the gentleman from Vermont just mentioned. 
   And I agree that we need to be doing everything--we need to be doing more biomass, we need to be doing more wind, we need to be doing more solar, but we need to be doing more of everything. And everything is not in this bill. There is no nuclear, there is no lawsuit permitting reform. There is no real way to do oil shale in this bill.  
   Most importantly, this bill that now purports to allow drilling offshore doesn't do that because you don't open the door to that offshore drilling. We have four States in America today that get 37.5 percent of the revenue taken from that resource near their State. We're telling the other States, the other coastal States, you're not going to get anything, but we want you to vote to open the door to that 100-mile area offshore. 
   We're taking too much permanently out of play. The 25-50 mile range that Republican bill after Republican bill--and in fact Democrats also supported bills that have that 25-mile boundary in there and let the States open that door, this doesn't do that. This doesn't produce any real new energy to solve this problem. And it sets efficiency standards for utilities that can't be met in the time frame necessary. This bill will raise almost every American's utility bill, some by as much as 100 percent in a decade, and it won't produce the energy that it purports to produce. 
   I think it's a shame we're bringing this rule to the floor. I will vote against the rule. I am going to be working hard to find another alternative to this bill.

   On the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, I'm certainly hopeful we can do whatever is necessary to get that bill to the floor. I know that a majority of Members of the House, at least I believe a majority of the Members of the House, based on what I believe to be the case on this side and on the letter sent to the Speaker by Members from your side, a majority would be ready to pass a bill that met the standards of the Senate, in fact, the Senate bill.

I do think the foreign individuals making calls in a foreign country, for that to work the way it needs to work, voluntary compliance is extremely important; and that's why working out this liability issue is, in my view, critical to that foreign-to-foreign, the only area where we say a foreign person in a foreign country, the only area where we don't believe a warrant would be required but that to not  have a warrant you have to have voluntary compliance. And the liability issue, I think, continues to endanger future voluntary compliance, and I hope we can work together in that regard to move forward. 
   I would yield.

We also don't want to put these companies that have voluntarily complied in a situation where the only way to prove that what they did was appropriate is to produce documents that are at this point, we believe, in the national security of the country not producible; but maybe we can work through this. 
   I hope to see this bill on the floor next week. I think we've had 2 weeks that I and others feel that each day the process gets more cumbersome than the day before because of the way this process builds up, and I look forward to working with you on that.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that. I do know that Senator Rockefeller in the other body has said that our intelligence is being downgraded and has made the case that the people that voluntarily complied don't get paid for it. He said, in fact: ``What do they get for this? They get $40 billion worth of suits, grief, trashing, but they do it.'' Then he went on to say: ``They don't have to do it, because they do have shareholders to respond to, to answer to.'' 
   I believe there is a way to address this issue. We need to find it, and I hope we can. 
   Last night, we had the Andean trade bill on the floor. This is a bill that allows access to our markets by Andean countries, including the country that we currently have a negotiated agreement with; and that country has changed dramatically since we put the first Andean bill in place 17 years ago. I'm wondering if the gentleman has any sense of where we might be on that outstanding agreement with Colombia. Certainly with the vote we took today they can continue to have the same kind of access to our markets that they've had for the last 17 years. 
   A trade agreement would give us substantially new access to their markets, and I'd like to hear any sense of when we may get to that bill and have a situation where the President would be encouraged to send a bill up to us so we could get to it. 
   I would yield.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I thank my friend for yielding. And certainly we do have a disagreement here on how to move forward. I tend to agree with the idea that the only way to rectify this and not have future court challenges is to send a bill to President that there's no question about. Let's go through that process and get it done. 
   I would say that the lecture on adult behavior from my very good friend, the majority leader, and he and I both know we are good friends; we're going to be friends when we leave here with this discussion today, is I don't know that that's very helpful. 
   The standards of the House on trying to help people through mistakes did not just begin yesterday. And I, personally, the Republican leaders generally, were challenged over and over again on anything that could potentially be a way to challenge our integrity, our goodwill on the issue that you just brought up of the Deficit Reduction Act. 
   Let me tell you the big difference in that and this. The big difference in that and this is that at least this Republican leader had no idea until we were at the bill signing ceremony that there was a problem because it all happened in the Senate. 
   I'm just saying what I knew, Mr. Hoyer. I had no idea. My guess is that nobody else did either or they wouldn't have scheduled a bill signing ceremony where 100 people were sitting in the East Room waiting for 30 minutes beyond the time it was supposed to start because the White House was deciding how to deal with this particular problem. And they did decide how to deal with it, and they may very well have looked at the case that you looked at, the 1892 case, because the Court eventually looked at that. The Parliamentarian may have given advice at that time on that case. It may have been the same advice you're getting now. 
   But the big difference in then and now was that the President signed the bill. And I don't really know how the House would have started that process again. It wasn't something that back at the House that we had some options to deal with. 
   That's why I'm supportive of the option that would give the President the bill we intended to give him. I'm not supportive of sitting here all day and being told that that's not an adult point of view.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I thank my friend for yielding back. You know, it's possible, for instance, on dividing this bill up, that I could have been for the farm bill, which I was, at great criticism from my colleagues and some editorial writers in the country. I was for the farm bill 6 years ago. I live in a district where the farm bill matters. 
   It's very possible that I'm not all that excited about the soft wood lumber provision in title III. I would just suggest to my friend, I might vote against title III and be doing that because I have real opportunities to do that since we divided this up, which was part of my case yesterday as to why a partial bill sent to the President doesn't mean that the entire House was in favor of the bill in its division rather than its totality. I hate to start down that line where that happens. 
   I would also say that I read from the Clerk of the House today that somehow this is a problem because of a Republican procedure, change in procedure 10 years ago. 10 years ago. And again, instead of the majority saying it's a mistake, which I'm willing to accept, the majority has to say, well, it's really something foisted upon us by the Republicans a decade ago. 
   Amazingly, we dealt with those same procedures for a decade, and on our side of the building, I'm not aware of any problems created by that. Certainly the problem we've talked about was a Senate side of the building problem, and I think we all know that. But, again, you know, looking back 10 years. 
   Now, if you want to change the procedures, apparently Republicans changed them 10 years ago, lived with those for 10 years or more. If you want to change the procedures to have a greater protection of the process, I think that's fine. 
   But to have to reach back 10 years and say this was a mistake created by the Republicans, there's only so long that we can take blame for everything on anything that happens on the House floor. 
   This is a procedural problem. I'm not sure it's the first one. We haven't really sent that many bills to the White House that were either substantive or controversial, in my view, in this Congress. But I'm not opposed to that. 
   But, you know, again, looking back 10 years and saying this is really a problem the Republicans created a decade ago does not move us toward acting like adults on the floor of the House. 
   I hope we can solve this problem. I hope I can be part of that solution. Frankly, I don't think dividing up the bill is part of that solution, and I think it subjects the whole process to court cases. And you might win again on the 1892 case. 
   But the difference in this and the last case, the most recent case, is that the  House has the bill back under its control, as opposed to a bill signed by the President, exactly like the 1892 case was, where the President signed the bill and then the courts say, well, the President signed a bill that the House and Senate purported was the finally passed bill, and so it's the law. 
   Well, the President didn't sign this bill, and so we have a great opportunity to do something to ensure that we don't spend all kinds of time and effort in court proving that a 1892 standard would still be the case in 2008 or 2009. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding. I'm sure we're going to have a vigorous debate today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I come today to express my great appreciation for him, the work he has done in this and past Congresses, the work he has done as part of our whip team, the consistent good judgment I  think he shows as a Member of this body. And I was surprised last night with the letter that appeared on the floor. I was surprised yesterday, frankly, that there could have been information available to the Members of this House from the staff of the Ethics Committee that deals with the proper work of the internal committee that has overseen the ethics of this House for a long time that that information would be out there and not made available to us, and frankly pleased that Mr. Hastings followed the procedure that the rules call for and let that information be available to Members. 
   And then, on the floor of the House last night, I received a letter from the chairman of the committee. And I appreciate her work too. The Ethics Committee is not an easy committee to serve on. Being the chairman is not an easy role to fill in this Congress, and I think Members of the House should be and are grateful to their colleagues who are willing to serve on the Ethics Committee. 
   But when I saw this letter last night, I was particularly taken by a paragraph, the third paragraph from the end which says, ``Representative Hastings' reliance on rule 7(g) which states `Unless otherwise determined by a vote of the committee, only the chairman or ranking minority member of the committee, after consultation with each other, may make public statements regarding matters before the committee of any subcommittee.' '' And then it went on to say after it quotes that rule, that that rule ``does not relieve him of the obligation to comply with the rules of confidentiality.'' 
   First of all, I don't know what purpose that rule would serve if it doesn't allow the ranking member and the chairman to tell the other person, as the rule says, here is something that I have decided is important to the Members of the House to understand or important for others to understand. That is what the rule is for. The rules of confidentiality as I read them, appear to clearly be talking about investigation, not opinions of outside ethics efforts that may or may not impede the work of the Ethics Committee. And that was important for us to have. It went on in the last sentence to say, the last two sentences to say, ``I do however want to make it clear that if he continues to release confidential communication, I will seek to have him sanctioned for violations of the Code of Official Conduct.'' 
   The relationship here may be such that this is not intimidating, but it certainly seems intimidating to me. And I join my good friend in rising to this moment of personal privilege to explain how he was working within the rules, how he is a long-term member of this committee, understood the rules, and how he properly, in my opinion, arrived at the conclusion that if we are voting on the floor on something that is likely to impede the efforts of the internal Ethics Committee as the bipartisan, nonpartisan staff of the committee said it would, that that is something that Members had a right to know, and I rise in support of my friend and the actions he has taken.

   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I would say, of course, we come to the floor today with lots of disappointment on what we are failing to do today. We think we should stay until we get other matters done. But on this issue that relates to the activities of the day, first of all, I was at the memorial service, as many of you were. I was privileged to be there. Frankly, there are very few Members of Congress, in the history of the Congress, that could have, on the very short notice that we would have this sad service today, would have the Foreign Minister of Israel, the Secretary of State, the head of the United Nations, the Speaker of the House present. It was an impressive service, and I hate that we are having this debate around any lack of respect for that service. 
   On the other hand, the only work we had to do today was 1 hour of debate on a rule that would then also replace the debate. One hour of debate. The service was scheduled to last from 10 o'clock until 11:30. It turned out it lasted until 11:50. But it was scheduled to last from 10 o'clock until 11:30. 
   When at 10:45 the majority decides we are going to start the 1 hour of work we have to do today at 11, the majority should expect the other side to complain. If in fact Mr. Diaz-Balart had not had his objection, 50 minutes of that 1-hour debate would have gone before I ever walked out of the memorial service. The vote lasted 50 minutes, or thereabouts. Apparently, Members couldn't even get in to vote for 50 minutes, let alone to get in to participate in the debate. 
   Of course, we should have said, let's not start the debate on the only work we are doing today while we are passing up the work on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. We are voting to talk about how you can kill rats in the technical correction to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. That is the only debate we were going to have during 50 minutes of the  1 hour of the memorial service. And of course LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART or somebody should have stepped up to stop that, and thank goodness he did. 
   I am really sad that a service we should have all agreed on would be the priority of the morning, we couldn't manage for that to be the priority of the morning. We had to start the 1 hour of work we had to do 50 minutes before that service turned out to end and 30 minutes before it was scheduled to end. 
   I am regretful that my good friend had to rise to this moment of personal privilege, but I certainly support him in seeking this privilege and hope that the Members of the House will understand what happened here and appreciate the great respect we all have for Tom Lantos.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I'm here to say that I am fully supportive of the prerogatives of the Congress. I think the Congress has a right to ask for, receive, demand information from the administration; but I don't think that right extends to this case. 
   I think the idea that we would expect to get information that is dealing with advice to the President on the status of at-will employees is a loser for us on the House floor. It's a loser for us in court. It will set back the prerogatives of the Congress; and beyond that, I think the idea that we're here today, as we see the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act get less value to us every day because we're unwilling to deal with a permanent solution, this is the wrong debate to have at any time. It's certainly the wrong debate to have at this time. 
   And the idea that somehow if we extend that act, if we've done all we could do by trying to extend an act, a bipartisan group of Members of this Congress for various reasons said we don't want to extend and then we come back today and we take our time focusing on a contempt charge on two dedicated civil servants is the wrong thing to do at any time, and it's particularly the wrong thing to do at this time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think you will be able to characterize our remarks in one of two ways: One is that we are continuing to encourage domestic exploration; the other is we are trying to do things that reach energy independence. 
   Following up on the bill that moved us toward energy independence that was passed in 2005 would have been a good idea. The efforts to have an energy bill this year are a good idea. But this bill imposes taxes double that already passed in H.R. 6. This would hurt our investment in energy independence and domestic supply. I don't have very many people in my district at all or in our State that are in gas and oil production. Almost everybody in our State that buys anything is in gas and oil purchasing. 
   Things that raise gas prices, things that don't allow us to fully utilize our resources, things that continue to make us more and more dependent on parts of the world that don't like us can't be a good idea. There is nothing wrong with buying things from people who don't like you, but there is something really dumb about having to buy things from people who don't like you. We are still in that mode today. This bill heads us more in that direction. 
   The incentives for many conservation measures are allowed to expire in this bill. I see my good friend with a bicycle on his lapel. I note that there is a tax benefit to pay people to bicycle to work. He would argue, I suppose, that we don't have enough people in southwest Missouri that bicycle to work, because we have almost no people that bicycle to work. We have lots of people that drive 50 and 60 miles to get to good manufacturing jobs, and they are not going to ride a bicycle there. They don't need more expensive gasoline to get there. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to move toward energy independence. This bill, regretfully, moves us toward energy dependence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am pleased to see this legislation on the floor this evening. I think it is critical that we pass this bill today, and many in the majority did too. I know it is not the bill that many of our friends on the other side would have liked to have had passed tonight, but I also know that they understand that there is a huge gap at this moment in the intelligence that we are watching, that we are gaining, that we are analyzing. This bill closes that gap. 
   Earlier today would have been better to pass this bill. Three weeks ago would have been better to pass this bill. But I am grateful that we have a chance before Congress goes into a district work period for a month to get this critically important piece of legislation passed. 
   Three weeks ago, we read the National Intelligence Estimate, if we wanted to take time to look at that estimate, and it was publicly stated during that estimate that our terrorist enemies were regrouping, that their communications had heightened, that their planning appears to be heightening; and we also understood at that time that we were not monitoring the communication that we knew we needed to be monitored because the law hadn't kept up with technology. 
   This takes the 1978 law, it provides the same protection for Americans that they had in 1978 and 1988 and 1998. And now, as we approach 2008, it just simply lets us have the definitions of the law meet the technology of the time. 
   The Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence have to have approval. That is a change, and it is an important change. This is no longer only one person in the executive branch, but two people, both of whom have both responsibilities and penalties if they don't make the right decision under the law. 
   This monitors the communication of people who are initiating their communication in a foreign country. It protects Americans. That is why the FISA court was created. Americans are still protected under the FISA court, as they were under the technology of 1978. 
   I am pleased to see this on the floor. I am glad that the majority has agreed with us, that while many of them don't like this piece of legislation, the gap was too big not to take the bill that could wind up most quickly now on the President's desk and pass it tonight. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this, and I am grateful to my colleagues for seeing that this gap will not continue between now and Labor Day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago at the beginning of the 109th Congress, the minority leader, today the Speaker, said that the rules of the House should never be changed without bipartisan cooperation. I think that did not mean without a bipartisan meeting. It meant without a bipartisan effort to reach a conclusion that both sides believed would improve the ethics process in the House. 
   During this Congress, the Ethics Committee has not worked. I don't think anybody is going to rise to debate the other side of that. This outside commission, if it does become part of the rules tonight, through this rule, it would have no vote, no amendment, no alternative. If it does become part of the rules, almost assures that the Ethics Committee will not work for the remainder of this Congress. This new outside group will become the reason to wait. It will take 45 or 60 days to reach agreements on people who can serve, if that can be done that quickly. It will take them another 60 days to get a staff together. Already we're clearly outside the ethics process working in this Congress. 
   The bill that Mr. Hill just mentioned, the bill that Mr. Smith just mentioned would both be focused on making the process work and work now. They both would be focused on ensuring that this process does what it's supposed to do. 
   This rule not only rushes without any real alternative or debate, but also Members were informed today that last November the bipartisan staff of the Ethics Committee asked to evaluate the concepts behind this bill gave reason after reason after reason why they thought those concepts were flawed, concepts that have not been improved by the changes that were made in the last few days. They gave reason after reason after reason why they thought this commission would make the Ethics Committee less likely to be able to do its job effectively. And we still rushed, Mr. Speaker, to try to force this on the Congress when that information, we now know, has been available since November. We got it today. 
   I think we ought to give the time for the people who work on ethics every day to be able to publicly evaluate this concept.

   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, the House passed the Military Construction-Veterans bill on June 15, over 140 days ago. The Senate passed a bill on September 6, sent it over to the House, and immediately appointed conferees. 
   The minority appointed their conferees. But up to now, we have never had conferees appointed on this bill, which means this bill that the President has announced he would sign could have become law before October 1. It means that military families, veterans, and retirees could be receiving the benefits of up to $18.5 million every single day since October 1. 
   This tactic of holding veterans funding hostage creates a dangerous precedent. What controversial, unrelated policies could go on this bill in the future?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, I am grateful to the gentleman for yielding me the time and the hard work he and Mr. Sensenbrenner have done to bring this bill to this point. 
   Certainly, this bill does a lot to restore the original intention of the Congress as to what the Congress had hoped at the time that the Americans with Disabilities Act would be. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill that's on the floor today. I think it strikes the right balance between protection for individuals with disabilities and the obligations of the requirements of employers themselves. 
   Ultimately, that partnership is the partnership that makes the most of people in the workplace and the skills they bring to the workplace. This ensures that people with disabilities, whom the Congress intended to cover by the original Americans with Disabilities Act long before I came to Congress, are now covered, as I understand it, by these changes, and that's important. It is better when there is a conflict between the courts and the Congress for the Congress to come back and say, ``No, that's not what we meant. This is what we meant, and this is what we hope to happen in the country.'' 
   This prohibits consideration of mitigating circumstances in the determination of whether an individual has a disability. Of course, it continues to allow the normal eyeglasses and contacts and things like that as an exception in those circumstances. 
   Most of all, Madam Speaker, this bill puts people to work. This bill creates opportunity. This bill creates a workplace where the skills people can bring to the workplace are maximized, not minimized, where what they add to the total product of America makes America a more productive country and for them establishes a totally different set of goals, a set of aspirations, a set of ways that they look at the world every day and brings their skills in new ways to the workplace. 
   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this bill. I urge my colleagues to do the same and think that the approach we've taken here of the Congress itself going back and trying to clarify what the Congress meant is certainly better than letting the court determine perpetually what the Congress intended to do.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I am pleased that the body will move forward this evening to approve this resolution that the Republican leaders offered. 
   The majority leader indicated in the last Congress that the Ethics Committee didn't meet for a year. I think  that is because the Members of the minority at that time, now the majority, wouldn't meet for a year. And now we are in the sixth month of this Congress, and only today is there a group of Members made available by the majority to choose a panel from to investigate this case. Now, maybe that was just an accident. Maybe that's just starting a new majority. Maybe that's not remembering that this investigation was stopped at the end of the last Congress and couldn't start in this Congress unless there was a new panel put in place. Those of us in the minority, I suppose, have less to worry about, so we put our panel of Members out immediately at the beginning of Congress, as we have in the past. We put our panel out there immediately. And now, in June, the sixth month of the Congress, the majority makes Members available suddenly to investigate this case as if it just occurred today, or as if we were just aware of it today. That is almost too big a coincidence to overlook. 
   We are going to start looking at this case. I am pleased that our friends on the other side are going to join us in that effort. This case has been known to Members of Congress for some time now. It rises to a level of accusations and an indictment that has seldom been met in the history of the Congress. A 94-page indictment that alleges conspiracies on this and at least one other continent that could result in 230 something years of prison time if the Member is found guilty. 
   Mr. Speaker, even if all of those things did not turn out to produce guilt at the end of this pathway, the standards that have been referred to here on the floor are clearly standards that the Ethics Committee should have been looking at. Those standards that violate the official conduct of the House, you don't have to necessarily have violated a law to violate those standards. You certainly don't have to have violated a law to have brought disrepute on the House, or whatever language is used in the code of conduct we attempt to hold each other to. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would just say that I think it's high time that we did start this investigation. I think it is unfortunate that we had the time this entire Congress where nothing has been done to look at this case. And because of that, I hope that we not only ask the Ethics Committee to look at the case, but do everything we can to encourage them to not decide necessarily the legal matters, they will be decided somewhere else, but to decide whether or not this Member has violated the ethical code of the House; and if that is the case, what should the action of the House be in the future. 
   So not only do I stand as the majority leader just did to join the Republican leader in supporting this resolution, but also in encouraging all of our Members to. 
   Mr. Speaker, if my friend has a quick response, I would be glad to just yield 1 minute to him for that purpose.

At that time you thought that we might be able to waive PAYGO for both the GI portion of the supplemental and the unemployment insurance portion of the supplemental. I wonder where we are on that topic of PAYGO as it relates to those two issues.

Since we don't have any options in that bill, at least the bill we were talking about this week, no options to bring alternatives to the floor, I would hope that we could look at all of the alternatives in that part that benefit our servicemen and women and be sure we're bringing the best alternative the House has available to it to the floor next week.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that. 
   When you look at the anticipated spending and the scoring on those bills, both of them add so many new things to the benefit area that there's very little money spent in the first year. And since it takes that long to really get the new system up and running, I would just suggest again that the closer we are to a system that the military can be supportive of, both individuals in the military and the institutions, I think all of us want to take a step forward on those things that relate to servicemen and women and particularly those servicemen and women that may have been left out of past benefits for those who served. That would relate most directly to the National Guard and the reserves who are called up maybe for multiple periods of time but never for a long enough period of time at one consecutive time of full-time service to qualify for past benefits. We want to do that, but certainly we want to do that in the very best way, particularly when you look at how long it takes to retool the way that these benefits are made available for that to happen. Since it appears at this point that we'd have no alternative to bring, in this case, a better House alternative to the floor, I hope we are putting the right set of building blocks together to really build a better future for those who serve and are willing to put their lives at risk and their other activities on hold for us.

That would be one of the things that we could do in the next 2 weeks that should have immediate impact at the pump by Memorial Day if we did it before that Memorial Day break. But if we could do something to reduce gas prices, that would be a major thing.

That was about a year after the Colombia Free Trade Agreement had been negotiated. We have not passed that agreement yet and don't have any schedule on the floor.

   Mr. Chairman, the Vice President is a talented man. He is a former Member of this body, a former whip of this body. I would like to think that any former whip of the body or current whip could confuse people as much as the Vice President appears to be able to do. 
   Certainly my good friend from Illinois is a smart man. He knows what branch of government the Vice President is a part of. There are only three, after all. We know he is not part of the judiciary. We know he is not part of the legislative. So he must be part of the branch that is funded in the bill. 
   This amendment may be lots of things, but it is not a serious amendment about really defunding the Vice President's office. It is an amendment about something other than that, and we know it. It has nothing really to do with moving this issue forward. There will be some discussion as the day goes on today about whether or not an amendment on our side was really an important part of the debate on the bill. 
   This amendment is an amendment in search of a press release. In fact, let me take that back. This amendment is an amendment that is following a press release. We have already had the press release. We have already had the comments to the press about how we take advantage of a moment about who has access to what records. We all know that defunding the Vice President's office is not the way to do that.     
   I was glad to hear my friend from Illinois say in his concluding remarks, or what I believe would have been his concluding remarks, I may find that was not right, is we understand the Vice President of the United States is our Vice President, we understand that his office is funded under this bill, and we  understand that is the work that needs to be done by the Congress. We know what branch of government he belongs to. No matter how confusing that may seem, there are only three. We know which one he is part of.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I'm on the side that this debate does matter. And, in fact, I think I just heard debate begin, as our good friend just suggested that this doctrine does need to be looked at and does need to be changed. 
   I certainly think that this debate is more meaningful than whether the Vice President is part of the executive branch of government or not, and I'm grateful to Mr. Pence and Mr. Hensarling and Mr. Flake for bringing this issue to the floor today. 
   I'm also grateful, and appreciate the majority's willingness to accept this. And while this may not be an item that was on the House agenda last week, I think it's clearly an item on the agenda of debate in the country. 
   The fairness doctrine, or the so-called fairness doctrine is a clear and bald-faced attack on free speech. It's been declared such by the Supreme Court and the FCC, and just about every reasonable American who ever heard about it. 
   Proponents of the doctrine don't like what they hear on the radio, but instead of empowering the process by engaging the points with regular Americans, they prefer to empower a government agency to silence those voices. 
   This is a diverse country with rich and robust views on politics, on culture, on society, on the role of government. The right to vocalize disagreements on all those topics in whatever medium or whatever way is available, is fundamentally what differentiates us from the countries, the totalitarian views of regimes that our country has stood against for now 230 years. 
   But the fairness doctrine would limit those rights and submit private broadcasters to arbitrary rules of so-called fairness, rules, I suppose, that would change from year to year, depending on who controlled the Congress or who controlled the White House. 
   The content of radio and television shows should be directed by station managers, not by government bureaucrats. The success or failure of that programming should be determined by the marketplace of options and the marketplace of ideas, not by some arbitrary rule of a government agency. 
   Again, I want to thank Mr. Pence, Mr. Flake and Mr. Hensarling for offering this important amendment. I urge its support, both in the House today and in the debates that I believe are starting now. 
   It may have been in an elevator yesterday and a hearing room tomorrow and the FCC in the future, if we don't engage in this important debate again. 
   I'm grateful to the majority for accepting this amendment, but I urge all Members of the House to speak out loudly against this so-called doctrine as this debate continues.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hoekstra for the leadership he has given on this issue. 
   The problem we have with the bill on the floor today is, in everything I read, it can't become law. That is one problem. A bigger problem is that it doesn't address the fundamental question of how we treat these companies for doing what we asked them to do after 9/11. 
   It is clear from all of the facts that as the FISA law anticipated, that the leaders of the House and the leaders of the Senate on the Intelligence Committee would be informed of what was going on. And, in fact, in October of 2001 and November of 2001, in March of 2002, those leaders were informed. On our side, the ranking Democrat at the time is the current Speaker of the House. Porter Goss, the future CIA director, was the chairman of the committee. They were informed on all of those occasions, and these companies only have liability protection if they were pursuing what was given to them as a lawful government order; orders that Members of Congress, including the now Speaker, were told would be issued to these companies. 
   This program doesn't work without voluntary compliance on the foreign side. It also doesn't work without subpoenas on the American side, the U.S. side. Every U.S. effort has to include a subpoena. The 1978 law anticipated that. The law we would like to have on the books today continues that. But for foreign subpoenas, to have to get a court order for a foreign request of somebody in a foreign country simply bogs this program down to the point it won't work. We proved that in July of last year when this FISA came to a screeching halt. 
   This bill is not the improvement that we need. There is a bipartisan majority in the House ready to pass a bill that could go to the President today, be signed today. 
   We are now 4 weeks away from the time when we said, if we just had a 21-day extension, we would solve this problem. This problem needs to be solved. It needs to be solved now. I urge the majority to step back and bring a bill to the House that can pass and become law.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I'm thankful to the former chairman and the ranking member for yielding to me on this bill. 
   It seems to me that what we have here is a bill that has not benefited from the process of hearings. Most of our friends in the majority today, I assume, will vote for this bill. Most of our friends on our side are going to vote against this bill, and I believe that during the month of August the voters will have the hearings that we should have had in advance. I believe what we'll find out is this bill has needless problems in it in the name of expanding SCHIP. 
   My good friend, Ms. DeGette, mentioned the moon mission. It does seem to me that, in this bill now, the moon is the limit. The original bill said 200 percent of poverty, with some flexibility to the States. We're in favor of extending these guidelines. 
   The original proposal, as we understood it from the majority, was 400 percent of poverty. Families who made 80, $85,000 would get free health insurance for their children. I don't think that limit is there any more. I believe it's up to the States under this bill. If you made 1,000 times the poverty rate and your State wanted to insure you, they could do that and your initial payment from the Federal Government would be 95 cents on every dollar. 
   We're going to offer a recommital today that extends the current SCHIP program; that gives us the time to talk about it and ways that make it better; that reinstates the current law on immigrants, where, if you come to this country, you have to have a sponsor, and you can't participate in programs like this for the first 5 years. That's been one of the workable parts of our immigration policy. 
   We would propose we don't have self-verification, where people who are here illegally just can walk up and sign up and say I'm legally here. 
   We'll have a doctor fix. We'll do something about the therapy caps. And, in my district, 21,033 people who would lose their choice of Medicare don't lose their choice of Medicare. Restricting Medicare benefits to pay for children's health care is not the right thing.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 21, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we will be talking about this budget for a long time. Everybody has their own view of this, but you can't have your own view of the facts. One of my good friends got up a minute ago and talked about the size of the deficit. 
   This budget is going to add $850 billion this year to the deficit. I think that's almost $1 trillion, though I am sure people who are listening to this here in the Chamber and anywhere else are confused now by all these numbers they are hearing. This budget, without a single other vote, adds to the national debt. 
   It raises the debt ceiling. In spite of the many Members in this Chamber who ran for office saying they would never try to hide this vote on the debt, that's exactly what this vote does today. 
   Entitlement reform, one of my other friends said, we hadn't passed a budget. Well, my friend, you can't have entitlement reform unless you pass a budget. You can't have reconciliation. 
   We cut the growth of the entitlement spending $40 billion in the last Congress. By definition, to do that, we had to have a budget. So somebody who suggested we hadn't had a budget also was the person who had some explanation as to why this budget doesn't do entitlement reform. 
   In fact, then we even make entitlement reform somehow the interest on the national debt. The programs that are growing out of control are the programs that this budget refuses to address. 
   Then the very interesting topic of tax cuts, tax policies in 2001 and 2003 that have produced record levels of income to the Federal Government; 2005, 14.5 percent more income than 2004; 2006, 11.8 percent, more income than 2005. These tax cuts grew the economy. That grew Federal income. If you raise the wrong taxes, you will reduce Federal income. 
   This whole budget debate, our friends in the majority have said, there is no tax increase in this budget. But suddenly, in the budget report, we are told that, well, we have accepted the Senate levels of tax increases, so we are only raising tax revenue by $217 billion for sure instead of $400 billion. 
   This is a huge tax increase. It doesn't deal with entitlements. It raises, without a vote, the national debt ceiling. I urge a ``no'' vote on this budget. Let's get a blueprint that really works for the future.

   One other thing that I would like to bring up, and I know how difficult it is to schedule the floor. Believe me, I know the concerns and criticisms that come from that. 
   When we were visiting a week ago, I expressed a specific request that as soon as we had an idea when the votes were going to be on Tuesday, we would have more general knowledge of that. At that time, my good friend thought we would vote early afternoon on Tuesday. As it turned out, we didn't actually start the session until noon on Tuesday.

It is still early in this Congress. I am really not saying that in a way that is critical at all, but at the time, we did ask for whatever knowledge the majority had as soon as possible so we wouldn't run into exactly the situation we did, people getting here thinking there could be votes at 12, only to find out we didn't start any of the work of the House until 12. Whatever it takes to work more closely on that, I am more than happy to try to do so we can get information out. But we can't get it out unless we have it. 
   I was disappointed we didn't get a little more notice on the time we were going to start work on Tuesday, which would have made it clear we would not be having votes at the time we started.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We all know that in a few minutes the President's veto will be sustained. We didn't all figure that out this morning. We didn't all figure that out last week. We didn't even all figure that out last month. We've known that since the very start of this debate, 90 days of debate at a time when there are real consequences for our troops. 
   There are consequences, we are told this week, in the preparation for troops going to Iraq and action. There are consequences of maintenance on bases in this country. There are consequences in the way we are dealing with our equipment and our repairs, and we have taken 90 days to get to this point so we can start all over again. 
   I hope when we start all over again this afternoon that we will start all over again with a commitment to get this job done as soon as possible, rather than to take as long as possible. It does matter. The message we send to the world matters. The message we send to our troops matters. This bill needs to be as clean as possible. It needs to be straightforward. 
   There are things in this bill that in another bill I could support. There are things in this bill I couldn't support in any bill, but there are things here that should be done that have nothing to do with this bill. I don't know why they were put on. Maybe they were put on to try to see if the majority could get the last votes necessary to pass a bill that has restrictions on the military that this Congress should never have advanced to the President's desk. 
   The President has vetoed. We will uphold that veto. Let's work together now to get the job done to support the  troops in Afghanistan, in Iraq and everywhere else around the world who are feeling the consequences of this 90 days we have already taken. 
   I will work with you. I hope you will work with us. We need to get this job started.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information. 
   I don't want to belabor the point. I certainly do want to join him in sharing this sense of how hard our Members do work and where they work. We talked about this at great length a couple of weeks ago. And I think the early discussion of being on the floor of the House 5 days every single week was widely enjoyed by the late-night comedians and others. And I said at that time, and I still believe, our problem is not that the Members of Congress don't work 5 days a week. 
   Frankly, our problem is that too many Members of Congress work 7 days a week. And on those times when we don't have work in Washington and can be in the district, people want to meet with Members in their office. It does give Members a chance to, during the normal workweek, relate to people, activities, and ongoing events that they otherwise can't relate to. I think almost all of our Members are more than willing to take time on a Saturday to meet with people who normally work Monday through Friday. Frankly, most of the people that you would want to meet with see that as a much greater imposition than the Members of Congress who really do work more than 5 days a week at home and in Washington. The work of the Congress is important work, and it doesn't all occur here on the floor of the House while we are voting, nor does it all occur in Washington. 
   I would like to yield to my friend, the ranking member on the Rules Committee. He has an observation, I think.

   Mr. BLUNT. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I think the point my good friend from California is making, and I would like to emphasize, is we hope we are now moving to rules that are open when possible, that allow amendments when an open rule is not possible. I think the point he was making was that hopefully this just isn't to go on the record and say, as my good friend just did, well, once we allowed you an amendment that the Member decided he didn't want and then you complained about that. We don't want this to be cited as, well, don't you remember the time we gave you the open rule on a bill that passed unanimously without amendment in the last Congress? It is time to move on. 
   My good friend from Maryland knows my high regard for him, and I am going to do my very best, at these weekly opportunities to talk about the schedule, to not just complain about the process. But I do know that my friend, who has been here longer than I have and understands and appreciates the process in the House, knows that it is to everybody's advantage if we get to the place where we are debating these bills, where the ideas that are brought to the floor can stand the challenge of debate and amendment, and we need to get  there. As I said last week, I am prepared to look forward, as disappointed as I was about the way the previous few weeks have been handled, but there are only so many weeks that you can just be satisfied to think that, well, I am hopeful that next week will be better, and I guess here we would be hopeful that the open rule would not just be the example of the open rule we got on this kind of bill, but the beginning of real debate and real opportunity to amend in this Congress. 
   I would like to yield again to my friend.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his response. 
   I would say that while we don't want to debate the bill again that we voted on today, all of the Republicans voted for the motion that would have improved the bill. Certainly the option of the February 15 deadline has impact. I don't even want to argue the point that some of our Members then voted for final passage, but all of our Members would have liked to have had a more wide-ranging debate on the points that were raised in the motion to recommit that all of our Members voted for. 
   We also noted in the bill we just passed that rather than allocating funds to Members' committees and other offices of the House, this bill, essentially a bill that contained the funding for half of the discretionary spending, provided a lump sum in excess of $1 billion. I think the exact quote that I will refer to for the leader was ``to be allocated in accordance with the allocation plans submitted by the chief administrative officer and approved by the Committee on Appropriations.'' 
   A pretty wide-ranging ability to now set specific allocations and for the Appropriations Committee to approve those. 
   I am wondering specifically, does the majority intend to use these funds to create a new committee that is not currently in existence or currently authorized? 
   I will yield to my friend for a response.

   Mr. BLUNT. I would also like to say, Mr. Speaker, as it might make that answer easier for the future, I did not mean in any way to set a standard for future weeks. But I was thinking in terms of this week, looking at 2 days of suspensions, 1 day of a bill that we have had on suspension before, even though it would have a rule, that I would think it would not be an unreasonable goal for us to set to get our, particularly our west coast Members, on the way home on late Thursday afternoon, rather than having to wait until Friday morning. 
   But I would also assume, having done both of the jobs you have held in the last few months, that there will be times when we will not necessarily need to be here on Friday, but to meet that goal we may have to work late enough on Thursday that many Members would not be on Thursday flights. I clearly understand that.

I think that the determination for next week, which I believe would have been the first 5-day week we have had scheduled to work all 5 days, I think the determination of next week shows the leader's willingness to look at the facts of the week, rather than to be pinned down to a standard that doesn't necessarily let the Members do all of the work they need to do in the various places they need to do it. I am glad to see that change.

He was here to do what he thought was the right thing to do. It wasn't always what I thought was the right thing, but it was what he thought was the right thing and he was  going to do it. The toughness, the courage, the determination of CHARLIE NORWOOD was extraordinary among an extraordinary group of people. Just this struggle that we have witnessed with CHARLIE's health, a struggle that he faced uncomplainingly as he sat day after day over in that corner recovering from massive surgery, but, as Chairman BARTON showed in the letter he got in recent days, never giving up on the job he was doing for the people he served. 
   The people that sent him here should be proud, the people who worked with him should be proud.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, like others, I am disappointed we are not going forward today to sustain the President's veto, an outcome that I think no matter how much time anybody has in the time-out chair will be the result. If we were moving forward today and sustaining the veto, then we could get together and try to have a bill that does what I think all of us want to do. 
   Madam Speaker, all of us don't want to do everything, but all of us do want to do some things. We all want a program that meets the needs of poor kids first. That is why when we put this in place in 1997, we said, look, kids, whose families are at the poverty level or below, they have access to Medicaid. But what about people who are kids whose parents are working, and working in jobs where they don't likely have access to insurance? Let's prioritize those kids. 
   Madam Speaker, as a minimum, whatever we do as we move forward, let's have a standard that the States  have to meet, the administration proposed 95 percent, Mr. Barton proposed 90 percent, but some percentage of kids whose families are in those jobs that may not have access to insurance. Before we go on and just simply talk about insuring kids, this should be a program that is focused on poor kids, not a program that is on more kids. 
   Madam Speaker, some of our friends say, well, if a program that would give health care to poor kids is a good thing, a program that would give health care to all kids or more kids must be a great thing. It is just simply not accurate. Things that destroy the private insurance market, things that don't meet the needs of the program before you move on to do more are not the kinds of things we ought to be focused on. 
   We need to be sure that we are covering people who are uninsured, not people who are insured, and then moving from insurance to government-paid health care, Washington-based health care. There are going to be situations, I guarantee, if we start insuring all the kids in America, or all the kids that this bill says that we are going to insure, where moms are going to wind up in houses that have both a mom and dad as the only person not insured. 
   Madam Speaker, think with me for just a minute. Dad has a job; insurance comes with dad's job. The government comes in and says we are going to insure the kids. Who gets left out then? It's mom. Our mom has a job, and while she is struggling with the job, she has to figure out how to insure herself and the kids, because insurance didn't come with the job. Then the government decides to insure the kids, and mom says, well, maybe I don't need insurance anymore. 
   Some of our friends will say, well, that is why we are insuring adults. This should not be a program about insuring adults. One of the reasons this program hasn't worked as well as it should have is too many States move to insuring adults before they would insure poor kids. 
   Madam Speaker, let's get on with this debate. I regret the fact that we are not able to start tomorrow because we went ahead and did today what is going to happen in two weeks. But let's get on with this debate. Let's be sure we provide a stable funding source for a program for poor kids and we put poor kids first in a program that is supposed to be about helping kids whose families are working, but working in jobs that aren't likely to have insurance.

The GI benefits that have been talked about both here and on the other side of the building, I think last week you suggested that those were related to the Iraq-Afghanistan expenditures in a way that you thought that the majority might waive PAYGO and include those in the supplemental. 
   I'm wondering if any of those other items that you discussed, like unemployment insurance, might also meet that criteria where if they were in the supplemental, they wouldn't have to comply with the PAYGO provisions of the current rules of the House. 
   I would yield.

I don't know if there is a way to handle those issues under that same umbrella of economic impact or not, but I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I hear that answer and I respect it, but I also believe that when we've let these tax policies expire, they have some of the same economic consequences. I suppose that can be debated when we get to that point in the debate. But sort of selective waiving of PAYGO, I hope we have developed some principles here that can maybe apply to some other things as well. I think we've discussed that and I appreciate the fact that we've had a difference on this for some time. 
   I mentioned a couple of States that are particularly impacted by the credit situation that we face right now on the sales tax deductibility. That's just another burden on taxpayers that may be dealing with another problem that's part of the overall economic challenge we face right now. And just like the stimulus package waived PAYGO to try to help solve this problem, I'd suggest that there may be items beyond unemployment insurance that equally are related and may be even more contributory to the problem than unemployment insurance. 
   I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate that. And I do recall those discussions. 
   Also, the tax policies that encourage purchases that create jobs are in place. And as all of us on the floor here know, the initial checks that go out as part of the stimulus package are going out in the next few days over the next couple of months. And that, hopefully, will be helpful. 
   On the supplemental, anything that we can do, that I can do, that our side can do to encourage going through the committee in the regular process, we would like to do that. In the last 20 years, under both Democrats and Republicans, there have been 36 supplementals. All but seven of them went through the committee. And those seven did not go through the committee based on a bipartisan decision that Katrina or 9/11 or some other event had occurred where Members on both sides of the aisle essentially said we know what needs to be done here, we're in agreement with it, let's take a bill to the floor. In the other 29 instances where there was not bipartisan agreement, every supplemental went through the committee. 
   In the 12 years that we were in the majority, there were 20 supplementals. None of them had a closed rule, all of them except the ones I mentioned by bipartisan agreement went through the committee, and 10 of them had an absolutely open rule where we brought the supplemental to the floor and the rule essentially said bring on every amendment that you want to and we'll debate it until the amendments are exhausted. That's a time-honored process not just under the Democrat majority, but under the Republican majority. I'd like to again encourage that we do whatever we can do to further that discussion that you suggested may be going on now that would have the committee option as one of the options.

   I do know the gentleman mentioned this week that in the 11 days left before this next work period at home, we  might have a flurry of activity. And I would suggest, you've seen lots of interest on our side, that hopefully part of that flurry of activity could be an energy bill. I think now we're in the 18th or 19th straight day of highest gasoline prices ever. Tomorrow may be the 19th or 20th straight day of that. That would be one of the things that we would certainly like to see Members of the House address before we leave here for the Memorial Day break. 
   I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. On Thursday, the 18th. I really have two questions about that. One is, what time during the day do we expect that to happen? After the 18th, we will have 5 more weeks before the extension expires, and I'm wondering if we can anticipate any effort to include the minority, if in fact the President's veto is sustained. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that information and for his attitude about this. 
   We were concerned this week, many of our Members were concerned, including the Members who had voted with the majority, when the leader on the other side of the building suggested that if this bill wasn't approved there would be no bill. We're not for that. We're for including the children that are covered now. I think that does mean that you have to go beyond the President's proposal, though in fairness to the President's proposal, his proposal would not have taken people off this program without intervening Congresses and intervening budgets, in my view. 
   But that's not the purpose of the debate here. The purpose of the debate is to try to have a program that works for children. I'm hopeful that we can arrive at a bill that I vote for, that the President signs, that keeps this program going. 
   I'm very pleased that the gentleman doesn't take the, if it doesn't work out to override the veto, as I believe it won't, that we still need to work together for a program that works well for children. And I appreciate the gentleman's comments on that. 
   And if we do sustain the veto, I pledge that I'll work hard with you to try to make this program work in the way that the majority of House Members, the majority of House Republicans, feel that it should to continue the current program.

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate that. I appreciate my friend's comments. And as many Members, most Members of the House know, we are good friends. 
   On the bill that the House voted on, as you know, I don't think House Republicans had the opportunity to have input there. I believe Senate Republicans may have. House Republicans did not. And I would like to see us work together to be sure that the priorities and the program are all exactly what the American people think we're talking about and what we hope to be talking about. 
   As we near that November 16 day, my other concern would be the fact that we apparently are not meeting yet on any appropriations bills. I believe on the four bills that have been sent over from the Senate, that our side is ready to join the Senate, who has already named conferees, and name conferees at any moment, and hope to see that happen. 
   I wonder, do we have any sense of any effort to get some of these appropriations bills before the House and on the President's desk in the month of October? Or even before November 16? And if we have a plan there, can you give me an idea of what that might be? 
   We've had four bills now. Some of them we've had for over a month. One, the Homeland Security bill, it is obviously important we continue those efforts; the Military Quality of Life bill.     
   We have had conferees named by the Senate for over a month now. We're ready to name our conferees, I believe, and I wonder if there is any way we can go ahead and at least start a conference to have a chance to get some of these bills signed into law. 
   And I yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for those observations. 
   Of course, Mr. Speaker, I have been in the job he is doing now and in the whip's job on the majority side, and I do know that waiting for the Senate to pass their bills and taking blame, as we did and as others will in the future, for not getting our work done is a frustrating thing. But if we can move some of these along, I believe it's better. 
   I also, in response to the gentleman's comments about having the President sign the bills, hope that we are dealing with the reality that the President actually does have to sign those bills, and if he is not willing to sign the bill, we can go through the efforts of a veto and sustaining or overriding and all those sorts of things, but before we can get next year's business started, we actually have to have the President sign a bill. And I hope we are developing a strategy to do that. 
   On FTA, the Peru FTA has been through the markup phase in the Ways and Means Committee, and I'm wondering when the gentleman expects that, the first of four pending trade agreements, to come to the House floor. 
   And I yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I understand that. And, of course, I also understand that up until now, we have always done these trade bills in sequence based on the time they were negotiated, at least under the TPA regimen we have when the House has been involved in trade bills. And Colombia, Panama, South Korea are all out there. I hope we can figure out a way to have the kind of debate those bills deserve. 
   I would also like to say to my friend I appreciate the accommodation of the House schedule this week based on the loss of our colleague from the First District of Virginia, Jo Ann Davis. She cared about the things this Congress does. She was a great Member of Congress. I think it's fair to say she was particularly focused on the armed services and on Federal employees, both of which she had a real opportunity to impact. 
   And I would say that I remember her seat over here where she almost always sat, that last week she was able to be here with us, just looking, and it was obvious the great health challenge she was facing and the incredible effort she was making to be here to cast the last week of votes she was able to cast. And for your quick accommodation of the schedule so that we could participate in her memorial service tomorrow and also, frankly, recognize her service by the House not being in session tomorrow, I am grateful to you for that. 
   I would yield for any comments you might want to make.

And, in fact, late in the last Congress we had that; and as I recall, we brought a tax bill to the floor and gave our friends on your side, the minority at that time, an opportunity to have a recommital or some kind of motion that would change or improve that bill.

   A bill that has not been debated, a bill that's treated like a conference bill, with the exception of not having the conference on this big a topic, is a bill that's not likely to become law between now and September 30, I would think.

   Mr. BLUNT. Reclaiming my time on that, Mr. Speaker, I would just say that I'm sure when my good friend was frustrated that conferences weren't always scheduled in in a way that was timely that the alternative that would have been presented would not have been, well, the way to solve this was just not to have conferences. 
   And the two bills, the Senate and House bill, were different from each other by tens of billions of dollars; so there is plenty of debatable space between a known Senate bill and a known House bill that apparently we will have no opportunity to issue an alternative on. 
   I believe there was not an instance, and I don't know when I was unsuccessful, but I always argued in that rare case when this happened that the minority should have an opportunity. In fact, I very well remember having a significant disagreement with our chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the last Congress on insisting that the minority be given that opportunity. And on something this big, I really think the process is at great fault here. But we'll have time to talk about this next week. 
   On appropriations will we have a continuing resolution on the floor next week or at what point?

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for that response. I would say that there are few exceptions to the rule, but my experience has been, and I have had some experience on this question when we were in the majority and had chairmen, the chairman almost never wants to believe that the bill can be improved. 
   So the chairman's desire for a closed rule is generally unanimous, though I know the chairman of the Finance Committee last week took a different view, and I was pleased to see his different view of that. 
   I think on appropriations bills, there are very few, if any, exceptions where those bills have not come to the floor with an open rule. The gentleman is a member of the committee and would have a sense of that, but the tradition here is pretty strong. 
   I don't know of any more important bill we are likely to deal with this year than this particular appropriations bill. I would hope that we have this kind of open process on the appropriations bill that we have had in the past. 
   I would yield for a response.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that response. I would say that I believe that I reflect the view of this side that the debates both on the policy issues, that I frankly think may be appropriate in some other bill besides an appropriations bill, on the policy issues and the spending issues, a full and free opportunity to discuss those is the desire of this side. I think it serves the best interest of the country. 
   As this appropriations bill gets broader and broader in the areas it deals with, it becomes more and more like the regular appropriations bills we will bring to the floor, and the tradition of the House, unaltered by any pattern I am aware of, has been on appropriations bills, as long as the Member was willing to say where they would pay for the change that they want to make, that they have been given the opportunity to make those amendments. 
   I was disappointed, as broad-based and as big as the continuing resolution was that we passed earlier, that it violated what I considered a well-understood and time-honored principle of amending those bills. This bill would go even further if we did that, and it would be a bad pattern, I think. 
   On the budget, does the gentleman have any information on the budget itself, when we might be able to see the majority's budget and when we would be voting on it, both? 
   I would yield to my good friend.

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate the gentleman's information on that. I will even be glad to accept some of it. Maybe gasoline was $1.46 in 2000. It had moved almost to $2.50 in the next 6 years. It has gone to $4 in the last 18 months. That is a record we are more than happy to talk about. 
   In terms of refining capacity, actually we have been bringing refined gas product into the country in recent months. I don't know enough about refineries to know if a 10 percent downage in refineries is normal or not. I do know we haven't built a new refinery since 1976, and a number have closed. 
   In terms of seeking oil, the Chinese now have an agreement with the Cubans that they can drill for oil 45 miles off our coast. Our companies can't do that. There's tremendous potential, I believe, and I think many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle do, in the water, in the oil shale, and certainly the gentleman is right, and neither of us want to particularly give away our age in suggesting that that transition that we both anticipate will occur, will not totally occur in our lifetime. Even if we knew what it was right now, the last person will put the last gallon of gas in the last car that burns gas 30 or 40 years after we move toward whatever that next thing is that powers the economy. 
   We certainly need to encourage getting there, and I think there are many parts to that puzzle, from wind and solar and nuclear and better battery technology. But we firmly believe that you can have impact, and I don't mean we in the royal sense, I mean those of us who have been talking for years about supply, that you can have impact on the world price by just announcing that the United States was going to go after its reserves, known and unknown, and that unknown criteria is much more promising because of recent finds in this entire hemisphere than we would have thought it would have been. 
   We are eager to enter into that and feel strongly that more supply is part of the important transition to a different energy future, and would like to see legislation on the floor that increases supply. 
   In terms of legislation, one issue that we have talked a lot about, you and I have worked on, one of my colleagues has worked on a lot, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, I am going to yield for a moment to my good friend from California.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise again today, as I did at the beginning of this debate, to urge a ``no'' vote on this nonbinding resolution. We have spent the week discussing the situation in Iraq and trying to find out what the resolution may really mean. 
   As I said at the start of this debate, it is hard to imagine a less qualified group prepared to determine tactics on the ground than 535 Members of Congress, or 535 members of anything else; how many troops to deploy, where to deploy them, which car to stop. Where does it end? 
   There is a disagreement on how we should fight this war on Islamic totalitarianism, but this fight is the challenge of our generation. 
   Madam Speaker, many of my friends on the other side of the aisle supported this mission at the beginning. Now they are ready to give up in the middle of the fight. 
   Those who join me in opposing this nonbinding resolution have been saying all week, while this resolution will have no impact because it is nonbinding, it is still the first step toward cutting funding for our troops. 
   Yesterday, we were told that this is the first step toward pulling the rug out from under our troops in the field. 
   This week, one of the veterans on our side of the aisle was accused of being dishonest in her representation when she said that this resolution we will vote on today did not support those who are deploying. But the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Murtha, said just yesterday, during the unveiling of his strategy to pull the rug out from under our troops, ``They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment. They don't have the training, and they won't be able to do the work.'' 
   He also said, ``I think, first of all, we have to be careful that people don't think this is the vote. The real vote will come on the legislation we are putting together. This nonbinding legislation is just an opinion.'' 
   I would say this resolution says just enough not to say anything at all. We have already heard the Democrats calling the debate this week the ``bark before the bite.'' Their so-called slow-bleed approach is the bite that will surely hurt those fighting under America's flag overseas. 
   This nonbinding resolution is the first step in an all-too-binding spiral toward defeat in a fight that we cannot afford to lose. 
   I am not pleased to vote ``no'' today, but I will vote ``no,'' knowing that the ``no'' vote is the right vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding and I come to the floor to talk about this bill with real appreciation for the hard work that the gentleman from New Jersey has put into this effort. I know it is a heartfelt effort on his part. 
   In fact, I first met his mother when we were both serving as the Secretaries of State of respective States, West Virginia and Missouri, at the time. I just come here to say that the States have handled the responsibility of the mechanics of election administration well for a very long time. 
   The process of voting, how you vote, the mechanics of what the ballot looks like, whether you have a straight ballot voting system, all that has been left to the States, and I think wisely so. 
   In the Help America Vote Act, the Congress provided States with over $3 billion to modernize their voting systems, including allowing the States to decide whether they wanted to have a paper backup. In my State, the State of Missouri, the Secretary of State determined if that money was used, there would be no system authorized in our State unless the paper backup was part of that system. As it turned out, that was a very good decision. 
   But in the aftermath of the 2000 elections, many States took that incentive, that $3 billion that was out there, and in my view made decisions more quickly than they otherwise would have. 
   This bill now offers a second round of money that would be available to encourage changing their systems, many of them that we know about today changing their system from a system they just used Federal money to change to. I think this is neither wise nor the responsible thing for us to do. 
   I also very much think that there is no reason to rush this bill at this time. There is not enough time left between now and the November election to change voting systems. Over 30 States have already conducted primary elections with the system they will use in November. The very worst time to change a voting system is an election that has overwhelming participation, as we believe this one will. 
   Election administration and the mechanics of election grew up in this country over decades and generations of voting and voting habits. To try to change those voting habits from a primary election some time earlier in the year to a new system, to be frankly tested the first time in probably the biggest election turnout that we have had or will have in a long time, is just a mistake. 
   To think that we should pass this bill today for the November election, I think, is as far off base as we could be. I am not absolutely opposed to the Federal Government encouraging States to do better with their election process; I am opposed to this feeling that we get into that creates an environment where the States have to make these decisions more quickly than they should, and particularly to make a decision like this just in advance of a high-participation election. 
   I don't think the $3.2 billion so-called solution produced the right results. In fact, several States are now complaining that it produced problems. But they are the ones that decided that they would deal with those problems. Those problems, frankly, become less significant every time voters use a system. Maybe you made an investment that you wished you didn't make, but you made that investment. It is not impossible to either reverse it on your own or decide you are going to make it work. 
   I think this is the wrong approach at the wrong time. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill today, not to give up in working with our friend from New Jersey to find a bill that would be helpful to the States, but not to pass a bill today that would only create with certainty more problems in November than we will have without it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding as this debate comes to an end. 
   The legislation we have debated here tonight was at one point supposed to be an emergency supplemental spending bill for our troops, dispatched to them with urgency, resolution, and purpose. It was supposed to provide money and resources for our fighting men and women on the frontlines so that they had the tools and equipment they needed to finish the task at hand. 
   Instead the majority turned this important funding package into an exercise in political theater, along the way, disregarding the testimony of our military commanders, the wishes of many in their own caucus, and basic and numerous dictates of our Constitution and our history. 
   The result has been a final conference report, though we know it really won't be a final conference report. It has been a conference report that imposes artificial deadlines, ties the hands of our commanders in the field, and demotes those tasked with managing an active military engagement to the rank of administrative assistant, forced to check new boxes before exercising the authority they have today to execute their mission. 
   And it would spend billions of dollars on things that should have been debated at another time. Some of those things have merit. Some of those things I agree with. Some of them I don't. But they shouldn't have been debated as part of this bill. 
   Those who attended today's briefing with General Petraeus benefited from a clear and sober assessment of our chances for achieving success in Iraq and the consequences we can expect by declaring defeat. But not a single person in that room today, with knowledge of our progress on the ground, believes this war was lost or that our presence there was without merit. Unfortunately, too many in this Chamber seem convinced of the inevitability of defeat. 
   However this vote turns out, I am hopeful that tonight's roll call will end this effort to undercut our mission by undermining the authority of our commanders in the field. Republicans are willing, and have been willing, to work with the majority on this bill. But we will not waver on our insistence that an emergency troop support bill passed by Congress actually be focused on supporting the troops. The legislation before us tonight fails to meet that most basic standard. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill and ask my colleagues to join me tonight in standing up for the interests of our men and women in harm's way. And hopefully, very soon, we can join together in crafting a bill that will be considered quickly, as this one should have been, passed quickly, with help to the frontlines as soon as possible. 
   It's time for the political theater to end and the real work to begin.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I want to also thank my good friends, Mr. Pence and Mr. Boucher, for working so hard on this legislation. I think it was first introduced 3 years ago. I was a cosponsor of it at the time and I am a cosponsor today. And I want to mention the hard work that Mr. Conyers has done to get this legislation to this point today after a long effort, and also to suggest that the hard work of my good friend, Mr. Smith, is deeply appreciated. 
   I'm always hesitant when I rise on the House floor with any position that's different than his, but this is a place where I really do think that it's important to draw a line, and important, a bright line, between the information that people have access to and how they get it. I certainly can't say that I agree with everything I read in a newspaper article or that I see on the evening news or that I hear on a local radio program, but I can say that the public is best served by maintaining the free flow of information on matters of public interest. 
   As James Madison said in the report of 1800, arguing against the Sedition Act, ``To the press alone, checkered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs that have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.'' Madison, Jefferson and our history lead to the conclusion that a free press is essential for a free people. 
   In the past few years, there have been too many instances where the pendulum has swung against the free flow of information and in favor of the government. I was troubled by the instances I've seen where reporters have been jailed or threatened with jail for simply protecting their sources. Journalists should be the last resort, not the first stop, for civil litigants and for prosecutors attempting to obtain the identity of confidential sources. 
   In my view, continuing to compel reporters to reveal the identity of their confidential sources will result in a chilling effect on the free flow of information and be detrimental to the public interest. Nevertheless, the privileges that reporters have should not be unlimited, they should not be absolute, and this bill defines those exceptions in an important way. This bill says that in cases where it's necessary to reveal a source to prevent an act of terrorism, to prevent other significant harm to national security, to prevent imminent death or significant bodily harm, the reporter can be compelled. It also includes an exception in cases where a properly classified national security secret along with financial information, a trade secret or personal medical information has been improperly leaked, where that reporter can face a penalty. 
   Finally, it excludes from protection terrorists and their media arms. Yes, there are times when confidentiality must be breached, and I believe this bill strikes that balance. Forty-nine States and the District of Columbia have legislation similar to this, but this establishes a national standard. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues for the hard work to bring this to the floor. I look forward to the vote today, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   I don't think, as I listen to this conversation and see it develop today, if we pass this section that the President hasn't seen, and the Senate passes the section that the President hasn't seen, and he either signs or vetoes it, that would be the only bill that the House actually passed that the President sees on this topic. It is clear if you look at the line-item veto case, it was clear in that case that the President can't selectively veto things in a part of a House bill. 
   Again, think through this with me, if you will. The only thing the President will have seen that the House and Senate both passed as it stands would be this last portion. 
   The concept that we can start sending bills over piecemeal because the House had passed this part of it is a flawed concept. Who knows what the House would pass if it didn't get a chance to pass the full bill each time. We would have passed the tax extenders today, unanimously, if it hadn't had the portion on it on new tax increases. We would have all voted for that part of the tax extenders bill. It wouldn't have changed that part of the bill. In fact, if we had only sent the President that part of the tax extenders bill, he would have signed it. But he probably won't sign it with this additional thing. 
   When we had the Deficit Reduction Act, which, believe me, I remember in vivid detail, vivid detail; we had a bill that we sent to the Senate, the Senate clerk made a change in it and sent it to the Senate floor. Nobody in the Senate who voted on the bill knew that it had been changed, so it had no impact on the Senate vote. 
   The Senate clerk got it back, realized that her change was inaccurate, sent it back to us just like we had sent it over to them. We voted on it again and sent it to the President, and didn't know until the signing ceremony that this had ever occurred. We didn't know until the signing ceremony that this had ever occurred. There was no action on the House at all with any knowledge any of this had ever occurred. In fact, none of it even occurred on the House side. 
   At that time, the minority leader stood up and said: 
   ``Whereas, although the Senate Enrolling Clerk mistakenly changed critical numbers that had major financial significance, leadership deliberately chose to ignore that notification and instead allowed the House to vote on an incorrect version of this legislation.'' 
   Not true, by the way. 
   ``Whereas, the effect of these actions raises serious constitutional questions and jeopardizes the legal status of this legislation. 
   ``Resolved, that the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct shall begin an immediate investigation into the abuse of power surrounding the accuracy of the process and enrollment.'' 
   The Speaker of the House, my friends, certified to the President that we were sending him a bill exactly as we had passed it. We now understand that clearly was not an accurate certification of what the House has done, and we are about to go down a path that might have the only action really taken by the House that the President sees in totality, this last segment of the bill. Why we would have moved forward, knowing all those facts before we moved forward, is a mystery to me.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for his response. We may have a significant debate over whatever standards we were held to, that people are no longer held to. I will say that in that case, nobody in the House ever knew that any changes had been made, and it was alleged that somehow we were  going to be subject to Ethics Committee investigations. 
   I would say in this case that my principal concern would be that the sections of the farm bill that have gone to the President, since they were not part of an entire bill, could be subject to all kinds of future litigation. I do know in the litigation that the minority initiated in February, 2006, 2 years and millions of taxpayer dollars later, we finally ended that litigation at the court of appeals level with the court of appeals deciding that if the Speaker and the President pro tempore certified that this is what both bodies passed, it was what both bodies passed. 
   Here, we're moving forward with both bodies admitting that what this President has seen is not what both bodies passed. This idea that just because a portion of the bill has passed in a bigger bill means that the House was for that portion of the bill, that the Senate was for that portion of the bill, I don't think would stand any reasonable test of a way for us to move forward, and I think this bill does become subject to all kind of challenges from outside this building as well as perhaps from inside.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. 
   We are for extending these good tax policies on research and development, we are for extending these good tax policies on energy research particularly. As Republicans, as conservatives, as people who actually brought these tax policies to the table to start with, of course we are for them. 
   Now a 1-year extension is not the right amount of time. We can debate that. I hope we have time to because this is not the last day we are going to see this bill. If you're really serious about energy research, try to go to borrow money with a 1-year plan. You can't borrow money with a 1-year plan. You can't take a chance with a 1-year plan. You can't hire people with a 1-year plan. Surely, everybody here knows that. 
   If we were really serious about extending these policies, we would be sending signals that we are committed to these policies for a long time. But we are for the policies that we are talking about in current law. We are not nearly as excited about the new things that are added; the tax breaks for lawyers who have taken a case on contingency and now want taxpayers to subsidize their dealing with that case by these new ideas in the Tax Code. But we are for the continuation of good policies. But we are not for believing that to continue good tax policies, you have to pay for those by taxing other people. 
   If these tax policies are good enough for now, they are good enough to continue to be the policies of the future. This House decided last year on the alternative minimum tax that, well, we don't want more people to slip into that bad tax situation so we are going to move forward without having taxes that replace what would happen if we didn't try to maintain the current status of taxes. 
   That is what we are for, maintaining current policies, giving them as much life as possible, and not assuming that other taxpayers have to suffer in an economy that we need to be sending signs of growth and productivity to, not signs of more ideas for the Federal Government to increase taxes. 
   I hope we can come back to a bill that extends good policy, that does it for a longer period of time, and doesn't seem to feel it's necessary to tax other people to extend policies that are working in the Tax Code today.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend. 
   Looking backwards at this, I think that my friend is right that there was a pattern that developed with the bill that included the Veterans bill that we didn't like. And so in the Congress that started in 2005, we tried to restructure that so that that would not happen in the future. We were trying to break that pattern, and, in fact, we did. And in 2005, that bill passed individually, as did every other bill. 
   In 2006, unfortunately, that was not the case, and there was a penalty to be paid for that, and I guess we paid it. But we were trying to break that pattern of coupling veterans benefits with something that was much more controversial than veterans benefits. It was part of at that time Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban Development, and so we took Veterans and put them with the Military Construction so that military families, military personnel, veterans and retirees would all be in a bill that we hoped would be the least controversial of all bills and not be the subject of that packaging to get those most controversial things done. Frankly, I think the 2005 experience showed that we were on the way to achieving that. 
   My concern on this would be exactly that, that the pattern of using the veterans benefit bill, to couple that with bills that are less popular, and not only appropriations bills, but I can certainly see, even in this Congress, that bill becoming the host for authorizing bills that are not popular, I think is a very unfortunate development and I regret it. I wish that we could have stayed with the pattern that we tried to create in the last Congress and successfully did create in the first year of the last Congress. Again, as we look back on history, this is the first time in 20 years that not a single bill has passed now. 
   Also, when we coupled bills together in the 10 years I was here, we coupled those bills together to try to get a signature rather than anticipating a veto, and we got those signatures.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, if we want to try to determine the motives of each other, which is, I suppose, what we do in this place, that's one thing. But you're the one that started that. 
   What we were trying to do, I'll advance again, was to take the Veterans bill out of the tug of war that always went on over the Housing bill, and that's what we did. 
   Now, your assertion that that's because we didn't like Housing, I don't agree with that. I do agree with the idea that we thought that the Veterans bill did not need to be needlessly held back by a bill that was assured to always be intensely debated. And that's why we did that. And that's why we passed the bill. And that's why if we would have passed this bill 60 days ago when it came over from the Senate, military families and veterans would have $18.5 million every day that they haven't had the last 32 days now. 
   On the other issue, I don't have any reason to believe that the President is not for all of those health care issues you talked about. That's not what this veto will be about. I know I'm for advancing all of those, partly because I've benefited from research in some of those. 
   But I think you said at the first of the year, and you were right when you said it, that the best way to advance these bills is one at a time. Now, I think I'm hearing a different argument than that today. But I agree with your first-of-the-year view of this; and I would hope, after this process, we can get back to that. 
   Another thing I wanted to ask about, I read in one of the Capitol Hill newspapers this week that the majority continues to look at the possibility of limiting the minority's right, and it has been a right of the minority since 1822, to have the opportunity to have a motion to recommit at the end of the bill. 
   I will point out, I believe yesterday, on the bill we dealt with yesterday, the first substitute that the minority had been allowed in this entire Congress, the last day of the 10th month of the Congress, we finally get a substitute. 
   No question, we've had to maximize our use of the motion to recommit because, while we appreciate the amendments we had on the bill today, we haven't had many amendments before today. And while we appreciate the substitute we had yesterday, we had had no substitutes before yesterday. 
   I'm wondering if the gentleman will want to talk a little bit about any discussions going on, the majority has going on, about limiting the 1822 right of the motion to recommit. 
   And I would yield.

I will assure my friend we are working in good faith to try to address the less than a handful of issues, though they are all important, that we think need to be addressed, from who benefits from this program to how you determine your eligibility and legal presence in the country to benefit, to how you work effectively to see that adults are moved off the program. We are more than willing to work on that. We have been trying to work on that all week. 
   And, of course, our request just a few days ago was the reverse of the problem that now we see is a problem in the Senate, which was give us some time to work this out. We were denied time on this side. Apparently the Senate has also been denied time to work this out. And, once again, I think we have headed toward a needless conclusion to this debate that could have been prevented if we would have all engaged more effectively before we sent the bill to the Senate.

   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leading this debate today. 
   I think we all know what's going to happen today, but we don't know what this debate is all about. The gentleman just mentioned that one out of five people on Medicare now take advantage of Medicare Advantage. This is not a debate about the insurance companies and the doctors, this is a debate about competition. 
   Now, there is a legitimate division on the floor of this House about whether competition and patient choice is part of the key to the future of Medicare.     
   I believe it is, and I think we could have taken care of the providers in a way that didn't step in and impact competition. In my district alone--and, in fact, in rural districts and minority districts, that's where that one out of five Americans live. In my district alone 28,000 people take advantage of the opportunity to be part of Medicare Advantage. Half of them take advantage of the opportunity to select their own doctor. That opportunity goes away if this bill becomes law. 
   I intend to vote ``no'' today not because I don't respect the providers but because I think this is a terrible way to solve this problem that could be solved otherwise.

And even if we now are able to clarify this, it is so late that it is going to have impact on how people can file their taxes next year. I certainly would agree with any premise to suggest this should have been taken care of long ago. And as my good friend knows, we did send a bill that I voted for to President Clinton in 1999 that would have eliminated this tax. We should have done that at that time. I am sorry we couldn't figure out a way to work together and eliminate that tax then so we wouldn't have to wrestle with this issue every year between then and now.

   Mr. BLUNT. They do, and it is a difference. I think the third thing that should be considered, that unfortunately we still are not able to bring ourselves to consider, is how you manage to deal with that revenue shortfall by savings and spending, by just not planning to spend it. But the President's budget did, your budget did. I don't agree with the President's budget and I voted against the majority's budget, and we do have to look at savings as one of the options. The President's budget, the President would have increased spending by over 6 percent, by over 4 1/2 percent in the bills left, and I think that is the number right now we are trying to deal with. I look forward to working with the gentleman as we deal with that, get the work of this year's Congress done, and let our Members go home and talk about what we have done or what we have failed to do.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for his response. In that regard, normally when we have had a closed rule on a continuing resolution, it has been a continuing resolution that did not include much or normally nothing in new policy, and we will have to watch these circumstances and hope that if there is a significant policy addition or significant financial addition, there is the normal process that goes on with appropriations bills to have a debate and a discussion about that. We are hopeful that whatever this bill is, it is as narrow as it can be and also that we get it out of the way as quickly as we can so that we can get on with the appropriations work for the next year. 
   I understand the challenge this creates for the appropriators, but the more we try to do the 2008 work in the 2007 bill, the harder that is, I think, to move that bill along quickly as well.

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate my good friend's comments in that regard too. As my friend knows, I argued and he argued and others did in November and into December that it would be so much better for this Congress if we could have worked with the other body and get these bills done last year. I regret that we didn't. I wanted to. I wanted to at least get some of them done. I think all of our colleagues on this side were on that side of the debate, or virtually all of us, and now we are faced with this work. 
   One other topic I would like to bring up today, because we didn't get to discuss it during the privileged motion, but I know my good friend from Maryland cares about the House, cares about the procedures of the House. 
   The topic that was raised earlier by the minority leader of an amendment submitted to the Rules Committee and then the Member who submitted it asked that it be withdrawn before the meeting; there may have been a similar occasion in the past, we can't find one in our research. I am hoping that was the fits-and-starts of a new Congress, rather than a new standard. 
   Occasionally Members, and your Members did it often during the last Congress, submit an amendment, realize as the debate develops and the discussion goes on that that is not an amendment that is in their best interests, or anybody else's, to be offered, and then request it be withdrawn. 
   I think we honored on every occasion, I believe, and if we did not, that  is beside the point, my belief is on every occasion, if a Member wanted to withdraw an amendment, we allowed that Member to do that. I hope that will be the process from now on in this Congress as well. I would be pleased to have your reassurance that we are headed in that direction. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Some of these issues, I will admit, that we have dealt with in the last 2 weeks, in fact in the last Congress, the Congress I was in the majority in, passed bills highly similar. But the 60 new Members didn't get to participate in committee. 
   But that is behind us. I am prepared to look forward. I hope that we have those opportunities. We will look carefully at the character of the CR and hope that it is as minimal in its changes as possible and that all the members of the Appropriations Committee are part of that discussion.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I thank the gentleman for that. I do think the time does matter here because of the potential for furlough notices and other things for troops if we let this bill go much beyond the work period we are in right now between now and Memorial Day. 
   One of the items that I keep seeing reports that could be in this bill would be enhanced GI benefits. The cost estimates I have seen from a Senate cost  estimate on a bill over there, to a bill here, have been anywhere from a low of $20 billion to a high of $60 billion over 10 years. I know a number of Republicans have been working on that as well. Some of them have reached out to Democrats this week, saying, We hope we can find a way to pay for this. 
   Does the gentleman have any knowledge of whether or not that GI bill, expanded GI benefits, is being actively discussed as part of the bill? 
   I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that information. I know Senator McCain on the other side of the building also has come up with a proposal in this area. He introduced legislation in this area. So it's widely discussed. I think something can be done. Whether or not the supplemental is the place or not, I don't know. I do believe that whatever we do should become permanently part of the benefits that veterans should anticipate being able to have in the future and not have any kind of a temporary aspect to it. 
   The other question I had of my friend are just about the conferences that I haven't asked about in a couple of weeks. There are really three of them I am wondering about, and that would be the conference on the farm bill, the conference on the higher education bill, or the budget itself. 
   I would yield.

I hope we get to a point where we have a bill on the floor or have some ongoing policy that farmers can rely on, even if that is an extension of the bill we have, but some ongoing policy really does matter, and I hope we get there.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. King for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today, in fact, in support of most of the efforts that are in this bill because most of the efforts in this bill were things that the Republicans in control of the Congress worked to pass on the House side of the building just in the last 2 years. 
   The most important responsibility of the Federal Government is to protect the American people. House Republicans recognized that and moved to enact important recommendations from the 9/11 Commission during the 109th Congress. We enacted, I believe, 39 of those 41 recommendations. And I would suggest to my colleagues that there is probably a reason we didn't enact the other two, because we didn't think they were the right thing to do. 
   Despite the fact that we have already taken this action before in the House by overwhelming majorities, the bill on the floor today has bypassed the committee process. There has been no opportunity to offer amendments. And, in fact, I want to talk in a minute about one new and I think particularly bad idea. These ideas are proposed in a way that talks about putting risk-based funding in place when, in fact, every single Democrat failed to support an almost identical initiative in the 109th Congress. That initiative passed in the 109th Congress. And amazingly, this initiative starts when that one ended. I am puzzled by what was so wrong with that initiative in the 109th Congress, now in the 110th Congress. It is an initiative that just simply takes up where the bill we passed last year left off.     
   We can't prevent terror attacks in this country by adding other layers of bureaucracy. We can't prevent terror attacks by making public information about our intelligence budget and other budgets that shouldn't be made public. Homeland security is too important to play politics when American lives are at stake. As a body, both Democrats and Republicans, we need to be committed to that. 
   We have an enemy that has vowed to exploit every weakness, every piece of needless information we give them, every failure we have to understand the kind of fight that we are in, Mr. Speaker. 
   Also in this legislation today, there is a sense of Congress that the Proliferation Security Initiative initiated by the President in 2003 would need to be somehow authorized by the United Nations. I think that doesn't make sense for this Congress. I don't believe that will ever be in any legislation that makes it to the President's desk. I think it is a particularly bad idea to suggest that our initiatives for proliferation security would somehow now come under the auspices of the United Nations. 
   This has been a successful program. We have 14 direct partners in this program; over 70 countries have worked with us to follow-up on specific pieces of information that we needed to check into to be sure that proliferation was not a problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that the House votes later today to eliminate that sense of the Congress that the United Nations would authorize this program from this legislation. I look forward to bringing this issue to the floor as the majority has promised with debate in the future. We didn't have committee debate on this bill today. I hope that we quickly get to the promises of the majority to debate these bills in committee, bring them to the floor, and work together to do the right thing for the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (THE REVEREND JERRY FALWELL -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I thank the gentleman also for putting this time together today so that we could talk about the incredible, remarkable life of Rev. Jerry Falwell, a man who never apologized for his spiritual beliefs, who never wavered in his commitment to furthering the dialogue of faith and family in America. 
   Jerry Falwell was a native son of Virginia, the senior pastor of one of its most prominent and well-attended churches, and the founder of a Christian college in Lynchburg that started its enrollment with 154 students in 1971 and today has over 20,000 students. 
   Along the way, Rev. Falwell honed his leadership skills and pursued his academic study. In Springfield, Missouri, the town I live in now and I am pleased to represent it in Congress, he transferred there as a sophomore to Baptist Bible College. He later graduated from that school in 1956 with a degree in theology. 
   And the first time I met Rev. Falwell was when he returned to Springfield. I was a county official at the time, and I had begun to watch him on television. And unlike so many other  television pastors, watching Rev. Falwell was like you were right there in the church service because it was a church service. And I remember the growth of the church as you could watch it on that late Sunday night broadcast that I happened to watch on Sunday evening. I remember when they started moving the church, they had a song that was something like ``I Want That Mountain,'' the site on which Rev. Falwell and the church had decided they wanted to grow the church and eventually the school. And watching his incredible faith and what he was doing, his unflagging determination to spread the Gospel, his ability to use the communication tools available to him in ways that others hadn't, but in ways that his growing congregation were totally comfortable with, in ways, in fact, that didn't compete with what he was doing every Sunday morning and every Sunday night at the Thomas Road Baptist Church.     
   He left Missouri in the mid-1950s with a renewed commitment to the power of ideas, ideas about the importance of spirituality and public life, ideas that promoted the family, ideas about the protection of human life at all stages of development. And for 50 years, for half a century, his mission was a mission of defending those ideas. 
   It would give rise to a movement of citizen activists in evangelical Christianity that, frankly, for the previous 50 years in many ways had been intentionally removing itself from the civic and political process, with a focus on what was going to happen after we were here, rather than also being focused on the world we live in. He never lost sight of his mission. 
   He was a man of purpose, not a man of things, it appeared to me. Whenever he applied that purpose to improve the conditions of the world around him, it made a difference. The time and energy he devoted to his once small college, in fact, once just his idea of a college, became one of our larger universities. It's a great example. 
   The church he started, the Thomas Road Baptist Church, which he started in 1956 in a bottling plant with a congregation of 35 people, now is a church of nearly 25,000 members. But his achievements weren't only building a church and building a school, he was deeply concerned about the moral direction of this country, and worked hard to ensure that people of faith were part of the national dialogue, part of a way of changing who we were for the better. 
   His lifelong pursuit of truth was not a casual affair nor was his commitment to a way of life and learning that acknowledged the lessons of the past and applied those experiences to building a better future. 
   Earlier this afternoon, parishioners of the Thomas Road Baptist Church and people from all over the country and all over the world gathered in Lynchburg to pay a final tribute to their pastor, their friend, a leader that they respected. 
   Tonight, I would like to join my good friend, Mr. Goodlatte, and others and use this opportunity to pay my final respects to a person who clearly was a leader. He was a teacher, he was a father and a husband, and above all other things, he was an untiring messenger of the good news and the eternal hope of our Lord. 
   I want to thank my friend for organizing this time tonight and for giving me the time to join you.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for his views on that, and I would hope that the Protect America Act is not allowed to lapse. I'm not as comfortable as the article that my good friend referred to or this article may have created comfort for him and other information, particularly about any new targets that might fit some past definition that arose. We've debated this before; we will debate it again. 
   I would think that allowing this act to expire on the basis that somehow we have a 12-month window would not be something that either I would be comfortable with or the intelligence community would be comfortable with. And we would have another day to debate that. 
   I do hope we continue to work both to resolve this issue permanently. The issue of immunity is an issue that's been out there long enough now that we should be able to bring it to some resolution, and I hope we can find a way to do that; and I would hope we could find a way to do that before February 1, which would almost require action next week. I understand that if the Senate doesn't bring their debate that would be initiated this week to some conclusion, it's hard for us to get that permanent solution at that time frame. 
   But I do think a permanent solution is important here, and I don't have the confidence that my good friend does that we would have a lot of time beyond February 1 where there is no harm by not having the ability to look quickly in those areas involving foreign individuals in foreign countries who come to our attention that are not to our attention today, but I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I hear my friend's displeasure. In August, I think 41 Members of the majority joined with almost everyone on my side of the aisle to put the Protect America Act in place for this period of time that's about to expire. 
   The very fact that the Senate majority leader and others are calling for an extension leads me to believe that there is a reason to have something beyond the normal bill, the regular bill, that may or may not allow some listening to information we need to hear in the future because of what's been decided today. 
   Clearly, in my view at least, the Senate believes that an extension of the current law would be necessary to provide the current level of protection or they wouldn't be worried about the deadline. They'd take the gentleman's suggestion that maybe we have a year to listen to the things that we now know we need to listen to, and we shouldn't be rushed. I would not like to see the current law expire without an adequate replacement. 
   The goal the gentleman mentioned for the legislation, hearing those things we need to hear, and I'd paraphrase here, in the quickest possible time frame, is an appropriate goal. We'll continue to debate how we get there. I would hope that neither body allows this law to lapse with nothing to provide the level of protection the American people now have and in the future, and I yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate the question. I would think that if we find ourselves in that situation, at least I personally would want to look for the shortest period of time when we could reasonably reach a permanent solution to this. I don't think the country benefits from a constant debate on how we move forward on this issue. I think we need to find a permanent solution or at least a longer term solution than we've found to date, 
   and I wouldn't want to see the law lapse. 
   I think we want to look at the circumstances at the time, what we were dealing with with legislation, and hopefully a conference of some kind and look at it at the time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his hard work on the floor this evening, for the leadership of Mr. Hoekstra and others on this important bill. We need to modernize FISA to keep up with changes in communications technology and the continually evolving tactics of our terrorist enemies. 
   We made some important steps in this direction only 90 days ago. We all understand that more needs to be done. But rather than responding to this need, this legislation actually impedes the intelligence community's ability to conduct effective investigations and to prevent future terrorist attacks. 
   This act requires FISA court orders for the first time for thousands of overseas terrorist targets. The Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, has described this requirement as unworkable and impractical. 
   This act contains a sunset date which fails to provide the certainty under the law that our intelligence community needs to effectively do its job. 
   It doesn't provide the liability protections for telephone companies and other carriers that assisted the government after 9/11 who now have a flurry of harassing lawsuits facing them. 
   Mr. Speaker, the majority claims that this legislation will restore a balance between civil liberties and national security. In fact, this bill will restore the intelligence gap that existed prior to our actions the 1st of August. 
   I urge this legislation be defeated. The current bill is better than this bill. We need to deal with it certainly between now and the end of the 6 months, but let's not take a step backwards. Let's let the law do what this law was intended to do in 1978 and is doing today.

I've been also told that there is now a PAYGO rule because of the way that bill has been calculated to have some potential costs.

We did notice that Ways and Means Committee had a hearing scheduled on the Peru Free Trade Agreement next week, which starts a clock. It would almost inevitably bring that bill to the floor on an understood date. That hearing has been scheduled.

On the appropriation bills, again, as I reminded the majority leader earlier today, the Republicans voting for the appropriations bills, most of them had a number of Republicans that would sustain a Presidential veto if that turns out to be the result. I would anticipate that we need to be thinking about how we move this as quickly as possible. 
   In that regard, the Senate has already produced a fall calendar for their Members. Our Members would benefit as early as possible to having a sense to where, if we are not going to be here in the fall, I think the Senate intends not to be here the week of Columbus Day and maybe the week of Thanksgiving and maybe the week after that. I wonder if the leader can give us any sense of when to expect a fall calendar or your views on that at this point as Members make their plans for the fall.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, the truth is that this $50 billion that we're now prohibiting being collected from 23 million new American families next year isn't our money. It's their money. It's not money that we have this year. Now, it's money that we said at the first of this year we never want to collect from these families, but then we decided we immediately wanted to go right ahead and spend it. 
   That's the real fallacy here. Whether the White House makes that mistake or the legislature makes that mistake, we have no right to this money. 
   As my good friend from Massachusetts said, Republicans oppose raising taxes. Now, because of that, our friends on the other side kept putting this issue off, and because of that, when it comes time for Americans who aren't impacted by the alternative minimum tax at all to get a refund, their refund is going to be slowed up. This should have been done 6 months ago. But we are getting it done today. We need to move forward in a way that doesn't let this continue to be a pattern. 
   This tax was put in place in 1969. Unfortunately, it's still affecting the same families that were affected in 1969. But no modification for inflation. No forward thinking. 
   It was made worse in 1993. Republicans in the House, and some Democrats, voted to repeal this tax in 1999. And that's the best answer. 
   We need to get on to how we eliminate this unfair tax. It doesn't do what it's supposed to do. And we have no claim on this money. Acting like we do, spending it in advance, waiting till the last minute to do anything to protect these families was bad management. But we are getting the job done today of protecting these families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for yielding. 
   I'm just here to say that I think this 18-month extension gives us the time we need to make SCHIP an even better program. It extends the current program. It increases funding for the current program. It helps the States that have a shortfall. It ensures that kids who don't have Medicaid, who are in that second 100 percentile, the families who are closest to the Medicaid number, get their coverage first, by not reversing the policies the administration has lately put in place on waivers. It does important things to ensure that the qualifying standards for SCHIP don't change. On those areas that extend Medicare payments to doctors, I would remind my friends here that we're paying for those, most of that, through the stabilization fund on the last big fight here we had. This was the fund we thought we might need to make part D addition to Medicare as a competitive and innovative addition to Medicare work. We didn't need that money because it's working on its own. The last fight we had this big on a health care issue, we kept hearing how terrible it would be for seniors. Eighty-seven percent of the seniors don't think it's terrible at all. 
   I think we're going to see that this debate also leads to better results for SCHIP, not worse results for SCHIP. I'm glad to see this extension.

   On the Military Quality of Life bill, I think we have had that the second longest, the Homeland bill, and then the Military Quality of Life has been here about a month, and that bill has contained substantial increases for veterans and for military personnel and their families for a long time. This year I think those increases amount to $18.5 million a day, and I just advance the thought that the sooner we can get that bill finalized, a bill that all Republicans in the House voted for, a bill that all Democrats in the House voted for, they can begin to benefit from those new changes and new benefits. All four of the bills are important, but that bill, I think, particularly is a bill that has an easy path to a moment when veterans and people currently in the military would benefit from the changes in that bill. So whether it is Homeland or Military Quality of Life or the other two bills sent over, I would be eager to see us move forward on those, but particularly on the Military Quality of Life bill.

   On MILCON for several years now, whether it was health care to retirees, starting a formula that ended the post-Civil War concurrent receipt problem, we have come together and passed good legislation, as I think we did this year, and this is a bill that had virtual unanimity. I am not sure that anybody voted against this bill. I would hope to get it done. I would hope to get all of our work done, and get it done in a way that we talk to each other, that gets a product on the President's desk that he can sign that we are all able to work together on and get done. 
   I would also like to see that happen on the Child Health Insurance Program bill. We believe that there is room for us in that discussion, and hope to be able to get there. I would tell my good friend as the whip on this side, I believe whether it would have been yesterday or Monday or 2 weeks from yesterday, we will sustain that veto, but we want to do that in a way that either now or later gets us in that discussion so that we continue this important program so that it works best for kids who don't have access to health care.

   On one more appropriations topic, two comments made this week by Chairman Obey, and I was interested in more information from the gentleman. One was that we won't do any supplemental funding for our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq this year, and I believe he may have said ``and potentially not next year,'' and then the other was the question raised by him of having an income tax surcharge placed on people who pay the income tax to the tune of about $150 billion.

   I come in support of my friend from Colorado's amendment that would reduce this by one-half of 1 percent below the spending levels of last year. 
   Over the last 6 months, the new majority has passed or paved the way for $103.5 billion of increased spending. I  guess actually, to be technically correct, it's $103.4 billion. While $0.1 billion may not matter here, it sure matters in America. $103.4 billion in new spending. 
   We have already enacted over a $6 billion increase in the continuing resolution for this year. We added $17 billion in unrequested funding to spend in the supplemental for this year. And now we're beginning this process of moving toward the additional $80.3 billion added to spending on this year's budget. 
   $100 billion is a huge amount of money. Today we're considering the Interior and Environment appropriations bill that really makes a good portion of that increase happen right here. This bill increases spending by almost 5 percent over last year's level, $1.2 billion of new spending. 
   And here, if you look at this spending thermometer, we're halfway up to what may be the taxpayer's boiling point. Somebody has to pay the bill. Somebody has to produce the revenue. Some American family is going to have to have a little less take-home pay because government wanted just a little bit more here, a little bit more there, a little bit more everywhere else. 
   And all my good friend from Colorado's amendment does is say, let's reduce spending here by one-half of 1 percent. Let's reduce spending by $138 million and still see if we can't do the things that need to be done in this appropriations bill in the right way. If you add this increase to the increases already proposed and passed over the past 2 weeks, we're spending $23.8 billion more than last year. 
   I rise in strong support of this amendment. I respect both the chairman and the ranking member of the committee and believe that they've done a good job with this bill, but I believe you could do that same job, I think you could do the same job, produce the same results with asking the American taxpayers not to have to carry a burden of 4 1/2 percent new spending in this part of the budget. And so I strongly recommend that we take this, what may seem like a slight reduction here, but when families have to start paying that $138 million in additional taxes, it's a big deal for American families. It should be a big deal for us.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chairman, I would like to inquire of my friends, the chairman and the ranking member, whether they are willing to work with me going forward on a solution for two broadcasters that cover the Joplin, Missouri, Pittsburgh, Kansas, broadcast area. This includes a significant portion of my district. 
   Due to the forthcoming digital transition, which Congress has already authorized for early 2009, the channel allocation assigned to KFJX, a local FOX affiliate, is likely to be shared with emergency first responders. This could result in significant service disruptions for both the station and the first responders. Another local station, CBS affiliate KOAM, has offered to make available spare spectrum for KFJX's use after the transition, which should provide a solution to the problem. 
   Unfortunately, due to the fact that one of these stations, KFJX commenced operations after the FCC issued viable digital channels for all existing broadcasters, at this point the FCC believes it is unable to make the proposed change without congressional intervention. I would like to work with my friends in order to fix this problem as this bill works its way through the process.

   Mr. BLUNT. I will say to my friend, I appreciate your concern about this. I would also say the rules provide for this kind of session. Many Members of the House, more Members in the majority than the minority were here when we had a secret session before when we talked about implementing legislation of the Panama Canal Zone or Cuba and other Communist block countries' involvement in Nicaragua.  
   I actually think that the debate that we are entering into this week is at a high level of security for the country. I believe I will bring information to the secret session that some Members are aware of but most are not. I also think that by the definition of the mutual agreement that we would divide the time, that I am only bringing part of the discussion. I certainly can't suggest what will happen in the questions, comments, and concerns that will come from the other side. So at least 30 minutes of the hour, I also have no idea what will be said in that, but I thought that was a fair way to divide the hour that I could at least ask for to control on my own under the rules with none of the restrictions the gentleman has suggested, and a majority of the Members of the House can either decide to do that or not. 
   And I appreciate the Speaker and the leader trying to work in this important issue to create an environment where we can talk about topics that we could not otherwise talk about. I am also sure, as my friend from California suggested, that some of the things that will be talked about very likely can and will be talked about later in the week, because they will be related to a secret topic but not secret in nature. You just can't discuss them as having been discussed as part of this secret session. You just discuss them as you would if we hadn't had the secret session that the rules clearly allow for. 
   And again, the most times these rules were exercised in the history of the Congress was not in the 1820s or 1830s. It was in the 1970s and the 1980s. And many Members of the majority were here during that time and participated in those sessions. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. BLUNT. I think I am in agreement with the parameters the gentleman has suggested. I also understand that when you raise those topics, you have perhaps a fuller exchange of ideas, but certainly you can't control what the exchange of ideas will be in the hour that we would mutually agree to give ourselves for this topic. And I believe the topic is every bit as important as implementing legislation for the Panama Canal Zone or other things that this has been used for in the past. And I frankly think the topic is of supreme importance to the security of the country. 
   And that is why I was prepared to make the request, but also prepared not to make the request with, my discussions with the majority leader and the Speaker about a way that we could mutually agree how to divide the time, how to establish rules that go beyond the rule that I would have been entitled to ask for, but perhaps not as far as being able to prove that we wouldn't talk about anything in that hour that wasn't of a secret nature. And I would thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. BLUNT. I think it would be my obligation, even though I haven't actually moved to do so based on our discussions, to bring information and communicate information that is confidential and that I believe ought to be kept secret at this time. I will also remind my colleagues that many of them in September of 2006 voted to go into secret session, and we didn't go into secret session that day. I am pleased that we appear to be moving in that direction. But there is a time that the rules call for when you are in a situation where the national security of the country is important, and there is much of the information that reaches a secret level that could be discussed in a secret session that conclusions have been drawn from and can be drawn from, that my belief is we would benefit from that discussion.

We worked with the majority to try to get the budget out of the way. It is my impression we were going to be here on Friday anyway. Maybe others had better knowledge of plane reservations than I did, but I think we are here on Friday. 
   I think the Friday work we would do is critically important, and my view is that this discussion adds to the knowledge that the Members will have as we have the debate on the bill tomorrow. Of course, I would much prefer we were voting on the Senate bill tomorrow, a bill that could go to the President; but I don't control that either, not being in the majority.

   I would say that every knowledge I have would indicate that our Intelligence Committees have seen the information, and that does not preclude moving to secret session to share information with other Members. I appreciate what some other Members have said about the difficulty of remembering what's secret and what's not, because those of us who have the obligation or the clearance level to look at this information have to do that. 
   I think the information we will bring to the floor will not be confusing to the Members but enlightening to the Members, and that's why I propose that we will move for a secret session later in the day if this UC is not agreed to.

   This is a bill that goes well beyond the information that most Members would normally have. I think the secret session will be helpful to the Members, or I wouldn't have said early today that I would ask for it. The information that I have, I believe, will be information that, in my opinion, has been available to the Members with the security clearance that allows them to normally see this information. 
   The Intelligence Committee would already know the kinds of things that I would intend to discuss this evening.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. I would say it is not intended for that but, in fact, to further amplify our ability to have that discussion tomorrow as we thoughtfully reflect on information. You couldn't talk about the information but you could talk about your reflections on things that you now know other Members are discussing. I think it helps that. 
   In terms of FISA, the rule allows for 20 minutes to the entire Intelligence Committee to discuss this issue and 40 minutes for Judiciary. 
   I just think this provides for a fuller moment for the Members to think about, talk about, and discuss some specific information at the secret level that otherwise would not have a chance to be discussed before we move forward with this vote tomorrow.

   Mr. BLUNT. I would just say obviously some Members were here and others were not when we had these sessions, five times since 1825, or three times since 1979, depending on how you want to use those numbers. My understanding is that you constantly in your efforts with the information you have as a member of the Judiciary Committee know where that line is. And you can't refer to the secret session, although you can clearly refer to any information that happened to be discussed there that was generally available before that session. You just don't say that it came out of the secret session. And the gentlelady does that with frequency based on her level of current clearance, and you know that line better than most Members of the House do and how to do that. 
   This would be the same kind of source of information that you would use in your other access, and it is a secret session under the rules on the basis that the rules then provide that what is there is not later to be discussed.

   Mr. BLUNT. I would say to my friend that it is not a political ploy. I would also say that beginning in 1978 when we passed actually the first Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, we set a new structure in place where the House of Representatives took more responsibility for intelligence information in the country. 
   And we can talk about how many times we have done this since 1825 or whatever, but three times, and certainly three times after the House decided in 1978 to take more responsibility for the intelligence issues in the country, we had a discussion that I thought was possible to have here today. 
   The bar certainly, I understand why my friends would want to raise the bar, but I have information that has been available to the Intelligence Committee that I thought the Members that have not seen that information would benefit from talking about. 
   I haven't suggested it is at the top secret level. I haven't suggested it is at the program level. I have said it is at the secret level. That kind of information is important to discuss, I think, and should not be discussed in a general session, but also does not rise to  the kinds of things that even in a secret session of the whole House I don't think should be discussed. 
   You know, the suggestion that somehow here the bar is that if the Member doesn't bring information that the entire country should know, the very future of the country, the essence of the country, rests on, that is not the determination of either a secret level of intelligence or a secret session. 
   Nor in saying to my good friend, the majority leader, I would be glad to discuss this for an hour, this topic generally, based on information that I think would be important for all of the Members to talk about. Many of the Members have not seen this. It is information I think would be helpful.     
   I certainly can't control the discussion of the hour, the 30 minutes that I've said I'd be more than happy for the majority to have. I hope we'd both try to be positive here in creating a discussion of items on an issue that, after all, does relate to some of the most sensitive techniques and procedures in our country. 
   I'm not going to talk about the highly classified parts of the program. I'm not going to talk about the top secret parts of the program that the chairman and the ranking member and others, including the majority leader and I am aware of. But I did have some information that I thought would help the debate that rose to the secret level that all of the Members otherwise would not hear.

   Mr. BLUNT. I would just say to my friend that the information that I had hoped we would discuss today and still hope we will be able to discuss today is not, is information that most of the Members do not have and have not had access to. And I think our respect for each other as we approach this important decision would indicate that a further discussion, and my view was a discussion that could not be had because of the nature of some of the implications of what we do in an open session, would benefit the debate and the final decision at whatever point that decision will be made. 
   We do know tomorrow when we leave, the Senate's leaving and there will be no decision made that becomes law this week. But my thought was that all of the Members would benefit from a discussion based on information at a level that could not be disclosed in full debate and a discussion that I hoped would actually see the Members respond with appreciation for each other and our ability to talk about one or two items that were secret and what those items might mean, rather than say, Did that rise to the level of our time? 
   I don't know what all Members had planned to do tonight, but I suspect that you could argue, if you wanted to, that that discussion will lead, will be well worth the time. I also suspect if you don't want to, you could argue that it doesn't. But my intention was not to create animus among the Members, but to try to create an opportunity where all of our Members, as they have this ongoing discussion about foreign intelligence, have just a little broader window. I think it's important we all understand. 
   I'm not proposing we open the entire window. I'm not proposing that we go to levels that we probably even among 431 of us who respect each other would want to go to. I thought it would be helpful. We've already debated whether to have this discussion far longer than I had anticipated the discussion taking. But I respect the Member's concern about something that we've only done three times in 30 years, haven't done very many times in the history of the Congress, and we may decide that the expectation of this discussion becomes so high that no Member would ever even consider saying, you know, I saw something here that I think we, it is truly secret so I can't talk about it in the full session. I think we should discuss it in a bigger session. 
   But if Members begin to think that that has to be that somebody has the plans, and we didn't know it, to nuclear weapons before it's worth having that discussion, we'll never have that discussion. That's not what I'm proposing at all, nor was I anticipating  setting any kind of condition that my friends would have a problem with. I truly believe, after months of looking at this issue, that if the Members understood, even at the entry level, some of the problems it creates not to have a program in place that deals with these problems, the Members would reach a different conclusion. It may turn out that I am wrong on that, and I may take the advice of others who were here 30 years ago when we had three of these and decide this is never worth advancing again to my colleagues; but could we have a discussion in private about things that we can only discuss in private. 
   The option here is to discuss it in private or not to discuss it at all. And if my friends want to set a level of that discussion so high that if a Member walks out of here and says, well, the world wouldn't have survived without that session, we're never going to have a session where any more of us know the secret level items available to the Congress than know those items right now. 
   I was trying to be expansive in my sense of this discussion, rather than restrictive. By the end of the day, I'm beginning to think that may have been a mistake, but I'm still optimistic that we can have a discussion that the Members will think, you know, I don't know what I intended to do with the hour tonight, but that was actually as valuable as whatever it was I expected to do. And I would hope that would be the decision the Members would make, was this a more valuable hour for me as I looked to the future of these programs than the hour I might have spent doing whatever you would have been doing if you hadn't been here as Members of Congress talking about things that, if they're going to be talked about, can only be talked about in this way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the budget he brings to the floor. I think it's clear, looking at that budget, that the specific cuts that have just been suggested don't have to be the cuts that are made. That's up to those committees. 
   Now, I personally, as a former university president, would not go to student loans as the first thing to look at of all of the things that are in the Education and Labor Committee to decide what the Federal Government's doing that it could be doing better. This is a budget that's willing to take that kind of responsibility. This is a budget, a budget that's being presented by Mr. Ryan, that's willing to look at the things that otherwise will overwhelm us in the future. 
   The mandatory spending in the Federal Government is going to be overwhelming if it is not dealt with. This budget deals with it. I had people yesterday, reporters, asking, well, how could you slow the growth of these mandatory programs from 5.2 percent to 3.8 percent? That would be $400 billion over 5 years.     
   Now, the key is slow the growth. The other key is they would still grow by 3.8 percent. And the final key is we're going to have to look at these programs and not just think about them in terms of whether we care based on how much money we spend, but whether we care based on the service we provide. 
   And we can look at these programs, as this budget anticipates we will, in a way that makes us look at health care so that people have more rights to have choices in health care, so they have more rights to their information in health care. We can look at health care. We can look at Social Security. We can look at things that provide a better service in a better way for taxpayers and recipients. 
   Just simply not exceeding inflation as our goal doesn't mean we're going to provide worse service. It means we're going to really look at these programs seriously. This budget has the courage to do that. I rise in support of it and hope that my colleagues will join me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lewis for yielding. 
   All I can say, Mr. Speaker, is that it is about time that we got this job done. Three and a half months to respond to our troops and to their families is too long. 
   Frankly, I think if we had been interested in getting this job done, most of us could have taken out a yellow legal pad and written 30 or 60 or maybe even as much as 90 days ago what the House would finally vote on that would solve this impasse in supporting our troops. 
   While we have let this process drag on, the military has had to cancel noncritical contracts, defer home station unit training activities, defer any nonabsolutely critical orders for spare parts, defer maintenance, put off summer programs that have affected spouses and families while military personnel were assigned to Iraq, and that is unfortunate. 
   What is fortunate is that we have come up with a bill that funds the needs of the troops and sets benchmarks for the Iraqis. House Republicans have been saying since January this bill needs to include benchmarks for the Iraqis. I have been saying almost since that time those benchmarks need to have consequences. We have done that in this bill, and that is a good thing. We are requiring the Iraqis to step up and do their part of the job. 
   Equitable distribution of oil resources is something that needs to happen if this country is going to achieve stability. Establishing a High Electoral Commission and establishing a deadline for regional elections is something that we have been talking about since January that tonight we are going to say the Iraqis have to do or there are consequences. Militia disarmament is important here, as it is also important, as you deal with the military, not to undermine the military or change military leadership if they are doing the job that needs to be done in ending sectarian violence. Protecting minority political parties in Iraq is something that we are going to be monitoring. The Iraqis have to come up with the brigades that they need to be part of the operation that General Petraeus is leading. The President has to certify these items. All these are things that many in this House have been talking about for most of the 109 days this debate has been dragging on. 
   It is time to bring this debate to an end. It is time to support the troops. It is time to support their families and do the job that the Congress needs to do rather than trying to figure out the job that the commanders in the field need to do. They need to do what is necessary to be successful. This is a step in giving them the tools to do that and giving the Iraqi Government the incentive to be who they are supposed to be.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding. I am pleased to be here as a part of this debate. 
   I continue to hear as these debates go on that somehow these increases are not real increases, and I continue to be mystified by that. I think if my good friend from Georgia's amendment was approved, and I voted for his cutting amendment on each of these bills, if that amendment was approved, we would still have an increase in this bill of a little over 5 percent. 
   Now, I don't know how that calculates out to not an increase, but I am continuing to try to figure out how that is not an increase. I do know that that increase of 5 percent anywhere that I talk to Americans is an increase. And I know, more importantly, in the course of today and tomorrow that what my friend from Georgia is suggesting is that if we let this one appropriations bill grow by 5 percent, as we move on later into the discussion of the farm bill, we would have saved enough money in this 1.4 percent cut not to have a tax increase that puts the farm bill in jeopardy. 
   The farm bill is a bill that I voted for in the past and hope to vote for this year, but it is a bill that doesn't have to include a tax increase. But the $7.5 billion over 10 years that the farm bill needs could be gained right here if we would save $750 million of the increase in this bill. 
   I just urge my colleagues to look at what we are doing here, realize that we are jeopardizing important things by moving forward in a way that spends more money than we have to spend this year. 
   Most of these programs are good programs. I was a college president for 4 years. I believe in college education, in everybody having one. I don't believe that the reality is as stark as our friends on the other side would suggest. I believe a 5 percent increase used wisely would make all of these programs work effectively and for the American people, and we would be making the decisions we need to make for the other things we need to do. 
   I support this amendment.

   On the DOD authorization bill that we passed by working together this week to solve a problem, does the majority leader have any sense as to whether that bill that we sent over originally will be back on the floor at any time, or if there will be any provisions? I have heard some discussion that there might be those among our Members who would like to vote on just the passage that created a problem, and I am wondering if you have any thoughts on how to deal with that bill.

Certainly it is a debate that we could have, but it does seem to me that we have already reached a bipartisan consensus on that, and we may or may not want to pursue that. But I had heard those same things and wanted to ask in that regard.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for that. I believe I understand the point that you just made that the procedure there certainly was a procedure that, frankly, we could have spent a lot of time debating. By doing that, we could have slowed down this pay increase, and I think we wisely did not do that. 
   I suppose that if the greater issue of individuals that were harmed by the Saddam Hussein regime comes to the floor, we can debate that at the time. And I just would suggest right now, if there was some way to reach the personal or family assets of Saddam Hussein, that is one thing. I think we hamper the efforts of this new government if we continue to hold the new government responsible for whatever bad things a government did that was virtually universally held in the lowest possible regard by the Congress. And I think we are universally glad that government is gone, no matter how we feel about the other issues in Iraq. I think that is really the point at the end of this one part of that debate. The government is gone. I suppose we can debate that. I think the arrangement we made in the bill handles other countries appropriately and also gives the President the proper waiver authority for dealing with this new situation in Iraq. But I suppose today is also not the day to debate that, unless my friend wants to comment on that.

   Also, I have one question the gentleman might have information on. In the conference on the 9/11 bill earlier this week, it appeared that the protection that the House had added for liability in what was called the John Doe action, where if you suggest someone you think is pursuing a dangerous course of action, you turn them in, then you are personally held liable, we had some protections added to our bill on that. I am told that the chairman of the conference, a member of the other body, has now said that he believes those protections would be germane, and if they are germane, we would hope that we would continue to see an argument in favor of that. But I wonder if the leader has any information on that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for bringing this amendment to the floor. 
   I'd actually thought, based on the other things I was doing today, that the case was being well-made that a $7 billion increase is an increase. And I didn't plan to come to the floor this afternoon. I had a number of other things I was working on that I thought were important. I was watching the debate and assuming that the case was being well-made until I heard in the last debate that a 4.3 percent increase was a cut. And I was so stunned by that, a 4.3 percent increase was a cut, a six-something billion dollar increase of the $7 billion that the majority hopes to increase was a cut, that I decided I'd come to the floor for a minute, and I've been amazed on the floor at what I've heard. 
   I've heard the gentleman just ask a series of questions about the Abandoned Infants Assistance Program that's the same funding as last year's level; the community-based child abuse program, prevention program, that's the same funding as last year's level; adoption opportunities that I believe I heard were below last year's level. 
   And I'm not asking the gentleman specifically this question, but I'm asking myself this question: why is that? Why is that that Abandoned Infants Assistance could be funded at last year's level and somehow that's appropriate? Is it less important than it was last year? Is it less important than the many unauthorized things that this bill funds for the first time ever? Why is it that we're not doing more, as the past Congress always tried to do more, in IDEA? Why is it that NIH, in the debate we heard yesterday, the National Institutes of Health, didn't deserve the funding that the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee found a funding source for for that to be raised? Why is it, if inflation is a factor, that we don't care at least at an inflationary level about Abandoned Infant Assistance or we don't care at least at an inflationary level about community-based child abuse prevention? 
   The gentleman from California is saying let's just cut this by one-quarter of 1 percent, one-quarter of 1 percent, a growth of still almost $7 billion, but instead, we're funding the unauthorized Full Service Schools Act. Now, why are we funding the unauthorized Full Service Schools Act, but we can't find enough money to keep adoption opportunities at at least last year's level? I'm amazed by what I've heard here on the floor. 
   Why is it we're funding the unauthorized sexual education program? Why is it that grants to local education that could be funded at $25 billion, because that's what the Congress in the past says we could allow, are only funded at $14.4 billion? 
   Part of the problem here is, once again, we're authorizing on an appropriations bill. We're trying to come up with new programs instead of fulfill the promise of the last programs. IDEA took major growth in funding in the last 10 years, but we haven't sustained that level in this bill because we're trying to fund new things. 
   And I just close by saying that every American knows that $7 billion is an increase and 4.9 percent is an increase, as was 4.3, as is 4.4.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This is clearly a critical debate. The spirit of the chairmen, Chairman Reyes and Chairman Conyers both, are exactly right in our need to solve this. My concern is that we're not in a place where we're about to solve it yet. The very worst thing I actually think we could do is pass a bill, have the Senate pass a separate bill, all go home and say we tried to solve this problem and didn't get it solved. 
   I'm most concerned, in this effort to get two-thirds of the Members to agree, that the Director of National Intelligence thinks this bill isn't the right bill and apparently our friends on the other side of the building are not in agreement yet that this is the right bill. I just say, whatever we do, let's not cast a vote here only so we can say we did something. Let's figure out how to do something that exactly makes a difference. Let's figure out how to do something that gets signed into law.  Let's figure out how to do something so that these enemies of ours, truly we're doing everything we can to listen to what they say, to try to track their actions, to try to anticipate what they're going to do. 
   This is clearly a very dangerous time for the country and the world. It's easier to follow up on the activities under our law of organized crime or even white collar crime than it is at this moment to follow up on the activities of our enemies in the terrorist camps of the world. 
   I hope, Madam Speaker, that we don't just take a vote for the sake of having a vote and, if this bill does fail, we all continue to work for however long is necessary to arrive at an agreement in this building that winds up with a bill on the President's desk that winds up with our intelligence agencies doing everything they can.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, let me say when we left here last night, I have left the House frustrated, I have left the House encouraged, I have left the House proud, I have left the House not so proud. I have never the House ashamed before. 
   Now what I just heard here this morning, I don't agree with it, the idea that somehow we have massively violated the traditions of the House and the only penalty is we will be more careful in the future. 
   I decided for 4 years when that vote would quit as the whip. That was my job. We never stopped the vote until the Clerk handed the person the piece of paper that said what the vote was, and the vote on the piece of paper was 215-213. 
   The remedy for the House that would solve this problem is to let the vote stand. A majority of this House voted that illegal immigrants would not receive these benefits. That is what the vote was about. All you've got to do is go back to committee, amend the bill and come back to the floor. 
   You lost the vote. I didn't hit the gavel. I didn't speak over the Clerk who was trying to read the vote. The Chair did. The Chair decided the vote was over. It doesn't matter what that board says. What matters is what the tally was. 
   A week of violations of the principles of the House culminated last night in such an excessive way that Republicans walked off the floor, and it was a deserved walkout. And I am ashamed of the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - August 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank Mr. Boehner for yielding; and I also thank my good friend, the majority leader, for being willing to accept this effort to look at the standards of how we do our business in the House. 
   In fact, I think many of my friends on our side, and obviously your side as well, want to be sure that the work of the House is done in a way that the American people can be proud of. 
   I think a lot of the problem that we saw last night, to our side, at least, was another indication of deciding that the normal behavior and the normal rules of the House may not apply any more. Last night's vote, I see some of my friends near the front of their House shaking their head, last night's vote is the only vote I am aware of in the House of Representatives in the 10 years and few months that I have been here that the Clerk did not write down a number which is the official end of the vote and hand it to the Speaker. 
   The Speaker, in fact, is talking over the Clerk while the Clerk is trying to announce votes are being changed. 
   If any Member on that side or our side, either one, has ever seen a time in the House when a vote was announced or sees one later today where the paper wasn't filled out and you wait for that paper, I would like to know when that was. 
   You know, as the whip of the House for the last 4 years, the previous two Congresses, I remember many times thinking that I wanted the vote over; and I remember many times thinking the Clerk is writing too slow, the Clerk is turning around too slow, the Speaker is reading the paper too slow, but I don't remember it ever not happening. 
   If that had happened, we would not have this problem. The vote on the board has nothing to do with the official tally. The Clerk keeps the official tally. 
   During that vote, someone said to the Parliamentarian, the Parliamentarians don't run the House, the majority does. Well, that's right. The Parliamentarians don't run the House. But the Parliamentarians provide the continuity of how the House is always run. 
   This is not the great legislative body it is because every Congress decides how they are going to run things. This isn't the great legislative body it is because those of us who, I think, if 78,000 votes in the entire country would have changed would be in the majority or the minority that we have no rights here. This is not the great legislative body it is because the majority just gets to decide. 
   Now, there are other instances in recent days when we believe the Parliamentarian gave other advice than was taken. I don't want to create a problem for the Parliamentarian. But I do know that one night this week in debate Members of the House were told that their comments were irrelevant. Now, they might not have been the best comments in the world, they might not have been the most on-target comments in the world, but I never remember anybody in the chair ever before ruling that a Member's comments were irrelevant. 
   We are not irrelevant here. Just because we are in the minority does not mean we are irrelevant. Just because we have a small difference between our numbers and your numbers doesn't mean we are irrelevant. That doesn't mean that the Speaker can decide to end the votes when they want to, no matter what the traditions have been of the House. 
   It does mean, when the Speaker ends the vote, whatever the official tally is at that moment, which, by the way, is what the Clerk would write down, should be the official tally. 
   That's why, I may not be quite to the level of outrage, but that's why I am offended by how that process worked. I have never seen it happen before; I hope to never see it happen again. 
   If it had happened in the right way, we wouldn't be having this discussion right now. But maybe this discussion also allows us to look at our relationships with each other, our relationship with the Parliamentarian, the job of the Speaker in the chair is to create fairness. It's not to ensure that everything goes so that one side is happy and the other side is not. 
   I welcome the acceptance of my friend Mr. Boehner's resolution by the majority leader and, I assume, the majority. I look forward to the report. I hope this creates a moment when we all begin to think about what we are doing here and how we are doing it and the obligations we owed each other. 
   This is not a one-sided street. I understand that. Respect for each other, appreciation for each other, respect for the way business has been done here for a long time is an important part of what we all need to work to achieve, and hopefully this helps get that done.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the law in place today, the law that we brought up to today's technical standards in August, is essentially the law that the Congress passed in 1978, a Congress that had a majority of Democrats in it. Jimmy Carter, President Carter, signed that bill, and it has worked for 30 years now. 
   The way this bill is drafted, the administration would be forced to seek warrants, as Mr. Smith just said, for foreign targets in case they might call the United States. If Osama bin Laden calls the United States, we should know it. If Osama bin Laden calls and it turns out to be a call that didn't matter, there are ways to minimize that. In all likelihood, if Osama bin Laden called, it shouldn't be a matter that we shouldn't know about. If he calls to order a pizza and says ``deliver the pizza to cave 56 in Bora Bora,'' that is something we ought to know at that minute. We should not have to go to court to monitor these calls, just in case they call somebody in the United States. 
   Granting what in essence is de facto fourth amendment constitutional rights to noncitizens who are not in this country makes no sense at all. It is not the right direction. We need a permanent fix. 
   This bill does not contain, as my good friend Mr. Conyers said, retroactive liability. We need to have liability for those companies that stepped up after 9/11 and immediately helped the country begin to monitor the things we needed to monitor. We still don't clarify in this bill what our intelligence agencies do. 
   This does not solve any problems. It creates problems. When you have a system that has worked in one way, and effectively, for 30 years, there is no reason to change that system. This bill makes needless, dangerous changes. 
   I hope we vote ``no'' on this bill today, and get down, as we did in late July, to the reality of what we have to do to defend the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I may move to strike the last word as I run through the time here, if I do. 
   I am grateful to the gentleman for bringing this amendment. I think it is exactly the kind of fiscal responsibility that many of us on both sides of the aisle talked about during our campaigns. It is an important thing to have before the Congress. 
   We have talked about PAYGO for taxes, but this is really PAYGO for spending. This is trying to reprioritize the spending of the Federal Government, to look at spending we are doing now as the first way to pay for spending we should be doing in the future. 
   I haven't heard anything in the debate today that doesn't suggest that we need to move forward with the bill that the chairman has brought to the floor, that the committee has brought to the floor, that there is a lot of interest in amending this bill in ways that make it better. But there is no real discussion that the underlying bill doesn't do the kinds of things we need to be looking for as we move toward energy independence. 
   Millions and billions of dollars, however, are authorized with no real requirement for fiscal discipline. In one of the votes we have taken this year in the early bills, the 6 for '06, the implementation of the 9/11 Commission, when we finally weeks after the vote got the cost estimate of the vote, the cost estimate was an estimate of $30-or-so billion over 5 years. And so we need to be sure that we are doing things that make sense with the people's money. 
   I think President Reagan, who would have been 96 this week had he lived, said that a government has never voluntarily reduced its size. 
   One of the ways we can at least maintain the size of the government is, we look at new and worthy things to suggest that the size of the government would not grow just because the needs of the government are changing.     
   In this bill we ask for the authorization----

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   This legislation authorizes $10 billion in spending to the EPA. And, frankly, the EPA spends a lot of money that could be spent in different ways. In the EPA budget last year $47,459,367 was spent in projects in foreign countries. I would suggest, in supporting the gentleman's amendment, that probably you could find $10 million there and, if you couldn't find it there, you could find it somewhere else. 
   Currently, the EPA has paid for things that establish a coal bed methane clearinghouse in the People's Republic of China or developing or producing a television documentary in China, in Chinese, on mercury pollution or improving environmental monitoring quality and capacity in the Ukraine. They may all be good things, but none of them as important to American taxpayers as the proposal today. This proposal would allow this bill to move forward, but require the EPA to find the $10 million for this new program by evaluating the value to the American people and the American taxpayer of their old program. 
   I think the money that is there to do this can be found elsewhere. I particularly am grateful to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam) for bringing this to the floor as one of our first opportunities to talk about PAYGO for spending. 
   If we are going to do things that meet the new priorities of the country, it is also an opportunity every time to look at the current spending and to reprioritize what the Federal Government has been doing.

   Mr. BLUNT. Of course, I hope that as you grapple with this, you will grapple toward the determination of input into this important debate. I believe, as you do, it is a critically important debate. This is an important issue. You and I have been together to Iraq twice. We both have taken this issue very seriously. We watched and the American people have watched the debate on the other side of this building this week, where the whole process has come to a halt because of the unwillingness of that body to move forward without having options on the table; and even in that debate, the majority offered at least one alternative opportunity to the minority. 
   And that was not acceptable to that minority on that side of the building. I would hope on this side of the building that at least we would get the offer that if you are working on the other side of the building, you walked away from, which would be one opportunity to express another view. 
   We are going to have 3 full days of debate. The gentleman said some of them could very well last as long as midnight.     
   That is enough time to consider more than one point of view and have at least two points of view heard. And I heard the gentleman early in the week; I heard him say today, you are still grappling with that. And I would just encourage you to do your best to try to create the opportunity for this issue to be debated in the fullest possible way at this moment and move on with that. 
   I would also like to ask, with February 15 being the last day for the current continuing resolution to be in effect, it seems to me possible at least that the Senate is not going to deal  with the bill by the end of the week. Do we have any plans as to how to deal with that issue? Or do you have any information that I don't have that would suggest that it is likely that the Senate will have agreed to a bill that we can agree to? 
   One option, obviously, would be agree to the bill that the House sent over. But I am interested in what happens on Friday, and between now and Friday that might settle that also, that important issue as well. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   The re-voting issue surprised me because when we re-voted those amendments that had been passed in the House, on one amendment, 57 people changed their mind between the vote and the re-vote. And on another one, 25 people changed their mind. I had always assumed there was more consistency in the voting than that, but I guess 30 minutes can make a big difference in how that goes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding, I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the time, and I thank the gentleman for the comments that he's already made. 
   I certainly agree with the chairman of the committee that in 1969, certainly a long time before I came to Congress, and there are a few Members here who were here then. I think the chairman was here. He said this was a bad idea. It was a bad idea in 1969. It was a bad idea in 1993 when the alternative minimum tax was made worse. It was a really bad decision in 1999 when the Congress voted to eliminate the alternative minimum tax and a Presidential veto prevented that from happening. This is an unfair tax. Everything that's been said about this tax today by both sides I believe is accurate.     
   Now 23 million more taxpayers are on the edge of this unfair tax and we are figuring out how to tax more people to somehow equal out this unfairness. I think it's clear that a significant majority of this Congress knew last year that we wouldn't have wanted this to happen. But for some reason we still apparently wanted to commit to spend the money that would occur if it did happen. 
   So we are taking money we don't have today, this $50 billion or $70 billion, I think I am hearing two different numbers here, money we don't have today and assuming that we have got to replace it tomorrow to have not stepped backwards. This is money we did not collect this year. But we are saying we have to have this. This is what I see as a real twisted application of the PAYGO rule. 
   We are now spending also time we don't have on this issue because our friends on the other side of the building have said they're not going to let the major tax increase here be part of a final solution. So once again we are spending a day we don't have when we could be spending a day doing things like passing the military construction, military families, veterans bill that somehow got lost this week. It got pulled out of a bill by the Senate. We went ahead and passed the Labor-Health and Human Services bill and went to conference on two other appropriations bills, but we chose not to go to conference on the one that would help veterans and help military families and pass that bill today. Instead, we're passing a bill today and I guarantee you we will be back on this floor with a different solution that the Senate and the President will accept and doing this work at a time when this work matters.  
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. Let's get on with the work of not letting these 23 million new taxpayers be affected, but let's get this done rather than make another effort to just give a speech about how we can raise more taxes.

   On that issue, we went to conference this week on two different bills, and my impression was, based on the combination of the Military Construction and Veterans bill with Labor-HHS, that that veterans part of that bill was probably done. I'm wondering if the gentleman has any sense of how we can reinitiate a conference on that bill so that we can get the veterans and the military quality of life, military construction money passed.

And I would think since essentially it appears that bill has already been conferenced, since it was included with the Labor-HHS bill in conference, that it should be pretty easy to do and hope that we can do it. The President has announced he would sign that bill. The difference in this year's spending and last year's is about $18.5 million dollars a day, and I would hope we could get there. 
   On the trade agreement this week, I thought we had a significant bipartisan vote on the Peru Trade Agreement. There are three other agreements out there that have been negotiated, and I wonder if the leader has any sense of when we might be able to look toward any of those bills coming to the floor. 
   And I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate that. I'd also say that I was heartened by the good work that Chairman Rangel and Mr. McCrery and others did on the Peru agreement, and certainly, I think I want to continue to reach out to you and the chairman and others who'd like to get things done so these bills could come to the floor. 
   Colombia is the one that was negotiated next, and because of the Panama complication, it may even be more likely that that could come next. 
   I would be pleased to yield to Mr. Rangel for any thoughts he has on that topic.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I appreciate that. And I do know that the chairman has worked hard with the U.S. Trade Ambassador and others, and I'm appreciative of that. And the administration, as this process works, will decide whether to send those up, but I know that they will do that in significant consultation with the chairman and ranking member and, I hope, others in the leadership. And these are important discussions. 
   I thought we had a significant step in the right direction for our neighborhood this week. To have all of the leaders of both parties vote for a trade agreement was a good sign about the future of our relationships with Panama and, I hope, a good sign about how we approach more of these trade agreements. 
   The other question I had also relates just on the Armenian resolution. I know that a lot of things have happened in regard to that resolution. But I also know that the leader, 3 or 4 weeks ago, maybe it was 4 weeks ago, said that that resolution would be on the floor by November 16. I know it wasn't announced today. I wonder, has any decision been made on advancing that resolution? 
   And I would yield to my friend.

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate that. What I believe will be my last question, Mr. Leader, is on Tuesday, knowing this is the last week before there is a break, and we may not stay with the normal procedure, should we expect anything beyond suspension bills on Tuesday? Do you think there's any likelihood, not possibility, but any likelihood of a rule bill as early as Tuesday?

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for that information. 
   I'm looking here at what we're going to be talking about. I will have some questions about that. 
   Before I get to that, I would like to congratulate my friend on the great work he did on the legislation we passed both yesterday and today. Particularly the legislation today took a tremendous amount of effort on the majority leader's part to get that legislation to the floor. I'm hopeful that the Senate, before we leave for the Fourth of July, will pass this and get it to the President's desk. 
   I'm convinced that the country will be significantly safer because of the tools we've given the intelligence community. But I'm also convinced that we have done a lot to structure this process in a way that not only protects individual rights, but also requires the government to be more forthcoming with its rules and regulations. And both the leader and his staff did a great job on this. And I know personally because we've worked together on it, and spent days, hours and weeks trying to get to a bill that would come to the floor that would have a significant vote from the majority side. And virtually every Republican at the end of the day was able to be there, as we have been on these bills generally. 
   But I am grateful to you, and I will just point out that while we almost got a majority of the majority voting for this, there wasn't a majority of the majority. And that makes it harder for a leader. And that can be easily overlooked. But this is something where you had to work hard to do what you thought was the right thing for the country. And I'm grateful to you for it.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I thank the gentleman, and I certainly share his comments on our two principal staffers who have spent so much time on this. 
   But one of the things in this process that I was deeply appreciative of, and that you mentioned in your remarks today, was how great the entire staff was in coming together on very technical issues where every single word mattered. The staff on both sides of the aisle were in those rooms you and I were in--and many times we were not in the room--when they were working out the last technicalities of which word was the best word. With all of those involved, it made a big difference here as they do so often, but this is one of those moments where exactly what is done makes a big difference in both how we secure our country and in how we secure our liberties. I'm grateful to the staff for that. 
   On the Medicare bill that would come to the floor under suspension, as I believe I understood your announcement on Medicare physician rates, when would that bill be available? Will it be available?

   Mr. BLUNT. We've known that we were going to face this deadline for about 8 months now or for at least 6 months now. 
   As to the process there of going through suspension, I would just tell my friend that I think, on a suspension bill, if this has Medicaid cuts that hurt rural communities or that hurt minority seniors, as we believe some of the cuts in the CHAMP bill did, I would be prepared for this bill to fail on suspension. It might pass with a rule. I wouldn't know about that, but I would give some prediction here that a suspension bill that does those things as pay-fors to appropriately see that physicians are reimbursed but then to have a big debate on the House floor as to whether or not seniors--minority seniors and rural seniors--are disproportionately impacted would, in my opinion, lead to at least a veto-sustaining number on our side. 
   I'd yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. So I'm certainly hoping that we deal with this important issue of physician reimbursement. I wish we could have done it with a bill that would have been developed sometime in the last 6 months, but we have some concern about that and, I think, appropriately so. 
   We have a number of physicians on our side who understand this process much better than I do, and I think it's very important that we try to involve them in this process. We've actually got a number of proposals on our side, as you very well may have, too, none of which I've seen in any kind of legislative form. 
   I'd yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. My belief is that is largely not going to be dependent on the issue that solves the problem for physicians but on how that problem is solved. Of course, if two-thirds of the Members are not prepared to do it that way, that will not have gained any time. It will actually have lost time. We'll continue to talk, if you want to, on that. 
   I notice there is also a bill on energy that is potentially to be considered, and I wonder if that bill would be considered under a rule, and I would hope that it would be.

   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Hoekstra for yielding me this initial time that would have the otherwise gone to you. 
   I thank you, Mr. Hoekstra, Mr. Reyes and Mr. Smith, for bringing this important piece of legislation to the floor and for working so hard to see that it came to the floor. I would also like to say that I again appreciated the opportunity to work with my good friend Mr. Hoyer, as he spent so many hours and so much time on this. From his staff, Mariah Sixkiller; from my staff, Brian Diffel; Mr. Boehner's staff, Jen Stewart worked hard on this; Chris Donesa from Mr. Hoekstra's staff was indispensable in his work, as was Caroline Lynch from Mr. Smith's staff. And I got to know frankly and work with Jeremy Bash from Mr. Reyes' staff and Lou DeBaca from Mr. Conyers' staff, and appreciated the real positive contributions they bring to this process every day. 
   I would also like to suggest that two staffers of my colleague from Missouri, Mr. Bond, Louis Tucker, and Jack Livingston, spent lots of time and lots of productive work on this. 
   Madam Speaker, this represents a compromise, as Mr. Reyes just said, as Mr. Smith just said, that was forged with lots of hard work by lots of people. It accomplishes the goals of the intelligence community. There is no individualized court order for targeting foreign terrorists in foreign countries. There are protections here for communications providers that may have assisted the government. But, as Mr. Reyes just said, those protections will be determined by a court, not by this legislation. 
   We modernized the law to adapt to changes in technology since the 1978 FISA statute. The bill would accomplish all this while adding new protections and strengthening the individual liberties and privacy protections of Americans. 
   We also worked closely with the majority to reinforce the FISA Court's role in procedural certifications and reviews of administration policies, and we created some new obligations for the Attorney General to establish guidelines. 
   Madam Speaker, like yesterday's vote, this bill is an example of what we can do when we work together. I thank all those who worked so hard to get it to the floor today. I urge my colleagues to vote for it.

On the question I have asked now for the last few weeks about conferences on appropriations bills, I believe 1987 was the last year that the Congress hadn't passed a single appropriations bill by this time in October 1987, particularly on the Military Quality of Life bill that has been ready for some time. I am wondering if there is any chance that we could go to conference on that bill or any other appropriations bill in the near future.

   It still has been 20 years since we failed to get any bills done by October 25. Of these bills that are ready, I do hope we can figure out a way to move them, again, particularly on the Military Quality of Life bill for veterans and for the families of people serving today, and for military retirees, I think it's about $18.5 million a day of additional benefits that could have been going as of October 1, and I know I brought this up before, I don't mean to be offensive about it, but I really strongly feel that this is a bill that we could get on the President's desk and get started quickly.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that. Again, I'd suggest on the Military Quality of Life bill, I think the President said he's ready to sign that bill, even though it exceeds his request. And of course it would drive the average up dramatically of the passage of the other bill, since every Member of the House voted for it. But the other bills did get bipartisan support at some level. I do understand that. 
   I also understand that I think all the other bills, but one, probably had enough people voting against them to sustain a veto. But as the actions today would have been evidence of, the very fact the President says he's going to veto is not the ultimate impediment to us getting our work done and challenging him with that. 
   One of the announcements you made today was on the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. I wonder, could we begin to expect a vote then on the Peru Free Trade Agreement after Trade Adjustment Assistance is on the floor next week?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Madam Speaker, here we are again. It seems to be just the same act in the same play, the same time. 
   Why are we having this vote today? I really don't know. Many of our Members believe it's because the TV ads, the radio ads have already been bought in their districts, and if they didn't have this vote today somehow that money might be wasted. I don't know that I believe that. 
   Many of our Members believe we're having the vote on a day when seven Republicans from California can't be here to make our ``no'' votes on this bill appear to be less than they really are. In fact, I asked that this bill not be voted on today for that reason. 
   What I wonder is why we weren't allowed to see the bill. If this bill is such a great bill, if this bill solved these problems, what would have been the harm of seeing the bill? In fact, a lot of the debate today would have been a different debate if the bill would have been laid down last night and we'd have had the vote next Wednesday or next Thursday. 
   This idea that somehow we have to get it done before November 16 because that's the day that this extension ends doesn't make any sense to anybody. We're going to be here well beyond that. 
   Once again we go through this process where we're told we've checked the boxes, but then when you look at where the boxes have been checked, they really don't do the job. 
   We ought to get to poor kids first. When we get to kids at 300 percent of the level of poverty, that's 54 percent of all the families in America would have their kids have insurance through the government. 
   I've talked to several people in my district that say, I don't mind helping poor kids, but I'm really offended when I'm helping kids whose families make more than I do. I'm really offended as someone who has raised their family when I'm paying taxes to provide insurance for families who make $20,000 more than I do. 
   And the Congressional Budget Office believes that the verification standards aren't right yet. I think this is a step in that direction. 
   Let's get this bill right. Let's see the bill. Let's vote ``no'' today and get to work on a serious proposal.

   Yesterday, I spoke on the floor, and others did, in opposition to the FISA bill, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill, that was on the floor yesterday. We quit in the middle of that debate. I am wondering if the gentleman has any information on when that bill may come back to the floor or if you have any information that it wouldn't be coming back.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that information. We are very interested in that bill. 
   On the bill that we just voted on, a vote that would have been pretty easy to predict, I believe, 2 weeks ago, I noticed just this week that the Governor of New York said that he would be willing to accept new language in that bill that would eliminate his State's ability to cover families at over 400 percent of the poverty level. I would suggest that that is one of the compromises that would really be helpful, if we could eliminate that level that appears to only initially apply to the State of New York. Last week, when Mr. Hoyer and I discussed this, he suggested that if the veto was sustained, that his view was that we should have an opportunity to work together on a bill that could come to the House floor. And I am wondering if the gentleman has any information on how the majority intends to move forward now on that bill. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. BLUNT. I would particularly think that that would be the topic I just raised, where families of four could make up to $83,000 a year and still have their children insured by taxpayers, would be one of the areas that, if we could deal with that issue, that would be a significant step on the bill, maybe not the only step necessary. But if we could now get in a situation where we could do what the vast majority of the House said they wanted to do just a few weeks ago when we definitely went on record saying we don't want this State Child Insurance Program to go out of existence but we want to do what we can to be sure that it is meeting the real goals of the program.     
   That would be helpful. And any efforts that we can collectively make to where we work together on this would be, I think, helpful in reaching a conclusion. And I think this too: unfortunately, I don't think many minds were changed in the last 2 weeks, and we lost 2 weeks that we could have been talking. But that's behind us now, and I'm hoping we move forward. 
   The other major topic that I wanted to ask a question about today to my friend was on appropriations. I've been asking every week since we started the new fiscal year, or approached the new fiscal year, when we were going to have some bills on the floor or to go to conference, rather, on bills. On the Military Quality of Life bill, the Senate Democrats have been named to the conference. The Senate Republicans have been named to the conference. The House Republicans have been named to the conference. And I'm wondering if the gentleman has any sense of when we might actually see something now begin to happen on these appropriations bills. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I appreciate the gentleman's view on that. I am hopeful. I think we've got a handful of bills that have been approved now by both the House and the Senate, bills reported over to the House from the Senate; and my view is that we're beyond the time when we should have been reaching some conclusions on these bills, and urge the majority to work with the minority and find a way to get these bills done. 
   I think in the Mil Qual Veterans area there was a substantial increase. There's been an increase every year for the last dozen years. But a substantial increase to the tune of like $18.5 million a day in benefits to veterans and military families; and every day we let that go by just complicates the delivery of those services. And I hope we can move forward.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for the information he has provided. It does raise a number of questions, and I will try to keep them in mind as you answer them a few at a time. 
   One, I think it is only fair to say that while we did discuss these two issues, the last two bills you mentioned, it was only in moments before the colloquy, and I think our leader only received notice these things were coming up within a few minutes of coming to the floor. 
   So more notice, as the former minority whip would know, more notice is always a good thing. Particularly, my good friend, on these issues, issues that affect Members and their families, notice, appropriate hearings, and we did pass similar legislation on the issue of the access to pensions for people who had committed a felony, we passed that in the last session. It did go to committee. It had a chance to be amended. We debated it on the floor, but this is a new Congress with many Members who were not part of that process. 
   In the case of the last Congress, I believe that issue went to both House Administration and the Rules Committee and possibly the Committee on Government Reform before it came to the floor. I think you are telling me next week you anticipate only the Rules Committee would see and have a chance to look at this legislation before the floor, and even the Rules Committee ranking Republican is getting that notice as we are talking right now, that that important issue is coming up next week?

   Mr. BLUNT. I appreciate that information. I share your sense this is an important issue. We dealt with it on our side of the building in what I expect will be a highly similar way in the last Congress. I say that not to defend the idea that it is not going through committees this time but to suggest it is not a new idea. It is something that we have dealt with. I expect there to be a significantly bipartisan debate here, depending on what the legislation says. 
   I would say, however, to my friend that while we haven't been really passive about these first six bills that haven't had a chance to have amendments, haven't had a chance to have debate in committee, they were six things, some of which we had dealt with, but the six things that the majority talked about in the last election, and at some point the suggesting that this is such an important issue that we need to move forward without the regular progress begins to wear pretty thin on our side of the building and I think on the public generally. I would hope that we don't have many more of those instances. 
   Apparently the House Administration Committee will not have a chance in this Congress to look at the intricacies of the pension issue. 
   I know this week we brought a bill to the floor dealing with minimum wage and then find out that while this is supposed to be an expansive minimum wage proposal that includes everybody, whether they were ever included before or not, that American Samoa is somehow left out. I have a feeling that if that would have gone to committee, there is a great chance that would have been pointed out. I don't know if the majority intends to go back and put American Samoa in the minimum wage package or not. 
   My friend who has been here longer than I have loves this institution and knows better than anybody the benefit of regular order. I hope we are nearing the end of us being asked to accept the fact that we can't do regular order on this issue for some extraordinary reason. Both the Page Board issue and any misconduct by Members are critically important issues, but so is the opportunity for every Member of the 110th Congress to be involved at their committee level and every other level. 
   I might ask about that American Samoa question. Do we expect to see that oversight taken care of in upcoming legislation?

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that commitment to begin to move forward as quickly as possible. I look forward to the time when there is actually legislation on the floor that has  gone through a committee and had a chance to be amended and discussed before it got here. 
   I believe fewer than a handful of committees are actually organized at this point. None of the committees that had work on the floor this week have yet been organized to the point they have had a meeting. I would like to point that out. 
   The other thing, in waiving points of order, another issue of the regular order of the House, on every bill that came to the floor this week, the majority waived points of order on anything that was in the bill but maintained points of order on the one chance we had to say anything at all about the bill in an official way which was the motion to recommit. 
   Again, I hope we are getting to the point where the things that the majority has talked so much about, and PAYGO would be an example of that, won't continue to be waived in every rule waiving points of order on the bills that do come to the floor. 
   I yield to my friend to respond.

   Mr. BLUNT. I would say on the significant portions of those bills that we voted on in the last Congress and passed, virtually every Member of the majority then, the minority now, voted for 39 of the 41 9/11 provisions. We voted for increasing the minimum wage, though we thought with a more helpful balance, and we hope to continue to work for that balance so that the wage producer is not affected, the job creator, doesn't stop creating these important entry level jobs into the workforce. 
   I would also say, on the PAYGO issue, I believe in the 9/11 bill and perhaps in the other bills, but in the 9/11 bill, I think the authorization was more often than not such sums as necessary. I don't know how that doesn't trigger some thought about cost in the future. I do know we were told it would be at least 3 weeks before we could get a score on what the bill would cost. So whether it violated a PAYGO provision or not, we are 2 weeks and 5 days from knowing the answer to that question. 
   But I am expressing some of my concerns as we move forward. I do sympathize with the leader's job of having a schedule that works for Members, not only their events at home but their families at home.     
   As the year progresses, I suspect the challenge of that will progress.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for the information he has provided. I would just again say this is not the place, I suppose, to have the debate on PAYGO for taxes or the PAYGO for spending or all the PAYGOs, but you do have the PAYGO rule. 
   Maybe I was inarticulate suggesting not to debate the merits of the rule, but if you are going to have the rule, my view is you should apply the rule. Waiving the points of order on that rule as a routine of rules for the last week hopefully does not become any kind of routine item in this Congress. I am sure that is not the gentleman's intention; particularly, though, when the rules are waived, the points of order are waived for the majority, but on the one small attempt that the minority has to improve a piece of legislation, we have every point of order still against us. The balance of that seems even more out of balance. 
   If you want to have PAYGO that is in our rules now, we need to have PAYGO, we need to have enough time to know what we are paying for, so we can really have that debate on the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4, but more than that, in support of prescription drug access that works for seniors. This has been a long, hard fight in this Congress to get this program to where it is today, and it is working for seniors. They think it is working for them, and I think it is working for them. 
   The cornerstone of the Medicare prescription drug program is choice and satisfaction driven by competition. Competition is a good thing. And once again, today we are talking about whether or not we have competition in this system. 
   Instead of a one-size-fits-all model, the prescription drug benefit provides choices for seniors so they can find the best plan for them. This competitive model works, and it is doing exactly what Congress intended: it is driving costs down and providing more options for seniors. 
   The current system, as my friend from Louisiana has already said, the current system costs less than was anticipated, has more options for seniors than was expected, and has a tremendous level of user approval. 
   With the competitive Medicare drug program, individual drug plans can decide not to sign a contract with a drug company if they can't reach a price that they can agree on. Then seniors analyzed what all of these competitors out there were able to do. They take the drugs they take to the plans available and find out which company was able to negotiate the best deal, not for all drugs, but for their drugs. That is why this plan has worked in a way that surprised so many people, including the seniors that now benefit from this plan. 
   What are we really talking about today? Our friends on the other side seem to think that we need government to negotiate prices for seniors. Well, what does that really mean? 
   When the government negotiates for you, it means you are cut out of the decision-making process. Government is almost never the best negotiator and wouldn't be the best negotiator here. 
   Some of my colleagues claim that the change they are proposing today is merely minor. But I believe the change we are debating today is the major debate about the future of health care in the coming decades. Do we believe that government should make the decisions about your health care? Or do we believe that these decisions are so fundamentally personal that they can only best be made by the individual? Are Americans better served by a competitive model or by a government mandate that has less access and more cost? 
   Opponents of adding prescription drugs to Medicare and the way we did it last January have never believed that competitive options for seniors were the way to go. They have said so many times. That is the reason that I think they are so determined today to take away these choices that seniors have. 
   When the government negotiates prices, it fixes prices. This means a government bureaucrat will be empowered to determine what kind of drugs our seniors will have access to. If the government couldn't reach a deal with the drug company, seniors wouldn't have access to those drugs. That is what happens in the VA system that we are talking about. 
   Actually, today, we ought to be talking about how we can provide more choices for veterans instead of fewer choices for other seniors. It is Economics 101. And if seniors only cared about price, the lowest plan available would be the plan all seniors were choosing. They are not choosing that plan. They are choosing the best plan for them. 
   H.R. 4 will open the door to price fixing and health care rationing by the government. It is as simple as that.  
   During the campaign, Democrats argued that this bill is needed to protect our seniors. But if any senior can point to anywhere in this bill where it points out that all the drugs available to seniors today would be available in the future, I would suggest not only is it not there, but one negotiator couldn't make that deal. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this change, to reject rationing, to keep choice out there for seniors, and to believe in competition.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that information. Regarding FISA, regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, I hope that we are moving toward a long-term resolution of that. I know the Senate, we believe, will pass a long-term bill possibly as early as tomorrow. 
   On the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as we hopefully move toward a longer-term bill, we had a 6-month extension the first of August. We did a 2-week extension last week. 
   I think the Senate will send over a bill that has a longer term and includes things like liability protection for companies that cooperate with the government under the law. I also understand that at least 21 Members of the majority have sent a letter saying they would like to see a long-term solution dealt with next week. I wonder if my friend has any sense of how that may go next week and, again, I am hoping that we encourage a longer-term solution before this short-term extension runs out.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I appreciate that; I hope we can. I do think that there is the likelihood that a very quick problem develops if you don't have the ongoing ability that we currently have to try to intercept communications. There is some argument even about the short-term of that, and I think almost any expert will say that the long-term challenge there actually becomes a short-term problem pretty quickly. 
   We saw how encumbered the FISA Court became when this law was not in existence and how difficult it was. 
   I hope that the Senate can act quickly. We saw them act quickly today, certainly. 
   In fact, today is a good example of what we can do working together. The House worked together. We sent a bill to the Senate, the House stood firm in defense of that bill, and at the end of the day the Senate sent a bill back pretty quickly with improved changes that the House could agree to. 
   I would like to see us respond to a bipartisan Senate bill, and I anticipate that would be the case with a bipartisan House vote. Even though we had sent a bill initially over a long time, this issue has been out there a long time. I think the documents that the leader was talking about were available at the White House at an earlier time, but I am glad those documents are now available in a way more easily accessed over the next few days for our Members. 
   Hopefully, that resolves what the leader has just described as the last significant outstanding issue, and that we get this done. A significant amount of what we know about our enemies in the world is found out today through the structure of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and we want to continue that.

   Mr. BLUNT. I am hopeful of that, too. I appreciate that. 
   In an article from the New York Times, January 23, 2008, that the leader was able to share a part of with me on that date, Kenneth Wainstein, who is the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said in an interview, according to the Times, ``that if the August bill was allowed to expire in 10 days,'' that was 10 days before the expiration date, ``intelligence officials would still be able to continue'' the word he used was ``eavesdropping on already approved targets for another year under the law.'' 
   I think that essentially verifies my friend's comments on that and possibly, as you have explained it to me, the admiral's comments this morning. But Mr. Wainstein went on to say but ``there is a risk'' that the officials would not be able to use their broadened authority to identify and focus on new suspects and would have to revert to the more restrictive pre-August standards if we wanted to eavesdrop on someone. 
   I think we want to not revert to that if we don't have to. I believe that the 2 1/2 months we have waited for the Senate and now the 2 weeks that we have had in addition to that time hopefully will turn out to be appropriate; and certainly as we have worked together this week to get the stimulus package off the floor, this is a critical item that I hope we can all work together next week to try to find a permanent solution on.

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, if I determine to make that argument, I will tell my friend, I will make it in good faith, and we do have a difference of opinion on this. Hopefully, the Senate will get its work done in a way that we will have a maximum amount of time in the relatively short time available here to look at this, and we won't have to have the argument about how critical that change is. 
   I personally believe that the 1978 law was written in a way where it was not anticipated that we would have to go to the FISA Court to listen to people in a foreign country who were making calls or communicating, and because of the way the law was written, it had come to mean that by now.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and for the effort he and others are making on the floor here today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to refer to this editorial today from the Washington Post which says, ``It seems like just weeks ago''--because it was that--``that Congress approved funding for the war in Iraq and instructed General David Petraeus to report back on the war's progress in September. Before Congress begins ordering withdrawals, they should at least give those generals the months they asked for to see whether their strategy can offer some help.'' Mr. Speaker, I think that, in a nutshell, sums up what we ought to be talking about today instead of what we are talking about today. 
   I've heard this resolution referred to as a ``new way forward,'' but it doesn't provide a new way forward. It, frankly, serves no purpose in meeting the challenge that we face today with our totalitarian enemies. 
   I'm told that, yesterday, in the House Appropriations Committee, 45 minutes was spent debating whether cats should be declawed before they were allowed into public housing; 45 minutes to decide whether cats should be declawed in public housing, and by the way, that committee decided they should, and no minutes spent to talk  about this bill. No hearing on an April 1 deadline. No outside testimony on a bill that was quickly put together to serve a purpose of, I believe, changing the subject of the failure of this Congress to get its other work done back to a subject that is obviously creating stress in America today, and that is, what do we do about the totalitarian enemies we face and their lack of appreciation for innocent human life? 
   Commanders in the field say that a responsible deployment from Iraq would take at least a year. Maybe that's why we didn't have a hearing on how long it would take to responsibly and safely leave Iraq. There was no testimony from the military about an April 1 deadline. In fact, I can't even find any evidence of any consultation with the military about an April 1 deadline. 
   And what does ``limited presence'' on page three of this, what does that mean? What does ``limited presence'' mean? I suppose it means whatever it needs to mean when you go home and explain why you voted for the bill, because it doesn't mean anything. Limited presence means nothing, and it's a key criteria of this approach. 
   The same people who say we went into Iraq without a well thought-out plan now want to leave without a plan at all. And that's what is wrong with what we're talking about today. 
   Let's go back to page three of the bill itself. The President is supposed to report back in January things like the projected number of armed forces necessary to carry out the missions. The projected annual cost of the missions. The projected duration of the missions, I guess to suggest that there really aren't going to be missions if you leave April 1 if you've been on the other side of this issue up to now, if a few weeks ago you were for giving the generals in the field up until September, and now you're for deciding what we're going to be doing in April without knowing what that September situation is about. 
   And it goes on, on page 3, to talk about whether it's necessary, I guess defining the missions, whether it's necessary to have Armed Forces to carry out the following missions; protecting United States diplomatic facilities and United States citizens, including members of the Armed Forces who are engaged in carrying out other missions. You can pretty much make this, I guess, whatever you want it to. Serving in rolls consistent with customary diplomatic positions. Engaging in actions to disrupt and eliminate al Qaeda and its affiliated organizations. 
   Now, we're going to decide, apparently the President should decide in January whether that continues to be an important thing, or whether training and equipping members of the Iraqi Armed Forces continues to be an important thing. 
   Where was the effort made to determine the impact on al Qaeda worldwide, or to determine the impact on Hezbollah or other agents of terror and how that would affect our security in the United States if we precipitously leave one more time, if we precipitously leave without a plan? 
   Only a few weeks ago, again, as others have verified all over the country in editorials today, I and others stood on this floor and said, our troops deserve a funding bill without strings and without congressional pork. Today, I'm here to say that they deserve a chance to carry out their mission without looking over their shoulder all the time to see what the Congress of the United States is about to do next.

   At 10:30 at night, I don't want to belabor this in the debate that we've already had today, but I do think that information on these kinds of issues would be helpful if we could gain that through the normal process. 
   And while we may have talked about Iraq in the normal process, certainly, many of the questions that this bill generated never had a chance to be asked. And just from my own perspective as a Member of Congress, I would think that there's a better way to approach this critically important issue than that.

And maybe, again, I also think, while we're on this topic, that the result of that vote was also very similar to votes we've had on this topic, and wouldn't anticipate that changing in the next weeks. But if that's the way we're going to spend our time, that is the way we're going to spend some of our time. 
   I have a couple of questions on conferences that I don't have any information on and I believe my friend may. Last time we talked on the floor, which was almost 2 weeks ago now, you thought we would be going to conference on the 9/11 recommendations bill and the lobbying reform bill in the near future, and I see that the Rules Committee is meeting on Monday concerning the 9/11 bill, and I'm wondering if you have any more information about combining that with something else or why there would be a Rules Committee meeting on that. 
   I would yield to my friend for any information on that process of going to conference.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his comments on that. I do recall that extraordinary session and dissatisfaction created with some of our Members and maybe with the country, and the country does look at what we do and how we do it and when we do it. They look at what we do over and over again, and it is up to the country to evaluate the purpose served by that. And if they evaluate it to the detriment of the majority, the majority sometimes pays the price for that. 
   And our troops in the field, not to debate this bill again, also I think, have some reason to anticipate that there should be a point when they are given direction and given an opportunity to follow up on that direction. 
   The last question I have is on energy. We have heard reports that the majority would hope to move an energy bill the week of July 23, and I have also heard that that bill could be moved in two parts, one dealing with the part of the bill marked up without the Ways and Means portion and then the Ways and Means portion. And I am wondering, as we anticipate that debate, if the leader could give us a sense of whether what we are hearing about that is the likely way that that energy bill will proceed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the time this morning. I also want to join my good friend, the majority leader, and say how much I appreciate the work that's been done by Chairman Peterson, by Mr. Goodlatte, by the members on the committee in a bill that I had every intention of voting for as it went through the committee. I didn't like everything in it, but I did like some things in it a lot. There are some problems solved in this bill. 
   The big problem is created in the bill in a way that I wouldn't suggest intentionally, but certainly has the effect of taking a bill that would have had a huge bipartisan vote, giving this bill great momentum in the Senate, and I think needlessly minimized the House support for this bill. 
   Following up on Mr. Goodlatte's comments that he just made, if the budget allocation could have been done in a way that the appropriations bill we voted on yesterday, it would have had a 5 percent increase instead of a 6 1/2 percent increase, we wouldn't be having this debate today. In fact, I would be here today with enthusiasm about the bill, though again, I would say that I don't like everything in it, but I like some things in it a lot. 
   What happened was this bill deserved to have a chance in the committees to find the right kind of pay-fors. In the committee hearing itself, and I am quoting my friend, Chairman Peterson, exactly when he was asked about whether there would be a tax increase, he said, ``We think it will be something to do with collection of existing taxes, which has nothing to do with tax increases.'' Quoting the chairman further, ``So far as I know, there is no effort to use a tax increase that I am aware of at this point. But given all of that, we do not have jurisdiction. If we had jurisdiction to raise taxes, we wouldn't be going through some of these machinations we are going through.'' And that ends the Chairman's quote. 
   This bill should have been in a committee to look at this pay-for. The Ways and Means Committee didn't meet. The Rules Committee didn't  have the language for the pay-for when they did their markup earlier this week, according to Louise Slaughter, the chairman of the Rules Committee. 
   We've done things here that don't just affect people who are trying to avoid taxes. What this pay-for does is abrogates our tax treaties with countries where we do business, and people who do business here. 5.1 million manufacturing jobs and millions of other nonmanufacturing jobs affected by this, mistrust in whether you can invest money in this country in the future if you're a foreign investor. Some of our Members can make a passionate case about many jobs that have been saved in their districts because a foreign country, a foreign investor who just happened to make particular sense in what they did, came in and saved those jobs. 
   I think it's a shame that we've had to have this debate. I urge that all Members vote against the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BLUNT. (FIRST AND SECOND BATTLES OF NEWTONIA, MISSOURI, STUDY ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and thank the subcommittee chairman and the committee for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   The language we are discussing today is designed to authorize a study by the National Park Service to determine the feasibility of creating a new Civil War battlefield at Newtonia, Missouri, or bringing those battlefield lands under the management of the Wilson's Creek National Battlefield near Springfield and also near the Newtonia battlefield site. 
   This measure is a necessary first step to determine if this battlefield, as I believe it will, fits the criteria necessary for being preserved as part of the National Park System. I believe the study will find that the two Civil War battles at Newtonia, like the Manassas Battlefield south of where we are now, hold a unique place in American history and are worthy of protection in the National Park Service system. 
   Two important battles were fought at Newtonia during the Civil War, one in 1862, where large numbers of American Indian troops on the Confederate side and the Union side, actually fought each other in battle. It was the largest of the rare engagements where native Americans fought on both sides in the Civil War. My understanding is that this is the place where those troops actually fought each other. 
   Two years later, in 1864, the last battle of the Civil War west of the Mississippi was fought at Newtonia as Confederate forces withdrew from Missouri after their defeat at Westport. Tennessee, Missouri and Virginia had the most battles in the Civil War, and this was the final battle in our State. 
   This legislation has really been strongly supported by the local community, as has the idea of preserving this battlefield. The Newtonia Battlefields Protection Association has spearheaded preservation efforts at Newtonia. In 2002, the association acquired 11 acres of the battlefield, along with the Ritchey Mansion, which is on the National Register of Historic Places for around $300,000. A year later, I delivered a ceremonial check for about half of that from the American Battlefield Protection Program to reimburse the local group that had put this association together. 
   The National Park Service rated the 1864 battlefield as a Priority I for preservation and the 1862 site as a Priority II. These sites are largely similar. They overlap in some places, but they are right next to each other. 
   A review by the National Park Service found the 1964 battlefield faced a greater threat from development. The not-for-profit Newtonia Battlefields Protection Association was formed in 1994 to work on funding to preserve the battlefields. In addition, the National Park Service has provided archaeological and historical surveys and assessments of the battlefield. 
   I think this study will answer the questions that need to be answered before any further steps are taken. I am grateful to the committee for bringing this legislation to the floor today. If this study is agreed to by both bodies, it might even be funded in this year's appropriation process.

   On the vote we took earlier today, the rule vote on Colombia trade, if you listened to the debate, you heard two very different views of that debate. The view of my side was that this likely ends this discussion for this year, and the view I heard from the other side was not quite there at all.

   I felt strongly about this. I still do, but I hope my friend's comments are correct and there is some way to now actively pursue whatever discussions need to be had on Colombia. 
   But on the final two if I heard you right, the two that have been negotiated and have not been sent up yet, I think I am hearing you say this does not establish any new way of doing this, and I yield.

   On the supplemental defense budget that we talked about last week, it would seem that during this period of time between now and the work period at home during Memorial Day, that the supplemental budget will move. I think last week it was your anticipation that it might move in committee as early as this week. That didn't happen. I also read this week that following the Petraeus-Crocker testimony, that a number of Members, including the chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, indicated that they thought that this supplemental would have not only extraneous spending, but also some restrictive language. Have you had any further discussions about either timing or whether this supplemental will get, in my opinion, bogged down and held back by any restrictive language?

   Mr. BLUNT. Well, I thank the gentleman for that. I would say that my sense of that is that the troop supplemental should be that, and that we should be willing to work together on these other issues, as we did the stimulus package earlier this year. That's a package that the tax provisions are already beginning to have some impact. The rebate provisions will begin to have impact when people get their money in May, June and July. 
   But I think we proved, with that effort to work together, that when both sides decide we want to make something happen, we don't have to use the troop funding or any other issue. We just have to get together and make something happen. I think that would be, generally, the view on this side of the House about how to move forward on those two issues, and we can and will probably debate this for some time. 
   One of the issues that puts people in crisis, we saw a discussion on the floor today, a bill out of transportation that dealt with beach nutrition. Many of our Members thought that the Transportation Committee and the Energy Committee would be better spending their time focused on gasoline prices, which are $1 higher today, per gallon, on the average, than they were a year ago today. And I wonder if the gentleman has any sense of when we might see some legislation on the floor that would deal with gasoline prices.

   Mr. BLUNT. The debate today, I thought, was important and, you know, certainly, the numbers you cited about what's happened in the last 7 years, I don't fault those numbers at all. But we took a lot of responsibility for all of that when we were in the majority. And I haven't seen anything coming from this majority that would have stopped that $1 increase we've seen since the majority changed. I just hope we can work together to do that. And some of it's shorter term rather than longer. 
   Our long-term energy needs are clearly going to be met with some long-term solutions. But things that encourage more production here, more and better use of the fuel sources we have as we develop alternatives, I think, are part of that solution. I hope that the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Transportation Committee both are encouraged by both sides of the aisle to get some legislation to the floor that would let us deal with that. And I hope that happens sooner rather than later. 
   Actually, the debate today may have related more to the committee than it did the bill, but I thought it was a debate that the American people want to see us have on the floor of the House.

   I, too, vigorously oppose this rule. It seems to me the House today is doing two things that this Congress has done too often. One is, if you don't like the rules, you change the rules; and two is, we continue to take actions that reduce confidence in dealing with the United States. When you change the rules, other countries just simply don't want to deal with you. 
   Five hundred days since this treaty, this agreement was negotiated in good faith. Changes made sense then in elements that dealt with the environment and labor that the Colombians went back at our request to make. Sixteen months of talking to the leaders of the majority about what was the best day to bring this agreement, now 500 days old, to the floor of the House, and it's going to happen today or it's apparently not going to happen anytime in the near future. 
   We had no trade agreements before we went to the process of Trade Promotion Authority because nobody wants to trade with you if they don't think you're dealing in good faith. Nobody wants to deal with you if they don't think you're dealing in good faith. 
   This is about jobs. It is about middle-class jobs that my good friend from Illinois just talked about. I mean, how much more middle-class jobs could you try to provide than you provide when we open their market to us? Seventeen years ago we opened our market to them. This is not a debate about whether we can compete with Colombian products or whether their workers are being treated fair. Their workers already make products that come in here every day with virtually no tariff. 
   This agreement would let our workers send products there with no tariff. Eighty percent immediately would have no tariff. Very quickly, 100 percent would have no tariff. The 8,600 Caterpillar jobs in Illinois would be sending their products to Colombia without the 15 percent tariff. Why wouldn't we want to give those 8,600 labor union workers a 15 percent advantage that they don't have today? 
   When you change the rules, bad things can happen. This is about manufacturing jobs. It's about union jobs. It's about middle-class jobs. And of course, it is about our closest ally in South America, the second biggest country in South America, a country that for 17 years has had access to our markets and, in the last decade, has worked closely with us to try to solve their problems and the problems of this hemisphere. 
   This is a huge mistake today. It is the wrong signal to send not just to Colombia but anybody who's thinking about working with the United States of America. You have got to deal with countries in good faith. We are not doing that. We are not dealing with our own workers in good faith. I hope we do everything we can to defeat this rule.

   Mr. BLUNT. I think one of our concerns about that on the energy topic, which I would hope to go to for a few minutes next, is there was a proposed liquid natural gas facility in that area that I think this designation will impact unless it is defined somehow out of that. And if the gentleman wants to respond to that, I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that. And that is exactly right. That will be a bill to be debated, and leaders shouldn't be expected to know everything about every aspect of that, and particularly on a bill that will be debated. I would assume that this designation would create an additional obstacle, and there may be other obstacles already in place and I am sure that will be part of the debate. 
   The gentleman's last comment about work for next week indicated that there may be other energy-related bills scheduled for the floor next week. Does the gentleman have a sense of what some of those options might be, and which ones may be more likely to be on the floor next week? 
   I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. In that regard, on the 2005 energy bill that I voted for and the gentleman just said he voted for, I think we did head things in the right direction. Of course from the 6 years prior to 2007, energy gas prices increased by about 50 cents a gallon; and in the 17 months since then, they have better than doubled. Everybody can take the numbers and do lots of things with them. Nobody likes the doubled number. There is no doubt about that. 
   In one of the early bills, I think it was H.R. 6, actually this Congress voted to repeal the incentives that we put in that bill that you and I voted for in 2005, the House voted to repeal those incentives which would have made it easier to promote the NPRA drilling area. I think maybe the position we would hopefully take in the future would be that we would want to continue to make those things easier to do rather than harder to do. 
   I would also say in terms of the 68 million acres, I have heard that a lot and I am sure we will continue to hear it a lot. Number one, not all of that land has oil or gas on it. Two, even if it does, you don't drill on every acre to drain this important resource from it. We are all going to learn a lot more about the gas and oil business, even than we know today, and my guess is that we know a lot more than we did even 6 months ago. 
   I do know in the last 6 years, as we frankly have accelerated exploration, that lawsuits to slow down exploration have gone up 718 percent in the last 6 years. 
   So if we want to deal with things like lawsuits and trying to expedite the process, that's a very appropriate thing to do, and at that point it is even more appropriate to hold people to their strict lease standards that they have. 
   The 22 million acres in Alaska, while that is some place we ought to look for both oil and gas, I don't know that we are going to be in an either/or environment, and particularly in this case where we want to look at what makes the most sense the quickest. I would also mention to the gentleman that we have a bill on the ANWR itself, it is H.R. 6107, that already adopts that principle that none of the petroleum coming out of there would go anywhere but to the United States. So many are already cosponsoring legislation that accepts that principle. It is a principle that if it's an easy way to open up new resources, I think it is something that we should be talking about and making sure that we get it just right. We do not want to assume that the oil companies can be micromanaged by Congress. We want to do what we can to make sure that we are producing American energy in the maximum way, and also understand that every oil lease does not result in oil. If it did, my good friend and I could open up Hoyer & Blunt and become oilmen if we could just get a lease. A lease doesn't mean there is anything there, but we ought to be sure that these leases are being vigorously pursued. We also should be sure that we are doing anything we reasonably can do to remove impediments, whether those impediments are lawsuits or the language that was in H.R. 6 that the House of Representatives passed. The Senate didn't pass it so the law didn't change, but the message to people out there looking for oil is that there is a new sheriff in town and the rules are different than they were under the old sheriff, and maybe we ought to get out of town. 
   A lot of this hesitancy about exploring could result from debates right here on the floor. We want to do things in debate, and I take my friend's word that he wants to, too, that encourages exploration, not discourages exploration. 
   I yield to my good friend.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for that. I am old enough now that I never argue with anyone who suggests I am a lot younger, even if I am not a lot younger. My children and grandchildren, too, I think, will live in a world much different than the world we are in right now; but it will take awhile to get there. And I absolutely agree we should be at an all-systems-forward effort to find the next technology, and while we are finding the next technology, to use the resources we have as an economic asset, not to see them as an environmental hazard. We need to get there. We need to have a debate that gets us there. 
   We are going to have some figures that we are going to disagree about. It is hard with these sort of believed reserves to know what they are. I personally think I will have a lot of facts that suggest that 81 percent of the known reserves in oil and gas are not in those 68 million acres, but I am also for pursuing those 68 million acres vigorously. 
   The oil shale in the West, we had a hearing last week that only members of my party attended because we wanted to talk about this whole issue of what this Congress could have done, and just the oil shale amounts in the West that I think are not calculated into your figure are hugely significant in how we use our resources in the future. We want to do that. We want to remove obstacles. 
   On the $14 billion, and we have debated this before and I am not going to spend a lot of time on this, but I think everybody in this room understands that $14 billion so-called tax break for the so-called oil companies is their part of the domestic manufacturing tax incentive that every American business gets. Now if we want to take that away from companies that are successful, that's a different principle. Maybe we take it away from computer companies. Who do we take it away from? We want those jobs here. That is what that is about. I would like to have that debate one of these days about whether or not those manufacturing jobs need to be here. We think that they need to be here for every other industry in the country. Why is this the one industry where we say, they are going to manufacture here anyway, particularly based on everything we know about the worldwide oil challenge we face, why would we want to do anything that would encourage the oil product to be refined somewhere outside of this country? That is what that domestic manufacturing incentive is for. I think every time when we talk about this as a big tax break for the oil companies, it sounds like we have gone into the tax law and said if you are an oil company, you get something that nobody else gets. What we have done in the tax law is say if you are an oil company and you refine a product, if you manufacture a product, if you produce a product in this country, you get exactly what everybody else gets that makes that decision to make their computer in Texas instead of Romania. That's what that incentive is. 
   Now, every time it is discussed on the floor, it is this big benefit that was just designed for the oil companies, and that is just not the fact. It is a domestic manufacturing benefit.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend, but part of the unfortunate circumstance we find ourselves in is, as we have restricted access to some of our own supply, we in fact saw in the last decade that this industry that had been forced to be totally domestic, and we hoped it could be totally domestic again, was sending jobs out of the country because we were bringing in refined product for the first time.     
   Because we were bringing in refined product for the first time, we were doing other things that the Congress should want to reverse. 
   One other topic I have today, and I look forward to a good debate on these energy issues. I would hope these energy issues could come to the floor under a rule, by the way, and I would ask my friend if there is any plan to bring the energy bills that he would hope to bring to the floor in the next week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks with a rule that allows more than a 40-minute debate on a suspension bill. 
   And I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend. I think that will be a helpful addition to this debate. 
   You know, when you have a suspension debate on a bill, particularly a bill that maybe has a majority but it can't get a suspension number, you check a box but you really don't move the agenda forward. I would hope that we could see some of these under rules. 
   My final topic of the day, unless you raise another one, is I read in the Associated Press just yesterday that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Chairman Obey, announced that the House will not consider a single appropriations bill this year. If that was true, this will be the first time in at least 22 years, maybe ever, that the House has failed to consider a single appropriation bill in any given session. 
   The committee has passed five bills that are out of full committee ready to go to the floor: Homeland Security; Military Construction; Energy and Water; Commerce, Justice, Science; and Financial Services. And I guess I'm asking my friend to verify whether or not the chairman's view on this is the view of the majority, and if we would expect not to see any appropriations bills on the floor. 
   And you can take this question in whatever order in July, in August, or as he said, this year. 
   And I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. I just suggest, the statement I read, and perhaps it was not accurate, but it seemed like an incredibly definitive statement on the part of the chairman; and since this is the work that the Congress has to do to fund the government, I would assume that the chairman will soon be conferring with the leader and the Speaker to determine if bills are coming to the floor or not.

   Mr. BLUNT. We might ask Mr. Obey what his views might be about his bills that are already through the committee in regular order and why those five bills couldn't come to the House. 
   You know, we have, in the years of our majority, always with an open rule, taken substantial time. It seemed to me 1 year we took five full days of hearing amendments on the Labor HHS bill and other bills, numerous bills at a time. 
   The evaluation of last year, the House passed its bills, but at the end of the day, we had one vote on one big bill which may not have been nearly as healthy as having nine individual votes and then having to carry three bills over into the next year to get them done one at a time. But that's not really the question. 
   The question is what about the bills that are out of the committee now and what would be a violation of any regular order problem to bring those to the House and take the time that we clearly have? We're passing a lot of legislation off the House floor, but not very much of it winds up on the President's desk. If we begin to determine the House schedule based on what the Senate is willing to do and a bill that can get to the President, not much of what we've done in the last several weeks really had much impact. 
   But I would yield.

   Mr. BLUNT. If we don't deal with any bills this year, I guess our average is going to go down quickly. If we had 12 hours on Labor H last year and zero this year, I guess for this Congress we will say we spent an average of 6 hours debating the bills because one of them never got debated at all.

   So I would like to close by saying we would like to see at least the bills that are through the full committee on the floor and would hope that the energy bills that the gentleman is looking at can come to the floor with a rule that allows a substantial and full debate on this critical problem of both gas prices at the pump now and home heating and other things that are going to quickly become problems for Americans.

   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chairman, nearly 25 years ago, President Ronald Reagan was given the option of signing what was at that time a little-known international treaty promising to bring the world's countries together to seamlessly and equitably manage the vast expanses of ocean covering the Earth. 
   That accord, all 17 parts, 320 articles, and 9 annexes of it, was known the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It was presented to the President as a key national security imperative, an important economic opportunity, and a powerful message of cooperation and trust to send to our current and future friends around the globe. 
   Mr. Chairman, it didn't take President Reagan more than a few days to separate the rhetoric from the reality. He rightly interpreted the Law of the Sea Treaty, LOST, as a direct affront to American sovereignty and envisioned, presciently, as it turned out, that it might some day be used as a tool by foreign governments to exercise direct authority over American interests, activities, and industries.     
   President Reagan not only refused to sign the treaty, he fired the staffers that were responsible for negotiating it in the first place. 
   More than a generation later, there is talk in the U.S. Senate that they may dust off this stale treaty once again and bring it to a vote. Before it does, I believe this House has an obligation to take a close look at one element of this accord, which will impact the way American companies invest in new technology, it will impede their ability to produce new energy, and has long-range implications. 
   Mr. Chairman, the amendment I have at the desk tonight will ensure that none of the funds spent in the State and Foreign Operations budget are used to support what's called the International Seabed Authority. It's a semi-autonomous, unelected body of the United Nations with authority to directly levy taxes and fines against American operators with or without their approval. Worse still, it would have the power to force a direct transfer of minerals and technology rights from the American companies that develop them to any competitor it sees fit. 
   The Treaty's collision course with autonomous American Government is obvious, Mr. Chairman; the Seabed Authority is not only an obvious and very direct example of a U.N. effort to raise revenue without the input of the United States Government, but the Authority would also disincentivize private investment in offshore energy exploration which, in our current energy climate, is something this Congress should be working to avoid at all costs.  
   We need all the energy we can get, whenever and wherever we find it. Submitting ourselves to an unelected, unaccountable, international ocean bureaucracy when it comes to distributing what American companies rightly explore doesn't strike me as the thing to do 25 years ago or today. 
   Tonight, Mr. Chairman, I've come to the floor to ask my colleagues to consider the implications of ceding unprecedented authority to an agency of the U.N. without proper oversight, without legitimate safeguards, and without a whole lot of concern about the economic and security well-being of the United States. 
   I urge adoption of this amendment, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This amendment is really another test of the Congress' commitment to fiscal discipline. 
   Today we're considering a State and Foreign Operations bill that is close to another record increase. I think it is below the President's number, but I've voted on a number of bills over the last several years that were below the President's number. And the fact is the President's number was too high, 9 1/2 percent increase over last year's spending is too high. We can cut more than that, we can cut back to last year's spending, we can cut a percent, we can cut 2 percent, we can cut, go maybe even below last year's spending, but 9 1/2 percent over last year's spending is too much money for this bill at this time. 
   Not very many American families saw an increase last year of 9 1/2 percent. First, you have to figure out where these massive increases are going. Fourteen and 15 percent increases for the U.S. Agency for International Development, $203 million, or a 17.6 percent, increase for the United States contribution to various international organizations. 
   Second, you have to look at where this wasteful spending is going. We're funding things in this bill at increased levels like the International Copper Study Group in Lisbon, Portugal; the International Lead and Zinc Study Group at Lisbon, Portugal; the International Hydrographic Organization at Monte Carlo; the International Rubber Study Group in London, England; the International Tropical Timber Organization at Yokohama, Japan. A 9 1/2 percent increase in a budget that American families will pay for, where not very many American families got a 9 1/2 percent increase. 
   We're going to have some legitimate debates about increases on spending in this country. I think increases on spending in other countries at this level are unacceptable. This is an important debate to have, it's an important vote to have. I encourage the gentleman to continue to make these kinds of principled stands.

   Mr. BLUNT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And this is a good debate. It's a little more spirited at moments than I think it could be. In fact, I didn't mean to speak again on this until I heard the second-grade math explanation from my good friend, Mr. Obey. And I did pretty good in second-grade math. I even did fairly good in 12-grade math. And I did okay in college math. But second-grade math was a little bit of a stretch, I thought, because I tried to follow the second-grade math outline we had on why this was actually, according to some group, a cut in spending. 
   According to my friend, Mr. Obey, if I heard this right, if you took inflation, and then you took the population growth of the world, I thought that was an interesting element to the equation, and then if you took the deficit as a percentage of the economy, that that actually might be a cut. 
   This spending is 9 1/2 percent over last year's spending. I've never seen the President's numbers so praised by our friends on the other side as it's been tonight. It may be the only time that the President had either a perfect number or a number that was just slightly too high. 
   In fact, I understand this is $700 million less than the President's number. That's a lot of money. But it's not as much money as the $2.6 billion this is over last year's spending. That's a lot more money. 
   Now, this is a 9 1/2 percent increase. And somebody else said, is this going to be the baby that's going to break the bank? Probably not. But if every one of these bills goes up, it's going to have a big impact. 
   And my good friend, Mr. Hoyer, said the government today is larger than the government you inherited, pointing at us. And then I guess the point is, and we're going to make it bigger. I didn't get that at all. The government's larger than the government you inherited, he said, pointing to us. So we're going to increase these spending bills, this one by 9 1/2 percent. 
   Very few American families got a 9 1/2 percent increase last year. And almost none of them got to take the rate of inflation, the population growth somewhere, and whatever they had as a percent of the entire national economy and decide how that number added up. 
   This is a 9 1/2 percent growth in the foreign assistance part of the budget. This amendment says, let's just do a little less than we did last year and see if we can't make up with that with efficiency. One of the other amendments said, let's just do what we did last year. 
   But this is a $2.6 billion growth. Let's not anybody be confused that that's a cut, or it relates to some complicated formula, or somehow if you didn't understand second-grade math, you would realize this wasn't a real increase. This is an increase. This is too much of an increase. 
   We need to start doing the kinds of things on this bill and the other bill that hold the line, as we did hold the line on the discretionary non-defense budget in the past Congresses. We looked at the entitlement programs in the past Congress. None of that's happening in this Congress. So those programs are going to grow until we're told the budget's balanced. 
   And by the way, in 35 of the last 39 Congresses, the budget wasn't balanced. And in seven of those, that was our fault, and the circumstances we dealt with. In the other 28, the majority party's party was in control. 
   We need to be doing better. We need to start now. This is real growth that families couldn't just pass off as some complicated formula. We shouldn't either. We should be able to cut this budget by the one-half of 1 percent that the gentlelady from Colorado has suggested.
