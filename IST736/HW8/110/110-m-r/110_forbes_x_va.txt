<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (EMMETT TILL UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS CRIME ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is both humbling and an honor to speak on this bill after the distinguished gentleman, Congressman Lewis, has just spoken. And I join my colleagues in strong support of H.R. 923, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act OF 2007, and also compliment Chairman Conyers for his leadership and work on bringing this bill forward. 
   It is important that Congress adopt this legislation as quickly as possible; 30 to 40 years have passed since many of these murders were committed. 
   Under normal circumstances, trying a murder case is difficult and costly. Add to that the loss or destruction of evidence, witnesses who have died or are unavailable, and numerous procedural hurdles, it only increases the difficulty and cost of prosecuting these crimes. But law enforcement officers and prosecutors are continuing to pursue these cases, and we applaud their efforts. 
   In 2006, the FBI directed all 56 of its field offices to comb through their own cold case files and assess how many could be prosecuted. The FBI identified roughly 100 such cases. Many cases are confined to a handful of field offices that must complete rigorous in-depth investigations before it's too late. 
   H.R. 923 directs the Attorney General to designate a deputy chief within the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to coordinate the investigation and prosecution of unsolved civil rights-era murders. The bill also directs the Attorney General to designate a supervisory special agent within the Civil Rights Unit of the FBI to investigate these outstanding cases. 
   Mr. Speaker, most of these cases, if viable, will lack the requisite Federal nexus for prosecution by the Department of Justice. Yet, the Department and the FBI are able to provide valuable assistance to State prosecutors in their investigations. The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act provides additional resources to fully assess these cases and bring the offenders to justice. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (BAIL BOND FAIRNESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2286, the Bail Bond Fairness Act of 2007. Bail bonds are rare in Federal court, and this bill will ensure that bail bondsmen and defendants are treated fairly. 
   This legislation amends the Federal code to prohibit a judicial officer from forfeiting a bail bond when a defendant violates a performance condition other than failing to appear in court. On balance, I think it is unfair to hold bail bondsmen accountable for compliance with performance conditions such as drug testing, curfews and other nonappearance-related conditions. 
   A bail bondsman should be held accountable for ensuring the defendant appears at all court dates. It is hard to justify authorizing a court to forfeit a bond for performance conditions that a bail bondsman cannot enforce. 
   I want to acknowledge the commitment of my colleagues, Congressman Wexler and Congressman Keller, who sponsored this bill and have demonstrated leadership on this issue. For these reasons, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, you have heard from the other speakers here today about the fairness of this measure, and it certainly is a measure of fairness, how we treat bail bondsmen. And also as the chairman has pointed out, this is a matter of fairness of how we treat individuals who need bond, which they may not otherwise may have. 
   Even though this is a measure that is very fair, even fair measures don't make it into law without the hard work of individuals. That's why I want to compliment Congressman Wexler on the good job that he has done. Congressman Keller, who wanted to be here today to speak on this bill, has worked very hard and tirelessly for it in the committee. Unfortunately, his flight has been delayed, and he won't be here today. But I know if he were here, he would speak on the record here as he has spoken in the committee on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AND VOTER INTIMIDATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was delighted to hear the gentleman from Illinois talk about having made the trip to Selma with John Lewis this year. I had the privilege of doing that several years ago and learned the experiences that you can learn only by being there and walking down the avenues that great men like John Lewis traveled. 
   One of the things that is important for us to remember is we have heard discussions here today about the denial of the right to vote, and that denial changes from generation to generation in the methodology used to deny people. 
   At one time we heard discussions about the denial by the State of individuals' right to vote. We have also heard discussions about it is a denial to vote if you fraudulently give information to individuals about their voting rights. But it is equally a denial if you are here illegally and you are voting by non-citizen, and that is a denial to individuals legally voting in elections, and that is just as much of a problem. It is also a denial if we have people voting in elections when they are not legally entitled to do so. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1281 addresses the very serious issue of integrity in the election system and it provides that whoever knowingly communicates false election-related information about that election with intent to prevent another person from exercising the right to vote in that election or attempts to do so shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years or both. 
   We all want fair elections and we all want people to vote based on facts and not false rumors. I hope one day we will be able to reach the point where we are able to take away those false rumors. This legislation can't do that. But I am glad this legislation addresses the problem of knowingly and intentionally trying to give false information, and I support that approach. 
   I am also glad to see that ranking member Smith's amendment to strike the part of the bill as it was originally introduced that would limit its prohibition on voting fraud to fraud committed within 60 days of a Federal election was adopted by the committee. If it is fraud, it is fraud, and it shouldn't have been limited to just 60 days. That amendment is included in this legislation on its floor here today. 
   Illegal voting by non-citizens can occur when voting registration forms are filled out more than 60 days before a Federal election. It is illegal for non-citizens to vote in Federal elections, and that raises an important issue of interpretation that I would like to take just a moment to address, Mr. Speaker. 
   We have to ensure that the courts give this bill its full intended scope to protect our elections from all fraud, all denial of people's right to vote. 
   The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires that a person registering to vote affirm that they are a U.S. citizen. If a non-citizen signs or attempts to sign any form that can be used for voting purposes, including a voter registration form, and that form states that they are a citizen when they are not, then that is a false statement. 
   This bill specifically defines election-related information to include ``information regarding a voter's registration status or eligibility.'' If a non-citizen fraudulently votes for, say, candidate Jones, they will necessarily negate the legitimate vote of a legal voter that voted for candidate Brown. That effectively denies the legal voter's right to vote. 
   In the landmark case Reynolds v. Sims, the Supreme Court stated ``the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.'' So an illegally voting non-citizen in that case would violate the clear terms of H.R. 1281 and be subject to up to 5 years in jail. 
   Regarding the issue of intent, Black's Law Dictionary defines ``constructive intent'' as ``a legal principle that actual intent will be presumed when an act leading to the result could have been reasonably expected to cause that result.''  
   If someone knows they are not a citizen but they sign a voter registration form that states that they are a citizen, and then that person votes illegally and knows they are voting illegally, then they obviously know that their illegal vote is going to cancel out the vote of another legally voting citizen. That knowledge constitutes intents to deny another voter their right to exercise their vote, and it is properly punished under this legislation. 
   I certainly support that result, and I believe the court should interpret this legislation accordingly. After all, the bill is designed to protects the rights of legal voters, not illegal ones. 
   At the committee's markup, I offered a sentencing enhancement amendment to enforce this principle. However, I was deeply disappointed that it was ruled nongermane. It provided that, ``if the offense results in voting in a Federal election by more than 10 persons who are not citizens of the United States, the offender shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years or both.'' 
   If we really want to stop this, we can get serious by making those penalties meet the crime. I believe that this was an incorrect germaneness ruling based on the rules and precedents of the House. I had certainly hoped to have a vote on this amendment before we got to final consideration here on the floor. 
   Increasing the penalties for those whose fraudulent, illegal voting negates the legal votes of more than 10 citizens is common sense, and I thought it would have bipartisan support. 
   Despite my disappointment on that score, I support this legislation because it provides another mechanism for punishing illegal non-citizen voting and other forms of fraud. However, this legislation does not go nearly far enough. It fails to address what the American people want, more reliable and accurate forms of voter identification. A better system of voter identification would increase confidence in the integrity of elections by preventing more illegal voters from denying citizens the right to vote by negating their legal votes with fraudulently cast ballots. 
   I hope some day both sides of the aisle can work toward that end. But, Mr. Speaker, as to today, we support this legislation and we are especially pleased with the fact that it reminds us that if we are denying the right to vote, it doesn't matter if it is the State denying it, it doesn't matter if it is done because of fraudulent information, it doesn't matter if it is done because someone is illegally voting and negating the vote of someone who is legally voting, or if someone is entering a voting booth who is not legally entitled to do so and they cast an illegal vote. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I am just delighted today that we can come in here on an issue that we agree on and recognize, as the gentleman just stated, that this is not the end all legislation. It is a small step, but it is a step. No matter what the legislation is that we pass, it is only going to be as good as the enforcement that goes behind, and we want to send out a message to prosecutors across the country who might get an opportunity to enforce this of how excited we are to put at least another tool in their hand where they can have  the possible imprisonment of up to 5 years for denying people the right to vote, whether it is by fraudulent information, or whether it is individuals that are illegally voting by noncitizens. 
   We have had reports to our committee of thousands of voters who are registered in as many as four States. While this may not be a perfect piece of legislation, it at least takes us a step in the direction we want to go.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE JO ANN DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I, like so many others, rise today to pay tribute to Jo Ann Davis and to offer my sympathies to her husband, Chuck, and her family. 
   By now, you begin to hear a pattern that reflects very accurately the life of Jo Ann. And you hear many people stand up and saying the same thing, that she was our friend, and like so many others, we will miss her. 
   I spent a lot of hours talking with Jo Ann in this corner and in the Armed Services Committee, and I remember reading one account in one of the papers that said that she was born of ``modest'' means. But if you listened to Jo Ann, she was born poor. Jo Ann never went to a 4-year college, but she had more wisdom than you could ever see reflected in a diploma, and one mistake you could never, ever make with Jo Ann Davis was to underestimate her. 
   I still remember how she used to talk that so many people felt that she could never put herself through real estate school, and she proved them wrong. I remember her talking about how, that as a wife and mother, many people didn't feel that she could become a successful Realtor, and she proved them wrong. 
   I remember when she was first running for the House of Delegates meeting with her and talking with her and she told me that people didn't think she could win, and she proved them wrong. And then, like my good friend from Virginia, Congressman Scott, said, when she was running for Congress, she was a 40-1 financial underdog and nobody thought she could win, and she proved them wrong. 
   Who would have ever thought she would have served on the Armed Services Committee, been the ranking member of one of the subcommittees, that she would serve on the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives, and as so many people mentioned, she became a national leader on shipbuilding and defending the shipbuilding trade. 
   She was a tireless advocate for our veterans and men and women in uniform. She loved her husband, Chuck, and firefighters and would stand with firefighters in almost every issue that they brought forward, both in the Virginia House of Delegates when she served there and here in Congress. 
   She loved her family, and she was proud of them. And she loved her constituents, and she fought for them. And nobody, and I emphasize ``nobody,'' ever told her what to do. She always did what she thought was right for Virginia, and what she thought was right for the country. 
   And two final things that I think you don't hear people reflect here today, but we need to just mention, she loved horses. And I remember her and I talking many times about the fact that we were probably two of the only Members of Congress that actually had to go home on weekends and clean out horse stables; and yet Jo Ann was the kind of person that was humble enough not only to do it, but to love it. 
   But above everything else, I am absolutely convinced that she would also want us to say today, and this is what Congressman Wolf alluded to a little bit earlier, that she absolutely loved, above anything else in her life, her faith in Jesus Christ. And I have no question that today she has heard those words that Congressman Wolf mentioned, and that is, ``Well done, good and faithful servant.''

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, one of the big concerns that many of us have with legislation of this type is that courts across the country have used it to establish public policy, and then certain judges have taken that and determined from that public policy that they are going to redefine the institution of marriage. 
   In considering this bill, I am deeply troubled by not only what is in the bill, but where I believe this bill is leading us. And you don't have to take my word for it. A memo from the Marriage Law Project at Catholic University's Columbus School of Law noted this: 
   ``ENDA is about more than jobs. It is also about marriage. ENDA is based on the idea that State laws restricting marriage to the union of one man and one woman are a `subterfuge' for discrimination against homosexuals and bisexuals. If the courts accept the proposition that marriage is a `subterfuge' for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the Defense of Marriage Act will be struck down as unconstitutional.'' 
   And that is the goal, Mr. Speaker. This legislation will ultimately allow activist judges across the country to redefine the institution of marriage. The majority might say that is not their intent, but I guarantee that is exactly what will happen if ENDA passes as it is. If we don't vote to stop it, then we are tacitly allowing one of our most sacred institutions to be torn down. 
   This legislation will provide certain activist judges with the legal justification to strike down State and Federal  marriage laws that define marriage as between one man and one woman. State ENDA laws are being used by activist judges to impose same-sex marriage and civil unions on States. State courts are using ENDA and other similar laws to justify the argument that the government has no rational basis to continue discriminating in the area of marriage. And this is not something that might happen down the road. It has already happened in three States: Massachusetts, Vermont and New Jersey. 
   In Massachusetts, the supreme court there decided in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that there was no rational basis for the denial of marriage to same-sex couples. In that case the court cited a list of State statutes, including nondiscrimination laws, as evidence that the State should not discriminate in the area of marriage. The court's opinion laid it out clearly, writing, ``Massachusetts has a strong, affirmative policy of preventing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.'' You can't get any clearer than that on how nondiscrimination laws can be used to undermine marriage. 
   However, even before the Massachusetts decision, the supreme court of Vermont in 1999 ordered the State legislature to pass either a same-sex marriage or civil union law. The Vermont court relied in part on the fact that the State had a law preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation. The court said it would be irrational and thus not meet the rational basis test to argue that the State could refuse to allow same-sex marriage or civil unions when they clearly already had a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
   Most recently, New Jersey's courts have gotten into the game. In 2006, the New Jersey Supreme Court gave the State legislature 6 months to pass either a same-sex marriage law or a civil union law. In Lewis v. Harris the court stated, ``New Jersey's legislature has been at the forefront of combating sexual orientation discrimination and advancing equality of treatment towards gays and lesbians. In 1992, through an amendment to the law against discrimination, New Jersey became the fifth State in the Nation to prohibit discrimination on the basis of affectional or sexual orientation.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ensure that this bill does not become the building block that some may want to use to destroy the institution of marriage. The motion simply says this: That nothing in this act may be construed to modify, limit, restrict, or in any way overturn any State or Federal definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, including the use of this act as a legal predicate in litigation on the issue of marriage. 
   On the wall in my office, I have a framed copy of the Declaration of Independence and the pictures of our Founding Fathers. This wall serves as a reminder to me of the ideals and institutions our country was founded on. Yet every day we see people trying to rewrite our history and tear down those ideals and institutions. 
   This country is great because of the ideals of our Founding Fathers, but eventually if we chip away at enough of our values, we will lose our foundation. This is what is happening and will continue to happen unless we stand up and make sure it doesn't. 
   Marriage between a man and woman has been the cornerstone of strength in our country, and while it may be under attack from all sides, I believe it is an institution worth protecting. This motion allows us to take a stand for marriage, for our country, and, at least for today, puts a stop to those that are trying or may try to use this legislation as a predicate to change those laws. This motion would ensure that the intentions of this Congress are clear and unambiguous.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (OUR RICH HISTORY OF FAITH -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, tonight is a rather historic night because as people might be watching this at home, or if they happen to still be in this great, historic Chamber, if you look around, this room is draped with history. Unfortunately, when people look at this great assembly hall in which so many great debates and great pieces of legislation have passed, what they have become accustomed to seeing is if you are on this side of the aisle whenever there is anything that goes wrongs, there are fingers pointed on that side of the aisle in trying to blame everyone sitting over here. Of course the folks on that side of the aisle are turning over here and pointing their fingers in this direction. If anything good takes place, the folks on this side of the aisle want to stand up and take credit for those things that are good, and folks on that side of the aisle want to do the same thing. And folks sitting at home begin to question and ask whether we can ever get anything done, whether we can ever come together as a body. Well tonight, that is what we do. Republicans and Democrats come together to talk about something that is the cornerstone of the American experience, and that is the rich history of faith that we have had in this country that has helped create our greatness, helped sustain us and that many of us who will speak here tonight for this next hour believe will continue to sustain us in years to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, right behind you tonight is a great phrase. It says ``In God We Trust.'' As you stare out all around this magnificent room, you see some of the greatest lawgivers history and the world has ever known. But the ones you see across this room, you see just half of their face, their half profile except the one directly in front of you which is Moses who we recognize as perhaps one of the greatest lawgivers of all. 
   And throughout our country we have been steeped in an enormous history of faith that starts all of the way back with the commission that Christopher Columbus had when they talked about the grace of God; the first colonial grant to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584, the grace of God was mentioned in there. The first charter of Virginia in 1606, it referenced knowledge and worship of God. The Mayflower Compact in 1620, it talked about having undertaken for the glory of God. The Declaration of Independence we all know and can cite that those inalienable rights were endowed to us by what the writers of that document said were their creator. 
   The first act of Congress, 1774, they asked a minister to open with prayer, and they read four chapters of the Bible. And during the Civil War we are told that soldiers on both sides, Union and Confederates, that religion was the greatest sustainer of morale. 
   Of course we know numerous stories of the great faith of men and women as they were in slavery and fought to get out of that horrible institution. 
   In 1815, over 2,000 official government calls to prayer had been made by States in the Federal Government, and thousands more have been made since then. 
   In 1864 Congress added ``In God We Trust'' to the American coinage. 
   In 1870, the Federal Government made Christmas an official holiday. 
   In 1931, the Star Spangled Banner was our national anthem, including the phrase ``in God is our trust.'' 
   In 1954 we added the phrase ``one Nation under God'' to the Pledge of Allegiance. 
   And in 1956, Congress by law made ``In God We Trust'' our national motto. And, of course, we all know the significant role that faith and religion and the church played in the civil rights movement. 
   Tonight, Mr. Speaker, for the next hour you will hear some of the greatest leaders in our country and certainly in this body who will come forth not as Republicans and not as Democrats, but come forth as Americans to talk about what we think is the core value system that we have been proud of in this Nation, and that is the rich history of faith that we have. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to my good friend, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre).

   H.R. 692 authorizes State Governors to fly the American flag at half-staff upon the death of a member of the Armed Forces who dies while serving on active duty. 
   We all honor the service of the brave men and women who defend our Nation. When they make the ultimate sacrifice, Governors of the State should be allowed to recognize and pay tribute to them by lowering the flag. 
   I am also pleased the majority included a Republican proposal to add a simple congressional finding to this legislation that states the following: ``Congress finds that members of the Armed Forces of the United States defend the freedom and security of our Nation.'' It is fitting to include this finding to recognize not just the loss of a member of our Armed Forces, but also to honor the reasons they serve. 
   Madam Speaker, members of our Armed Forces deserve our deepest respect. They put their lives between us and hostile enemies around the world; they sacrifice stability with their own families so ours may sleep easier. They persevere in the most extreme conditions so we can lead ordinary lives. 
   The flag code is designed to honor public service. When we lower the flag to half-staff, we remind ourselves that the United States is not merely preserved by lofty ideals, but by the service and sacrifice of a great many men and women.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (COPS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, America's State and local law enforcement agencies are on the front lines combating and preventing crime every day. In the last decade, their dedication and service and innovative policing programs have led to a 34 percent decrease in violent crime. 
   It is unclear, however, whether the $11 billion in COPS grants awarded since 1994 can receive the same credit. Studies have reached inconsistent findings as to the effectiveness of the COPS program in reducing the Nation's rising crime rates. 
   The COPS program awards grants to State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to hire or rehire police officers or procure new crime-fighting technology. It is intended to provide short-term Federal assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies. It is not intended to assume the funding of State and local police, a duty that lies first and foremost with the States. 
   The COPS program specifically directs that grant money not be used to supplant State or local funds but, rather, increase the amount of funds for  community policing. In reality, this has proven not to always be the case. Studies show that spending on the COPS program has not led to an increase in the overall spending by local law enforcement but often supplants State and local funds. 
   The actual number of officers put on the street under this program is also in dispute. Estimates vary from 118,000 to as few as 82,000 additional police officers. The answer to addressing crime in the 21st century is not simply more cops on the street. It is innovative programs, such as multi-jurisdictional task forces designed to target specific types of crimes and neighborhoods plagued by gangs and drugs. 
   We should look to cities like New York and Los Angeles, who continue to enjoy reduced violent crime rates thanks to smart, effective policing. 
   To put to rest once and for all conflicting findings about the effectiveness of the COPS program, the committee adopted an amendment directing the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to conduct an audit of the COPS program to review three areas: first, the effect of the program on the rate of violent crime; second, the degree to which COPS funding recipients contribute State or local funding to law enforcement programs and activities; and, third, any waste, fraud, or abuse within the COPS program. 
   As introduced, H.R. 1700 reduced the likelihood that community policing would, in fact, some day be funded by America's communities. The bill stripped several provisions from current law that encourage State and local governments to assume a larger share of COPS grants. This is directly contrary to the purpose of the COPS program and would only exacerbate the use of Federal funds to supplant State and local funds. 
   H.R. 1700 also stripped from current law limits on the duration of COPS grants and instead allowed unlimited grant renewal. This too is directly contrary to the original intent of the COPS program to provide short-term assistance to State, local, and tribal governments to hire additional police officers. 
   I am pleased that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle listened to our concerns and supported our changes to preserve the partnership between the Federal Government, State, local, and tribal governments.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (COPS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Over and over again we hear on the floor, we hear outside this body the importance of coming together in a bipartisan manner and what we can do to resolve issues for the American people. The unfortunate thing is when we try to do that, as we have done in this bill and we bring this bill in a bipartisan manner, sometimes my friends on the other side of the aisle simply can't take yes for an answer. And when we hear presentations like we just have, Mr. Speaker, I feel it is incumbent  upon me to stand up and just correct some of those facts. 
   The first thing is that the COPS program has been authorized in the 2005 Department of Justice authorization bill through 2009 for $1.047 billion. All this authorization will do is increase that to $1.15 billion through 2013. 
   In addition, when you see these lines that drop off with the number of cops that are being hired, one of the things that we have heard from the testimony that we've had is twofold. One of the reasons that we had declines in the crime rate was not just because of the numbers of police officers, but more importantly, not just because we sent money, but because throughout the 1990s we had a lot of policies from Republican legislators across the States that did things like abolish parole, that did things like mandatory sentences, that did things like truth-in-sentencing that took criminals off the streets and out of our communities. And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out if we do that, we reduce violent crime. 
   The other thing that we heard testimony on is that in New Orleans, when we went to do hearings there, the number of police officers increased and the crime increased. And in New York, the number of police officers decreased and the crime decreased. By the rationale we just heard, one would argue we should have less police officers. 
   But the testimony was, Mr. Speaker, we do need police officers on the streets. That's why we brought this bill in a bipartisan manner. But it is important that we have smart policing, that we have comprehensive programs. Because if we just dump money at the problem and we don't do that, we're not going to solve the problems that are before us. 
   Mr. Speaker, fortunately there were members from the Judiciary Committee that worked in a bipartisan manner to bring this bill to the floor. I hope we will pass it.

   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again I want to emphasize my support of this legislation and my support of additional police officers, but it is important that we continue to make sure we are separating the facts from some statements that are being made. 
   Testimony that we have received before the committee strikes a great contrast between different areas in our  country. Sending money alone, even putting cops on the streets alone, will not solve our crime problem. As we mentioned earlier, in New Orleans we had testimony that only 7 percent of the individuals arrested, and this is pre-Katrina, only 7 percent of the individuals arrested ever end up in jail, and the police officers themselves, the police chief, testified how demoralizing that was to crime fighting and police officers there. 
   That is why a comprehensive approach, looking at more police officers, but also such things as abolishing parole, mandatory sentencing and three-strikes legislation work to help cut down on the crime that we have. 
   We have also heard testimony from both sides of the aisle about the importance of technology. Many police departments are recognizing across the country that it is not just the quantity of police officers, but it is how they use them. New York came in and testified that what they have done is actually decreased the number of police officers they have, but they have used technology to do it in a smarter way, which has reduced overall crime. 
   Mr. Speaker, we support this legislation, but let's make sure we are not using the hyperbole, that we are using the facts. It is important to have police. It is important to have them used in a smart, effective and comprehensive manner if we are going to deal with the crime that our communities are so concerned about.

   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, as I rise to close, I just want to say that I don't think the American people much care whether it is Republicans in charge or Democrats in charge. I think what they really care about is whether or not we are reaching across and trying to forge solutions to the problems they face. That is why I want to compliment the chairman for his bipartisan manner in which he has not only handled working on this bill, but has handled this debate on the floor today.     
   Mr. Speaker, this bill was never put on the sidelines. As I have mentioned before, the facts show in 2005 we reauthorized it through 2009 for $1.047 billion. 
   The key was the DOJ Office of the Inspector General and GAO reports note that thousands of hires funded by COPS never materialized as law enforcement agencies used COPS funding to cover their own budget shortfalls. In fact, they showed that $277 million were misspent funds. 
   Mr. Speaker, by working together in a bipartisan manner, I think we have crafted a bill that will help in a comprehensive manner continue to put police officers on the streets and continue to allow our local and State enforcement agencies to be able to use technology and smart policing to do what they want us to do, and that is to reach out to form practical solutions of how they deal with crime and the crime that is plaguing their communities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (JOHN R. JUSTICE PROSECUTORS AND DEFENDERS INCENTIVE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 916, the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007, establishes a loan forgiveness program within the Department of Justice for State and local prosecutors and for Federal, State and local public defenders. However, the bill, as introduced, raised several concerns regarding the breadth and cost of the loan forgiveness program. 
   I am pleased that the majority listened to our concerns, and at the Judiciary Committee markup we were able to reach a bipartisan compromise that ensures fiscal responsibility while encouraging young attorneys to join the criminal justice system and preventing attrition. 
   Many law school graduates carry a large amount of student loan debt, on average between $50,000 and $80,000. More than 80 percent of law students borrow to pay for their law degree, and the amount borrowed by many students exceeds $100,000. 
   At the same time, the median entry level salary for State prosecuting attorneys is $46,000, and the median entry level salary for public defenders is $43,000. 
   Several States and prosecuting agencies currently offer loan repayment programs. Yet, H.R. 916, as introduced, made no provisions for whether participation in existing State and local loan repayment programs would offset repayment from this program. 
   This substitute amends the bill to direct the Department of Justice to consider applicants' participation in other loan repayment programs when determining their ability to pay their loans. 
   The bill, as introduced, would have resulted in a very costly program. Although the bill caps repayment at $60,000 per applicant, as few as 25,000 applicants would have cost $1.5 billion over the life of the program, even with the cap in place. 
   The bill also authorized the program at $25 million for the first year and such sums as are necessary for each additional year. The bipartisan compromise authorizes $25 million a year for 6 years. This fiscally responsible limit on the authorization provides Congress the opportunity to review the cost effectiveness of the program. 
   The bipartisan compromise directs the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to review the costs of the program and determine whether the program positively impacts the hiring and retention of prosecutors and public defenders. 
   The compromise also directs the Department of Justice to administer this program subject only to the availability of appropriations, ensuring that the Department's criminal justice responsibilities remain a priority. 
   H.R. 916, as amended, directs the Attorney General to give priority to those applicants with the least ability to repay their loans. This provision guarantees that funds will be made available under this program to those prosecutors or public defenders suffering the greatest burden. 
   I thank Chairman Conyers and Crime Subcommittee Chairman Scott for their cooperation on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, every day on the floor and across America today, we are hearing people talk about being bipartisan. They come to the floor when they have drafted a bill improperly or they have ethics charges against them, and they plead with us with tears almost that we need to be bipartisan. 
   But when it comes to one of the most significant issues facing America today, energy, they don't want to be bipartisan. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to cut the microphone and the lights off against Republicans; but what this bill does is cut it off against scientists and engineers and analysts who will never have an opportunity to analyze this bill and tell America what it does because it was filed last night and we will vote on it today. 
   When they do, this is what they are going to tell Virginians. They are going to tell Virginians that it pulled away the revenues that they could have gotten from oil drilling. They will tell Virginians that it has increased their electricity bills enormously, and it puts $18 billion more taxes across America. 
   But that is okay because off the camera they are going to put their arm around us and say don't worry about it because this bill will never become law because it is just designed to give us cover in the election. 
   Mr. Speaker, America deserves better.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment to create an advisory panel between the Department of Defense and the State Department. 
   Under the leadership of Chairman Skelton, Chairman Berman and Chairwoman Lowey, I believe we've taken the first of what I hope will be many steps to reform the Interagency process. 
   As Chairman Skelton said yesterday, reforming the way our Federal agencies cooperate is not going to happen in 1 year. 
   We have 19 Federal departments that have Cabinet-level authority, each with their own mission, culture, and priorities. But whether it is coordinating a uniform and united response to a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina, whether it's organizing counterterrorism efforts between the CIA, FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, or whether it's coordinating food safety efforts between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Homeland Security, it's critical that our agencies are not restricted by regulations or cultures that lead to distrust rather than one of cooperation. 
   The American people expect their government agencies to work together to be responsive and effective in carrying out the duties of government: keeping America safe, enforcing justice, and providing assistance in times of crisis. Americans expect this to be the case in our government's dealing, both at home and around the world. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which establishes an advisory panel between two of our largest departments. This panel will identify ways those departments can collaborate more effectively to address national security challenges we face. 
   I want to thank Chairman Skelton for his leadership and his commitment to this issue.

   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for their work in getting this resolution to the floor. I also want to thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Scott, for his hard work and the work of his staff in getting the bill here and also Congresswoman Foxx for her efforts and her staff in helping to get H. Res. 182 on the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as do my colleagues, to commend Virginia State University on the celebration of their 125th anniversary. This resolution honors Virginia State University's continued resolve to provide an excellence in education since March 6, 1882. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we just pause and we say to all of the current students of Virginia State University, to the alumni, to the faculty and to the administration, thank you for a job well done in the pursuit of excellence that you have done for these last 125 years. 
   As you may know and you have heard mentioned today, Mr. Speaker, Virginia State University is located in my district in Chesterfield County, and it is warmly embraced by the neighboring city of Petersburg. It was the first university to be fully funded by the Commonwealth of Virginia as an institution of higher learning for African Americans. 
   Currently, Virginia State University offers 45 baccalaureate and master's degree programs and introduced their first doctoral program in 2003. This campus includes 236 acres and an additional 416-acre agriculture research facility. They host nearly 5,000 students and continue to grow. 
   It fills me with pride to stand on the House floor today to present this resolution. We have had a long-standing relationship with Virginia State University and look forward to continuing this through the years to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution comes before the House floor cosponsored by the entire Virginia congressional delegation. Though I cannot speak for my colleagues, I believe I can say we are proud of the progress Virginia State University has provided through its 125 years of service to the students in Virginia and beyond. This anniversary represents a significant milestone in the Commonwealth of Virginia's history. 
   The university is more than worthy of this distinguished recognition for the impressive advancements and accomplishments in their 125-year history, and we are honored to acknowledge their achievements today

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, as you know, Congress has granted the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to grant temporary refuge to aliens, usually illegal immigrants, from particular countries under temporary protected status. Congress intended this provision to live up to its name and be temporary. Unfortunately, a pattern of abuse has emerged in the temporary protected status, or TPS, program. DHS can grant TPS status to the nationals of a country for as long as 18 months and can later extend the TPS period indefinitely by adding extensions up to 18 months each. 
   The administration has begun to utilize TPS as a de facto amnesty for illegal immigrants from certain Central American countries. TPS status was granted to Honduran and Nicaraguan nationals at the end of 1998 following Hurricane Mitch. The administration has extended TPS for these individuals multiple times, the latest extension lasting until January 2009, more than 10 years after the hurricane. TPS status for Salvadoran nationals was granted early in 2001 as a result of earthquakes hitting the region. The latest TPS extension for Salvadoran nationals lasts until September 2007, again, long after temporary dislocations caused by the earthquakes. 
   There are currently some 248,000 Salvadorans, 81,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans, mostly aliens who came illegally to the United States, benefiting from TPS status. Our Nation currently has a growing gang problem, and we have had testimony in the Judiciary Committee that 60 to 85 percent of some of the most violent gang members in the United States are here illegally. Of 5,000 gang members in a database that ICE compiled for Operation Community Shield, 291 El Salvadoran nationals, 43 Hondurans, and 1 Nicaraguan had been granted temporary protected status, 6.7 percent of the total. 
   At least one of the suspected MS-13 members accused in the 2002 rape of two deaf girls in Massachusetts had been in our country protected by TPS. In fact, currently, a criminal gang member could literally stand on a street corner and announce that they were a member of a violent criminal gang and that they came here illegally, and if protected under TPS, no law enforcement officer could touch them until they had actually committed a crime. 
   TPS is being used to grant long-time residence, a perpetual amnesty, to illegal immigrants of certain favored nationalities. This amendment will return TPS to its original intent of providing temporary refuge during temporary periods of crisis. It would bar any funds made available in this Act from being used to extend TPS for nationals of a country beyond the original period of not more than 18 months. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remaining time. 
   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman stated that this would perhaps be the meanest and most misguided amendment of the night, but I would suggest that the gentleman look in the eyes of the father who had his deaf daughter raped and assaulted by individuals who were here illegally, protected only because we shielded them with temporary protected status, where they could have literally been standing on the street and have said, I'm a member of a violent criminal gang, I was here illegally, and there would have been nothing law enforcement could have done to have gotten rid of those individuals until they'd actually raped that little girl. One of those individuals was here protected by temporary protected status. The other one had applied for it and was in the process of getting it. 
   The second thing, Mr. Chairman, we heard it mentioned that these individuals are here and we're protecting them on a temporary basis. It's mighty hard to look into the eyes of the American people, and say that when we have extended something for 10 years, that that is a temporary situation. 
   And Mr. Chairman, I would just suggest to you when we talk about they're here legally, it is true they're here legally because we've put this shield of protection around them. If we're going to truly deal with the law and be honest with the American people and what this law says, we need to either take the word ``temporary'' out and just tell them it's protected status, or we need to let the law do what it's intended to do, which is to truly be temporary by being an 18-month period of time, not a 10-year period of time. 
   Mr. Chairman, once again, I hope that it will be the pleasure of my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon among a sea of voices that I quickly confess I do not understand. Now, some of them are my friends and some of them are very good people and I don't want to make any mistake about it. I understand the pressures they are under. I understand what it is like when you have major news media outlets who will not even take individuals who attack innocent civilians in the United States and destroy our property and they won't even call them terrorists. I understand the pressure when they control much of the media that we get across the country. 
   I also understand what it is like, Mr. Speaker, when we have Web sites that are filled with hate, that spew poison out throughout all of our congressional districts, and I understand the pressure that we get when we have people who don't want to listen but simply want to scream, who stand outside and protest at our offices. I understand those pressures. What I don't understand is the response that I am seeing here today on this floor. 
   Just a few years ago, I had the privilege of traveling with then Speaker DENNY HASTERT to the 60th anniversary of one of the greatest military achievements the United States has ever seen, and that was the invasion of Normandy. Almost every historian agrees it was the battle that literally saved the world. It was of particular importance to me because my dad had died just a few months before and he was there during World War II. Mr. Speaker, I sat that day in the sun among a sea of heroes who didn't come up to the microphone and pound the desk and they didn't speak in shrill voices. They sat with quiet silence because they had done the hard work and they had literally saved the world. And after that ceremony, I had the honor of just walking with them, in the same presence with them, as we walked down on the beach at Omaha Beach and stood there literally speechless as the military historians first told us that that was a victory that didn't necessarily have to be a victory, that we could have easily lost that battle. And if we had lost Omaha Beach, we would have lost that invasion. If we had lost that invasion, Germany would have signed a treaty and Europe would have looked much different than it looks today. 
   And they told us about the guns that were pointed up and down Omaha Beach, huge cannons and the machine guns locked on the front that created virtually killing fields for our young men that would have to come on that beachhead. 
   And then, Mr. Speaker, they told us about the very first Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan, who had warned against doing exactly what we are doing today when he said this: ``Do not have efforts that end in the production of nothing but paper, but we must contrive to produce action, not paper, if our goal is victory, not defeat.''     
   Mr. Speaker, they described how when General Eisenhower, one of the most beloved generals of our time, when he was strategizing that great vision, his own generals disagreed with him on many issues. In fact, some of them threatened to quit because there were different strategies. Some said don't go today, some said go today, some said do it a different way. 
   But then as they watched that invasion, greatest victory of all times, let me tell you what happened early that morning. Our airborne men, some of them were dropped into the flooded lowlands, and they drowned without a bullet ever being fired on them because we dropped them in the wrong places. Some of them were dropped in the midst of German positions, and they were captured or they were killed. 
   Less than a half of the 82nd Airborne's gliders ever reached their assigned landing fields. By early morning, 4,000 men of the 82nd and 60 percent of their equipment was unaccounted for. 
   The high seas that day swamped many of our boats, and we lost our radios in the bottom of the sea, and only three out of 16 of our bulldozers survived. But what was worse, in the first 4 minutes we had 97 percent casualties on that beach. The Germans were elated. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I have listened to this debate, I could only think what would happen if the leadership controlling this floor had been on the command ships sitting off of Omaha Beach, because you and I know what would have happened. One by one, they would could came up to the podium, they would have grabbed a microphone, they would have pounded, and they would have looked at all the things that happened. At the end of all that, do you know what it would have resulted in? 
   It would have had a note that they would have passed to the 29th Division, and those young boys on that beach, some of them 17, 18, 19 years old, who were hunkered down on that beach in the sand, some of them paralyzed with fear not knowing what to do. That note would have said, we love you, we support you, we just want to let you know we disagree with the action that you are taking. We don't know what to tell you, we just disagree with the action that got you here. 
   But fortunately, that was not the leadership that governed that day. The leadership that governed that day was people like Brigadier General Cota who went up and down that beach and he looked at those young boys and he said, essentially, don't look at the beach. Don't look at the bullets that are flying here at you, because if you do you are going to die on this beach and you are going to lose everything you believed in. 
   What he told them to do, he said, Look at that hill. We have got to take that hill. He said, Rangers, lead the way. Americans, lead the way. You know what? They took that hill, and they won the greatest military victory in the history of this country. As a result, they saved the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope and I pray that we will continue to birth voices that say don't look down, don't look at the mistakes, look at that hill. We have got to take this hill, and we have got to save the world from this threat of terrorism that so threatens us.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (MEJA EXPANSION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairwoman, when I walk into this great body, I understand often why our approval ratings are so low with the American people, because they tune in and they listen to our debates and they listen to us talk about problems, and then they actually read the legislation and they look at the proposed solutions and they scratch their heads and oftentimes say there's a huge disconnect between the two. 
   The other thing that they see is they see Members on this side of the aisle and certain Members on that side of the aisle who scratch our heads and wonder why we can't come together in a bipartisan manner to create solutions that actually work. And this piece of legislation is exactly why that isn't able to happen. Because when this bill came through the Judiciary Committee, the minority and the majority both agreed, it was voted out by voice vote because the intent that you will hear discussed today was supported by both the majority and the minority. But we were given assurances, and we certainly had the expectations, that the absolutely poor drafting of this legislation would be corrected before it came to the floor. And we had opportunities to do that, Madam Chairwoman, but they didn't happen. 
   And so today we have a bill that Members are in somewhat of a quandary over how they vote because they can either vote on this bill and vote against the bill to send a message to the Senate that it needs work and it needs to be corrected, even though they support the intent of the bill and hope the Senate will do what we cannot do, and that is, correct the poor draftsmanship, or they can vote for the bill because they support the intent of the bill, and again, hope springs eternal, and hope that the Senate will be able to correct the poor draftsmanship and send us back a better bill in conference. 
   I am not going to suggest which way they should vote, but let me try to correct the disconnect between the problems that are alleged and the actual legislation, because it's an intent that's important for us to get right, but it's important for us to get right with proper drafting. 
   First of all, under MEJA, which was passed under the previous majority, let me tell you who was actually covered. Under that bill, which is the reach we have to reach out for individuals who may be Americans who do stuff that's wrong overseas under contracts at that time, every Member of the Armed Forces that was subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice was covered. Every civilian employee of DOD was already covered. All the employees of every other Federal agency and every provisional authority who was supporting a mission of DOD was covered. Every contractor of DOD, covered. All contractors of any Federal agency or provisional authority supporting missions, and their employees, covered. The dependents of the members of the Armed Forces, covered. The dependents of the civilian employees of DOD, covered. And the dependents of DOD contractors, all covered under current legislation. 
   Now, what does this legislation purport to do? What it purports to do is to add contractors of other Federal agencies who are not supporting DOD missions but who work in, according to the language of the bill, close proximity to a contingency operation. Well, Madam Chairman, the problem is that we've actually reduced some of the jurisdiction as opposed to increased the jurisdiction under this particular legislation. 
   First of all, there is no defining of what ``close proximity'' actually means. And there is no carve-out for those who are supporting a DOD mission who might not be in close proximity to a contingency operation. 
   So, Madam Chairwoman, under the proposed legislation, if we have a contractor who was doing something that would have been covered because they were in support of a DOD mission, but let's say they were on a base in Germany, because they were not in proximity or close proximity to an area of contingent operations, under the previous jurisdiction they've been covered; under this jurisdiction they would no longer be covered. That's something that could have easily been corrected in the draftsmanship if we had been given the opportunity to do that prior to coming to the floor. 
   The second thing, Madam Chairwoman, is when it comes to intelligence operations, which will now be brought under this particular bill, there is no carve-out under this bill for employees who may be working in operations that are involved in intelligence. If they are accused of doing a particular criminal act and they are then exposed and the linkage is because they're hired to do intelligence activities somewhere else, that entire network could then be exposed and the security of this country jeopardized, which certainly shouldn't be the intent of what we want. Again, that could have easily been corrected if we could have just written that in and corrected it before it came here. 
   The other thing, Madam Chairman, is there is no carve-out for residents and nationals of other countries. In the current bill there is, but under this particular legislation and the way this bill came to the floor, it may not be. We can actually have an employee of a company from another country, not even a resident of the United States, who could be employed by one of our corporations doing work for the United States, and because of the way this bill is drafted, when they say just because they're in the employ and they didn't put a scope of employment definition in the bill, then even if that person was outside of his employment, even if he was off the job, even if he wasn't working then, if he committed an act that might be a criminal offense in the United States, even if it wasn't a criminal offense in the country in which he did it, under this bill there would be jurisdiction, but there are all kinds of questions as to whether or not we could pick him up, arrest him and detain him. 
   The final thing, Madam Chairman, that could have easily been corrected and wasn't done is this bill sends the FBI to do these investigations in theater of operations, and there is no definition for what theater of operations actually is. We are now putting our agents in danger to do investigations in areas of military conflict where they primarily do investigations domestically at home, but we don't give them any funding to do it; we just mandate that they do it. And some of the estimates of cost that were given in the committee were as much as $5 million just to do the investigations. That means that we will have FBI agents that will be doing investigations of employees who could be doing illegal activities overseas, but we may be taking them away from activities here domestically that they could be protecting American citizens here against terrorist activity, against gang activity and against things that are going on in the United States, and this bill doesn't give a dime of funding to do that. 
   So, Madam Chairman, this is a bill, the intent of which is a good intent; unfortunately, the draftsmanship is horrible. It is unfortunate that we couldn't have worked in a bipartisan way to have corrected those issues before they got to the floor.  
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, I would have responded to the gentleman from North Carolina had he yielded to me when he asked me the question what I would do that we support the intent of this bill, but it doesn't justify writing a poor bill. It doesn't justify taking away existing jurisdiction. When we have contractors that are committing bad actions, whether they are in Iraq or whether they are in Germany, we want to hold them accountable. Why in the world we would draft legislation which could reduce that jurisdiction is beyond me. 
   I would like, Madam Chairman, to yield at this time 7 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays).

   Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, once again we hear the intent, but why in the world we would want to reduce the current jurisdiction that we have, which is what we see reflected in this piece of legislation that could have been corrected, still is beyond me. If we have a contractor who is having employees doing illegal acts in a base in Germany in a mission for DOD, we would want to prosecute them every bit as much as we would if they were in Iraq. Why we want to reduce that, I just don't understand. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays).

   Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, once again we hear the reasons and the policy reasons why we would like to have legislation, but it doesn't suggest why we need poorly drafted legislation. 
   My good friend from Virginia, for whom I have the utmost respect, mentioned that there were 17 pending cases of detainee abuse, including some that occurred at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. But we already have jurisdiction for those. This isn't a bill that deals with prosecutorial discretion or whether or not we are going to have prosecutors prosecute those cases. This is a jurisdictional bill. 
   The second thing, my good friend mentioned the fact that some of the deficiencies in this bill were corrected by the manager's amendment. The only thing the manager's amendment has done is to say with our security concerns for our FBI agents, who normally do not do investigations in war zones, they do them domestically, we have a manager's amendment that says that they can request assistance from the Secretary of Defense. 
   Madam Chairman, requesting assistance and security and getting it are two different things. We had the ability to request bipartisan cooperation in redrafting this legislation. It didn't happen. 
   So our concern, Madam Chairman, is not again all that we hear in the debate about getting at bad apples, but it is why we want to reduce the jurisdiction that we currently have for some of those bad apples; and, secondly, why we are going to expose and create vulnerabilities for our intelligence network and also for our FBI when it is so easily corrected, if we could just sit down and do that with the proper amendments. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, once again I scratch my head as I listen. The gentleman has just stated on the one hand that the legislation does not reduce the jurisdiction and then 30 seconds later he says, oh, but there are differences between the bases in Germany and the bases in Iraq and it's okay if we don't prosecute the ones in Germany. We can't have it both ways. 
   Madam Chairman, this significantly does do it. The bottom line on this is that we have created a new standard which is proximity to contingency operations before we could reach in and get those bad actors in Germany and  many of the bad actors that were in the contingency operation areas. 
   I want to emphasize again on the FBI, it's not that we mind the FBI doing the work. We want to make sure that they are secure when they do it, and give them the funds to do it because they are stretched so thin defending us here against terrorists and defending us against gang and other criminal activities here, that it makes no sense for us to mandate that they would take those resources and spend them overseas without giving them the funds to do it.

   Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, once again my good friend from Virginia talks about equal justice; we agree. He talks about not acting with impunity; we agree. 
   That's why this minority when it was the majority passed the MEJA legislation in the first place. That is why we have covered the DOD contractors, their employees and dependents and the Armed Forces members. All of these individuals are already covered at this point in time if they are supporting a mission of DOD. 
   And we agree, the American people and most people in this House want us to reach out and get the bad actors. The only thing that they don't want us to do in the process is, one, jeopardize the intelligence operations that we could have, which this bill could easily do. 
   Number two, they don't want us to divert resources here from the United States in dealing with terrorism and gang activities and criminal activities here, or put our FBI agents in harm. 
   The third thing they don't want us to do is let bad actors do these things in Germany and Haiti wherever they may be sent just simply because we couldn't get the drafting right. 
   That is our point that we have been saying from the beginning. It is easy to have equal justice, not let contractors act with impunity, but write it in a good, rational basis that can be enforceable and not the kind of drafting that we have had brought forward in this legislation.

   Madam Chairman, once again we hear the words that we can and we must do this, and we agree. The only thing, we must do it with proper legislation. Once again, as we pointed out, I don't see how any Member of this Congress or many of our citizens across the country want us to take individuals who may be employees doing intelligence operations for us in any area, and simply because they have an allegation of a criminal act that may not even have been criminal in that area, that they may be doing it on an undercover basis, that we then have to have them exposed which this act could very easily do, and the linkage would only be because they were hired to do that particular act; and, therefore, expose the entire network in that intelligence operation. 
   They are the kinds of things that we could easily correct so that we could do this legislation and accomplish the intent of the legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, first of all, I am appreciative of all of the people who have worked on this legislation. I am appreciative of the comments we have had here. I think if we try to pick through the apples and the oranges and we look at what we have, we find that the intent of what we are trying to do is an intent that is shared by both sides of the aisle. 
   We don't want bad contractors. We don't want bad actors. We don't want people working in the name of the United States anywhere in the world that we aren't able to reach out and make sure that they are accountable. That's why this Congress previously on two different occasions has, one, passed the MEJA legislation and also expanded it. That's why we have already reached out and said if you are a member of the Armed Forces, we are going to reach out to you under MEJA and make sure that we hold you accountable. 
   That is why we have already said if you are an employee of DOD, we are going to reach out and hold you accountable. That is why we have already said if you are a civilian employee of any Federal agency in support of a DOD mission, we are going to hold reach out and hold you accountable. That is why we have already said if you are a contractor of DOD, we are going to reach out and hold you accountable. That's why we have said if you are a contractor of any other Federal agency and you are in support of a DOD mission, we are going to reach out and hold you accountable. That is why we have already said if you are a dependent of a member of the Armed Forces, we are going to hold you accountable. That is why we have already said if you are a dependent of a civilian employee of a DOD contractor, we are going to hold you accountable. Or if you are a dependent of a civilian employee of DOD, we are going to hold you accountable. 
   We do not have a problem, we encourage the reach-out, to hold accountable other contractors who might be working for other Federal agencies. But we think the wording in this bill, we could do much better. We hope that our friends in the Senate will sit down in a more bipartisan manner and correct those defects before this bill becomes law.  
   We believe a reading of the law does narrow the existing jurisdiction because we have added a phrase which is a limiter which means that it is within the proximity of the contingency operation. To many people listening to that debate, it is just words. But to the courts, it is litigation over what ``proximity'' means and it is a limiter which we believe could allow bad actors who could currently be brought under MEJA to escape liability. 
   In addition, we are very, very concerned in a world and in a day when we know that terrorists are out to get the United States that we not limit our intelligence operations. Why in the world we would want to expose some of those intelligence operations and the contractors that we have to hurting those intelligence networks when we could easily correct that is beyond me, especially in a day and age where we know that intelligence is so vitally important to the defense and the protection and the security of American citizens across the country. 
   Finally, Madam Chairman, it is of grave concern to us in what we are doing to the FBI, to enforce upon them, whereas before we have given them discretion. This is a mandate that they do investigations. It is a mandate that they furnish adequate personnel to do that. And to put them in a situation in a military conflict where they have to do these investigations is a concern for their security. 
   The second thing that it is a major concern of is diversion of assets that they are currently using in the United States to keep our citizens safe, to protect us from terrorists and gang activity, to protect us from other criminal activity here. If we are going to mandate that for them, at least let's put the funds there and make sure that we do it. 
   That is why I simply close the way I began by saying this is a bill that individuals will have to determine: Do they just simply want to vote for this bill in the hopes, and realizing that hope springs eternal, that perhaps the Senate can correct these defects before they become law and cast their vote because they agree, as I do, with the intent of this bill? Or do they cast a ``no'' vote even though they agree with the intent of the bill because they want to make sure that they have sent that signal over to our friends in the Senate that they want to protect our intelligence networks, protect the FBI, and make sure we expand, not decrease, the jurisdiction that we have. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, the manager's amendment purports to correct several flaws with this legislation. Unfortunately, the amendment offered by my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, misses the mark. It is one of those things that had we had the opportunity to work in a bipartisan way we could have corrected it. I don't have any pride of authorship, don't care who writes it. We just need to get it written correctly, and unfortunately, it's not written correctly as it's before us today. 
   H.R. 2740 imposes an unworkable and unnecessary geographic limitation on Federal jurisdiction to areas in ``close proximity'' to a contingency operation. The manager's amendment fails to correct this flaw. If the majority were serious about passing a good bill, it would have heeded the concerns of the Department of Defense that establishing extraterritorial jurisdiction based upon a tenuous link to geographic locations where a military presence can be found is impractical. Civilian criminal jurisdiction based on a nexus dependent upon a military ``contingency operation'' is ill-advised. 
   For instance, Madam Chairman, if the majority had consulted the Department of Defense, it would have learned that Secretary-designated contingency operations are rarely, if ever, used and are limited to operations with a view toward an enemy or opposing military force. 
   By-law designations, however, result from automatic actions during a war or a national emergency declared by the President or Congress, the scope of which may be unannounced, generally unknown, or imprecisely defined. 
   Thus, it will be next to impossible for Federal prosecutors to establish jurisdiction in a U.S. court based upon an indefinable proximity to a contingency operation at the time the offense occurred. 
   Moreover, the majority clearly did little to educate itself as to how the government currently investigates fraud or violent crimes committed by U.S. military personnel or contractors overseas. If it had, it would have learned that such investigations are not conducted solely by the FBI. 
   The FBI does not operate theater investigative units. Rather, legal attaches assigned to 70 embassies worldwide are the first point of contact for any overseas crime investigated by the FBI. The largest of these offices is currently in Baghdad, which operates the Iraq Contracting Fraud Task Force. 
   In addition, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of the DOD Inspector General, has been engaged in investigating DOD-related matters pertaining to the Iraqi theater, to include Kuwait, since the start of the war. 
   Likewise, the International Contract Corruption Task Force, which is known as ICCTF, combines the Department of Justice and FBI with Army CID, DCIS, SIGIR, IRS CID and other Inspectors General to investigate and prosecute procurement fraud. 
   Requiring the FBI to establish individual theater investigative units will disrupt the existing law enforcement partnerships and task forces. 
   This bill will also impose a heavy financial burden on the FBI with no additional funding from Congress and will most certainly detract from the FBI's duty to dismantle gang networks, combat child pornography and exploitation, and protect Americans from another terrorist attack. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   So we hope that the Senate will make these changes, Madam Chairman. We look forward to that. I think it's important for the American people and for the individuals that are defending this country.

   This amendment, Madam Chairman, expands the reporting requirement of the Department of Justice Inspector General to include a list of charges that have been brought against contractors and contract employees in Iraq and Afghanistan, a list of all criminal investigations and reports made with respect to contractors and contract employees in Iraq and Afghanistan in cases where no criminal charges were ultimately brought, and a description of the legal actions taken by the United States Government against contractors and contract employees in Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of a criminal charge or criminal investigation.     
   This is important information that Congress should be provided in order to make informed and accurate decisions regarding the investigation and prosecution of offenses by contractors overseas. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. FORBES. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This amendment requires the FBI to report annually to Congress the number of reports received of criminal misconduct by contractors, the number of reports received of fatalities caused by contract personnel, the number of cases referred to the Attorney General, and statutory changes necessary for the Director to carry out the duties entailed by this bill. 
   As I mentioned earlier in this debate, the creation of Theater Investigative Units within the FBI will hinder rather than help the investigation and prosecution of overseas crimes under MEJA. The creation of such units ignores the current framework of interagency cooperation amongst the Departments of Justice, Defense and State. 
   More importantly, these investigative units are in direct conflict with statutory mandates under other portions of MEJA. For instance, MEJA, under title 10, section 3262, requires the Secretary of Defense to authorize a person within the Department of Defense to arrest persons subject to MEJA. 
   H.R. 2740 does nothing to address this requirement with the conflicting requirement that the FBI establish Theater Investigative Units. Which agency will take custody, detain and transfer suspects arrested under MEJA? 
   MEJA allows suspects to be transferred to authorities of a foreign country for trial in certain circumstances. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for determining which officials of a foreign country constitute appropriate authorities. Will the Secretary now be required to make this decision for contractors not associated with military operations or will this decision fall to the FBI and, if so, under what authority? 
   MEJA allows initial court proceedings to occur while the covered person is outside of the United States. When this occurs, MEJA requires that a suspect be appointed counsel by a Federal magistrate judge. Such a counsel is designated a qualified military counsel, which is designed as a judge advocate made available by the Secretary of Defense. So now will a contractor who isn't associated with military operations be assigned a military judge advocate to be his counsel? Or will the Department of Justice be required to designate qualified civilian counsel for nonmilitary contractors and under what authority? 
   Clearly, there are numerous flaws with the creation of FBI Theater Investigative Units. This amendment does not alleviate any of these concerns. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support House Resolution 826 to condemn the vicious act of hanging a noose with the intent to intimidate and terrorize. Our country's tragic history of brutal, racially motivated lynchings will be forever associated with the vile symbol of the hanging noose. 
   The noose was used to instill fear in African Americans during our Nation's struggle to protect the civil rights of all Americans. During our country's period of reconstruction following the Civil War, the infamous Ku Klux Klan and others used lynching to strike fear into the hearts of African Americans. Lynchings were used to dehumanize their victims, who were often horribly tortured and disfigured before they were hung by a mob. 
   Today, everyone should recognize that the stark image of a dangling noose, intended to intimidate and terrify, should be condemned in the strongest of terms. And those who are ignorant of the terrifying history of the symbol of the dangling noose must be educated, such that they understand its grotesque history and come to never see its use as a harmless prank. 
   There have been a disturbing number of recent incidents in which nooses have been found under suspicious circumstances. Those incidents are being investigated, and must be investigated. But we should also be aware that some of these incidents may have been motivated by the perverse desire for publicity. On Sunday, the Baltimore Sun reported on a hoax in which a firefighter who reported finding a knotted rope and a threatening note with a drawing of a noose in an East Baltimore station house last month had placed the items there himself. 
   We also know of an instance in which another symbol of hate, a swastika, was drawn on the door of a Jewish student at George Washington University, but she later confessed to drawing the swastika herself after she was caught doing so on a security camera. 
   We should recognize today that those who use symbols of hate for any improper reason, including to get attention for one's own cause, are contributing just as much to an atmosphere of intimidation as those who do so motivated by hate for another group. 
   Finally, I want to note that while I support this resolution, one of its provisions states that any use of the noose symbol as a means of intimidation that constitutes a crime ``should be vigorously prosecuted.'' That provision should be viewed in light of the Department of Justice's policy on the Federal prosecution of juveniles. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this, and I reserve the balance of my time.

   Perpetrators of genocide have committed some of the most heinous crimes ever carried out. Genocide is a crime not only against specific victims targeted for extermination, but it is also a crime against humanity. History is replete with horrible images of human suffering, where victims targeted were based on their human characteristics. In the modern era, we have technological advances used for carrying out heinous acts of genocide. 
   The idea that individuals, hundreds, thousands, and sometimes hundreds of  thousands, are singled out and systematically targeted for extermination offends every person's belief in humanity or the rule of law. In recent decades, we have seen ethnic cleansing during the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, systematic mass killings in other areas, and of course there is the ongoing suffering in Darfur.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join those voices in support of H.R. 3791, the Securing Adolescents from Exploitation-Online Act of 2007, otherwise known as the SAFE Act. 
   Child pornography is a profitable, global criminal enterprise and is growing rapidly in technical sophistication in response to efforts to detect and disrupt these criminal operations. It is despicable in its scope and in its vicious victimization of children. 
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that 50,000 child predators are online at any time searching for potential victims. The Internet is a virtual playground for sexual predators, who satiate their desire for child pornography with relative anonymity. 
   H.R. 3791, the SAFE Act, would, first of all, strengthen the requirements applicable to Internet service providers to report violations of child pornography laws, and second, provide limited liability to ISPs, telecommunications carriers, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in connection with the reporting to law enforcement agencies of child pornography violations. 
   This legislation is a good first step in addressing the problem of child pornography. However, there is much more that needs to be done. In February 2007, Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Smith and I introduced H.R. 837, the Internet SAFETY Act of 2007, a comprehensive proposal to provide law enforcement with the tools and resources needed to deal with the problem of child pornography. Unfortunately, the majority has chosen not to consider this vital proposal. I am hopeful that the majority will bring H.R. 837 up for consideration by the Judiciary Committee and then to the House floor. 
   Our children deserve as much protection as we can provide. They are vulnerable victims of the child pornography industry. We need to do more. A first step is good, but we cannot stop here. We must keep moving forward to keep our children safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1759, the Managing Arson Through Criminal History (MATCH) Act of 2007. 
   I want to first commend my colleagues from California, Congresswoman Bono and Congressman Schiff, for their hard work on this legislation. 
   My colleagues from California know all too well the devastation that arson causes. The wildfires that burned across much of southern California in October killed 14 people and injured as many as 70 others. The fires touched over a half million acres from Los Angeles to the Mexican border and displaced 513,000 people from their homes. Costs in San Diego County alone were projected to exceed $1 billion. 
   Sadly, just 2 weeks ago, another fire in Malibu, California destroyed 35 homes and forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents. Two of the October fires, the Santiago fire in Orange County and the Buckweed fire in Los Angeles, we now know were set deliberately. 
   Many arsonists begin by starting small fires and then escalate to larger and larger fires to increase their sense of excitement. Unfortunately, only 17.1 percent of arson offenses result in convictions nationwide because the evidence needed to convict these arsonists is often destroyed in the fire. 
   As arsonists become more sophisticated in their technique, identifying them and prosecuting them becomes more challenging. Each year, an estimated 267,000 fires are caused by arson. In recent years, arson has been used to burn churches and protest urban sprawl. But the ongoing threat remains those who set fires to get a rush and feed a compulsion. 
   We may never be able to fully prevent wildfires, but we can implement tools to help prevent arsonists, particularly serial arsonists, from eluding law enforcement and escaping punishment. 
   The MATCH Act creates a national arson registry and requires criminal arsonists to report where they live, work, and go to school. In addition, the bill requires the national database to include finger and palm prints and an up-to-date photograph. The MATCH Act will assist law enforcement officials with identifying and apprehending arsonists, particularly serial arsonists and eco-terrorists. 
   I want to once again thank Congresswoman Bono and Congressman Schiff for working with the committee staff to make a number of important bipartisan changes to the original bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding and for his leadership on the Armed Services Committee throughout the years. 
   I rise today in strong support of the conference agreement for the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. I also want to take a moment to thank Chairman Skelton and Mr. Hunter for their leadership and hard work in getting us to this point. 
   This conference report is the culmination of 102 House Armed Services Committee hearings, a comparable number of informational briefings and untold hours of debate and discussion with our friends in the Senate. This bill reflects our strong and continued support for the brave men and women of the United States armed services, and I thank both of these gentlemen for moving forward a robust, bipartisan Defense authorization bill. 
   I also want to thank Mr. Ortiz, my subcommittee chairman and good friend, for his outstanding leadership of the Readiness Subcommittee. 
   This conference report provides funding authorization and support for our military and civilian personnel serving in the global war on terrorism while at the same time seeking to reverse declining trends in readiness. 
   Major highlights include: It provides $18.4 billion for the Army and $8.6 billion for the Marine Corps to address equipment reset requirements. It provides $980 million for critical National Guard equipment. It authorizes $1 billion for the Strategic Readiness Fund. It establishes the Defense Materiel Readiness Board. It requires quarterly rating and reporting of National Guard readiness for homeland defense missions. It provides a 3.5 percent pay increase to our men and women in uniform. It increases the end strength in the Army and the Marine Corps to improve readiness and meet the threats of the 21st century. It authorizes $2.8 billion in military construction funding to support these end-strength increases. And it authorizes funding to examine the national security interagency process. As many of you know, this is an issue that is overdue for reform, and many of us are pleased to see this begin to be examined more closely. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are all very aware that our continued global presence and ongoing combat operations are taxing current readiness levels. We also know that all of the military services are facing aging equipment inventories and are in need of recapitalization and modernization funding. Striking the balance between sustaining readiness today and ensuring a healthy, ready force tomorrow is a vast and complex challenge. This conference report strikes a good balance between sustaining what we've got while ensuring a well-trained, all-volunteer force with modern equipment will be available in the future. 
   This conference report deserves your support.

At the time, people called it unreasonable and absurd to put a man where no human had stepped before, using technology that hadn't even been developed yet, and to do it in less than 10 years seemed impossible. 
   But what we saw come out of that decade was a Nation that continued to defy the odds and achieve the seemingly impossible. When Neil Armstrong opened the door of Apollo 11 and set foot on the surface of the moon, he embodied the very essence of America, combining our hopes, our dreams and our determination. Americans rose to the challenge and changed the course of history. 
   Today we face a new challenge. The national average for a gallon of gasoline is now $4.07. Gas prices have risen nearly 75 percent since the Democratic majority took control just a year and a half ago. And this isn't a coincidence. 
   The majority's policy since taking power has been to restrict domestic energy production and increase taxes and regulations on U.S. energy suppliers. Simple economics tells us that limiting the supply of oil will increase costs. At a time when families in my district and across the country are struggling every day to cope with skyrocketing prices and a slowing economy, this is outrageous and irresponsible. 
   We continue to get the bulk of our energy fossil fuels, and 60 percent of that comes from foreign nations that, in many cases, do not share our interests. This is not just an economic problem. It's a national security crisis that demands both short and long-term solutions. We must increase our oil supply in the short-term, but we must also launch a national effort to harness American innovation if we hope to succeed in the long-term. 
   Like the first Manhattan Project that was established to insure the security of our Nation during World War II, today our national security depends on our ability to produce reliable sources of energy to fuel our economy and our national defense, independent from other nations. 
   That's why I've introduced a bold new initiative that will put us on the path to energy independence. The New Manhattan Project for Energy Independence, H.R. 6260, challenges the United States to achieve 50 percent energy independence in 10 years, and 100 percent energy independence in 20 years tape, and establishes a commission to lay out a plan to get there. A lot of people had talked about it, but it was time to put forth a bill and do something about it. That's what H.R. 6260 does. 
   Additionally, the bill sets out seven major goals that will put our Nation on this path. The New Manhattan Project will bring together the best and brightest minds in our Nation and encourage American innovation by awarding major cash prizes to anyone who successfully reaches one of these goals. 
   Specifically, Americans will be challenged to develop ways to double CAFE standards to 70 miles per hour, while making these vehicles affordable to consumers; improve home and energy efficiency by 50 percent on a wide scale, develop a solar power plant that costs no more than a coal-consuming power plant; make the production and use of biofuels cost-competitive with standard gasoline fuel; safely and cheaply store carbon emissions from coal-powered plants; safely store neutralized nuclear waste; and lastly, to produce sustainable electricity from a nuclear fusion reaction. 
   The processes to reach these goals are neither simple nor cheap, and many Americans may think them impossible. To make it possible for the inventor, researcher or company that achieves any of these goals, my proposal would provide significant cash prizes to the first person who reaches each of these goals. And to assist those who have promising ideas in these areas to help our country achieve energy independence, $10 billion will be set aside for grants to fund promising lines of research. In total, this bill would supply the same level of resources on the same scale as the original Manhattan Project, which is a total of $24 billion. 
   It is, in fact, possible that even after the major investments proposed in this bill, we may not be 100 percent energy  independent. But even if one of these goals is achieved, the impact would literally transform the energy sector. And if every one of these ambitious goals is reached, our country would be free from our addiction to foreign oil, and we will have guaranteed our economic and national security tape for future generations.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. It's my pleasure to rise in strong support of this bill tonight. I also want to express my feelings about what a rare moment this is in Congress when you can have a committee like this where the members on both sides of the aisle have such friendships, where they are able to work together in a bipartisan solution to defend this country, and where they can pass a bill of this magnitude unanimously, and that is due in large measure to the leadership of our chairman, Chairman Skelton, also to the leadership of our ranking member, DUNCAN HUNTER, and to the chairman of our Readiness subcommittee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ortiz). 
   We've heard a lot of people today talk about the great leadership of DUNCAN HUNTER. The truth is that we could stand here all night and we wouldn't say enough because there is and has been no greater champion for the men and women that we have in uniform and for the national defense of this country than DUNCAN HUNTER. DUNCAN, we appreciate your great work. 
   This is a good bill. This bill provides more than $550 million in funding above the President's request to address much-needed equipment, repairs, and maintenance that will particularly help the National Guard and the Reserves. When you add that to the additional depot maintenance provided in the bill, it's a great step towards restoring readiness. 
   Additionally, the bill provide $650 million to increase funding to repair aging barracks for the Army and Marine Corps. We also send a clear message that this committee and this Congress is going to fully fund and implement the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure round by the September, 2011 deadline, and we are not going to forget the communities that are impacted by BRAC, especially those that will have large increases of students because we are going to provide the new Federal education funds immediately rather than making them wait for the next year. 
   While so many of the provisions make this a good bill, there are two points where I think we can do better, and I hope we do so in the conference with the Senate. In the first case, this bill explicitly prohibits public-private competition for 3 years, competitions that could have saved the military billions of dollars and avoided costs which they could use for additional weapons, additional personnel, additional benefits. The government does not have a monopoly on good ideas. If a company can prove in a fair and open competition that it can do the government's work for less, that company should have the opportunity. 
   In the second case, there is a very well-intended provision to ensure we have world class facilities at the new Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Unfortunately, the more we have learned about the impact of this provision, the more I am concerned that it would result in broken construction contracts and delays that would cost the taxpayers millions of dollars in redesign and construction costs, with no tangible benefit to our servicemen and women. 
   With those exceptions, I am extremely proud of this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, as it will do much to restore the readiness of our military.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTION OF MODELING AND SIMULATION TECHNOLOGY TO THE SECURITY AND PROSPERITY OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Madam Speaker, while nearly all Members of this body have benefited from the application of modeling and simulation, or M-and-S, technology in one way or another, I want to briefly describe what we are talking about when we discuss Modeling and Simulation technology. ``Modeling and Simulation'' simply refers to replicating a system on a smaller scale or on a computer for extensive analysis. 
   For example, we can test a new airplane in a wind tunnel without risking human life and without building full-scale airplanes. The benefits and applications of this technology are immediately obvious: we can learn about a system in a more cost-effective, timely, and safer manner than analyzing the real thing. And furthermore, we can simulate thousands of scenarios over and over again on a computer when it is too hazardous, expensive, or impossible to perform a real-world experiment.  
   So in short, M-and-S tools allow us to understand complex interactions that would otherwise be impossible to comprehend using other means. If modeling and simulation technology sounds like it has the promise to dramatically change the way we apply science in the world, the fact is, that is has already done so--and this resolution seeks to recognize the countless efforts of the professionals who have taken this technology and applied it to make the United States a safer and more prosperous Nation. 
   The impact of Modeling and Simulation technology is felt in the private sector, academia, government, and across all disciplines. M-and-S tools have streamlined the design and manufacturing of cars, homes, boats, and airplanes. 
   M-and-S software designed in Illinois is assisting automotive engineers to design engines that are more efficient while reducing emissions. M-and-S analysis is also used in the engineering of major roads, bridges, harbors, railways, and airports--all of which lead to increased transportation capacity and safety. 
   At the United States Joint Forces Command in the Fourth Congressional District in Virginia, M-and-S tools have accelerated the effectiveness of joint and interagency exercises run by the Command. One of their experimentation projects is to enhance our national security by running scenarios in an urban combat environment. Their goal is to provide ``lessons learned'' for our troops in theater before they encounter the same situation on the ground. 
   Because of these kinds of valuable contributions, this resolution honors modeling and simulation by recognizing it as a National Critical Technology. A National Critical Technology refers to those technologies that are essential to develop in order to ensure the long-term national security and economic prosperity of the United States. I have already mentioned how modeling and simulation has broadly contributed to our national security and the economic prosperity, but let me name a few specific examples: 
   During the Manhattan Project, it was early models and simulations that allowed scientists to a developed understanding of nuclear chain reactions that ultimately led to the end of World War II. 
   America's military have used simulators to train personnel for flying aircraft and ships, and now they use simulators to train soldiers and marines to detect roadside IEDs. 
   Additionally, in the past, medical malpractice insurance rates have included artificially high premiums because it was difficult to reduce the number of medical errors for certain medical procedures that were not routinely performed. Today, however, insurance discounts are being provided to anesthesiologists and obstetricians who include simulated procedures in their biennial training requirements. 
   I commend those that have used M-and-S tools to make great contributions to this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. FORBES. (RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTION OF MODELING AND SIMULATION TECHNOLOGY TO THE SECURITY AND PROSPERITY OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Madam Speaker, in addition to formally recognizing modeling and simulation contributions, H. Res 487 urges Congress to continue to invest in critical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM education--disciplines that are essential to the expansion of modeling and simulation technology. Previous Congresses, as well as this Congress, have demonstrated a deep commitment to furthering STEM education. Because the skills required for modeling and simulation develop over a long period of time--it is essential that we begin to develop these critical skills in our children now. 
   Already, academic programs for modeling and simulation have sprung up across the country, at places such as Texas A&M and at the Virginia Modeling and Simulation Center based out of Old Dominion University. There, nearly 100 modeling and simulation professionals seek new ways to apply this technology. 
   We must invest now rather than later, and I applaud the efforts of the Administration and this House towards that end. This investment is particularly valuable as other countries continue to produce more engineers than we graduate each year. 
   This resolution is also meant to bring to the attention of this body, that policy decisions made in Congress and in the Administration can either accelerate the implementation of this technology, or unnecessarily slow its growth. That's why for the past 2 years, leaders in modeling and simulation from government, academia, and the private sector from around the country have come together in Virginia to identify the key policy challenges that are affecting the modeling and simulation industry. 
   For example, since last year, there has been a prohibition in place that prevents the Department of Defense from purchasing any flight simulator using a services contract. Now, if that prohibition had been in place just one year earlier, the Army's Flight School Twenty One at Fort Rucker, Alabama, would not have had the chance to revolutionize the way the Army's future aviators train. Because the prohibition came into affect after the service contract was signed, the Army was able to incorporate modern simulations into the heart of the training curriculum. As lawmakers, we ought to be aware of these policies, how they came about, and whether they are still valid or have outlived their usefulness. 
   When we recognize a technology that has been instrumental to our Nation, it follows that we should also understand the workforce that is producing these accomplishments. The professionals who make up the modeling and simulation community are scientists, mathematicians, programmers, and analysts. And unfortunately, we do not know much about them in part because they do not fit neatly into any current category as defined by the Department of Labor. There is also no nationwide estimate of how large the modeling and simulation community is; or whether our education system is producing an adequately technical workforce. So the government's classification of occupational codes is another area where Federal policy impacts modeling and simulation technology. 
   As many of my colleagues know, the Department of Labor uses classification codes to identify and describe many occupations. The codes identify the projected job market, and the typical skills, education, and experience requirements. Particularly for occupations related to critical technologies such as modeling and simulation, it is important that we identify these details. With this information, we can learn if the number of technical graduates each year can match expected modeling and simulation job growth, and we can identify the economic impact this industry has had across the country. 
   Madam Speaker, as Members consider their vote on this measure today, I would encourage my colleagues to keep in mind how this technology can break some of the logjams that seem to know no solution. For instance,  medical errors persist even in the best hospitals. But, these errors could likely be reduced if we can train our medical professionals in situations that replicate the most common errors or scenarios without ever seeing a patient. Simulation can also extend the value of each defense dollar, which will only become more important as rising entitlement spending squeezes overall discretionary spending, which includes defense spending. 
   We can increase the opportunity for interagency cooperation by decreasing the financial and time costs associated with exposing department-long bureaucrats to other agencies. One way to do this is through simulated exercises and interagency education and training. Just five years ago, a large scale defense exercise was run with many personnel in real-time. It required 5 years, 14,000 personnel, and 250 million dollars. 
   This year, a recent interagency exercise at U.S. Joint Forces Command was conducted to practice responding to a natural and a man-made disaster. It required only 5 months, 140 personnel and 2 million dollars to develop. Madam Speaker, the price of many things that the government buys only goes up with time. But, with modeling and simulation, we can improve the value of each taxpayer's dollar by saving money on personnel costs, equipment, and time. 
   Modeling and Simulation also contributed to finding a solution to the concerns of nuclear testing. For a long time, there was a tension between wanting to have certainty in the reliability of our nuclear stockpile that at the time, was believed to only be achieved by live testing. But there were also concerns that more testing by the United States would negatively impact our nuclear nonproliferation efforts. Fortunately, an acceptable solution came in the form of modeling and simulation. 
   At the Government's Department of Energy national laboratories in California and New Mexico, modeling and simulation tools serve as a foundational element of the National Nuclear Security Administration's Stockpile Stewardship Program, which enables the President of the United States to certify the safety security and reliability of nuclear stockpile for more than 10 years without the use of live nuclear testing. So, we are able to have full certainty as to the readiness of our primary deterrent, while also demonstrating the Nation's commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. 
   Madam Speaker, we are at the tip of the iceberg as to what other issues modeling and simulation can address. I urge passage of this resolution that commends past modeling and simulation successes, and which presents a glimpse of the kinds of issues this House must address in the future to advance the benefits of this technology for the security and economy of this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately some things never change, and unfortunately this bill happens to be one of them. No matter how dangerous law enforcement says this bill is, it hasn't changed. No matter how dangerous the intelligence community says it is, this bill hasn't changed. And unfortunately there is a cycle that won't change either, and that cycle is simply this. 
   In the nineties, we cut our intelligence capabilities. On 9/11/2001, we had the worst terrorist attack that has ever hit our shores. Since that time our intelligence community and our law enforcement people have worked hard and they have kept us safe. But if we have another hit, and this bill puts us on the same cycle, because what are we doing now? We are cutting our intelligence capabilities once again, like we did in the nineties. If we have another terrorist attack, the cycle will repeat itself, and they will bring back in law enforcement and they will point their fingers and they will say, why didn't you stop it? 
   Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity tonight not to repeat that cycle by not passing this bill and making the amendments necessary to keep our intelligence strong.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit I have offered is straightforward. It preserves the ability of our intelligence community to protect America's national security. 
   We all agree that it is important to hold contractors liable for criminal acts that they commit while working overseas. No one is above the law. But, unfortunately, H.R. 2740 in its present form will have significant dangerous consequences to the intelligence community and the vital role it plays in protecting America. The motion to recommit clarifies the application of H.R. 2740 to ensure that critical intelligence activities will be able to continue. 
   The majority in its haste to score political points has ignored the intelligence community's concerns about the implications of the bill. Let me take a moment to outline some of the specific concerns that the majority has ignored. 
   First, H.R. 2740 covers all agents of any Department or agency of the United States, including clandestine assets. If a clandestine asset was implicated in a crime, investigating and arresting that asset under traditional criminal procedures could expose other assets and compromise critical intelligence activities. 
   Second, H.R. 2740 extends United States criminal jurisdiction without regard to the nationality of the offender. Host country nationals serving or assisting sensitive assets could become criminally liable for a felony violation of U.S. law and undermine critical intelligence activities. 
   Third, H.R. 2740 applies the entire criminal code to the new category of potential offenders and could implicate the authorized business of the intelligence community employees and contractors. 
   The bill also does not limit criminal liability to activities that occur in the course of employment, whether committed on duty or off duty, and increases the risk of exposing intelligence activities. 
   We agree with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that we must hold everyone accountable under the law. Our criminal code is aimed at ensuring peace and order in our country and should not be applied internationally to every aspect of our Nation's foreign activities. 
   Our country relies on our intelligence community to preserve our national security and protect our citizens. We must legislate responsibly when it comes to applying our criminal code to overseas activities. Preserving our critical intelligence operations is paramount. Politics has no role in this decision. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the motion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Speaker, as you listen to this debate and those watching at home listen to it, the only thing that they hear are Democrats saying one thing and Republicans saying another thing. They don't know who to believe. They listen to the debate and they hear hatred of the Presidency and hatred of Republicans. But, Mr. Speaker, we just invite you today, take a moment and a breath and put all of that hatred on the shelf for just a second, and to remember that the Director of National Intelligence, not an appointee from President Bush but from President Clinton, has stated that their approach will be devastating to the intelligence-gathering capability of the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, here are the facts that we know. In the late 1990s, we cut intelligence. Then we had 9/11 where we had the worst terrorist attack to ever hit our shores. Since that time, regardless of who did it and deserves the credit, we have not had a major terrorist attack hit the United States, and now we are trying to repeat the cycle and cut intelligence-gathering capability again. We all know what is going to happen if, and some would say when, another terrorist attack hits. We are going to bring law enforcement in and we are going to point our finger at them and say: Why didn't you stop it? 
   Mr. Speaker, just recently we had one of our NFL football coaches get in trouble because he was trying to steal the signals of an opposing team. Everyone argued and agreed that wasn't fair. And they were right; but that was a game. Mr. Speaker, in this particular situation it is not a game. We don't want a fair fight. We want to steal every signal we can from enemies who are trying to harm this Nation, and we want to know what they are doing before they do it so we can protect and defend this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just invite us to take the hatred off the shelf, take the rhetoric off the shelf, and to exchange it for ration and reason so we can do what we need to do to gather the intelligence to keep our people safe.

   Mr. FORBES. Madam Speaker, today when the sun comes up on America, there are all too many people who spend all too much time criticizing and apologizing for this Nation, trying to verbally tear it down. But what frightens us most is those people who spend way too much energy and way too much time trying to do harm to innocent Americans as they go about their day-to-day lives, carrying their children to piano recitals, to Little League practice, just going to work. It just makes common sense that we would want to know what they were trying to do, because if we know, we have at least a chance to stop it. 
   This is a bipartisan bill that we should have had a year ago. We certainly should have had 4 months ago. Thank goodness we have it today. The only unfortunate thing is those who will benefit the most will never know it, because they never became victims because we were able to stop those terrorist acts before they took place.

   Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, the amendment I have at the desk is a simple, straightforward amendment. This amendment says that none of the funds under the Economic Support Fund may be made available to Ethiopia. 
   In 2005, Ethiopia held democratic elections for the first time. As in any election, there were winners and losers. The opposition party won so many seats in that election that the ruling party immediately moved to limit the power of the parliament, stripping it of the power to craft a budget and allowing discussion exclusively on issues approved by the prime minister. 
   When protests grew after several members refused to participate in the new government, violence ensued; and the opposition political leaders were arrested. Thousands of protesters were arrested since October 31, 2005; and, thankfully, most of them have been released. However, nearly 2 years later, 38 prisoners from the protest remain incarcerated.
