<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (HIGH ENERGY PRICES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, today the low-income families and other disadvantaged Americans are disproportionately affected by high energy prices. 
   Just to be clear, this is about low income. It's about the poor. It's about veterans, seniors and children. We have reached a point where our poorer citizens are spending greater and greater percentages of their limited income on energy. 
   With the average cost of fuel more than $4.05 per gallon, some now have to determine whether they can get to work or even buy food. This price tag and the fact that this body hasn't done anything about it are wreaking havoc on the daily lives of Idahoans and Americans across the Nation. 
   Just last week I talked to a woman from Idaho whose husband is disabled and not eligible to receive disability benefits. She is the sole source of income for her family. She was worried about just being able to afford to get to work. 
   It's time for partisanship to be put aside. It's time for Congress to act, and it's time to increase American production of crude oil and natural gas.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because of my serious concerns with section 4 of H.R. 1309. 
   As I begin, let me emphasize that I support the intent of H.R. 1309. Transparency in government is an important priority. I campaigned on it and voted for the new ethics package that came before this House in early January with the hope that Congress might be more openly accountable to those who elected us. 
   This is a government of, by, and for the people, and the people deserve to know what their government is doing. Except for critical issues of national security policy, there must be a much better level of openness in the conduct of the Federal Government and the access of the American people to information about it. 
   However, section 4 of the bill before us, as it is currently drafted, appears to authorize Federal courts to award attorneys' fees to a plaintiff even when the opposing parties mutually reach and execute a settlement agreement. 
   The policy of FOIA is, and should be, to expedite and streamline production of documents falling within the statute. My concern is that when a Federal statute provides attorneys' fees after the parties mutually reach a voluntary settlement, it runs contrary to that very goal. Resolution short of protracted litigation should be encouraged, not discouraged. The current proposed language of section 4 of H.R. 1309 may have a devastating, perverse effect. 
   Second, the statute may further allow plaintiffs to receive attorneys' fees in almost any case they file so long as they can show that the defending government agency, for any reason, changed its position once the case had been commenced. 
   While it is true that FOIA complainants often face an uphill battle when they deal with a Federal agency, the language, as proposed, invites litigation instead of resolving it. Additionally, the legislation, as drafted, may actually undermine the stated ``dominant objective'' of the act by giving an incentive by Federal Departments to avoid disclosure. 
   The question this raises in my mind, Mr. Speaker, is that given the provisions of section 4 of the bill, why would any agency settle? As I read the bill, once a lawsuit is commenced, any change in position by a Federal Department or agency would be tantamount to an admission of liability for attorneys' fees. This would only encourage the filing of a myriad of lawsuits. If lawyers know they will make money no matter what the outcome, they will see this as a great opportunity to file, file, and file again. We will likely see a cottage industry for litigants who may not even care about the underlying documents. 
   Because of the concerns I have that the current proposal provides incentives to prolong litigation, I cannot support this measure in its current form. I regret that because I want to vote for any bill that prudently opens the door of government to those whom government represents, our fellow citizens. But the law of unintended consequences is at play here, and unless we strike section 4, we will see massive new litigation that will only clog the Federal docket, hamstring legitimate functions of government, and cost taxpayers potentially untold millions of dollars.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would remove language from H.R. 985 that would prohibit dissent with respect to scientific research. 
   I filed my amendment because I believe it is inappropriate to attempt to shoehorn the debate about public policy influencing science into this legislation, thus turning it into a personnel issue to be litigated in the courts. 
   As set forth by section 13 of the bill, the dissemination of ``false or misleading technical information'' is deemed to be an ``abuse of authority'' upon which a Federal authority can make a protected disclosure. 
   The problem is that on scientific issues, the question of what is false or misleading is often a difficult question on which reasonable people can disagree, and on which sometimes scientific authorities have a hard time making up their minds. Are eggs good for you or bad for you? Is milk good for you or bad for you?  
   Section 13 of this bill has significant implications upon the development of scientific research conducted by the government, including research and development work at the Defense Department, as well as federally funded research on health and related issues. By including the science provisions in this bill, I am concerned that we are opening the door for debates in science to become the basis of litigation. Putting the threat of litigation on a healthy debate of science is not good public policy. 
   Furthermore, this clause potentially makes the tension between ethics and science the subject of litigation. For example, federally funded scientific research on human cloning should be debated amongst policymakers and agency officials without fear of retaliation by scientists and researchers. If an agency or the administration disagrees with the findings of a particular scientist, we should not be opening up our judicial system for those disagreements to be litigated as Federal employee personnel issues. That hardly seems like a responsible policy. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose turning science into a personnel issue to be litigated in the courts. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Chairman, our great country was founded on the recognition of the most basic rights of mankind, that all persons are created equal and endowed by their Creator, with the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Yet for decades this conviction wasn't perfectly realized because of the blight of slavery, which we fought a civil war to end. 
   Tragically, this is not just a long-past episode in human history. Human trafficking, frequently referred to as modern-day slavery, is an ugly reality not only in the developing world, but also in the United States. Our country is the destination of thousands of people trafficked for purposes of sexual and labor exploitation. 
   Between October 2000 and March 2007, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had certified nearly 1,200 victims of human trafficking. As Americans, we must defend the dignity of human life. 
   With my amendment, I propose to designate $2 million of the monies appropriated in this bill for the formation of a task force to combat this barbaric trade coming across our borders in the States of Washington, Idaho and Montana. This task force would join 42 other such task forces nationwide in serving as a cooperative effort between State and local governments, NGOs and compassionate citizens all working together. 
   The northern border of our country is a point of entry for this horrific practice. In 2004, it was estimated there were between 1,500 and 22,000 people trafficked through Canada to the United States, numbers that some observers believe significantly understate the problem. 
   Currently, however, there are no human trafficking task forces along most of the northern borders of Washington, Idaho and Montana, yet these same States cover more than half of the northern land border of the United States, hundreds of miles of which are extremely rural and rugged, being patrolled only by officers on horseback or even on foot, if patrolled at all. Given the rural nature of these northern borders, opportunities for human trafficking continue, with few resources available to the many rural communities along the same border. 
   By my amendment, I seek to make $2 million in the DOJ budget available in grant funds to establish the Tristate Task force to provide training and resources to rural communities in Washington, Idaho and Montana to combat human trafficking. This important task force will work to coordinate local efforts to combat modern-day slavery. 
   This measure goes to the heart of equality, dignity and worth of every person. I ask my colleagues to join me today in the defense of these essential American values and support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (DEMOCRATS NOT MOVING TOWARDS ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, every Member of this body recognizes the honor our constituents have reposed in us in allowing us to serve them here. For me to represent the people of my hometown, my home county, the entire western part of my State in the House of Representatives is an extraordinary honor. 
   Like all my colleagues, I try to remember why my constituents sent me here. Perhaps Thomas Jefferson captured best what our service here as Members of Congress should really be about, and I quote. ``A wise and frugal government, which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits in industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor and the bread it has earned.'' This philosophy is not reflected in the priorities of the new majority which, interestingly, celebrates Thomas Jefferson as its founder. 
   It has appeared to me over the past 6 months the priorities of the new majority are increasing government spending, growing the Federal bureaucracy and deepening America's dependence on foreign fuels. 
   In the past 3 months of the second quarter of this year, the new majority has approved more than $80 billion in new spending, new spending for programs, including a proposal to spend Idahoans' hard-earned tax dollars to pay off the student loans of practicing attorneys. At a time when the national debt is out of control, authorizing $80 billion in new spending just cannot be seen as fiscally responsible. 
   This new majority has also proposed an increase in Federal bureaucracy. Just recently I was in a hearing discussing legislation that would add yet another layer of red tape to Federal agencies in order to improve customer service. Adding another layer of government bureaucracy is far from frugal, but more ironically, since when has more government ever improved government? Since when has adding more government ever improved government? 
   Another priority of the new majority is the energy bill, which I've been calling the ``no energy'' bill. America should be moving towards energy independence. America's economy growth, Idaho's manufacturing and agriculture future and our families' ability to make ends meet are all intertwined. The new Democrat majority, however, is not moving towards energy independence. Rather, the ``no energy'' bill will only serve to increase America's dependence on foreign fuels. 
   In their bill, our friends across the aisle propose to curtail nearly all forms of domestic exploration and development, including resources of ANWR, natural gas reserves, offshore drilling reserves, oil shale deposits, nuclear power and hydropower. Such a policy can only increase America's reliance on foreign fuel. Instead, America should be fully engaged in exploration and development of domestic energy. 
   This exploration and development should be coupled with the development of alternative energy. The majority, however, proposes to bury the development of alternative biomass energy in a myriad of legal challenges and bureaucracy surrounding the so-called Clinton administration Roadless Rule. 
   The new majority's assault on energy development does not end there, instead extending the assault to one of the most green energies, wind energy. The new Democrat majority recently held a hearing to give ear to complaints that wind energy causes fatalities among the bird and bat populations of this country. Now, holding a hearing on bird and bat fatalities from wind energy does not just sound absurd; it is, particularly when you consider that many more times birds are killed by office windows, cars and trucks, and, of course, cats than by windmills. What's next, outlawing sky scrapers? Outlawing cars and trucks? 
   America's energy crisis must be solved. Continued reliance on foreign energy while simultaneously curtailing domestic development and exploration will only result in higher and higher fuel prices at the pump. That is an unacceptable result, and Congress must be committed to pursuing policies to reduce our dependence on foreign fuel. 
   Unfortunately, the priorities of the new majority, as evidenced over the second quarter, are not Idaho's priorities, and consequently, they are not  my priorities. In my view, Congress must make it a priority to cut spending, making the tough choices to live within its means. Congress must make it a priority to shape bureaucracy in Federal Government. And Congress must work to solve the energy crisis by providing for domestic exploration and development.

   Mr. SALI. Mr. Chairman, those recreating in Idaho, whether residents or tourists, will likely head to lands encompassed by this bill. More than 2 million acres in Idaho alone will be affected, which will in turn affect many of the uses enjoyed in Idaho, four wheelers and off-highway motorbikes, hunting, boating, and shooting. All of that today is at risk because of the legislation before us. 
   But more than just recreation is threatened by the bill. Federally managed public lands, treasured by so many, are in jeopardy of being cut off except to those who have the health and the strength to hike or perhaps to mountain bike. 
   My 84-year-old mother can only walk with a walker but still enjoys the outdoors. Mr. Chairman, look at that smile. I think everyone wishes that their mother could have that kind of enjoyment. With activities including off-highway vehicle use threatened under this bill, my mother and others like her will have no meaningful way to enjoy these lands. The same is true of people with disabilities. Today we are telling those individuals that these 2 million acres in Idaho and 26 million acres across the West will not be accessible to them and will only be available to a small segment of our society with very narrow uses. 
   Public lands should be available for everyone, including the elderly and people with disabilities, not just a select few. We can and must do better.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (ABORTION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, Mother Teresa once said: ``Any country that accepts abortion is the poorest of the poor.'' On that basis, I fear that our own great country is in serious trouble. 
   While current law forbids family planning agencies from using Federal funds for abortion, those same organizations are able to receive those title X funds for their other family planning services, even if the organizations also provide and even promote abortion. 
   Today, as long as the bookkeeping of the two divisions is kept separate, these organizations can reallocate their resources and free up money for providing abortions. In other words, it appears that an accounting gimmick masks the way Planned Parenthood uses Federal dollars to fund its abortion services. 
   As many know, Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of abortion in the country, performing more than 264,000 abortions in 2005 alone. However, Planned Parenthood receives more than $336 million from the Federal Government each year. Planned Parenthood affiliates enjoy special access to discount drugs, grants through the title X program, and a 90 percent Federal Medicaid match for family planning activities. In effect, Congress is playing favorites by subsidizing the largest business in the abortion industry. 
   Now, lest there be any confusion, abortion is an ``industry'' in every sense of the word. Abortion providers rake in over $400 million a year from women and girls who believe that they are receiving a simple health service. However, to the tune of $372 per abortion on average, abortion-providing businesses are turning a major profit. For instance, while Planned Parenthood reports that it is a ``not-for-profit'' organization, it had an ``excess of revenue over expenses'' of almost $56 million in 2005 and $112 million in 2006. Remember, this is the same organization that receives over $336 million in government grants and contracts each year. 
   I find it outrageous that taxpayer dollars are subsidizing abortion in the United States. The absurdity of this abuse is illustrated by the long-standing Mexico City policy. Instituted by Ronald Reagan in 1984, this policy prohibits foreign aid from going to nongovernmental organizations which provide or promote services related to abortion. If we recognize the importance of prohibiting foreign abortion providers from receiving our taxpayer dollars, how can our domestic policy be any different? 
   I also adamantly oppose funding for an organization like Planned Parenthood that is alleged to have committed substantial fraud. The former vice president of finance and administration of the Los Angeles Planned Parenthood affiliate estimates that affiliates in California overcharged State and Federal Governments by $180 million, despite internal and external warnings that its billing practices were improper. If Planned Parenthood is able to abuse its government support by as much as $180 million in California alone, imagine the possible magnitude of its fraud nationwide. 
   The Federal Government clearly has a significant interest in identifying and recovering those excess payments. However, I believe that any funds that support abortion are ``excess payments.'' 
   We in the Federal Government have no business providing money to help end a human life. As the Declaration of Independence makes clear, our Nation was founded on the idea that our Creator has endowed every person with ``certain unalienable Rights,'' the first of which is life. Now, 232 years after our predecessors signed that document in that First Continental Congress, now we have to ask, how is it possible that we in Congress are allowing the money of unsuspecting ordinary Americans to support businesses that specialize in terminating human life, when our Declaration of Independence recognizes that those are unalienable rights, the right to life? 
   We in Congress are charged by our Nation with the responsibility to ensure oversight of Federal funds, and it is abundantly clear that providing ``excess'' funds to abortion providers is not the proper use of taxpayer dollars. I call on my colleagues here in the House to end taxpayer subsidies of abortion by ending Federal support for Planned Parenthood. Let us thereby begin to restore the richness of spirit that Mother Teresa spoke about so eloquently.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Fire season is here and wildlands are in flames across the Nation as we speak. California is currently reporting 24 large fires, and along with California, there are large wildland fires burning in Arizona, Oregon, Washington, Virginia, and North Carolina. 
   Since January of this year, some 46,113 wildland fires have burned more than 2.71 million acres, destroying more than 461 residences, 15 commercial buildings, and 979 outbuildings. But it's not just property, homes, community, watersheds or livelihoods that are at stake when a wildland fire burns. Lives are also in danger, and since January of this year alone, eight firefighters have died while on duty to fight wildland fires. 
   For many areas of the country, the wildland fire season is just beginning. 
   This is an issue that I have familiarity with, as each year in Idaho the skies fill with smoke from fires. Last year alone, more than 2 million acres burned in Idaho, threatening lives, homes, and communities. 
   I commend the gentleman from West Virginia, my chairman, on his initiative to move a bill and bring this critical issue before the House of Representatives today. Real solutions to these deadly and growing wildfires must be found, and I appreciate his efforts to this end. 
   Regrettably, the bill before us today will not do enough to address the raging wildfires across this country. Communities, homes, and lives will remain at risk from wildland fires. 
   There is no question that there are budget issues that must be addressed. We require the Forest Service to fight these fires, while we have handcuffed that agency at the same time, whether through its budget or with forest management practices. 
   Over and over again on this floor, we have had discussions of how to pay for the measures that are passed by this body. And yet, the Forest Service used to provide a source of revenue. It used to manage Federal lands, selling the harvested timber and thereby bringing in revenue. 
   Today, in most areas, active harvesting and forest management is nonexistent on Federal lands. This has had a twofold effect. There's less and less money generated by the Forest Service, while there are also ever-growing fuel loads on federally managed lands. 
   I agree that we cannot expect an agency to budget for the very large wildland fires that we have seen develop over the last 6 or 7 years. To do that is something like asking an American family not only to budget for ordinary and foreseeable expenses, like dental care, health care and car repairs, but also to budget for a serious car accident or tragic health crisis that would eat up 50 percent of their entire budget for the year. 
   Yet that is the point we have reached with the Forest Service. Today, roughly 48 percent of the Forest Service's budget is dedicated to wildland fires, but we still expect the Service to be able to budget for these fires. 
   We agree there is a problem with the funding. Unfortunately, this bill doesn't fix that problem. While well-intended, this bill fails to correct the 10-year funding average problem we currently face. Even if it did, merely erasing and rewriting lines in a ledger book does nothing to fix the crisis on the ground in federally managed lands. Moving money to different accounts will not solve the problem. 
   While well-intentioned, unfortunately the bill before us today fails to address the more critical issue, forest management. The greatest obstacle our public land managers face in preventing catastrophic wildfires isn't dollars, it is having the ability to overcome mountains of red tape and lawsuits filed by extremists. The laws that Congress has created in an attempt to save our forests have now become the biggest obstacles to saving them from wildfires. 
   Congress should not be addressing funding for suppressing these large fires without addressing the cause of these large fires as well, the increasing and unchecked fuel loads in our national forests that surround or are adjacent to homes and communities. 
   The critical link between pre-fire forest management and fire fighting was illustrated at the hearing we had on this bill in the Natural Resources Committee in April. 
   During that hearing, Arizona Governor Jane Napolitano, a Democrat, testified that the 2006 woody fire near Flagstaff, Arizona, was halted before it reached 100 acres because of the hazardous fuels treatment that had been done in that area. And according to Governor Napolitano, those treatments dramatically minimized the fire's devastation. 
   Similarly, during that hearing our colleague Norm Dicks testified about the large fuel loads that continue to accumulate in Federal forests.     
   He pointed out that the larger fires have resulted from increasing tree density and fuel loads. 
   We will continue to have larger and larger fires until we reduce fuel-loading. Until we provide the tools for pre-fire forest management to reduce fuel-loading, the western United States will  continue to see homes burn, watersheds destroyed, and even lives lost. We must provide the tools to preempt these devastating fires, the kind of preemption pointed to by Governor Napolitano that protected so many people and homes in the 2006 Woody Fire near Flagstaff. 
   Last year, during the Poe Cabin fire in Idaho, in one area the fire moved some three miles in a mere 20 minutes. In that area, several homes that had defensible space around them due to fuel reductions on private land survived the fire, while other structures in that area without defensible space did not survive. 
   One of these homeowners was able to get his wife out while he stayed just a bit longer to finish loading his truck. However, because of the fast-moving and intense fire combined with the heavy fuel-loading on Federal ground, he became trapped by the fire and was unable to leave. While this could have quickly become a tragic story, this man lived and his home survived thanks to the fuel reduction that had been done around his home. 
   While this was a result of the fuel reduction done wholly on private ground, many communities and individuals abutting these forests do not have the luxury of enough land to adequately protect the communities, watersheds, homes and lives. Providing the tools to these communities to protect their homes, livelihoods and very lives from these devastating fires is something we can and must do when addressing long-term funding to suppress the fires. We should be discussing solutions like the one I proposed, H.R. 4245, to provide the agencies with one more tool to reduce hazardous fuel loads around communities and homes. 
   In the great State of Idaho, many communities have put the time and energy into developing Community Wildfire Protection Plans, but implementation of many of these plans has been significantly delayed in large part because of the NEPA process. These CWPPs, as my colleagues know, are cooperative plans, requiring community collaboration and input in the formation of the plan. By delaying treatment for the safety of communities through unbelievable red tape, we subject these communities to be threatened by large wildfires. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not only a bipartisan issue, this is a nonpartisan issue. It's about public safety and sound forest management that will benefit millions of Americans. My bill, which I would urge this body to take up as it addresses these wildland fires, would provide for a categorical exclusion from the NEPA process to provide another tool for timely treatments to protect these communities from large and devastating fires and preserve our pristine national forests. Too many homes have burned and too many lives have already been lost. We must provide real tools for firefighting. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I too rise today to commend the heroic efforts of firefighters throughout our Nation. At times they are called to pay the ultimate sacrifice to save the life and property of others. I have had the honor of meeting the men and women who fight these wildfires in my State of Idaho, and there is no greater example of courage than these folks. 
   I understand how important it is to provide firefighters who battle wildfires with the right tools they need to do their job. Threats to human life are compounded by the fact that more and more people are living in homes near the fire-prone forests, placing themselves and the firefighters who try to protect them at greater risk. 
   In April of this year, I offered an amendment to the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008 that allowed the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration to develop and distribute information on the importance of clearing biomass from Federal lands. This commonsense amendment will require USFA to work in consultation with other Federal agencies, such as the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, to ensure that the USFA provides the best possible recommendation. As we come upon another deadly  and costly fire season, this information is as vital as ever. We must provide our Federal employees, who are the best in the world, all of the tools they need to keep our communities and themselves safe from catastrophic wildfires. 
   I urge the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee to hold more hearings on the crisis situation in our Nation's forests. We have had just one hearing this year on the wildfire problem compared to six last Congress. I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to continue to work on providing firefighters and our public land management officials with the necessary tools they need to do their job. As firefighters risk life and limb to protect us, the least we can do is to provide them with everything they need. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, as I have walked around the halls of the office buildings for the House. I have noticed the signs that talk about the truth needing to be told regarding the majority's budget that was passed, the claim that while there is no tax increase in that budget, and technically that is true, Mr. Chairman. There is no language in that budget bill that says taxes are raised on anyone in any manner. There is no claim there are additional taxes. That language is not in that budget. 
   But the effect of that budget, Mr. Chairman, will be increased taxes. Why do I say that? Well, because the majority has been very vocal throughout the last year, through the last campaign season, that by golly, one of the things we need to do is get our spending under control, get this deficit problem under control. 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, the problem is not taxes at this point. The problem today, though, is the spending, because if the spending continues at the rate we are going, that the majority is proceeding, one of two things has got to happen: Either we have to increase deficit spending or we have to increase taxes to pay for it. 
   I would just point out that about $1 in $5 for the budget last year was deficit spending, so how does the majority intend to avoid deficit spending at the same rate that they criticized last year? And, in fact, how will they avoid increasing that deficit spending by spending more this year unless they intend to increase taxes. At some point that choice has got to be made. 
   Mr. Chairman, it starts with the spending. If we support this amendment, that will be a start in the right direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (MAKE THE R&D TAX CREDIT PERMANENT -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the subject of the R&D tax credit which lapsed on December 31 of last year. 
   One of this country's greatest strengths has been its ability to innovate, to create and develop new ideas. The lack of a competitive R&D tax credit here at home is driving American businesses to invest in R&D abroad. 
   In the last 5 years alone, over 100 global companies have established R&D centers in India due to the long-term benefits provided by that government. With benefits such as a 15-year phased income tax holiday, deductions for in-house R&D equal to 1 1/2 times the expenses incurred, coupled with accelerated tax deductions on prior period expenses, it is easy to see why companies are choosing to invest in India over the U.S., especially now that we have allowed our R&D tax credit to expire. 
   The R&D tax credit should be renewed and made permanent as soon as possible, to create jobs in America and ensure we will always be on the cutting edge of innovation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill to designate this Portland post office in the name of and memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   While I support this designation, I note with some disappointment that we are not also addressing rising fuel prices on this week's schedule. Dr. King spoke passionately about our Nation's moral obligation to make sure that the needs of the poor and the elderly are met. 
   American senior citizens and low-income households have been disproportionately affected by higher energy costs. In 2006, before the skyrocketing and record-breaking fuel price increases we are seeing today, low-income households in America spent nearly 20 percent of their income on energy-related expenditures. 
   This is a moral issue, an issue which, for many low-income families, senior citizens and hardworking families, affects their access to education, and even to their doctors. It's time for Congress to act on that moral obligation to take care of the poor and the elderly, and lift the restrictions on America's energy rich public lands to increase exploration for and production of American crude oil and natural gas, and do so in an environmentally friendly manner.

   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5477 designating this post office in the name of Chi Mui. 
   While I rise in support of this resolution, I again rise to urge my colleagues to address rising fuel prices. Chi Mui's efforts to improve his community are  akin to the efforts of America's charitable organizations that seek to meet the needs of Americans all across our lands. Today, as Americans across this country pay $3.98 per gallon at the pump, these prices hit nearly every facet of life, including those charities providing care for many Americans in need. 
   One Tennessee paper reported today on the effects these prices are having on charities, and it says, ``Nonprofit agencies and charities that rely on voluntary drivers to help carry out their work say soaring gas prices are forcing volunteers to scale back or even stop driving. This means there are fewer people to drive cancer patients to treatment and fewer people to deliver food to the needy.'' 
   Congress has a moral obligation to address rising fuel prices by immediately lifting the restrictions on America's energy-rich public lands to increase exploration for and production of American crude oil and natural gas and to do so in an environmentally friendly manner.

   Mr. SALI. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   Today, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 138, supporting National Men's Health Week. Not only should we be recognizing this important health issue this week, but Congress should also be addressing other issues critical to the American people, especially rising fuel prices. 
   As Americans across this country pay an average of $3.98 per gallon, these prices hit families, and particularly school children. Just yesterday, the Calhoun Times reported in Georgia that, and I quote, ``High gas prices hit high school sports. With gas prices soaring to record heights, the cost of taking teams on the road has become a looming storm on the horizon of high school athletics that has led some to worry what the future may have in store. All across the country, people are dealing with the pinch of high gas prices. With high school teams' main mode of transportation still the average school bus, which runs on diesel, costs are even higher.'' 
   This is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. We need to act now to lower gas prices.

   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. 
   I rise in support of H. Res. 923, recognizing the 150th anniversary of the great State of Minnesota. While I rise in support and recognition of this anniversary, I also rise to remind my colleagues that we must address rising fuel prices. 
   Some have blamed rising fuel prices on those who own and manage big oil companies. In a recent study, however, Robert Shapiro, Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs under President Bill Clinton, found that the vast majority of oil and natural gas company shares are owned broadly by middle-income Americans through mutual funds, pension funds and individual retirement accounts, while a mere 1.5 percent of the shares of public oil companies are owned by company executives. That means that when Congress levies additional taxes on oil companies, the American public will pay for that tax in one of two ways; either through their pension or mutual funds, or by paying a higher price at the pump. 
   Mr. Speaker, increasing taxes is not the answer to rising fuel prices.

   Mr. SALI. I thank the gentlewoman. 
   I rise in support of H. Res. 1114, supporting the goals and ideals of the Arbor Day Foundation and National Arbor Day. I wholeheartedly support the planting as well as the management of healthy trees and forests. The Forest Service has estimated that a healthy and well managed forest could sequester much more of our national carbon emissions than our forests currently sequester, currently sequestering an estimated 10 percent of our national carbon emissions. 
   I rise in support of this resolution. I also rise to urge my colleagues to address other issues facing our Nation, especially rising fuel prices. Increasing the supply of crude oil and ultimately its price is the single most effective thing Congress can do to lower gas prices. Today, 73 percent of every dollar we pay for gasoline is the price of producing crude oil. And yet, according to a study just released by the Bureau of Land Management, while onshore public lands in the United States are estimated to contain 31 billion barrels of oil and 231 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, some 60 percent of these lands are completely closed to leasing. Congress must act to lift the restrictions on America's energy rich public lands and increase exploration for and production of American crude oil and natural gas, and do so in an environmentally friendly manner.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Chairman, today Members of Congress faced two budget resolutions. The choice is a clear one between bigger, more expensive and more intrusive government versus fiscal discipline based on key priorities. 
   Now, fiscal discipline is hard, which is why it is not always popular. It is easy for some to vote to increase government spending, but ultimately someone must pay for it. It is common to hear about the ``government'' doing this project or that project. We hear a lot about the ``government'' spending money, but we must not allow the idea of ``government'' doing something to lead us to forget that, ultimately, ``We the People'' are the ones who have to pay for what government does. The nineteenth century economist Frederic Bastiat once said that ``government is the great fiction through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.'' 
   Although the Federal Government is not known for its fiscal discipline, we are now facing a budget that exceeds even the most fevered imaginings of history's biggest spenders. It would enact the largest tax increase in history--an almost $400 billion increase. 
   This is one path, and it is the one down which the new Majority proposes to take us. We also had the opportunity to take another path, a roadway to a balanced budget without raising taxes on working Americans. 
   The choice is clear. The Democratic budget would do serious harm to Idahoans, their families and their businesses. The Democratic budget would: Raise taxes on 436,000 Idahoans who benefit from the current 10 percent tax bracket; force 176,000 married couples in Idaho to pay for an increase in the marriage tax penalty; force 133,000 Idahoans with children to pay higher taxes because of the expiration of the current child tax credit; and raise tax rates on capital gains and dividends for 74,000 Idaho investors, including Idaho senior citizens. 
   The Democrats are demanding that hardworking Idahoans further subsidize the already bulging government coffers. More than that, the reckless increases in entitlement spending included in their bill would require that generations to come pay for our present unwillingness to make tough decisions. 
   As many know but few heed, the explosive rate of entitlement spending is simply not sustainable. If the current rate of federal entitlement spending remains unabated, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will consume 20 percent of the Nation's economy annually by 2040. If trends continue, entitlements will take up over 60 percent of the entire Federal budget in less than a decade. Our Nation is one of great prosperity, but no nation can expect to maintain economic and political greatness by feeding government programs at the expense of working families. 
   Few will be untouched by this vicious money-grab. Seniors, married couples, parents, small business owners, lower-income earners--all will be forced to turn over more of their earnings to the Federal Government. 
   In contrast, I support the Republican-offered substitute budget. The Republican budget reaches a balanced budget by 2012, but retains the important tax cuts adopted in 2001 and 2003. The Republican budget does not arbitrarily raise the 10 percent bracket to 15 percent; it preserves the current 10 percent rate. Lower-income earners need that money more than the government does. The Republican budget: Stops raiding the Social Security surplus; reins-in unsustainable, runaway entitlement spending by slowing the rate of annual entitlement spending growth, thereby saving money for the taxpayers; prepares for the future by budgeting in advance for national emergencies and crises; refines and strengthens the so-called ``pay as you go'' (PAYGO) rules to require that spending increases be offset with spending reductions instead of increasing taxes; caps discretionary spending through 2010 so Congress cannot simply throw more money at problems that require real solutions. 
   In short, we in Congress are accountable to our constituents. We must remember that real people and their livelihoods are at stake back home. If we wish to help those back in our districts, we must bear in mind that we do not have all the answers here in Washington. Congress did not earn the money that we took in taxes. It was hard-working Americans that earned it. If we fail to make the direly-needed tough choices about runaway spending, we are merely fostering a tax-and-spend culture that demands our constituents make pay a greater sacrifice in their earnings. 
   This is an unacceptable demand to make. Thankfully, the President has said he would veto the Democratic bill. Yet unless Congress begins to take seriously the need for economic growth, tax reduction for families and balancing the Federal budget, relying on the nation's Chief Executive to exercise his veto pen is like depending on a child to put his finger in the leak of a dyke. It will only work for a short time. We've got to do better, soon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 249 that would end the Bureau of Land Management's authority to sell wild horses. This is an important resource and wildlife management issue that affects our Nation's rangelands. 
   Recognizing the need to ensure healthy herds and healthy rangelands, the U.S. Congress gave the administration the authority to manage, protect and control wild horses and burros with the enactment of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971. 
   The statute directs the agency to maintain populations at a designated appropriate managed level, based on wild herds and rangeland monitoring, to determine the number of animals, including livestock and wildlife, that the land can support. In spite of the removal of horses, as was mentioned by the gentleman from Utah, currently the population of wild horses on the range is more than 10,000 above the appropriate management level. 
   The excess horse populations are causing significant resource and environmental damage. Even conservation groups such as the National Association of Conservation Districts, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, the Izaak Walton League, and a number of others have acknowledged the damage caused by this overpopulation of horses. Balanced management, respecting recreation, watersheds, wildlife and grazing must be restored to the public lands where these horses roam. 
   I urge a vote against H.R. 249 to help protect the environment and ecosystems of the western States.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Chairman, firefighting is a high-risk, high-consequence activity, and the agencies that are involved in managing wildland-urban interface have always had strong firefighter safety and training programs. Firefighter safety is their highest priority. In fact, the 1995 Federal Fire Policy sets the order of priorities for wildland firefighters as, number one, public and firefighter safety; number two, protection of resources; number three, protection of property. 
   The safety, health, and welfare of firefighters and the general public are becoming increasingly linked to the decline in the health of forested ecosystems. The most effective means of reducing burgeoning fire suppression costs, protecting community values, restoring forest and grassland health, and improving firefighter safety is an aggressive fuel treatment program. How land managers apply the fuels reduction program will have the greatest impact on the safety of wildland firefighters. 
   Threats to human life are compounded by the fact that more and more people are living in homes near fire-prone forests, placing themselves and the firefighters who try to protect them at greater risk. 
   My amendment allows the Administrator of the United States Fire Administration to develop and distribute information on the importance of clearing biomass from Federal lands. This commonsense amendment requires USFA to work in consultation with other Federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and the BLM to ensure that USFA provides the best possible recommendation. As we come upon what many are predicting to be another deadly and costly fire season, this information will be as vital as ever. We must provide our Federal employees, who are the best in the world, all the tools they need to keep our communities and themselves safe from catastrophic wildfires. 
   The Federal hazardous fuels reduction program can be a very good thing for wildfire fighters. If it is done properly, the program can reduce the most extreme of the hazardous fuels and make the working environment for wildland firefighters much safer. 
   The Federal Government has invested millions of dollars in a hazardous fuels reduction program to mitigate the risks, costs, and consequences of wildfire across millions of acres of publicly owned wildlands. The knowledge gained as to relative effectiveness of different types of treatments and the overall effectiveness of those treatments will have much greater value for protecting and promoting firefighter safety when that information is shared. The United States Fire Administration should be an important vehicle for disseminating this information, and this amendment will help to make that a reality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, continuing on the line of the previous speaker on this side, the bill that was before us last month, that did provide for secure rural schools funding, I did vote for it in committee because we were promised that it would have a different pay-for by the time it got to the floor and that PILT funding would be in at 100 percent. And I did vote against it when it got to the floor here because it didn't have a pay-for. What it had was a bunch of baloney in it. 
   Now, the money that's supposed to come from Big Oil, as has been referred to by the other side, there's a Supreme Court case that is a 9-0 ruling that says that that money will never, ever, ever be used in Idaho. 
   Madam Speaker, my district is over 62 percent federally administered land. I have counties that are over 80 percent federally administered land. Imagine what that does to the tax base for your schools. And that is the real problem that we're trying to address here. 
   Well, the gentleman controlling time on the other side said, well, you know, we just can't include it this time and we included it last time, a month ago in the last bill and you wouldn't support it. Madam Speaker, these are real life people we're talking about. These are school kids whose teachers get laid off because the local school district can't afford to pay them. 
   These are local road districts who are trying to figure out how to make roads so that when you come to Idaho to enjoy those public lands we can actually get to them. These are real people trying to deal with real problems. 
   Madam Speaker, if this country wants to have federally administered land in the State of Idaho, I can tell you, I understand why. It is a beautiful, beautiful State. The recreation  opportunities are great. There are places in Idaho that offer world-class recreation. But when are we going to take care of the people of Idaho? 
   You want to blame it on a baloney pay-for that will never get money to Idaho? If we'd have voted for this and passed it last month and it had become law, you know what we would have given the people of the State of Idaho? An empty bag. They would never have gotten a penny of that money. 
   So how will they pay for those teachers? How will they pay for those roads that you might want to drive on to come see the beauty of the State of Idaho? 
   Madam Speaker, the idea that this comes down under a closed rule, that we can't even talk about it in this bill, we can't even offer another pay-for that would get real money on the ground in Idaho I think is a shame to this body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, I'm going to urge everyone to just listen closely to what I have to say here. 
   There are two reasons why the pay-for doesn't work that was in the bill last month. And these are a matter of court cases, and I want to remind everybody again, the one that went to the Supreme Court was a 9-0 ruling. There are very few of those that come along. 
   The first reason is because the courts have said you cannot go back and change a contract that has been made. You just can't do it, except in some very, very narrow areas that were recognized by the court. 
   The other reason is because, in those narrow areas, you can't use that money in the State of Idaho. I don't care if you tax the oil companies to kingdom come. There is not a penny that was in that pay-for in that bill last month that would ever end up in Idaho. And that's the reason why I voted against that bill, because it would have left the State of Idaho--had we passed it, had it become law, it would have left the State of Idaho holding an empty bag. 
   And let me tell you something, Madam Speaker, an empty bag will not pay a teacher's salary. It will not pave a road in the State of Idaho so that you can come visit Idaho and come visit the natural beauty there, which is amazing. 
   Madam Speaker, this not about whether we're going to prefer Big Oil. It's not about priority. It's a matter of responsibility of the Congress of the United States. If you're going to come to my State, if you're going to come to my district and you're going to impose Federal administration on the lands that are in my district, then step up to the plate and have the responsibility so that you don't leave us holding an empty bag, so that you don't leave us without a tax base so that we can pay our teachers and pave our roads. 
   It is the responsibility of this Congress, and the idea that we would come here with this bill under a closed rule and shut us out is a shame on this body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, the country we live in is far too big to see all at once, and many of us have only heard stories of some of its subcultures, hidden treasures, and the uniqueness of thousands of local communities. 
   One world that some of us never see is the dark world of human trafficking. Because trafficked persons look just like the rest of us, it is a difficult world to perceive. And yet, this underground global economy in persons is thought to involve as much as $132 billion a year, with profits from its trade reaching over $200 billion. 
   This sordid culture, to which most of us are happily blind, crosses all national boundaries, including our own. Perhaps the most widely recognized form is sex trafficking of women into prostitution, but we must also recognize the trafficking of migrant workers, who are often deceived into leaving their homelands into forced, brutal labor without travel documents that give them the identity with which to escape. There is also the forcible use of children to beg for street gangs or work in dangerous conditions, and what I think is the most disgusting, the recent trend of Western tourists engaging in child sex tourism, traveling the world looking for children who are being held in prostitution by their captors. 
   We like to think that we live in a modern and modernizing world, where barbarism is merely a bad memory. Yet, raw evil persists in our time. Ignoring human trafficking only pulls a shade over an already dark practice. But ignoring it makes it no less real and no less horrifying. 
   The State Department's 2008 Trafficking in Human Persons Report reveals the truth, but sickens us at the same time. The report quotes one self-justifying American schoolteacher about his child sex tourism, ``I'm helping them financially. If they don't have sex with me, they may not have enough food. If someone has a problem with me doing this, let UNICEF feed them.'' 
   America is not great because we are perfect or because we refuse to accept injustice when we see it. Child soldiers, 8-year old prostitutes, domestic slavery, this is all real, and you can read about it in the State Department's report. The problem does not go away when we close our eyes, so it is imperative that we open them and act on this problem. 
   It's easy to think of this as a Third World problem. The numbers and the brutality are best gazed at from a distance, when we can shake our heads in horror and promptly change the channel to a different station. However, according to the State Department: The U.S. is a destination country for thousands of men, women, and children trafficked largely from East Asia, Mexico, and Central America for the purposes of labor and sexual exploitation. The Trafficking Victims Prevention Act of 2000 has been a great step forward in this fight, its purpose being to punish traffickers, protect victims, and prevent future trafficking. 
   While the number of prosecutions has gone up and steps clearly have been taken to help the victims, we can make a significant move to prevent trafficking by ensuring that the U.S. is not a destination country. One way to further this goal is to create a Northwest Trafficking Task Force to coordinate these efforts on our Northwestern border, running across Washington, Idaho, and Montana. This thousand-mile border is often patrolled merely on horseback. Without adequate resources, we cannot effectively fight this problem; we must catch it at the border. 
   We are morally responsible to ensure the God-given dignities of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in this country. We must have the vigilance to keep watch over these freedoms so that no form of human bondage is accepted or ignored. 
   I humbly ask my colleagues to open their eyes, consider these facts, and stand with me against this horror of human trafficking here at home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of discussion here and I think the main issue we are dealing with is how do we end our addiction to foreign oil. Can we drill our way out of this problem; can alternatives be used to replace crude oil. I think those are the two primary positions that are being bantered about on this floor. 
   As the American public is watching this debate, I am sure they must be quite baffled because both sides claim only they are correct. I think the answer, can we drill our way out of this problem, can alternatives be used to replace crude oil, the answer to both of those questions is probably ``kind of.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, a couple of weeks ago I was at the Idaho National Laboratory. It is one of the premier nuclear and alternative energy research facilities in the U.S. Here is what the experts at the INL told me when I was there. They said wind energy is about a 2 percent energy solution. Solar is not much better, and it is a lot more expensive. They talked about hydrogen. Currently we generate hydrogen by burning natural gas. That actually loses energy. Today there is no good source for the carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide that they say is needed to develop other forms of alternative energy, unless we are going to burn coal, and coal is not included in this bill except that we are going to increase excise taxes on that coal. 
   How will we get enough hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide to make alternatives a reality? Well, the folks at the INL said we will need to have next generation nuclear reactor facilities, not today's light water reactors that people are seeking to permit today. Next generation reactors operate at higher temperatures, and at those temperatures, chemistry and the reactions that take place, they take on new characteristics and that will allow the generation of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide in quantities that will make alternatives a reality. 
   Here is the problem. According to the Idaho National Laboratory, next generation nuclear facilities are two to three decades away from becoming a reality. 
   This bill does nothing to develop next generation nuclear reactors, and it doesn't really address the alternative energy in a meaningful way because of that. The bridge has to be made with crude oil and natural gas. The problem is this bill permanently locks up almost 90 percent of those offshore resources so it doesn't really address even our most limited need for crude oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need crude oil for more than just gas and oil. No plastics will ever be made from a windmill. No industrial chemicals will ever come from solar panels. No ink for printing. No asphalt that we need to make pavement to drive those electric cars and hybrid cars on. Well, Mr. Speaker, it just doesn't deal with those energies. 
   What does it deal with? Well, it increases taxes to the tune of about $18 billion. I wonder how many people in America believe that if we increase taxes on oil companies, that somehow that will cause them to reduce the price they charge for gas and oil. That is an absurd, absurd suggestion. In fact, what is going to happen is those taxes will go right down the pipeline, through the gas tank right into your gasoline tank where you will be paying higher prices for the gas and diesel that you need. 
   It was suggested earlier that we use so much energy in this country. You have all heard T. Boone Pickens on television say, gosh, we burn so much of this crude oil. I am not ashamed that we use a lot of energy in this country. It has made us the most prosperous Nation on the face of the planet, and it has allowed us to help essentially every other country on the face of the planet at one time or another. And America has proven time and time again that with our prosperity, we will also be generous to other countries at the time when they need it. Without that prosperity, we would not be able to have that generosity. Using energy makes us prosperous. 
   Just over a year ago, the Business Roundtable put out a report. Their conclusion was that to meet our energy needs for the future, we had better get our hands on every bit of energy we can from every source possible. That includes all of the alternatives. It includes nuclear. It includes crude oil and natural gas in increasing quantities. This bill does not get us there with any of those things. 
   I guess the question at this point is what kind of future do we want for our kids and our grandkids.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (AMERICA NEEDS TO DEVELOP ITS OWN NATURAL RESOURCES -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, if you're afraid of the future, said Ronald Reagan, then get out of the way, stand aside; the people of this country are ready to move again. 
   As with so many things, President Reagan was right. We cannot avoid real problems, gloss over pressing needs or, out of fear of something unforeseen, sit immobile until we are overtaken by inevitable results of our previous inaction. 
   Americans are paying on average $3.62 a gallon, and by early summer, we're going to be at $4 a gallon. By the end of this year, it's projected oil will be at $180 per barrel, an approximate doubling in the space of 1 year. Why are we paying so much? Very fundamentally, it's a supply and demand issue. We need oil, but the supply is limited. This is frustrating in its own right, but it's truly maddening when you consider the supply of crude is not really limited and that we have additional resources available to us, but they have been locked up by Congress. 
   The current majority claims they have the answers in a new clean energy agenda which purports to offer reduced reliance on foreign oil. But they seek to do it through increased alternative forms of energy, much of which is not even available today, instead of drilling for and pumping American crude. 
   Before the vote was taken on the majority's latest energy bill on December 18, 2007, Speaker Pelosi said, You are present at a moment of change, of real change. Perhaps she was correct, only the change she envisions is radically different than what most Americans want. 
   To lower the price at the pump and to break our addiction to foreign energy, we must increase production of American crude, not stifle it. Today, our country currently imports 61 percent of its crude oil and 15 percent of its natural gas. It's not only expensive but foolish for us to depend on such politically unstable regions like the Middle East for our energy. 
   If this Congress were serious about reducing America's reliance on foreign oil, one would also think it would invest in new energy supplies that it can produce in the U.S., such as coal-to-liquids using clean coal technology; and it would engage in immediate development of domestic oil sources by obtaining oil from ANWR, drawing oil from our Outer Continental Shelf, our oil shale, and even oil sands. 
   Additionally, we have large supplies of natural gas, and instead of using it for domestic purposes, we're selling about two-thirds of it abroad. Natural gas is a steal when compared to crude oil. According to one recent news story, natural gas prices are currently much lower than crude oil when the two are compared on a BTU equivalency basis. Currently, crude oil is nearly $120 a barrel compared to natural gas at about $11 per thousand cubic feet. Since natural gas is used at about one-sixth of the cost of crude oil, that's a bargain. 
   We need to actively develop American natural gas resources, and we can because the supply is there. We need to lift the moratorium Congress has imposed on drilling our offshore natural gas reserves and tap into this incredible resource. 
   These are supplies that we have right now on the lands of our own Nation. We don't have to go abroad and be held economic hostage to foreign oil cartels. 
   Natural gas is one piece of the puzzle. But let's be candid. We still need oil, a lot of it. And as we increase oil supply, we must also increase refining capacity to process it, yet it has been three decades since we built a new oil refinery. Lack of refinery capacity is another reason why gas prices are so high. 
   And we further tied our hands by shying away from clean, secure, safe nuclear energy. Since the 1970s, nuclear technology has been developed that will enable us to produce nuclear energy without the potential dangers of previous years. 
   In his news conference yesterday, President Bush said, Many of the same people in Congress who complain about high energy costs support legislation that would make energy even more expensive for our consumers and small businesses. He went on to say, Congress is considering bills to raise taxes on domestic energy production, impose new and costly mandates on producers and demand dramatic emission cuts that would shut down coal plants and increase reliance on expensive natural gas. That would drive up prices even further. The cost of these actions would be passed on to consumers in the form of even higher prices at the pump and even bigger electric bills.     
   Now, of course the President was referring to our friends on the other side of the aisle. And the fact that he's right does sadden me because this is not a partisan problem, it's an American problem that demands a true bipartisan solution. Yet, the Speaker's energy bill that came out at the end of last year will invest less than $300 million over 3 years in such clean energy sources as hydropower, marine and hydrokinetic energy, wind energy, solar, and clean coal technology. 
   In contrast, consider the cost of what the Speaker chose to invest in through her energy bill. The bill contained $375 million for a Green Jobs program for 3 years; $600 million to assist developing countries with their renewable energy development, and additional funding, as needed, to assist India and China with the same. That's right, we are sending American tax dollars overseas to the two very countries we are competing with for energy supplies. Is that the kind of real change that Americans want? 
   Tragically, with the policy changes wrest by this Congress, Americans across this country have only continued to see higher and higher gas prices as new record-high gas prices are reached almost daily. As President Reagan correctly reminded us, Americans are not afraid of the future, we welcome it. In facing the future, however, America needs sound energy policy that develops domestic energy sources from every source available, including crude oil, natural gas, clean coal, hydropower, and every alternative source of energy. To put it another way, we need all the energy we can get from all the sources we can possibly afford. We need a real energy policy, not a futuristic wish list. Madam Speaker, we're waiting. Please don't make us wait any longer. 
   With that, I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, a number of my colleagues have pointed out the problems with raising the minimum wage; that it is an unfunded mandate on small business, will likely result in the loss of over 1 million jobs for low wage earners, that it will eliminate entry level jobs and actually hurt the poor more than it helps them. 
   The negative impacts will result naturally from the rules and principles of the free market. In my college courses, I learned that the rules and principles of free markets are the rules and principles that every business and worker are subject to in every transaction, every negotiation and every new idea. That is, those negative effects of this bill are unavoidable with its passage. In spite of the negative effects, this bill does seem destined to pass. 
   As a freshman Congressman, the likely passage of this measure has taught me a new principle: The force of Congress can be brought to bear and justified to suspend those natural laws which would otherwise control important matters. The well-intentioned desire of Congress to help the poor apparently will not be restrained by the rules and principles of the free market that otherwise do restrain American businesses and workers. Apparently, Congress can change the rules that would otherwise affect the affairs of mankind. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I have asked my staff to draft a measure I call the Obesity Reduction and Health Promotion Act. Since Congress will apparently not be restrained by the laws and principles that naturally exist, I propose that the force of gravity by the force of Congress be reduced by 10 percent. Mr. Speaker, that will result in immediate weight loss for every American. It will immediately help reduce obesity problems in America. Weight loss will also help to promote the overall health of Americans as we have been vigilantly advised by our health care. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank this body for the education I have received from the passage of this bill. Since the basis for the use of Congress's power is the same with both measures, I would also ask that everyone who is supporting the measure before us consider becoming an original cosponsor of the Obesity Reduction and Health Promotion Act, and I have a copy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I close by noting that, with the new principles I have learned, it appears to me that with Congress the sky is the limit.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about an issue that is of vital importance to Idaho's First Congressional District, my State as a whole, and the greater western region of our country. 
   It is critical that Congress include language in the Emergency Supplemental to reauthorize and fully fund a 1-year extension of Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. It affects more than 615 rural counties and 4,400 schools near national forests in 39 states and literally, tens of thousands of students. 
   Without reauthorization, in Idaho alone, we would lose $23.3 million in funding this next year. That is a staggering loss in my small rural state. 
   In order to fully understand this issue we need to go back to the final year of Theodore Roosevelt's presidency to the establishment of the 1908 Payment Act for National Forests. Under this act, the Forest Service has paid 25 percent of its gross receipts to the states for the use of roads and schools in the counties where our national forests are located. The receipts come from leases, rentals, timber sales or other fees paid for using the National forest lands or resources. This is especially critical in Idaho, where more than 60 percent of our land is federally managed. 
   Congress realized at the time it was difficult for rural communities to be financially independent if they were surrounded by Federal land. If we privatized the land in those counties, they would be collecting property tax. But they cannot because the land is managed by Uncle Sam. 
   The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000, or a bipartisan Craig-Wyden plan was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton to provide funding to offset the loss of revenues to counties resulting from the severely reduced Federal timber sales in rural communities. The laws kept schools opened, roads maintained, search-and-rescue missions operating and many other essential services afloat. 
   The 5-year time frame of the Craig-Wyden measure was designed to allow counties sufficient time to broaden their economic bases to replace historic timber sale income. The Federal timber sale program in Idaho has, to put it mildly, come up short. Idaho's communities want to log and carefully make use of the State's timber resources, but regulatory restrictions won't let them.     
   And that is why we need to take action. 
   Allow me to cite one example. I have the good fortune of representing the people of Shoshone County. Shoshone County is a rural county with about 13,000 students. Shoshone County receives the second largest amount of funds under the Secure Rural Schools Act, about $4.3 million. This is an already economically depressed community. About 75 percent of Shoshone County is in the Federal system, and yet the county is responsible to maintain more than 400 miles of public roads. 
   On my recent trip home just days ago, I had the opportunity to meet with Shoshone County commissioners and superintendents of public schools. For Shoshone County, losing these funds, 40 percent of their budget, means massive layoffs in an already small school system, loss of transportation for children to get to school, placing children in hazardous conditions to get to school. The road system needs constant care and maintenance. They can barely get by with what they have now. 
   We don't let Idahoans harvest timber. We expect them to maintain Federal roads. We provide them no fiscal relief or support. We want a top quality education for our children, but they have no economic base to raise even modest taxes. 
   Congress has to step in. We have to act now. First, in the short term, the solution is for Congress to approve a 1-year extension of Craig-Widen in the emergency supplemental. Second, while providing interim funding, Congress must come up with a long-term solution to this situation. I believe ultimately the answer lies in increasing timber harvesting. 
   The House Appropriations Committee will mark up the emergency supplemental this week. The emergency supplemental will be the last opportunity to address this issue before counties have to start implementing cuts to schools and services. Without a 1-year reauthorization of and funding for the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, the predicament will be an emergency without rescue for hundreds and hundreds of rural counties across America. 
   I want to urge my colleagues to support this crucial 1-year extension.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to this energy bill. 
   Let me start out by saying bluntly that I feel that this energy bill is a step backward with virtually every topic that it covers. 
   With that being said, I do want to bring to light an issue that I feel this bill does not cover and that issue is hydropower. My amendment is simple. It expresses the sense of Congress recognizing and supporting renewable energy; specifically, it will add clean, consistent, pollution free, large and small scale conventional hydropower to this bill. 
   My amendment is a sense of Congress supporting hydropower. If we are going to discuss renewable energy, then we need to include hydropower. It is clean, renewable, consistent, and, most importantly, pollution free. Hydropower works all the time and should be a part of this bill because hydropower in America produces no greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, hydropower offsets more carbon emissions than all other renewable energy resources combined. Let me say that again: hydropower offsets more carbon emissions than all other renewable energy resources combined. 
   We have heard a lot about greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Chairman, if we are serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, than we need to recognize hydropower produces zero greenhouse gas emissions. Last year alone, we avoided some 160 million tons of carbon emissions by the use of hydropower here in the United States. 
   I am from the Pacific Northwest, from Idaho. We are truly blessed to have more than 60 percent of the power in the Pacific Northwest come from hydropower. In fact, there is so much power produced in the Northwest from hydropower that we often sell our excess supply to areas such as Southern California, where they historically have a shortage at certain times of the year. 
   I feel strongly that Congress needs to support conventional hydropower, and that is why I am offering this amendment today. 
   In closing, I want to remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that hydropower is emission free, completely renewable, clean, and domestic. That is right, it is domestic. I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this Sali amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time remaining.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (NEVER PLAY POLITICS WITH FUNDING FOR VETERANS SERVICES -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, as we approach Veterans Day, it would seem that the funding for the men and women who have served our country faithfully should be a no-brainer; yet, under a new majority of this Congress, the President has yet to send a single appropriations bill, including funding for our veterans. 
   We shouldn't be on our floor asking that the funds for our veterans be considered on their own merits. That should just be the way that it's done. It is inexcusable to tie funding for our veterans with a Labor-HHS appropriations bill which can best be described as wasteful. 
   This Congress has drifted far from the priorities of the American people. We should never play politics with funding for veterans services. On Veterans Day, it is fitting that we remember the sacrifices of the brave men and women in uniform and their families and their loved ones. 
   Our country was founded by courageous patriots. It is sustained by the same kind of people today. Our veterans have done their duty to their country, and it's time that we do ours by providing them with the benefits they are owed.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (THE SCOURGE OF ABORTION IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Thank you, Congressman Franks. 
   First of all, I would like to start off by saying how proud I am to be a new member of the Republican Study Committee and to be a part of that group that is about the business of changing the way that Congress does its business, the way that the law will affect the people of this country. I think that we are set to do good work in that group of 100-plus people, and I am very proud to be a part of that group. 
   Mr. Speaker, tonight is a night of celebration. The Supreme Court has this day extended legal protection, a modicum of legal protection, to thousands of preborn babies. 
   Many of my colleagues have given moving speeches about this victory for the little ones, and I am so pleased to add my voice to theirs. From my esteemed former colleague, Henry Hyde, to the tireless gentleman from New Jersey, CHRIS SMITH, and countless thousands of Americans whose names will never really be known, to President George W. Bush, people of conscience and conviction have worked for years to end one of the most gruesome practices imaginable; and today, the Nation's highest court has vindicated the law this House passed repeatedly and that the President finally signed into law in 2003. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we, as a culture, cannot defend the right to life, all of our other rights really become meaningless. So today's Supreme Court ruling is a great victory not just for preborn children, but just as 
   importantly, for our culture. 
   For 16 years in the Idaho legislature, I worked on protecting the most vulnerable among us, the unborn. That the highest court in our country would today extend this minimal protection to thousands of little ones, infants almost ready to be delivered, is very satisfying. With a great majority of Idahoans and of American people in general, I am gratified by this affirmation of our most basic right, the right to life. And yet I would temper my joy with a note of sadness. 
   We have outlawed a single barbaric practice, but other types of abortions, an estimated 1.3 million per year, continue with full protection of the law. The fact that these abortions are performed through less startling, cruel and brutal procedures than partial-birth methods makes them no more morally acceptable. The impact is undeniable. Forty-five million Americans are dead from abortion. That is a full one-third of a whole generation, and we are well into one-third of now another generation, all lost to abortion. 
   The challenge to end unrestricted access to abortion on demand will not end until every life, however small, is protected, until every person at whatever stage of life gains the protection of the law, until the Constitution of our beloved country is respected fully and, consequently, absurd notions like the idea that abortion is a protected right are jettisoned from our Federal law. 
   Mr. Speaker, 9 years ago, in the Idaho legislature we passed a ban on partial-birth abortion. Because of activism in our courts, that bill was almost immediately enjoined. It didn't protect a single unborn child in the State of Idaho. I remember in my debate on that bill I questioned what could be going through the mind of a doctor who partially delivers that baby, feels that life moving in his hands and feels that little baby jerk as he takes his life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I question what must be going through his mind. And I say, if we cannot end this barbaric practice, God help us, God help this country. And today, Mr. Speaker, that prayer was answered, that request for God's help was answered today. 
   I close with this: Some of our friends across the aisle make a great effort of obfuscating the true issue of what we are dealing with by calling preborn children fetuses. That is fine with me, as long as we all understand that the term ``fetus'' is simply Latin for ``the young yet in the womb.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, today was a great day for every fetus, for every young boy and girl still in the womb. May God be praised and may He be pleased so that His blessing is poured out upon our land.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, today, millions of Americans will go to work, and the overwhelming majority of them will drive. No matter what type of car they use, tens of millions of Americans will use privately owned passenger automobiles to get to and from work and school, the stores where they shop, and the soccer fields where their kids practice. That's reality. That's here and now. 
   We have to think about how to help the people that we represent today, the great majority of our fellow citizens for whom the past few months have been an energy nightmare. 
   We are here today because my colleagues and I on this side of the aisle believe in what our distinguished leader has called the All-of-the-Above Energy Agenda. Many of us, including me, came here during the August recess to call on our friends in the majority to come back and work with us on an energy policy that would enable us to access America's incredible natural resources in an environmentally responsible way quickly and effectively. 
   That's why I'm offering this motion to recommit so that the House may vote on the American Energy Act now. Madam Speaker, this is a question of stewardship. We all look forward to a future where fossil fuels are less prevalent. We're all working toward that future. We need to pursue solar and wind power, advance hydrogen fuel cell technology, and encourage nuclear energy so we can cut through the red tape and construct plants as soon as possible. 
   All of these are components of the American Energy Act, and I rise to call for a vote on that act today. But the American Energy Act also calls for drilling right now.     
   We need to drill--drill offshore, drill in ANWR, drill in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, drill in the new fields of North Dakota--aggressively develop oil sands and oil shale; we need to drill wherever there is a realistic promise of obtaining fuel for America's families. 
   Let me give you some examples of why. According to an assessment conducted by the Minerals Management Service of technically recoverable oil and natural gas, the OCS contains 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Both could be obtained safely and in an environmentally sound way. 
   In addition, there are an estimated 18 billion barrels of oil and 76 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, or approximately 20 percent of the undiscovered technically recoverable resources in the OCS that are completely off-limits today, but the extreme lobby that seems to have a grip on the majority's energy policies won't allow us to go get it, and people suffer as a result. 
   My motion to recommit promotes and offers effective incentives for energy conservation and more efficient use of our energy resources. It promotes all manner of alternative energy sources, and even establishes a renewable energy trust fund using revenues generated by exploration in the deep ocean and on the Arctic coastal plain. 
   We fuel our cars and trucks and heat our homes and businesses because hardworking men and women take risks, drill for oil, refine it, store it, ship it and then sell it to individual customers. We need more of it--a lot more--now. 
   We are all mindful that drilling won't make our energy problems disappear, but it will start us in the right direction. In the next few years, the oil that new drilling provides would start flowing into our fuel pumps. And in the interim, the fact that America is finally shattering our long-term dependence on foreign oil will send an unmistakable signal to friend and foe alike that America will use more of her own resources and thereby regain a degree of economic independence that we have lost for far too long. 
   We have heard talk that there will be another new comprehensive energy bill from the Democrats. We also just took a break for more than an hour because there is not agreement across the aisle on what that bill will look like. Apparently, there are real questions whether the Democrat Members even support the proposal of Speaker Pelosi of a day ago. But I submit that now is the time to stop politicking, to do the right thing and vote on this motion to recommit right now. Everything the American public is asking us to do is included in this motion. America wants this all-of-the-above kind of legislation. 
   Now a point of order has been reserved. That means that those across the aisle will try to beat this motion on a technicality. If we ask Americans, do you care more for an amendment to this river study bill that is totally free of technicalities or for Congress to finally vote to conserve, produce alternative energy and drill here and drill now, we all know they wouldn't care one whit about technicalities. They want energy. 
   Earlier, Chairman Rahall said Republicans and Democrats have been too busy trying to blame each other for high gas prices. Well, I say America is blaming all of Congress for high gas and diesel prices. And I submit on my side of the aisle, by offering this amendment--that America wants--we're doing our part to make things right with the American people. 
   I invite my colleagues across the aisle, don't sidestep this opportunity to do the right thing because of a technicality. Do the right thing. Vote for this motion to recommit so we can finally get the job done that the American public is demanding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, as you sit down to beat the April 15 deadline for filing your tax returns, consider this: In 1913 the IRS tax form, that's singular, ``form,'' was 1 page, and the entire Tax Code was a mere 14 pages long. Today the Tax Code consists of an amazing 15,758 pages bound in 22 volumes. James Madison's words ring true when he said, ``It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be  read or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.'' 
   Today this Chamber is addressing a commonsense measure, one dedicated to James Madison's proposition that the laws governing us should be readily understood by average citizens. 
   No one enjoys paying taxes, but at the very least the forms should be readable and understandable to the average American. Americans should be able to tell quickly and easily whether they're paying too much or too little in taxes. It should not take an attorney to figure it out. 
   It is imperative that Americans know just what is being asked of them, and that is why plain language in tax forms and instructions is so important. 
   The Plain Language in Government Communications Act will enhance citizen access to government information and services by promoting the use of plain language in government documents issued to the public. 
   When the Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives addressed this bill in January, I raised concerns that the bill only focused on documents relating to benefits or services. Since that time I have worked with Congressman Braley to find a way to expand the scope of this bill to include things like tax forms, instructions, surveys, and other similar documents. These changes appear in the text under consideration today, requiring that tax forms and instructions be made available in plain, straightforward language. 
   During this time of year, we all recognize the importance of plain language as we tackle tax forms. It is my hope that this bill will become law, which will lessen the burden of government on taxpayers. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important and commonsense measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (CHESAPEAKE BAY GATEWAYS AND WATERTRAILS NETWORK CONTINUING AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today on H.R. 5540, permanent authorization for the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network. 
   As my colleague pointed out, today's bill would permanently reauthorize these Federal funds and remove the $3 million annual cap. 
   When we held a hearing on this bill in committee, the administration testified that there have been some successes with this program, and consequently Federal funds are no longer necessary to subsidize this partnership. So I rise with serious concerns over the permanent authorization of this program. 
   In committee, I offered an amendment that would strike a compromise limiting this authorization to 5 years. Today's legislation, however, proposes to put the taxpayer, including taxpayers in Idaho, on the hook permanently funding this program, and that in spite of the administration's claim that no Federal funds are even needed. 
   This comes on the heels of the vote of this body we just took approving the largest tax increase in American history, a tax increase of some $683 billion, as well as action raising the national debt to an all-time record high of $10.5 trillion. This, together with skyrocketing fuel prices and increases in fuel cost, has the American taxpayer, the American family, and everyone across this country, including my great home State of Idaho, under a tremendous burden. 
   Idahoans are considering the reality that they may not have enough money to pay their bills, let alone enjoy the majestic beauty of Idaho's outdoors this summer. Notably, however, this is not a problem limited to weekend excursions or vacations. The price pinch is hitting folks who have a job, but wonder if they can afford the fuel to get to work, those people that have called my office to complain. In addition, schools across this country are cutting programs and moving to four-day school weeks to address rising fuel costs. 
   People being hit the hardest by these high gas prices don't even drive, they're our parents and our grandparents, those seniors who rely on services like Meals on Wheels to deliver the food they eat each day. In Idaho, it was reported on Tuesday that five volunteers had quit because they couldn't afford the gas they needed to complete their routes and deliver meals to seniors. 
   This is a moral issue, an issue which for many senior citizens and low-income, hardworking families affects their access to food as well as to education and even doctors. It's time for Congress to act on that moral obligation, to make provision so the needs of the poor and the elderly will be met. It's time for Congress to lift the restrictions on America's energy-rich public lands, to responsibly increase exploration for production of American crude, and to increase American supply and bring down prices of gas and diesel. 
   Increasing the supply of crude oil and ultimately lowering its price is the single most effective thing Congress can do to lower gas prices. Today, 73 percent of every dollar we pay for gasoline is the price of producing crude oil. Almost two-thirds of it comes from foreign countries, including OPEC nations and dictatorships like Hugo Chavez's Venezuela. 
   Congress could vote today to unlock huge American onshore oil and natural gas reserves on public lands in the United States. In a study just released by the Bureau of Land Management, while onshore public lands in the United States are estimated to contain 31 billion barrels of oil and 231 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, some 60 percent of these lands are completely closed to leasing because of the actions of Congress.     
   Once such example is the oil reserves in Alaska, where in 1980 President Jimmy Carter set aside 2,000 acres specifically for energy production. According to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration, the mean estimate of technically recoverable oil on those section 1002 lands is 10.4 billion barrels. That's more than twice the proven oil reserves in all of Texas and almost half of the total U.S. proven reserves of 21 billion barrels. The recoverable oil within these lands represents a possible 50 percent increase in total U.S. proven reserves. 
   Congress must act to lift the restrictions on America's energy-rich public lands and increase exploration and production of American crude oil and natural gas. We can do this in an environmentally friendly manner. But we have to act and we have to act now. Of that there can be no dispute. 
   With those pressing needs before us, why would Congress act on this bill to give a permanent authorization and increase the amount of money to go to the subject of this legislation when the administration has told us that no Federal funds are even needed? Mr. Speaker, we can and we must do better.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, this motion is a straightforward one and one that I hope we can all support. 
   Because the underlying bill is a permanent authorization of appropriations for this regional program, it is suitable that the Secretary of the Interior should use some of these funds to help the residents of the Chesapeake Bay better understand exactly how their recreational opportunities, their livelihoods and even their everyday lives are affected by the shocking gas prices affecting the country, prices which have skyrocketed over 71 percent since the current majority was installed in the House of Representatives.  
   I have read several news reports that show exactly how high boat fuel prices have affected the watermen of the bay. They cannot afford to run their boats to catch seafood we all enjoy. In the meantime, the price of those delicious crabs is climbing almost as fast as gas prices just so these fishermen can make their costs. 
   While this program creates popular Chesapeake Bay watertrails, tour operators have shuttered their boats because they cannot afford to fill up their tanks. Families are forced to stay home rather than vacationing on the Chesapeake Bay shore to enjoy its historic sites, education programs and Chesapeake Bay gateway sites supported by the authorization in this bill. This is a shame because the area has much to offer. 
   I wish I could offer a motion to actually decrease these prices, but the majority won't allow a vote on a measure to open up secure, American supplies of oil and natural gas, or oil shale, on our public lands. In the meantime, we are occupying hours of our legislative day with this minor program. 
   Our constituents, including the millions who live near, use, and enjoy the Chesapeake Bay, deserve better. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all know that we're going to hear from the other side of this body that there's a problem with this motion being made ``promptly.'' As we also know, the majority controls the work of this committee and schedules the House. Just as they have scheduled this bill today, they can bring this bill back early next week. This motion is made promptly so that, in addition to the matters that are considered within this motion to recommit, that the committee can take up all of the matters and make sure that we have fully addressed all of these issues as they affect the people who live and work in the Chesapeake Bay area.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to tip my hat to the good gentleman for his efforts on the floor and for the compelling argument that he has made here. 
   The idea that our young people, young men and women, have gone to Iraq, gone to Afghanistan, they have spilled their blood there for a purpose that would become meaningless if we withdraw without finishing the job over there, that is something that makes the discussion I think a little different. 
   All of us are tired of the war. All of us are tired of the casualties that have been inflicted. What we have to do is keep our eye on the ultimate goal, what it is. Is it to quell a disturbance, a dispute that has arisen between different Islamic groups? No, it is not. It can never be. 
   It has to be the security of the United States. For those folks who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan, for their lives to have meaning, we have to consider what that goal is. 
   The national security of every person in this country, those interests have to be paramount to everything else that we consider. They have to be paramount to our distaste for the fighting that has gone on. They have to be paramount to every life that has been lost. 
   Mr. Speaker, for those lives that have been lost to have meaning, it has to be that we will save more lives by their efforts that have been there than if we just pull up stakes and quit. If we do not get that job done, if those radical Islamists are allowed to declare a State, if they have a home, a base from which to operate, we will repeat the events that happened when the Taliban had a home base in Afghanistan. 
   The recipe is before us. We have seen it before. We will have a repeat of something like 9/11. 
   The only choice that we have as a Nation is to continue that job over there, to get it finished as best we can. Is there a perfect prescription for that? No, there is not. Is it going to be easy? No, it is not. Will we have more casualties? Unfortunately, we will, and yet we must continue this fight so we will not dishonor those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to this point in the conflict. 
   I thank the good gentleman.

   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Pancreatic cancer, the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the United States, is a devastating disease caused by excessive cellular growth in the pancreatic gland. Approximately 37,200 people will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year alone. Sadly, the average life expectancy for those diagnosed is only 3 to 6 months. 
   Despite the lethal nature of pancreatic cancer, research remains in the earliest scientific stages, and there are currently no identifiable early warning signs. By the time the symptoms become evident, it is almost always too late for successful treatment. While research and scientific developments have led to lower mortality rates for other types of cancer, such as cancer of the breasts, lung, prostate, and colon, the mortality rate for pancreatic cancer continues unabated. 
   The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, PanCAN, is the only national patient advocacy organization that serves the pancreatic cancer community. It focuses its efforts on public policy, research funding, patient services, public awareness, and education related to the development of an effective treatment and ultimately a cure. 
   PanCAN will once again be promoting pancreatic awareness during the month of November to educate citizens about pancreatic cancer, the need for funding, early detection methods, effective treatment, and prevention programs. 
   In honor of the many victims of this horrific disease and the efforts of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, I ask that the Members of Congress join me in declaring support for the goals of Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month.

   It's appropriate that we honor Kenneth T. Whalum, Sr., in the naming of a post office in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. He spent many years working for the United States Postal Service in various human resources capacities and eventually became the director of personnel for the main Memphis post office. He later became the director of employee relations for the southern region. 
   Kenneth Whalum is also an influential member of his community. He's long believed in serving the people of Memphis and did so as both a preacher and a school board commissioner. 
   Born and raised in Memphis, he attended Morehouse College and earned his law degree from Temple University. His strong faith and belief in public service led him to roles as a Baptist minister and school board member. 
   He served as a city council member from 1988 to 1996 and was elected to the school board in 1996. While on that school board, it was his goal to work toward higher standards, more opportunities and brighter futures for the students of Memphis City.     
   Upon retirement from public office, Kenneth T. Whalum plays an active role with the Stroke of Hope Foundation, which educates and supports fundraising for people suffering from  strokes and transient ischemic attacks. 
   It is fitting to honor Kenneth T. Whalum with the naming of this post office. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2587.

   We do rise today to honor a truly great artist in the field of opera. Robert Merrill, the highly acclaimed baritone singer was well known for his remarkable career with the Metropolitan Opera. 
   He was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, son of Polish immigrants, and he was first inspired to perform as a singer after watching a performance of Il Trovatore as a teenager. His mother guided him through his early musical training, which he paid for by working as a semiprofessional baseball pitcher. 
   An avid baseball fan, he became widely known for his annual singing of the national anthem at Yankee Stadium on opening day and for special events, a tradition he carried on for over 30 years. 
   His legendary performances at the Metropolitan Opera brought him national fame and recognition in the arts and the opportunity to perform with other notable singers and entertainers. 
   He performed for numerous presidents, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy. Throughout his career, he performed as a soloist with some of the world's greatest conductors, made numerous recordings, and appeared at several worldwide music festivals. Outside of the stage performances, he also ventured into radio and television. 
   Robert Merrill enjoyed a successful career in performing music for over 30 years. His velvety smooth voice was said to have improved with every performance. He retired from the opera in 1976, and made one final performance in 1983 for its centennial. 
   In 1968, he was appointed to the National Council on the Arts by President Johnson and was awarded the National Medal of the Arts in 1993. 
   He died at the age of 85 while watching his favorite pastime, baseball, at his home in New Rochelle, New York. It is appropriate that we honor him with the naming of a post office in his beloved hometown.

   This measure proposes honoring the life of Eleanor McGovern by naming the post office in Woonsocket, South Dakota, in her honor. A tireless advocate for children and families, she set a new precedent for women on the campaign trail and left a lasting mark as a passionate and eloquent speaker. 
   Born on November 25, 1921, in Woonsocket, South Dakota, Eleanor Stegeberg began her life-long devotion to caring for others at the tender age of 12, when she, along with her twin sister, Ila, assumed many household duties following the death of their mother. Even with all of her responsibilities at home, Mrs. McGovern was successful at school, becoming a renowned debater and a cheerleader before attending Dakota Wesleyan University. 
   It was in high school that she met a young George McGovern, whom she impressed by leading one of the few debate teams that was able to defeat him. Three years later, in 1943, just before he was shipped off to war, they were married. 
   Upon returning from service, Mr. McGovern began his 24-year career in Congress by winning a seat to represent South Dakota in the House of Representatives. However, he fell ill during his 1962 senatorial campaign, an opportunity that thrust Mrs. McGovern into the spotlight. She campaigned statewide for him, helping to secure his victory, and from then on she became a tremendous asset on the campaign circuit, either with Mr. McGovern or on her own. 
   Mrs. McGovern was a trailblazer in this role, opening doors for women and spouses in the election process, never more visibly than during Mr. McGovern's unsuccessful 1972 bid for the Presidency. 
   Mrs. McGovern was an advocate for children, family and women's issues during and following her husband's political career. After the tragic death of her daughter, Theresa, she became a public face of the campaign against alcoholism. 
   Mrs. McGovern's service endeavors included work for the Child Development Center and the Women's Democratic Club, as well as serving on the boards of the Psychiatric Institute Foundation and Dakota Wesleyan. 
   In recognition of this outstanding record of accomplishment and service, let us pay tribute to Eleanor McGovern by naming her hometown post office in her honor.

   Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate Mr. Owen Lovejoy, who was an accomplished lawyer, Congregational Minister, abolitionist and Republican Congressman. 
   Mr. Lovejoy was born on January 6, 1811, in Maine, where he taught school in order to support himself while in college and law school after his father's death. 
   After becoming a convert to abolitionism in 1836, he studied for the ministry under his brother, Elijah Lovejoy, a well known antislavery, Presbyterian minister. Tragically, 1 year later, Elijah was murdered while trying to prevent the destruction of the printing press of an Illinois antislavery society from an angry, drunken anti-abolition mob. After his brother's murder, Mr. Lovejoy is reported to have vowed to devote himself to, quote, ``the cause that has been sprinkled with my brother's blood.'' 
   After becoming a Congregational church minister, Lovejoy used the pulpit to attack slavery. 
   He was elected to Congress in 1856, with the support of Abraham Lincoln, and served four terms. Although he died before seeing the enactment of the 13th amendment to the Constitution, Congressman Lovejoy's legacy lives as a lifelong champion of equality. 
   Because of his courageous support of equality for all, regardless of race, it is fitting that we name the Princeton, Illinois Post Office in his honor.

   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, global competition is a fundamental reality of today's economy. America is doing well because we offer the highest quality products in the world. Only by staying on the leading edge of technology and innovation will our competitive edge stay sharp. Our competitive advantage will diminish unless our companies have the ability to perform research and develop the technology improvements that keep America out front. That is why we need a permanent R&D tax credit. 
   One recent study found that R&D credit teases out nearly $3 of additional R&D investment for every $1 of taxes companies can deduct. In addition, it has been estimated that more than three-quarters of R&D tax credit dollars are used for the compensation of employees who work in U.S.-based research and development. 
   In my home State of Idaho, roughly 35,000 people are employed in the high-tech industry. The companies where they work depend on the best possible research and development. It is hard for firms to plan for future growth when a key tax credit is destined to expire at the end of the year. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time to make the R&D tax credit permanent.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the bill before us. 
   Plain and simple, this bill is bad for America because it is bad policy. My concern centers around the long-lasting impacts that this bill will have on the First District of Idaho and on America's future. 
   The bill imposes a royalty that will threaten the existence of domestic mineral production. Please note that mining is already one of the most regulated industries in the United States. Everyone believes that we need safe, productive, and environmentally responsible mineral development and that there needs to be a logical and efficient way to deal with abandoned mines. We all agree on those goals. But this bill takes an environmental cause, like abandoned mines, and uses it as a cover for a tax hike that will accomplish nothing less than outsourcing our domestic mining industry. That is bad policy. 
   Hardrock mining is dangerous. It takes a lot of grit to engage in it. Today, hardworking professionals do it here in the United States. This bill, however, will send American production overseas, where there are limited or no environmental standards and where child labor is used. 
   As the gentleman from Kentucky before me mentioned, H.R. 2262 makes America more dependent on child miners from around the world for our minerals and metal needs. The International Labor Organization estimates there are over 1 million children that are working in mines and quarries around the world. This bill will not only ship our mining industry jobs overseas; it will ensure that American mineral needs are satisfied by child labor. That is just plain wrong; it is bad policy. 
   My colleagues across the aisle have made a commitment to the American people to combat global warming. This bill will ensure that they cannot meet that commitment. How are they going to combat global warming if they do not have the very minerals that they need to do it? Alternative energy is dependent on minerals that we mine here in the U.S. For instance, copper is used for wind, solar power, and fuel cells, just to name a few items. Currently, domestic production cannot meet domestic demand. This is kind of like having the Democrats promise us sand castles but banning domestic sand. They're cutting off the domestic supply of minerals that they need to deliver on their commitment to fight global warming. Once again, H.R. 2262 is bad policy. 
   Mining industry jobs are important in the First District in Idaho. H.R. 2262 will outsource these good-paying jobs that America and Idaho needs. H.R. 2262 will take these jobs away from hardworking American professionals and force them on child laborers. Once again, H.R. 2262 is bad policy. 
   My final point is this: our national defense depends on minerals mined in America. This bill will result in an importation of the very minerals we need to keep America safe from every unfriendly country from which we are protecting ourselves. Yes, that is right, we'll be asking our enemies to supply  us with the minerals used for the very weapons we will be using to defend ourselves from them. Once again, H.R. 2262 is bad policy. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, at the end of this month, a vitally important  research and development tax credit is due to expire again. 
   Since 1981, Congress has erratically extended this tax credit, and extensions have ranged from 6 years to 5 months. Sometimes extensions have applied retroactively. The tax credit even lapsed for a year. A permanent R&D tax credit is long overdue, and Congress should act now to make a permanent R&D tax credit a reality. 
   Congress was right to offer an R&D tax credit. Doing so boosted America's competitive edge in an increasingly cut-throat global marketplace of ideas, products, and services. Yet we ignore, to our economic peril, the fact that other countries, including Australia, Canada, China, France and India, also offer tremendous R&D incentives to their industries. 
   Now is the time to make R&D tax credits permanent. Doing so would remove an unnecessary burden on our industries, including roughly 35,000 Idahoans employed in high-tech jobs. 
   Madam Speaker, there is no reason for keeping this kind of tax credit temporary. Let us unleash the power of American ingenuity and make the R&D tax credit permanent.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (TAXPAYER FREEDOM DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. I would like to thank the good gentleman for yielding to share a few thoughts.  
   Now that the April 15 deadline for filing tax returns has passed, I would actually like to ask everyone to consider a few things. 
   In 1900 most Americans only had to work until January 22 to fully meet all of their tax obligations to the Federal, State, and local governments. At that time the percentage of a worker's income needed to pay their taxes was just 6 percent. Imagine how much easier life would be today if we were done working for the government by the end of January. 
   And today, Tax Freedom Day, for most Americans doesn't come until tomorrow, April 23, as my good friend has pointed out. The deadline to fill out your tax forms, it comes and goes, and yet you're still working for the government, not for yourself, not for your business, not for your family. A third of your income goes to pay the taxes that you owe government. 
   Government has demonstrated an insatiable appetite to grow. In fact, Federal spending has more than tripled since 1965. Almost every week in Congress, we are asked to vote to create new programs and expand existing ones. Unless there is some urgent need, and there usually isn't, I vote ``no.'' Americans just can't afford it anymore. Congress is not being careful enough with our hard-earned tax dollars. 
   The majority recently passed a budget plan that would raise taxes by $683 billion in the next 5 years. That's the largest tax increase in American history. It requires higher taxes on married couples and small businesses. Their plan also includes no permanent fix for the alternative minimum tax that threatens unsuspecting middle income Americans to the tune of $70 billion in new taxes. 
   And on the horizon are even more tax increases if Congress fails to act. Higher income tax rates and higher capital gains tax rates will hit virtually everyone. Higher dividend taxes will hit every investor. The death tax will be back, as will the marriage tax penalty. The tax credit for every child will be cut in half. 
   I think Congress needs to recognize that Americans are taxed too much, and that is why I am a proud cosponsor of my friend Congressman Walberg's Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007, which would prevent this unprecedented tax increase. Congress must make a priority of finding ways to lower the tax burden on Americans instead of increasing it. If we don't, Tax Freedom Day will soon be delayed until May or June and we will reminisce about the ``good old days'' when our tax debts were paid in full by April. Well, let's hope and pray that that never happens. 
   As a kind of a bookend here on your comments earlier about what's happening in your State, I want to let you know, Congressman Walberg, in the State of Idaho, we're actually going the other way. This year our legislature cut the tax on personal property for businesses. We had a tax that was imposed upon the personal property that businesses owned, and that's being phased out at least at the bottom, and there will be a floor so that if you have less than $100,000, I think was the number they settled on, worth of business property, you won't pay any property tax on that. It's not just for business, though. It's for individuals as well. And I will let you know that in Idaho we have been paying tax on the food that we buy, sales tax. This year the legislature passed a plan that would increase the deduction that's allowed against your State taxes. We call it the ``Grocery Tax Credit.'' It will increase that significantly and will reduce the taxes that people pay on food. 
   This is an important concept because I have kind of a principle that I use as a test here, and it's this: If you had a dollar to put wherever you thought it would do the most good and you could pick your favorite government program or anywhere in the private sector, where do you think it would do the most good? What the legislature in the State of Idaho has said is we think it will do the most good if we leave it in the hands of individuals. It comports with the Founding Fathers, as you were referencing earlier. Unfortunately, I don't understand the thinking of your State legislature where they are going the other direction. 
   And I guess this represents the battle that exists within this country today. Many people say we live in a divided country. And I think that's true. And it's divided, I think, into two main categories, the first one being those who believe in the vision of the Founding Fathers, that want a government that is there to serve the people, that we will have a government that allows people to have the freedom to determine what's going to happen in their own lives, allows them the freedom to use their personal property, the wealth that they create because of that personal property to do as they see fit. 
   And that's opposed to the other vision, which is one that says government must do more for people. We hear that phrase on this floor regularly or some iteration of it: Government must do more. That's not what the Founding Fathers thought. This vision that government needs to do more, that somehow if the government takes control of a problem, that it will be solved. How many times have we looked at a program and said why won't this thing work? And the answer, I think, is because generally government doesn't work. That was the whole point that the Founding Fathers brought to light. 
   And I think there are two places where we can see kind of the underlying principles that get at these two very different visions for our country. The Founding Fathers relied on that vision that was set out in the Declaration of Independence; that when they said these words, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal'' and ``endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights'' and then later said ``Governments are instituted among men'' to protect those rights, that's one vision that says our rights come from God and it's government job to protect and respect those rights. 
   When Franklin Delano Roosevelt was, I think, addressing a press club here in Washington, DC, he described it quite differently. He described government as a contract where the people give power to the government and then the government dispenses benefits to the people. We call those things entitlements today. The vision of the Founding Fathers didn't rest at all on entitlements. They rested on rights. That vision that wants to see bigger government, government's securing a solution for every problem--

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Well, again, I thank the gentleman. It begins with your vision of the principles that underlie your vision for how you want government in this country to exist. If you have a vision that says the principles can change over time, essentially that the truth can be molded over time, that there is not absolute truth, then you don't have to have that vision of the Founding Fathers. Everything can change. Up can be down if you go far enough with that. 
   The principles over time that change will lead you to a point where you can move from that vision of the Founding Fathers, where they said that freedom is the thing that matters the most, where liberty is the thing that matters the most. That those rights that are given by God, it is the obligation of government, and the reason that government exists is to protect those rights. If you can change those principles, you can end up with a government that will take care of you and do everything for you, and your rights don't matter at that point. It's not the government's job to protect your rights that are God-given, it's government's job to give you those rights. Again, we call those entitlements. 
   At the end of the day, when I talk to people who live in my State, what they want is they want a future for their kids and their grand kids, where they  will have freedom and security and prosperity. Freedom comes when you make fewer laws. Prosperity comes when you take less money out of my pocket and give it to government, when Tax Freedom Day comes earlier in the year. Security comes when we have things like a strong national defense, when we allow our government to do those things that are needed to protect the security of the people who live here, and of our country itself. 
   When I talk to Idahoans, that is what they tell me that they want. That can't exist under a government where the people give power to the government, and the government distributes entitlements. Whoever became free living on entitlements? Whoever became prosperous living on entitlements? Who was ever secure living on entitlements that at any moment can be changed by the 535 Members that serve in Congress. 
   With that, I would yield back to the gentleman.

   Mr. SALI. Madam Chairman, child abuse is a horrendous evil. Such abuse is reported on an average of every 10 seconds in the United States. And three children die every day in our country as a result of abuse. Any abuse in residential treatment programs is an incredible travesty. 
   While fighting child abuse poses a tremendous challenge for us to overcome, this bill is not the answer. The manager's amendment makes great progress in improving the bill, yet there remain provisions that are simply unconscionable for those who respect the system of Federalism long established in our Nation. H.R. 5876 represents a dramatic expansion of the Federal oversight role in really an unprecedented area. Most States already have systems in place to check the abuse that this legislation would supposedly address. Yet this legislation would trump those systems. This bill provides a one-size-fits-all mandate for residential treatment facilities, inflexible to the needs of actual children and unresponsive to the local challenges faced by such youth treatment programs. 
   Residential treatment programs have had a great impact on youth in my district in Idaho. For instance, Cherry Gulch is a small, owner-operated treatment facility located on 220 acres of pristine land near Boise, Idaho. The ranch-style therapeutic boarding school is designed specifically for 10- to 14-year-old boys, and has made an incredible difference in the lives of the youth who have participated in those programs. Yet directors of these facilities have expressed grave concerns to me that their needs will not be met by H.R. 5876. 
   For instance, as one treatment program director pointed out, in a State like Idaho where usage of drugs like methamphetamine has exploded, giving every child the undefined right to so-called ``reasonable'' access to a telephone creates direct and unreasonable risks. Why allow youth the opportunity to contact drug dealers when the entire point of being put in such a facility is to overcome their addictions? 
   There is kind of political hubris to this approach. The attitude of this bill is that we here on Capitol Hill know better than people in our home States how to address the needs of abused children. I find that stunning. I would invite any of my colleagues to go back to their districts and talk with the people who day in and day out work to bring hope and healing to children victimized by abuse. I believe they will find it, as I have, quite humbling. We don't have all of the answers in Washington, D.C., and we certainly would be wrong to impose a top-down system of Federal management on States and localities. 
   Overall, I am certain that we can agree that it is important that children in residential treatment programs be protected. However, I do not believe that another Federal intrusion into the affairs of all 50 States is the answer. 
   In Federalist No. 8, James Madison warned of the dangers of creeping Federal powers over the States. In his words: ``Ambitious encroachments of the Federal Government on the authority of the State governments would be signals of great alarm.''

   Mr. SALI. When the Father of the Constitution issues such a warning, we should listen closely. Even more importantly, the Constitution of the United States says in the 10th amendment: ``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved for the States respectively, or to the people.'' 
   In 1941, the New Deal Supreme Court, in Darby v. United States, commented that this amendment is mere ``truism.'' Many of us here in this body would challenge that assertion. The authority of the States and their right to govern their own affairs is not a trite and archaic remark but an essential aspect of our Federal system. We diminish it to the peril of our system of Federalism which has been vital to our freedom as a Nation. 
   H.R. 5876 is not a solution looking for a problem, but it is a solution that I will submit solves fewer problems than it will create.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the greatest, most influential book known to man, the Holy Bible. November 18 through 25 is National Bible Week, and it fittingly coincides with Thanksgiving. 
   The Bible teaches us that we have very much to be thankful for. And although we ought to remind one another of this truth at all times, I am glad there is a time set aside for remembering our blessings. 
   The Holy Bible teaches that we are all created by God in His image. And as such, each individual has a certain dignity that should be respected. One John 4:7-11 is one of my favorite passages of scripture. It says: Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is how God showed His love among us: He sent His one and only Son into the world that we might live through Him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
   Elsewhere, in Matthew 16:24, Jesus tells his disciples that if anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. I particularly like this verse because, coupled with the first passage from 1 John, it reminds me that I am to love God first, others second and myself third. How different would our personal interactions be if we took this to heart and sought to love others in the way that the Bible encourages us to? 
   It is a lesson worth learning, to love one another. In a city that oftentimes seems so bitterly divided, glimpses of true peace and genuine care seem so rare. 
   Holy Scripture, which served as guiding light for so many of our Founding Fathers, can also illuminate a path for us today. In spite of all of our differences, there are many things that we have in common: we have a common creator, a common desire to serve our country and a common inherent worth by virtue of being creations of the Almighty. As we go about our daily business, I think it would behoove us to remember that the Good Book teaches to love one another because we have been loved by God. 
   In all of the many chapters of my life, the Bible has served as a source of great wisdom, comfort and insight. Whether as a husband, a child, a father, a lawyer, or legislator, I have purposed to rely on the word of God to give direction in times of doubt. I applaud the efforts of my friends here in the people's House and around the country to recognize what is truly a treasure. I hope and pray that each Member of  this House, their staff and all of our fellow citizens take time in the upcoming weeks to not only reflect on the great truth found in the Bible, but also to count our blessings and to give thanks. 
   On a personal note, I am quite sure that my third grade teacher, Mrs. McClain, prayed for my salvation when I was young. I believe my seventh grade reading teacher, Mrs. Cantrell, prayed for me, as did my high school band teacher, Mr. Jim Henry. They joined a long list of relatives, my sister, Annette; my brother, Joe; my great, great grandfather, John Henry Fortson, pastor of the Fishing Creek Baptist Church in Washington, Georgia, for over 40 years. He prayed for the salvation of his children and grandchildren to seven generations. 
   I reconfirm tonight that their prayers were fruitful. Jesus is my friend and I am a student of his word, the Bible. I understand His work on the cross as the sole means of my salvation because the Bible has taught me so. 
   Yes, Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tell me so. May all those who prayed for me so diligently reflect in Thanksgiving this year that God has heard their prayers for me, and I will thank the God of the Bible for their prayers which resulted in my salvation according to the plan that He set out in the Bible.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (FEDERAL RAILROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, Congress has a spending problem. The budget passed earlier this year anticipates spending $2.9 trillion over the next 12 months. That is more money than the total value of all goods and services produced in Germany at $2.87 trillion, China at $2.52 trillion, or the United Kingdom at $2.34 trillion. 
   This spending problem is further evidenced by a whopping $9 trillion national debt, a debt that can only be addressed by drastic change. Those changes will only come as Congress prioritizes and makes tough decisions, funding priorities and cutting wasteful spending. 
   Safety is an important issue. No one argues that point. But spending taxpayer money to rename a 40-year-old agency is just plain ridiculous, and yet, that is one of the things that this bill proposes to do. 
   The Federal Railroad Administration was created in 1966. Today's bill proposes to change the name of the agency to insert the word ``safety'' renaming it the Federal Railroad Safety Administration. While this sounds innocuous enough, it raises some very practical considerations for spending the American taxpayers' money. 
   The Federal Railroad Administration has 837 employees. Printing new business cards for everyone to reflect their new agency, at a cost of $30 per person, will cost taxpayers more than $25,000. 
   Consider also that the agency has eight regional offices across the country, all of which will require new signs to reflect the new agency name. Again, this raises questions: How much taxpayer money will the agency spend for these new signs? 
   How much taxpayer money will the agency spend to print new letterhead to reflect this name change, an agency that spent nearly $200,000 in printing costs last year? 
   How much taxpayer money will the agency spend issuing new regulations that reflect this new name? 
   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this. While all of these expenses are relatively modest in light of the $1.11 billion proposed to be authorized by this bill over 4 years, this kind of spending is unnecessary and, frankly, ridiculous. 
   If the point of this bill is safety, then why not spend the money on safety? Don't spend the hard-earned money of American families and individuals just to rename an agency. That type of spending is an out and out waste of taxpayer money. 
   Yes, Congress has a spending problem. The only way Congress will cure that problem is to prioritize, make tough decisions and learn, like everyone else, how to live within a budget. 
   Let us spend money on the priorities that serve the American people best. Let us save this kind of name-changing, sign-adjusting business until a day that we have extra money and no deficit. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against needless spending, and please join me in voting for this motion to recommit. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (A QUARTERLY REPORT CARD -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman McCarthy. I appreciate the opportunity to give this report on this first quarter. I think it is very apt for us to let the folks back home know exactly what is going on from a Republican perspective. 
   In the first quarter of the new Congress, the new Democrat majority has made its priorities clear by acting to impose higher taxes, more government spending and by attacking key aspects of the Idaho way of life. 
   In the last 3 months, the majority has acted to impose the largest tax increase in more than a decade. In fact, within the first month of Congress this new majority passed H.R. 6, a bill to increase by $7.7 billion over a 10-year period, an increase that will effectively affect the price of gas at the pump and further our addiction on foreign oil. 
   Instead of higher taxes and continued increasing reliance on foreign oil, my constituents need lower fuel prices, but in the first three months in Congress, this new majority has done nothing to lower fuel prices but to the contrary has acted to actually increase the price of gas. 
   In the same 3 months, the new majority has passed a budget that includes almost $400 billion in increased Federal spending, a budget that failed to address the explosive growth in entitlement spending, spending that will consume over 60 percent of the Federal budget in 15 years. 
   The Democratic majority has focused in the Natural Resources Committee on what they call the evolving West. Those of us who are actually from the West are calling it the war on the West. The majority has had countless hearings primarily to paint an inaccurate picture of the West and its issues. 
   The reform of Federal forest land management policies should be their focus in these hearings. We have forests that are overgrown and are fire hazards to our communities. We lack access to our lands, and we are under constant attack from radical environmentalists. We need better forest management, and the Federal Government needs to be a better landlord instead of an absentee one. 
   This should be the focus of their agenda in the Natural Resources Committee if they really want to help us in the West. 
   The priorities of this new majority were further illustrated when they mandated the Commander in Chief, withdraw troops on an unprecedented  and arbitrary timeline without any consideration of what is actually happening on the ground. The same new majority conditioned financial support for our troops on funding of unrelated and various pork barrel projects, including $5 million to study tropical fish and $74 million for peanut storage. 
   In a time of runaway deficit spending, something needs to change dramatically. The change the new majority proposed in the first three months, however, is to proceed in the wrong direction, the direction of debt, deficit and defeat.     
   We need to balance the budget. To do so, we must cut Federal spending. Congress' ongoing spending habits continue at the expense of our children, and we owe it to Americans and we owe it to our children and our grandchildren to cut spending. 
   That is why I stood with my Republican colleagues and supported an alternative budget plan to balance this Federal budget by 2012 in just 5 years. Together with a balanced budget, I also joined my colleagues cosponsoring legislation to make permanent numerous tax cuts, numerous tax credits that affect average American families. The American taxpayer will work through April 30 this year just to pay their share of taxes. 
   Well, change, indeed, must occur. My priorities for change are these: spending must be reduced, tax burden on American families and small businesses must be reduced, our natural resources in the West must be responsibly managed, the constitutional authority of the President must be respected. Unfortunately, the priorities of the new majority, as evidenced over the last 3 months, are not my priorities, and they are not the priorities that the people of Idaho hold.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, under Democrat leadership, the year 1993 witnessed the greatest tax increase in American history, until recently. Just 3 months into this new Congress, the Democrats have shown their vision for America with a more than $400 billion budget increase, an increase which can only be paid for through a colossal scale of taxation that will reach nearly every American. 
   The Federal Government has created a monster. Today, our Tax Code and regulations bulge at over 60,000 pages. I have yet to meet anyone who has read all of them. Americans pay billions of dollars to accountants and financial advisers just to comply with this labyrinth of rules. More than 50 percent of all taxpayers pay someone else to prepare their tax returns. 
   Planning for the future is challenging enough without the added headache of complex taxes and confusing deductions, not to mention the uncertainty of how taxes may change from one year to the next. Congress has the moral responsibility to remove the obstacles it has created that punish Americans who are simply working hard to achieve their dreams. 
   I encourage my colleagues in Congress to overhaul our cumbersome tax system.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, for the third time this Congress, the House of Representatives  is again addressing the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. For the third time, this House is considering a bill that would move millions of children away from private health insurance into government-run health care, substantially raise taxes, and dramatically increase federal spending. 
   Recently the President vetoed an SCHIP bill precisely because of these concerns. Yet here we are today with a bill that is remarkably similar. I am afraid that this Congress is not serious in addressing America's health care challenges, particularly health care for America's children. The majority purports that this bill is ``for the children.'' That phrase--``for the children''--is used like a club by our friends across the aisle whenever they want to pass bad bills. If we really care about children, we won't pass legislation that takes a giant step toward government-run health care. 
   That said, Madam Speaker, I am interested in more than this bill's title or good intentions. The success or failure of all legislation must be judged not by its intentions, but how it will affect real people, real families. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill is not the right policy for our children. Government health care is the most expensive and least efficient health care you can get. And that's exactly what this bill will produce. The Congressional Budget Office states that 2 million people actually will lose their private health insurance coverage and become enrolled in a government-run program. 
   This bill explodes funding for SCHIP above current law by $35.4 billion over 5 years and $71.5 billion over 10 years. The majority claims to fund this by raising taxes on tobacco products, yet the irony is that 22 million more smokers will be needed in just the next 5 years to fund the SCHIP bill we're considering. 
   Let me get this straight: We want healthy children and cancerous adults. I'm pretty new here in Congress, but even for a new kid on the Congressional block that doesn't seem to add up. 
   This bill is not about poor children. The bill defines the poverty level to qualify for SCHIP at 300 percent, which is around $62,000 for a family of four. That's $16,000 more than the median income in my home state. 
   Additionally, loopholes will allow states to define this poverty level and employ ``income disregards,'' thereby allowing families with even higher incomes to qualify for this expensive program. 
   Ostensibly ``for the children,'' this bill actually would increase the number of adults on SCHIP. The CBO projects that over 700,000 adults may be enrolled in SCHIP in FY2012. Shouldn't we be working to move people off of government health care and into private-sector care that works much better? We say we're for personal responsibility, free markets and red tape, yet this bill would create dependency, bigger government and more bureaucracy. 
   Finally, this bill substantially weakens the citizenship requirements to qualify for SCHIP, inviting fraud and abuse of this program by illegal aliens. The CBO projects that this fiscal disaster could cost the taxpayer around $3.7 billion in increased federal spending over the next 10 years. 
   This bill also changes the period of time a state has to spend its SCHIP allotment from 3 years to 2 years. This will significantly increase the strain on state budgets. 
   This proposal is not about good intentions, soothing sentiments, or warm feelings. It's about real people, real taxpayers, and real, quality, affordable and accessible health care. It fails miserably in every category. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this fatally flawed bill.

   Last week, the LCSC Warriors won the 52nd annual National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics championship World Series baseball game. It was LCSC's third straight win, and 16th since 1982, all under the leadership of Coach Ed Cheff. Lewis Clark State College can be proud of these men for an extraordinary win and the national recognition they are once again receiving. In fact, I was proud to recognize the fine athletes at LCSC by wearing their red, white, and blue uniform during the congressional baseball game last year.  
   Mr. Speaker, naturally I believe Idaho produces the best of everything. The best agriculture, the best companies, the best people, and, indeed, the best baseball players, originate in Idaho, and last week's win just proves the point. My congratulations to the Warriors, LCSC, and Lewiston, Idaho.

   We are a Nation of immigrants, and this bill emphasizes the many contributions of Caribbean immigrants to our society. Over 5 million Americans proudly share the Caribbean heritage in promoting and attending Caribbean-style festivals around the country. These festivals appreciate the rich culture, history and diversity brought forth through the joining of these two nations.

   Mr. Speaker, to most residents of Rogers County, Oklahoma, and rodeo fanatics, the name Clem Rogers McSpadden is well recognized and much appreciated. Known as a ``son of Oklahoma,'' Clem Rogers McSpadden was born into the well-known Rogers family of which his home county is named. His great uncle is none other than the famous Will Rogers. But it is not his historical family background that we are here to speak about today. 
   We rise to honor the achievements of Clem McSpadden during his life in politics, his military service, community leadership, and successful career in rodeo broadcasting. 
   Clem McSpadden was raised on his two family ranches, Bushyhead Ranch near Chelsea, Oklahoma, and another in nearby Oologah. During his first year in Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College, he left to join the U.S. Navy. 
   He served during World War II, and upon returning completed his education at Oklahoma A&M with a degree in animal husbandry. While at college, he and some friends formed a rodeo team. 
   His strong interest in roping began at an early age, and over time he served as general manager for the National Finals Rodeo, the Old Timers Rodeo and the Indian National Finals Rodeo. He has been announcing for over 60 years and estimates he has announced over 1,400 rodeos. 
   His esteemed career in politics came in 1954 when he was elected to the Oklahoma State senate, where he served until 1972. He went on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives one term in the 93rd Congress. In 1983, he formed a consulting and lobbying firm McSpadden & Associates, which lobbies the Oklahoma Statehouse on a variety of issues. His powerful presence and influence continue to drive politics of his beloved Oklahoma. 
   Nowadays, he spends his time more quietly at home on his vast cattle ranch enjoying retirement with his family.  
   I urge Members to join me, Mr. Speaker, in passing H.R. 2127 to name this post office for Clem Rogers McSpadden.

   Mr. Speaker, Major Scott Nisely, a father, athlete and musician, made the ultimate sacrifice for his country on the field of battle and deserves the honor of having his name on the post office in Marshalltown, Iowa, where he worked for 12 years. 
   Scott was born in Syracuse, Nebraska in 1958, and excelled in track and cross country. He attended Doane College on a track scholarship and pursued a degree in biology. 
   He showed a passion for his country and did not shy away from the duty of serving his Nation. While in college, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps ROTC, and after completing his Bachelor's degree in 1981, he was commissioned an Infantry Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps.     
   He rose to the rank of captain and commanded an infantry company during Operation Desert Storm. After his tour in Kuwait and Iraq, he returned to the Reserves, where he was promoted to the rank of major. 
   Scott continued to serve his community even when out of the military. In 1994 he began working for the U.S. Postal Service in Marshalltown. He participated in his church's music ministry program and was active at the local tae kwon do. Above all, he worked tirelessly to serve others. 
   Even with such an impressive record of service under his belt, he could not ignore the call of duty. When his country went to war again, he enlisted in the Iowa Army National Guard and accepted the rank of staff sergeant in order to do so. In 2005, he returned to Iraq with C Company of the Iowa National Guard's 133rd battalion. 
   On September 30, 2006, he was providing security for a convoy in Al Anbar Province, Iraq, when his company came under insurgent small arms fire. He and a fellow member of the Guard were killed. 
   His decorations include the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Bronze Star Medal, the Oak Leaf Cluster, the Purple Heart, the Army Achievement Medal, and a dozen others.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of Fairbury, Illinois' most famous citizens, and that was Dr. Francis Townsend. He was an American physician best known for creating the Townsend Old-age Revolving Pension plan and for spurring social movement that advocated for benefits for the elderly during the 1930s. 
   Dr. Townsend, the son of a farmer, grew up in Fairbury, Illinois, and attended Omaha Medical College in 1917. Shortly after becoming a physician, he served in the Army Medical Corps during World War I. After leaving the Army, he began a medical practice in Long Beach, California. When this was not successful, he obtained employment as the assistant city health director. Sadly, due to the Great Depression, he lost that job and was forced into retirement. 
   In 1933, Dr. Townsend witnessed something extremely heartbreaking but not uncommon during the Great Depression when he saw three old ladies searching through trash cans in his back alley for food. This became a watershed moment for the doctor. In response to what he observed, and his inner drive to help others, he decided to become involved in politics. Later that year he created the Townsend Plan, which proposed creating a Federal pension of $200 a month for every citizen 60 years old and older on the condition that the money would be spent within 30 days in order to stimulate the economy. 
   By 1934, through his leadership and determination to help the downtrodden, the plan generated a great deal of support and gave rise to the establishment of at least 5,000 ``Townsend clubs'' nationwide. At the height of popularity, membership in the clubs totaled over 2 million people. 
   By 1935, an additional 25 million Americans signed petitions to Congress  and the White House supporting the implementation of Dr. Townsend's plan. He became such a national celebrity by this time that he testified before Congress. 
   Thanks to Dr. Townsend's efforts, his social crusades sparked a national antipoverty movement in 1933 that likely contributed to the expedited passage of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Social Security Act of 1935, one of the major initiatives of the New Deal. 
   Dr. Townsend was a steadfast leader and original thinker. His efforts to fight poverty during our Nation's worst economic crisis and his exemplary civic activism are an example for us all. 
   Naming the Fairbury, Illinois, post office after one of its most famous citizens during the sesquicentennial anniversary of Fairbury is a fitting celebration of both Dr. Townsend's contributions to the city and to this important milestone.

   Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to imagine a time when national news took months and sometimes years to disseminate throughout the country. Today we get immediate news updates through various outlets. But it was over 2 years after President Lincoln gave the historical Emancipation Proclamation that the slaves of Galveston, Texas, learned that their long-deserved freedom had been won. It was on that date, June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers made their way southwest to spread the joyful news of their Civil War victory. 
   Every year on June 19, commonly known as Juneteenth Independence Day, African Americans in the Southwest and around the Nation celebrate their emancipation, their culture and the historic significance of the civil rights struggles. It is critical that we educate our children not only of American history and the Civil War, but the tradition of Juneteenth Independence Day. By taking time to celebrate these anniversaries, we honor the richness, diversity and heritage of all races that form our great Nation. 
   June 19th is a time to acknowledge a period of history that helped shape our Nation and continues to influence our society today. It is with great honor that I support the passage of House Concurrent Resolution 155.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, before I begin, I would first like to thank you for reminding the body of the need for decorum in our remarks 
   Madam Speaker, several points. First is, it is stunning to me that this body will consume over 36 hours of floor debate on a nonbinding resolution. This should be on the consent calendar. Irrespective of one's position on the war in Iraq, all taxpayers are right to be incensed at such waste in this Congress. 
   This legislation will not have the effect of law, will neither inspire nor impede military action in Iraq or elsewhere, will not encourage our troops on the ground nor foster victory over America's enemies that practice terror. It will have one effect: poking the President of the United States in the eye, diminishing his credibility among the international community and eroding his ability to lead here at home. It will also have the very genuine result of undermining and demoralizing our soldiers that are now in harm's way. 
   Second, equally stunning is the apparent preoccupation with demeaning President Bush while ignoring those who are our real enemies. Our enemies are not in the White House or the Defense Department. They are not people like David Petraeus or his staff. They are not the vast majority of Muslims throughout the world, who, like us, want simply to live peaceful and secure lives. 
   America's enemies are radical Islamists, less than 1 percent of all Muslims, whose faith requires that a pure Islamic state be established and that violence is the instrument by which to establish it. Their faith requires terrorist acts against the West and all Muslims who stand in the way of that agenda. That is why Osama bin Laden can say that he and his followers are ``in love with death.'' Indiscriminate slaughter is, for these sick people, merely a tool in their arsenal of moral barbarity. 
   That is why his second-in-command has declared that Iraq and Afghanistan are ``the two most crucial fields'' in their war. That is why al Qaeda in Iraq has declared an Islamic state in Iraq's Anbar Province. 
   Third, how do America's enemies view us? For one thing, they fear George W. Bush and our military. That is why Libya's Mu'ammar Qadhafi 3 years ago surrendered his nuclear materials to the U.S. That is why Moqtada al-Sadr, Iraq's most powerful militia leader, just made a beeline for Iran; not for a sunny vacation from long, tiresome days of planning suicide bombings, but because he feared for his life.     
   But America's enemies view Congress quite differently. They see us as divided, irresolute, unwilling to face honestly their concerted plan for our destruction. Hence, this nonbinding resolution. 
   In light of this reality, I would ask my friends across the aisle, what is your binding plan for defeating America's enemies? America, our allies and our enemies are still waiting for your binding plan. 
   More than 3,000 Americans have died upholding the hope of defeating America's real enemies and bringing freedom to Iraq. We must not allow their deaths to become a pretext for the abandonment of that hope of victory or abandoning the Iraqi people. But rather, they must serve as the inspiration of a renewed commitment to hope of victory and security for Iraq. We owe to their heroism and sacrifice nothing less than one thing, victory over America's enemies in Iraq. 
   America is the last best hope of man on Earth. A victory in Iraq is our last best hope of defeat of America's most dangerous enemies and also the freedom and security in the Middle East. We must not fail.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (ROE V. WADE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Thank you, gentlemen. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to commemorate National Sanctity of Human Life Day. This year marks the 35th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade, that landmark decision that so drastically altered the landscape. 
   This month also bears a sad distinction. In January 2008, we passed the tragic mark of 50 million lives that have been lost to abortion since Roe vs. Wade. We cannot help but wonder about the implications of this astonishing statistic. We are all concerned about the shortage of workers in our country. So many of those unborn lives lost due to Roe v. Wade would now be in the workforce. 
   What about Social Security? Could we not better sustain the vitality of the program if these same workers were paying into the system? These are matters of demographics and economics, yes, but ultimately they are about the most profound issue of all, the simple but indispensable sanctity of human life. 
   In this very room, from the view of the distinguished Speaker, the center of relief that looks over all of us is an image of Moses, the lawgiver. In the 90th Psalm, Moses wrote ``Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom ..... May your deeds be shown to your servants, your splendor to their children.'' 
   How many of our children will never be able to number their days because their days will never begin? How many will never know God's splendor in the life He wants for each of us, because they never have been allowed to see the light of day? 
   As the father of six and the grandfather of six, five of whom have been born and one who remains unborn, yes, a grandfather of six, I have watched the breathtaking miracle of life unfold again and again. Every time I see a small child, I am reminded of the wondrous blessings of a creator who allows us to share in the miracle of creation. 
   In the words of the poet William Wordsworth, ``Heaven lies about us in our infancy.'' It is essential for all of us to remember that in any abortion there are two victims, the mother and the unborn child. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have to do a better job of communicating to women in crisis what public and private resources are available to help them, to reach out more vigilantly to these women with a tenderness and a practical compassion our country has shown so often to so many.  
   I applaud the selfless unsung sacrifices of tens of thousands of our fellow citizens who care for women with crisis pregnancies and to provide spiritual, emotional and material support for them. 
   It is fitting that we recall the words of our Declaration of Independence, that our creator has endowed all with certain unalienable rights, the first of which is life. The little one in the womb is a person with value independent of his or her mother and deserves the right to that life. 
   As Members of Congress, we are uniquely positioned to protect the most innocent and vulnerable members of our society, the unborn. If we cannot protect the most innocent and helpless among us, how can we proclaim that we want to provide justice and protection for anyone else?     
   May those of us who believe in the uniqueness of human personhood, from conception to death, today again resolve never to cease our efforts to make our beloved country not only a beacon of hope but a sanctuary of human dignity. Surely there can be no higher calling for us as public servants of this blessed land.

<DOCNO>Mr. SALI. (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SALI. Madam Speaker, continuing on with the remarks that were just made, many U.S. companies are making plans of where they will spend their research and development budgets for the next 3 to 5 years. Unfortunately, this Congress has made it increasingly difficult for these companies to invest those R&D dollars with the kind of careful planning their needs demand. 
   High-tech companies are sending their R&D jobs abroad to countries that recognize that permanent R&D  tax incentives induce businesses to locate research activities there. Canada provides a 20 percent flat credit for R&D. Ireland offers a 20 percent credit, as well as a full deduction, a low corporate tax rate, advanced infrastructure and a skilled, English-speaking workforce, all factors that appeal to many multi-national companies. 
   Madam Speaker, these jobs sent overseas are permanently lost when a company starts a new R&D project. We must keep these jobs here. The R&D credit has already lapsed. The clock is ticking. Congress must extend the R&D tax credit today, and we must also foster R&D at home by making this important tax credit permanent.
