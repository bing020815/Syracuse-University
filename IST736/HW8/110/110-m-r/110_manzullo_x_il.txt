<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1612. S. 1612 is legislation which significantly increases the enforcement and deterrent effects of sanctions and export control violations imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, otherwise known as IEEPA. 
   Through this law, the President may respond to unusual and extraordinary threats originating in substantial part outside of the United States by, among other things, prohibiting transactions associated with particular entities or countries. 
   In other words, IEEPA authorizes the President to impose economic and financial sanctions against certain foreign threats to the U.S. and our interests around the world. An example of success was the use of these tools to bring North Korea back to the bargaining table to eliminate their nuclear program. 
   IEEPA is also vital to U.S. national security because it continues the expired Export Administration Act in full force, allowing the Department of Commerce to carry out its mission of ensuring sensitive goods and technologies do not fall into the hands of our adversaries. It is important to keep the EAA in force so violators do not escape the penalties of the law on a mere technicality. 
   I would like to take the time to respectfully remind the administration that IEEPA brings the entire Export Administration Act into force, not just certain provisions. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation would remove existing barriers to meaningful enforcement of U.S. sanctions against terrorist financers, proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, Iran, Sudan, and other threats under IEEPA. 
   Current penalties under IEEPA do not constitute an effective deterrent to entities that violate the law by engaging in prohibited transactions. 
   The legislation will remedy that problem by increasing civil penalties from $50,000 to $250,000 and increasing criminal penalties for willful violations to $1 million with a maximum jail sentence of 20 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I strongly support this increase in penalties to willful and  knowing violators, I have expressed concern that these increased penalties may be applied without taking into account unintentional, accidental, or inadvertent violations by companies that are trying to comply with the law. 
   I have since been assured by the Departments of Treasury and Commerce that they will not abuse this new authority, and I include for the Record the letter sent to me by Under Secretary of Commerce Mancuso.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Speaker, the horrendous massacre that is taking place in Burma is despicable and unconscionable. Now is the time for Members of this House to condemn the military junta and support human rights by supporting my good friend, Representative Peter King's resolution on Burma. 
   On September 27, 2007 the military junta violated the sacred traditional sanctuary of Buddhist temples in mass coordinated pre-dawn raids. More than 200 monks were arrested. What we know is that at least five  monks, eight civilian protestors, and a Japanese photographer were killed by the army. But how many more were gunned down or dragged off in the middle of the night by the junta may never be known. 
   This resolution not only calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Nobel Peace Price laureate Aung San Suu Kyi but also for a restoration of democracy and human rights that has eluded the people of Burma for so long. The Rangoon Massacre only makes our call for the return to democracy ever more urgent. 
   Burma was once the richest country in Southeast Asia and the world's largest rice exporter. However, as a result of decades of corruption and gross mismanagement, Burma is now an economic failure. Countless Burmese are regularly victimized by human traffickers as they seek a better life outside the country. The junta's decision in August to hike fuel prices further threatened the people's livelihood. This led to the largest street demonstrations in two decades. So, instead of listening to the will of the people, the generals have only made things worse by cracking down violently. 
   Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of Burma's George Washington. Ms. Suu Kyi is the living symbol of Burmese democracy, and this year she turns 62. How much longer must democracy and freedom be held hostage? 
   President Bush, in his recent speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York, announced plans for new U.S. sanctions against the military regime in Burma. I join the President in calling on the U.N. to act more decisively in the face of the unprecedented demonstrations taking place in that country. Now is the time for the world community to stand up for human rights and democracy. 
   Who else will join the U.S. in raising their voice against this injustice? Singapore has issued a strong statement on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. I commend them for this. However, more needs to be done. Burma's neighbors can make a real difference by letting the junta know that their actions will not be tolerated. China, India, and Russia must act too because the world is watching.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (CONDEMNING ASSASSINATION OF FORMER PAKISTANI PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO AND REAFFIRMING COMMITMENT OF UNITED STATES TO ASSIST PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my anger and sadness regarding the assassination of former Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto. The horrific murder of Prime Minister Bhutto is a chilling reminder that extremist forces are continually trying to undermine democracy and freedom. Today, we stand with the democrats in Pakistan and throughout the world to oppose tyranny and terrorism. 
   Benazir Bhutto was the first woman elected to lead a Muslim state and served twice as Prime Minister of Pakistan. I had the distinct honor and privilege to meet her when she spoke to members of the House International Relations Committee during the mid-1990's in an ornate ceremonial room just one floor below this rostrum. Her accomplishment paved the way for other women leaders to seek and win top offices throughout the developing world. Bhutto's dedication to democracy in Pakistan is closely tied to the time she spent as a student in the United States. In fact, she credits her exposure to America as a driving force behind her push for a free Pakistan. 
   Former Prime Minister Bhutto was also no stranger to the good people of Illinois' 16th Congressional District. In 2002, she spoke to an overflow audience at Rockford College about the link between promoting democracy and defeating extremist terrorists. I know I speak for the people of northern Illinois in expressing our heartfelt gratitude that she visited Rockford. Bhutto's speech was inspirational and enlightening. I enclose for the Record the article titled, ``Ex-Premier Pushes U.S. to Aid Democracy Fight'' from the Rockford Register Star, published on September 20, 2002, discussing Bhutto's historic remarks at Rockford College. 
   Pakistan must continue its journey to political reform and democracy. The United States must stand with those who advocate for the fundamental freedoms that were bestowed onto all of us by our creator. Let's not forget Bhutto's legacy and stand with the people of Pakistan in this dark hour.   
   Ex-Premier Pushes U.S. To Aid Democracy Fight 
   ROCKFORD.--Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said Thursday that people of her country support her battle to bring democracy to Pakistan. She wants President Bush to help. 
   The deposed leader--who at age 35 became the first female prime minister in the Muslim world--continues her efforts, made more important in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 
   Bhutto remains critical of the regime of Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who has controlled the country since 1999. She is an author and active in the Pakistan People's Party, the country's largest, pro-democracy party. 
   ``I support democracy in Pakistan and, with the war on terrorism, there is a new commitment to bringing democracy to the Muslim world and the empowering of the Muslim people based on fundamental human rights,'' she said. 
   Bhutto planned to share this message later Thursday night with a sold-out crowd at Maddox Theatre at Rockford College. Additional crowds were seated in the Cheek Theatre and dance studio to watch a live television feed of Bhutto's presentation. 
   Bhutto's visit kicked off the 2002-03 Rockford College Forum Series, a program of speakers and workshops focused on the politics and culture of Islam. 
   Bhutto acknowledged that she hasn't met with Bush about bringing democracy to her home country but ``other U.S. officials'' assured her that the United States remains committed to fostering democracy in Pakistan. 
   ``I want President Bush to say `Look, you've been our ally, and we want to help bring democracy because democracy doesn't promote terrorism,' '' she said. 
   Her determination to see Pakistan become a democracy began after she completed her education at Radcliffe College and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, in the late 1970s. 
   Bhutto was born June 21, 1953, in Karachi, Pakistan. In 1977, at age 24, she returned home and took up the struggle to restore democracy and human rights in the country as a leader of the Pakistan People's Party. 
   Bhutto faced imprisonment and exile while guiding the resistance to Pakistan's military regime. 
   Her government was replaced by opposing political forces in 1990, but Bhutto was again elected prime minister in 1993 and served until 1996, when the government was overthrown by a military coup. 
   ``My leadership was of different vision than the conservatives. It was dictatorship vs. democracy.'' 
   Jeff Hendry, chairman of the forum series committee, said Bhutto's visit was ``huge, especially now with all the news in that part of the world.'' 
   In her speech: ``she will deal with the international political climate and deal more with what the U.S. can do and should be doing to bring democracy to Pakistan as well as the strategic importance of the region,'' he said.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (NATIONAL STEM SCHOLARSHIP DATABASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, the science and technology and math education fields, they are inseparable, tremendous assets to our economic strength and national security. These disciplines are critical to ensuring our global competitiveness, and the demand for knowledge-based jobs is growing. 
   From 1994 to 2003, the proportion of the work force working in STEM fields jumped from 17 percent to 23 percent. Furthermore, if trends in manufacturing continue, over 40 percent of factory jobs will require postsecondary education by 2012.     
   I spend at least half of my time in Congress working on manufacturing issues, one of the founders of the manufacturing caucus, and serve as co-chairman, along with Congressman TIM RYAN from the State of Ohio, and this is obviously a bipartisan effort in order to encourage more education of people who will be qualified to play a more meaningful role in the field of manufacturing. 
   The skyrocketing cost of college education have made access to this type of education more and more difficult for many of our brightest students. This bill seeks to correct the problem. It  creates a web portal of public and private science, technology, math education scholarships, loans, and grants that are available. And the database would be searchable by field of study, demographics, and level of study. By placing all of these scholarships in one easily accessible location, H.R. 1051 greatly increases the chances that our students will be able to pursue these valuable opportunities. 
   It is not without coincidence this bill comes up 3 to 4 weeks after the missed reauthorization wherein we set aside a certain amount of money to complete the huge web portal that would replace what agencies are doing in manufacturing and what programs are available. So this fits very tidily into that program, and I would encourage that the House adopt it.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Speaker, I am privileged to be a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Our chairman, Mr. Lantos, has scheduled for March a hearing to discuss the different proposals relating to the handling of the war in Iraq. He has promised a lot of time for debate on all the different bills introduced in the House of Representatives, ranging from those that call for us to pull out of Iraq immediately, to those that demonstrate our presence there as part of a larger war, not against a nation, but against a movement, Islamic jihadis. They are everywhere and are responsible for attacks in India, Jordan, Israel, England, Egypt, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Spain, Turkey, the Gaza, Morocco, Pakistan and in the United States and Iraq. 
   Chairman Lantos wants to make sure that all sides are heard, that all possible alternatives are given an airing. But that is what is missing in the bill that the Democratic majority has given us this evening: it can't be amended. Can you imagine three days of debate without the opportunity to amend a bill? That implies the Democratic leadership believes they have a monopoly on truth and fear input from other Members of Congress. 
   The bill we are debating today condemns the infusion of up to 21,000 more troops in Iraq. However, at a time when we should be excited about a new proposal calling for a major shift in our policy on Iraq, the bill we are debating condemns it. This proposal taps as its new leader Lieutenant General David Patraeus, who should be given an opportunity to succeed. Confirmed unanimously by the Senate, he has extensive knowledge of other wars and military conflicts and has resolved that America can achieve a favorable result in Iraq. 
   The new policy is a shift in the rules of engagement and calls upon the Iraqis themselves to step up in responsibility and achievement. A Washington Post story dated January 12 of this year with the byline, ``Withdrawals could start if Iraq plan works: Gates,'' repeats the words of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on January 11, Gates said: ``If these operations actually work, you can begin to see a lessening of the U.S. footprint both in Baghdad and Iraq itself. Then you could have a situation later this year where you could actually begin withdrawing.'' 
   Isn't that what Americans want, a plan of action with a new focus, stabilizing Iraq and bringing our troops home? But that plan is not being debated today, and that is why I am going to vote against this resolution. 
   We live in extremely dangerous times. We know Iran is developing atomic weaponry. We also know that six other Arab nations are actively seeking atomic technology, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The stakes are onerous. That is why America's men and women in uniform not only deserve our support in the field, but also here in the House of Representatives, by allowing their opinions to be voiced through their Members of Congress. It is the least we can do for them.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 556. This bill strikes the correct balance between the need to increase foreign direct investment and national security. 
   Let me first make clear that I am a strong supporter of foreign direct investment, which represents the insourcing of capital and local jobs to America. The congressional district that I am pleased to represent has had several manufacturing facilities that have benefited, and some have been saved as a direct result of foreign direct investment. This includes investment from businesses located in Great Britain, Sweden, Canada, Israel, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Japan, Brazil and Italy. Even a Chinese enterprise bought a nonsecurity-sensitive manufacturing facility in my congressional district at a time when no other financing was available. 
   These investments have been critical for saving and creating jobs in the 16th District of Illinois. While I very much am interested in maintaining full foreign direct investments, I recognize it is important for our national security to regulate the types of businesses that receive such investment. 
   The bill before us ensures us that the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, known as CFIUS, will conduct an extended review when a foreign government tries to purchase a company within the United States. The bill also mandates greater transparency by ensuring that Congress is informed of a CFIUS investigation in a timely manner. 
   I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the rule and in favor of final passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act (H.R. 5819). I am a long-time supporter of the Small Business Innovative  Research, SBIR, and the Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, program because it requires federal agencies with at least a $100 million research and development, R&D, budget to set aside a certain percentage of awards for small firms. The SBIR program was created in 1982 because small businesses--the most innovative sector of our economy--received very few R&D awards. Almost the entire federal R&D budget back then went to large firms and academic institutions. 
   There are many good provisions in H.R. 5819. Section 102 increases the small business set-aside in the SBIR program from 2.5 percent to 3 percent. The SBIR awards come in three phases--Phase 1 is for start-ups; Phase II is for follow-on work; and Phase III is for commercialization of the product either in the form of government procurement or for sale in the marketplace. Section 103 increases the maximum award in Phase I from $100,000 to $750,000. For Phase II awards, the maximum award goes up from $300,000 to $2.2 million. There are no grant dollars for the Phase III or commercialization phase. In the past, few federal agencies had any interest in Phase III. However, H.R. 5819 contains several provisions, most particularly in Title IV, to encourage commercialization of products developed with SBIR awards. 
   However, Section 201 of H.R. 5819 opens up more of the SBIR program to small firms that have significant investments from venture capital (VC) companies. For the purposes of the SBIR program, a small firm would be considered to be independently owned and operated even with a majority share owned by VC firms. VC investments, unlike a bank loan, make the ``owner'' of the company no longer the true leader of the firm if venture capitalists own more than 50 percent of the firm. In other words, he or she doesn't control the ultimate destiny or direction of the company--the ``owner'' has to take ultimate direction from the VC firms. The small business is no longer independently owned and operated. Thus, if a small company receives venture capital even from multiple sources to pursue Vaccine A but then sees the research going in a different direction to develop Vaccine B, the ``owner'' of the company will be compelled to complete the research on Vaccine A for which he or she received funding unless the ``owner'' receives permission from the venture capitalists to pursue Vaccine B. 
   The only limitations on VC investments in Section 201 for SBIR firms are that (1) no one single VC firm can own a majority of the tech company applying for a SBIR grant; (2) the VC firm does not control a majority of the seats on the tech company's board of directors; (3) only ``small'' VCs, as defined in the bill as those VC firms employing 500 employees or less, can participate; and (4) a ``corporate-owned'' VC firm can only own up to 10 percent of a SBIR tech company and that a SBIR tech company can only have one investment from a corporate VC. My concerns are that the first two limitations can be easily evadable by creative VCs that set up multiple firms. The third limitation dealing with a small business definition of a VC encompasses almost every VC in the nation. The Small Business Administration (SBA) currently defines small venture capital firms as those with less than $6.5 million in annual receipts. There is no need to change the small business definition of a VC. 
   In Section 110, H.R. 5819 also allows firms to apply directly for Phase II awards, bypassing the Phase I process. In my opinion, combining three key elements of H.R. 5819--dramatically higher awards (Section 103), allowing almost every VC in the nation to own more than a majority of a SBIR firm (Section 201), and bypassing Phase I (Section 110)--sets up a stage where VC-owned ``small'' firms will gobble up most of the money in the SBIR program. Then, there would be a dramatic drop-off in the number of truly very small and independently-owned companies in the SBIR program, particularly those looking for Phase 1 start-up funding. 
   During my tenure as Chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I spent a lot of time and effort trying to solve the specific problem of the eligibility of some small businesses with venture capital investments to participate in the SBIR program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). After the Defense Department, the NIH is the second- largest spender of R&D funding in the federal government. This issue of the role of VC investment in SBIR companies seems primarily confined to NIH. 
   Section 201 in H.R. 5819 tries to solve a problem that is grossly exaggerated. It is a myth that small businesses with VC investments are unable to participate in the SBIR program at NIH because of a misinterpretation of the law by the SBA. In an impartial Government Accountability Office (GAO) study that was released in 2006, the GAO discovered that 17 percent of NIH SBIR awards, accounting for 18 percent of the dollar value, went to small businesses with VC investments in Fiscal Year 2004. These small firms had no problem in complying with SBA guidelines. Nevertheless, I tried to proffer a compromise to establish a two-year pilot SBIR-like program to set-aside 0.5 percent of NIH R&D funding for smaller firms that receive a preponderance of their funding from VCs and do not own or control their company. Unfortunately, my compromise was rejected by NIH and by the biotech and VC industries. However, the solution contained in Section 201 is a dramatic overreach in the effort to solve this specific problem with NIH. 
   Finally, the Bush Administration shares my concern on this issue. According to the Statement of Administration Policy issued on April 22, 2008, ``the Administration believes that H.R. 5819 goes too far in relaxing constraints on venture capital ownership of firms receiving SBIR and STTR funds, which could lead to inappropriate subsidization of well-capitalized businesses that do not warrant funding through a set-aside program. The Administration is reviewing whether venture capital funding of businesses receiving SBIR and STTR funds could be expanded through reforms of SBA regulations without inappropriately providing Federal commercialization subsidies to well-capitalized businesses.'' 
   Thus, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 5819.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO THOSE AFFECTED BY THE DEVASTATING SHOOTING INCIDENT AT NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my deepest sympathies to the victims and their families who suffered the horrific shooting tragedy at Northern Illinois University. 
   I would like to offer my deep thanks and gratitude to Chairman George Miller and Ranking Member BUCK MCKEON of the Education and Labor Committee for allowing this resolution to come to the floor for expedited consideration. 
   Northern Illinois University is one of the largest schools in Illinois. It's over 25,000 students, and it's centered in the corn fields in the beautiful city of DeKalb, Illinois. And it reaches throughout the entire State and indeed around the country and in many cases around the world with the diversity of the foreign students. My colleagues and I represent thousands of Northern Illinois University faculty, staff and graduates. The tragedy has shaken all of us. 
   Schools are supposed to be a sanctuary of safety, which is why the news that came out of NIU on the afternoon of February 14 was particularly tragic. A lone gunman, a former NIU student, opened fire on an oceanography class, killing five students and wounding 17 more in a matter of seconds. The NIU police were in the auditorium within 30 seconds of the shots being fired. Shortly afterwards he killed himself, but all of the shooting took place prior to the police arriving, even in that short period of time. Many of us remember the shock we felt almost a year ago when 33 members of the Virginia Tech community were lost in a similar senseless act of violence. 
   As a father of three children in college, I cannot even imagine the sorrow and hurt the families are experiencing. I shared that a bit this past week when I, along with Senators DURBIN and OBAMA and Representatives EMANUEL, ROSKAM and BEAN stood with a crowd of more than 10,000 mourners on the NIU campus to memorialize this tragedy. 
   But still the sorrow and the shock remain. We cannot bring back these young men and women to the classroom, to the sidewalks of DeKalb, or to the arms of their families. We cannot explain why, but we continue to search for answers. But as we did last week at NIU, we can pause to remember the spirit, energy and life of each of the five students lost in this tragedy. 
   Gayle Dubowski, was a 25-year-old anthropology major from Carol Stream. She loved the arts, and was committed to her Christian faith. Her friends remembered her as a sweet and genuine person, someone who shined brightly for her Lord on the campus of NIU. 
   Catalina Garcia, 20 years old of Cicero, Illinois, a first-generation American who hoped to be a teacher. An honor student, an athlete and a dancer in high school, her teachers remember her as a quiet girl but with big ideas. Jamie Garcia, her older brother, says he'll always remember her as the family princess. 
   Julianna Gehant, age 32 of Mendota, Illinois, had served our Nation for 12 years in the Army and Army Reserves. She enrolled at NIU to major in elementary education, a childhood friend remembered, because she loved the innocence and creativity of children. 
   Ryanne Mace, age 19 of Carpentersville, was an only child whose friends remember her rarely being without a smile. She majored in psychology to pursue her dream of helping others. Her roommate remembers her as a vibrant person, full of life, never wanting to miss a beat. 
   Daniel Parmenter, age 20 of Westchester, Illinois, is remembered as a 6-foot-5 rugby player with a gentle spirit and a bright future. His family has memories of his touching gestures, phone calls and small acts of love and courage. His last act of love was to throw himself in front of his girlfriend and he took the fire and was killed. And she was injured. 
   It is an honor to have these students remembered in this body and to remember the courage of those who responded that day. The purpose of this resolution is to express the condolences of the House to those affected by this devastating tragedy. 
   The Bible tells us to mourn with those who mourn, to pray for one another that we may be healed. We pray the healing continue for the families and the victims of Northern Illinois University.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT EXPANSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the Small Business Investment Expansion Act of 2007, H.R. 3567. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates that this bill will cost $102 million over the next 5 years. Thus far this year, the CBO estimates that the Democrat-controlled House Small Business Committee has authorized $5.9 billion in new spending over the next 5 years--$1.55 billion in fiscal year 2008 alone. To put this massive spending increase in perspective, the Fiscal Year 2008 Financial Services Appropriations bill, H.R. 2829, provides $582 million in total spending on the SBA in FY 08. 
   In the past, legislation dealing with programs in the Small Business Investment Act operated under the assumption that the bill should not cost the taxpayer any new money. I am proud that the Republican-led Congress took the Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, program to ``zero-subsidy,'' funded solely by user-fees, first with the debenture program in 1996 and then the participating securities program in 2001. I regret that because of the downturn in the markets earlier this decade, the participating securities component of the SBIC program, which targeted equity investments in early stage small businesses, has become essentially insolvent and defunct since 2005. During the 109th Congress, I tried numerous ways in my capacity as chairman of the House Small Business Committee, to thread the needle to reopen the participating securities program while still keeping it at ``zero subsidy.'' However, H.R. 3567 abandons fiscal restraint by creating yet another new program to promote equity investments in early stage small businesses. 
   First, CBO estimates that the creation of the Angel Investment Program in Title III of H.R. 3567 will cost $57 million over the next 5 years. While there is a provision that requires an angel group repay any investment it receives, the repayment comes solely out of any profit the group receives. But what if the angel group makes no money? Then the taxpayer is left holding the bag. This is a departure from the regular SBIC program where upfront fees are also charged, in addition to retaining a share of the profits, to help offset the cost of the program. 
   The bill creates yet another new office and more bureaucracy at the Small Business Administration, SBA, to promote angel investments in early stage small firms. It also spends $1 million to create a Federal angel network to collect and maintain information on local and regional angel investors that is readily available over the Internet, e.g., www.bandofangels.com. H.R. 3567 also spends $1.5 million to create yet another grant program to increase awareness and education about angel investing, heaping potentially yet another mission upon the already stretched Small Business Development Center, SBDC, program. Earlier this year, the House passed three SBDC-related bills that created nine new programs for them to implement. 
   Last year, I held a hearing on the Small Business Committee to listen to the leading experts on the angel movement. At the time, the committee debated similar angel legislation, H.R. 4565, offered by Democrats to what is on the floor today. All the witnesses except the one called by the Democrats testified that because of the decentralized and informality of angels, a tax credit modeled after what exists in many states is far more preferable to creating yet another office and program at the SBA to promote angel investments. This is what the leading experts in the angel movement said about the ideas contained in H.R. 4565, which is now Title III of H.R. 3567, at the May 10, 2006, Small Business Committee hearing: 
   Dr. Ian Sobieski, founder and managing director of the Band of Angels: ``I would be wary of any kind of government interaction with angel groups because of the danger of perturbing a natural market process that is still good for it. The tax credit changes the environment in which capital decisions are being made ..... The danger in ..... data collection is the implied authority by which it is collected. If the Federal Government gets involved in collecting data (on angels) that has the imprimatur of the United States Government, that speaks with great weight.'' 
   Susan Preston of Davis, Wright Tremaine LLP: ``..... the vast majority of investments by angels are done by individuals, not members of angel groups. These are highly independent autonomous anonymous individuals that don't want their name in databases and aren't interested, for the most part, in joining groups.'' 
   I simply don't understand why this Democratic-led Congress ignores the advice of angel experts to direct the SBA to provide capital to extremely wealthy individuals to support investments they probably would make anyway. I'm also surprised that this Democratic-led Congress, which routinely criticizes the SBA for its alleged incompetence, would add another yet another mission to its responsibilities. That's why I was proud to join Representative EARL POMEROY of North Dakota in reintroducing the alternative to this government-run approach--the Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs, ACE, Act of 2007, H.R. 578--to keep decisions on angel investments at the individual and local level. 
   Second, I also have concerns about Title II of H.R. 3567 that dramatically expands the New Markets Venture Capital, NMVC, program and opens up the Federal Government to more exposure. The CBO estimates that Title II raises the subsidy or exposure rate to 17 percent and will cost the taxpayer $11 million over the next 5 years. The mission of the  NMVC is to promote venture capital investments in economically distressed communities in both urban and rural America. However, I believe the NMVC program is already a triplicate of two other programs that already exists--the regular SBIC program and the Rural Business Investment, RBIC, program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA. Of the 2,299 U.S. small businesses that received SBIC financing in fiscal year 2005, 23 percent were located in Low- and Moderate-Income (LMI) areas of the country. Those LMI-district companies received $543 million or 19 percent of the total $2.9 billion invested by SBICs in FY 2005. Also, 
   30 percent of SBIC investments were made in small U.S. manufacturers. For the period FY 2001 through FY 2005, SBIC investments in small manufacturing companies totaled $4.3 billion. In addition, the USDA runs the RBIC program in cooperation with the SBA to promote equity investments in rural areas. Thus, I see no need expand a program to help small businesses that are already being assisted by two other government programs. 
   Third, I object to reinstating taxpayer funding for the surety bond program. This program is important to help small businesses, primarily small construction firms, win federal government contracts by offering a bond to guarantee that the work will be completed. To cover the costs of those guarantees, fees are paid to the SBA by both the contractor receiving the guarantee and the surety or insurance company that issues the bond for the contractor's performance. In fiscal year 2006, the SBA provided guarantees under the surety bond program for about 5,000 small businesses and collected about $7 million in fees. Section 405 of H.R. 3567 eliminates fees that are currently charged to contractors and sureties. That's why the CBO estimates Section 405 will cost the taxpayer over the next 5 years. 
   Mr. Chairman, there is no need to do this. During my tenure as chairman of the Small Business Committee, I never heard from a small business complaining about fees charged in the surety bond program. This could develop into a problem for the Federal Government when small businesses, which have no financial stake in their surety bond and thus have nothing at risk if they default, do not complete the contract. I predict that there will be more broken contracts and uncompleted work. Section 405 also sets a precedent to do away with the ``zero'' subsidy policy in other SBA programs, such as in the 7(a) loan guarantee program. 
   But the most egregious provision in H.R. 3567 is the revamping of small business size standards in Title V. This provision allows companies not independently-owned and operated but controlled by venture capital, VC, investors to still be considered as a small business in the eyes of the Federal Government. Title V will allow large businesses and universities that establish a VC to potentially game the system to benefit from not just various SBA technology programs but every other SBA loan and procurement assistance program. It could even complicate the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which requires Federal agencies to take into account the interests of small businesses during the development of new regulations. When I was chairman of the Small Business Committee, I was proud of the bipartisan support I received in eliminating big businesses from participating in various federal small business programs. This led the SBA to finally clamp down on this abuse and issue new regulations and policies to do away with this practice. However, I fear that many of my colleagues have not fully thought through the implications of this provision. Title V would undo all the bipartisan work done on this issue over the past five years. 
   In particular, I spent a lot of time and effort trying to solve the specific problem of the eligibility of some small businesses with venture capital investments to participate in the Small Business Innovative Research, SBIR, program at the National Institutes of Health, NIH. The SBIR program guarantees that at least 2.5 percent of Federal research and development, R&D, dollars must go to small businesses. After the Defense Department, the NIH is the second-largest spender of R&D funding in the Federal Government. 
   Title V tries to solve a problem that is grossly exaggerated. It is a myth that small businesses with VC investments are unable to participate in the SBIR program at NIH because of a misinterpretation of the law by the SBA. In an impartial Government Accountability Office, GAO, study that I requested, they discovered that 17 percent of NIH SBIR awards, accounting for 18 percent of the dollar value, went to small business with VC investments in fiscal year 2004. These small firms had no problem in complying with SBA guidelines. Nevertheless, I tried to proffer a compromise that would have established a 2-year pilot program to set-aside 0.5 percent of NIH R&D funding, over-and-above the 2.5 percent currently set-aside for small businesses, for these firms that receive a preponderance of their funding from VCs and do not own or control their company. Unfortunately, my compromise was rejected by NIH and by the biotech and VC industries. However, the solution contained in Title V is a dramatic overreach in the effort to solve this specific problem with NIH. 
   The amendment offered by my good friend and colleague, Representative STEVE CHABOT of Ohio, is a good step forward. It prohibits any one single VC from owning a small business that wishes to benefit from a SBA program. However, I can easily envision a situation where two VCs with common ownership but with different board of directors could game the system and still be eligible for SBA programs. Because even the largest VCs have less than 500 employees, Title V--even as changed by the Chabot amendment--would open up SBA programs to large businesses and universities. 
   In particular, I am concerned about the future of the SBIR program. It's important to remember that when the SBIR program was created 25 years ago, it was because of the frustration that federal research and development dollars went only to large businesses and universities. Even under current law, only 2.5 percent of all Federal R&D dollars is set-aside for small business. But Title V allows large universities that establish a VC to participate in the SBIR program. This provision will further decrease Federal R&D dollars going to independently owned and operated small high technology firms. 
   Mr. Chairman, I enclose for the record the Statement of Administration Policy in opposition to this bill plus two letters from the oldest small business association in America--the National Small Business Association; a letter from the nation's only association that represents small high technology firms--the Small Business Technology Council; and a letter from the world's largest business federation--the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. I urge my colleagues to heed the recommendations of the administration and these business associations by voting against H.R. 3567.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, when Jefferson was given the duty and obligation of drafting the Declaration of Independence, he could have turned to the Revolutionaries of lower Europe, the followers of Russo, which led to the Jacobites and the reign of terror who believe that man is the center of the universe and man is the ultimate judge of what is truth. 
   But instead, Jefferson turned to the writings of Blackstone and Locke. Ms. Blackstone, the great jurist of England, examined the laws of England and laid them side by side with the biblical statements to come up with something called the Doctrine of Natural Law. And Blackstone said, When the supreme being formed the universe and created matter out of nothing, he impressed certain principles upon that matter from which it could never depart, without which it would cease to be. 
   This will of a Maker is called the Law of Nature for as God, when he created matter and did it with a principle of mobility, established certain rules for the perpetual direction of that motion so when he created man and indued him with free will to conduct himself in all parts of life, he laid down certain immutable laws of human nature. 
   Considering the Creator only as a being of infinite power, he was able unquestionably to prescribe whatever laws he placed to his creature, man, whoever unfit or severe. But as he is also a being of infinite wisdom, he has laid down only such laws as were founded in those relations of justice. 
   These are the quotes of Blackstone. It was the thoughts of Blackstone, in fact many of the words that were incorporated directly into the Declaration of Independence, and that great document set forth not only our severance from Great Britain, but also a statement as to the source of laws in this country that God is the source of liberty, that man is given the power to form governments for the purpose of protecting those rights that God gives.     
   Jefferson took that knowledge, sat down, inscribed that into the Declaration, and that's what forms the basis of the law of America. It's the law of nature and of nature's God.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Today, we rise to offer our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the people of China for the horrific loss they suffered as a result of the gigantic earthquake that struck Sichuan Province in southwestern China on May 12 of this year. The 7.9 earthquake struck without warning during the busiest time of the day when schools and office buildings were full of people. And as Congressman Wu states, the toll of the dead has not yet been completed, except we know it remains in the tens of thousands, including those that remain missing. At least 10 to 12 million people remain displaced, and we all saw with horror on television the school that had collapsed on over 900 children on that one particular site. 
   I want to thank Mr. Wu for sponsoring this resolution so that the House of Representatives can stand with the people of China in their hour of need. I also want to commend the American people for showing their generosity in pledging humanitarian support for the victims. In America, the sense of loss is perhaps felt strongest in the Chinese American communities where loved ones pray and hope for positive news from across the Pacific. 
   Madam Speaker, I chaired the U.S.-China Interparliamentary Exchange for 7 years, and I'm now the vice-chair. I had the opportunity to travel extensively in China, including the Chengdu area in 2005, as part of our official business. To see the utter destruction on television comes as a complete shock. I echo the words of the President in saying that we admire the spirit and the character of the Chinese people as they desperately strive to put their lives back together. 
   I also want to commend the Chinese Government for not being embarrassed or too proud to seek out and receive help from American resources. I only wish that the Government of Burma were as open under these particular and similar circumstances. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I rise in support of House Resolution 1194, which reaffirms America's support for the Government of Lebanon and condemns the violent Islamic group Hezbollah and its state sponsors, Iran and Syria, for undermining the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon. 
   For over two decades, Hezbollah and its state sponsors have done everything in their power to destroy any hope for a free and democratic Lebanon. In response, some have tried to compromise with Hezbollah to incorporate it into the Lebanese electoral system, to pretend that it is a group of Lebanese freedom fighters instead of a wholly-controlled subsidiary of Iran and Syria, to permit it to arm and re-arm in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and to excuse its relentless attacks and incitement against America and Israel. 
   Mr. Speaker, America and other responsible nations must stop Hezbollah's current attempt to rule by the gun. We must support efforts in the U.N. Security Council and elsewhere to ensure that Hezbollah is disarmed and that Iran and Syria are barred from rearming that group. Moreover, we must hold Iran and Syria accountable for the continuing efforts to spread violence and to undermine our allies in the Middle East, including Lebanon, Iraq, and Israel. 
   Mr. Speaker, Iran and Syria continue to start fires throughout the region only to disingenuously step forward and offer to put them out for an unconscionable price. We must cease falling prey to their deception, and we must stop their deadly behavior, which undermines the security of Lebanon and the entire world.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (TRIBUTE TO RAY <em>LaHOOD</em> AND JERRY WELLER -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Speaker, tonight we recognize the retirement of two great Members of Congress from the State of Illinois, JERRY WELLER and RAY LAHOOD. Both of these gentlemen came with the great Republican class of 1994. It's indicative because these are two guys that are rebels with a cause, always believed in a continuous fight, never would miss a fight that would take place on the floor of the House. 
   And in particular, RAY LAHOOD, who represents Abraham Lincoln's old district in Illinois, probably one of the greatest institutionalists. A person who has been with this Chamber for a considerable period of time serving as chief of staff to minority leader Bob Michel. And what's interesting that he puts in his own biography is the fact that he says, ``Leading the efforts to establish a higher level of civility, decorum, and bipartisanship in the House of Representatives.'' 
   I don't know how you can pay a higher tribute to somebody than that. Recognizes that he had the--call it the honor, whatever it is, of being the person to hold on to the gavel during the impeachment hearings or impeachment proceedings taking place in this body of President Clinton. And the reason he was chosen is because of somebody who loves this institution, understands the meaning of order, and wanted to bring the highest level of civility to a place that has been torn up by things other than civility, especially during that period of time involving the impeachment. 
   And JERRY WELLER. Yes, JERRY. What an interesting person he has always been. What a great American. What an interesting start to politics. When he ran for the general assembly and then he lost, but he thought that he had won in a very interesting election that was taken away from him just before he was sworn in to be a member of the general assembly. 
   But JERRY came back with a great class, and every married couple in this country has JERRY WELLER to thank for the fact that he's the one who's the leading champion of the 2001 marriage tax penalty. Every couple in the country has him to thank for saving at least $1,700 on their joint tax return. 
   Always an interesting individual. I was in Chicago with him one time attending a hearing, and we went to a restaurant on the north side. I lived way out in the country, and actually JERRY's background is a hog farmer. And we went to this restaurant, presumed that nobody knew who we were, and somebody came over and said, ``Aren't you Congressman JERRY WELLER?'' And I turned to him and I said, ``I bet you paid that person to say that, to come over here and recognize you in Chicago way out of your territory.'' 
   But I have known him as a confidante, as a friend. I had the opportunity when I chaired the Small Business Committee to travel with him around his district. And a small town mayor came up to me and said, ``You know, Congressman, I have been mayor  here for a long time, but when JERRY got elected, he called me. And no one has ever called me and taken an interest in the small town that I represent. And it wasn't for the purpose of trying to get projects, because we know that those are very difficult when you have a lot of cities. But JERRY WELLER cares about the little people in this country so much so that he contacted all of the small town mayors and all the mayors just to say that he's our new Congressman and he's there to help us.'' 
   I can't find a better tribute to an individual who does stuff like that, anybody who takes the time to travel the area and get to know the people. 
   I also noticed that when I was with him, people would call me ``Congressman Manzullo'' but they would call him ``JERRY.'' I said, You know what? What a title of honor to feel comfortable enough around this man, and even with the dignified title of ``Congressman,'' they called him ``JERRY.'' And why? Because JERRY has always been JERRY. Just your average young man working on a hog farm with a desirous heart to serve America elected to the United States House of Representatives. 
   And JERRY, we're going to miss you. We're going to miss your humor, your unfunny jokes. We laughed at them just to be polite. 
   And, RAY, we're going to miss you also because of the dignity that you always would bring to the House of Representatives. You had the heaviest mallet in the House. When you hit that mallet, people would sort of stand to attention.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, America faces an energy crisis that threatens the livelihood of the people we represent. Every day they get up to go to work, many people wonder whether or not they can afford the gas for their tanks. And to compound it, the high cost of energy is destroying manufacturing jobs in our country. My largest city is at 11 percent unemployment. Many manufacturing facilities have been hit because of the high cost of energy; they simply cannot compete. 
   Today, we debate an energy bill that further compounds the problem. Last night, the Democrats filed a bill that gives the illusion of opening up our coast to drilling, but really continues to keep those areas closed, with no opportunity to debate it. 
   Last May, I authored a 12-point gas relief plan that incorporates more domestic production of oil, conservation, and new fuel and vehicle technologies. Until these technologies come online, we have to increase our supply of oil to give us the relief that we need, to give us the time that we need. 
   We have enough oil now in order to fuel 60 million cars for 60 years. Does that mean that we use it all up? Of course we don't. We simply need this as an opportunity for breathing time until we can develop these new technologies. 
   The time had come to put partisanship aside and solve this issue on behalf of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Chairman, this is a very immodest request that's part of an overall strategy to revitalize an economically depressed area of downtown Rockford. 
   The City of Rockford led the Nation in unemployment in 1980 at 25 percent. We lost 14,000 highly skilled manufacturing jobs at many of our over 1,500 factories in the area. 
   What this money does, it sets up a paleontology lab, which is an extension of Northern Illinois University, into the Burpee Museum of Natural History itself. This is astonishing because what it is doing, it's moving many of the assets of this great university to a city 30 miles away, and the reason that that lab has been created in Rockford is because of the incredible finds that were made by the university in terms of the paleontologist digs several years ago in Montana with regard to dinosaur projects. 
   There are currently eight Northern Illinois University faculty and 13 graduate and undergraduate students working on various cutting-edge physical science projects at the Burpee Museum. Thus, the request is ready to be used to support these research projects by Northern Illinois University students and staff utilizing the laboratories at Burpee Museum in Rockford. 
   With this assistance, Burpee Museum is becoming one of the foremost places in the world to study and view paleontology. What we lost with our manufacturing base we're trying to compensate for in an educational center and people coming to town in order to tour this great center. In fact, tourism is up by 7 percent as a result of the paleontology digs by the museum. 
   Besides that, the Institute of Museum and Library Services would receive this money, but there is no way to get it through the regular budget. The rules and regulations simply do not allow this type of project to be funded by it. 
   The Burpee Museum is a center for study. Students are coming from around the world. In fact, recently Burpee and Northern Illinois University co-hosted a scientific symposium. Almost 200 scientists from around the country and from China, Norway and Canada attended this important scientific meeting in Rockford. 
   I spend, probably, 75 percent of my time working on manufacturing issues. I was born and raised in Rockford. This was a city that refused to die. This was a city that refused to give up. This is a city whose citizens came together and said we have lost so many manufacturing jobs, but we're going to find another way to keep our kids in town to allow them to have jobs there so parents can see their grandkids, and unlike many Midwest towns that gave up, kids just leave the area because of no opportunities. What we're doing here is the creation of this wonderful laboratory to study paleontology to help put Rockford back on the map again. 
   I believe that this is extremely fair. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Because the Flake amendment does not save money. It just puts more money back into the hands of the bureaucrats to spend wherever they should.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H. Res. 500, which condemns the establishment of a natural gas cartel. On April 9 of 2007, several gas-exporting countries agreed to form a natural gas cartel similar to OPEC. The cartel would be initially composed of countries that have nearly 70 percent of the world's reserves. Those countries include Russia and Iran. 
   Though the U.S. currently is largely self-sufficient in natural gas, we are projected to greatly increase usage over time. That could result in a growing dependence on world supply. 
   At that point, minor disruptions can lead to rapid price increases that could have grave consequences for the United States' manufacturing base. This could be particularly disastrous for the chemical and plastics industry and advanced composite manufacturers because they use natural gas as their feedstock. Soaring prices today in this country have already challenged their competitiveness. Unfortunately, in 2004 alone, increases in natural gas prices forced the closure of scores of chemical companies and cost roughly 100,000 well-paying jobs. 
   If the United States loses our advantage in chemical manufacturing companies, that will be the demise of manufacturing as a whole. Because without chemicals, you cannot have a strong manufacturing base. With the chemical industry on a particular siege by the high cost of natural gas now, one can only imagine what would happen if an OPEC-type group got together and decided to gouge America and increase greatly the cost of natural gas. 
   Natural gas materials are used broadly for defense products. Disruptions in the supply are detrimental to America's defense industrial base and therefore our ability to defend ourselves. We must not stand by and let yet another global extortion group, such as OPEC, take over and command the world's supply of natural gas. 
   The purpose of this resolution is to send a strong message to the people involved in these international conspiracies to back off, that the United States will do whatever is necessary to make sure that the people who control the world's supply of natural gas do no harm to this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, it's a privilege and honor for me to be closely associated again with the effort to reauthorize the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Along with now Senator BOB MENENDEZ, former OPIC President George Munoz, and me--the 3Ms--we were able to rescue OPIC from oblivion with a resounding vote of confidence of 357 to 71 to reauthorize OPIC in 1999. OPIC represents the best of both worlds--the agency doesn't cost the U.S. taxpayer any money and it creates jobs and aids in economic development both here and abroad as evidenced by the Congressional findings section in this bill. 
   I also want to commend Mr. SHERMAN for working with the minority in a bipartisan way in order to produce a bill that can receive overwhelming support. The bill before us today wouldn't be the one I would have written from scratch. However, I am pleased that as the bill has moved through the legislation process, the majority has been sensitive to the concern as to the practical effects of certain provisions in order to insure that OPIC can remain open for business in various markets. I also appreciate the willingness of the majority to continue to keep the lines of communication open. 
   I also want to commend Mr. Syman for including my suggestion in Section 17 to make sure that OPIC will always continue to have sufficient staff and resources to support small businesses. I also want to thank the majority for their willingness to add in report language a statement that the climate change initiative in Section 8 should not take away from other environmental remediation efforts by OPIC. 
   However, I would be remiss in my duties if I didn't raise a couple of concerns that I hope will get addressed through the rest of the legislative process. First, I believe that the language dealing with enhanced worker rights in Section 5 will have the counterproductive effect of taking OPIC out of some of the most challenging markets in the world where we have a significant foreign policy interest to see success such as Afghanistan. In my opinion, it would be much better to strengthen OPIC's oversight workforce to make sure that companies live up to the agreements they sign rather than remove OPIC totally from nations that are not making ``significant progress'' towards worker rights. You can't positively influence a nation in this sensitive area of internal domestic policy if you disengage from the country. A good example is better than speaking a thousands words. 
   Second, as evidenced by the difficulty to clarify the direction and intent of the language in Section 10, it's hard to narrowly target unilateral sanctions without it either harming other U.S. national interests or the people we are supposedly trying to help. This section could cause big problems down the line, particularly as more and more deals at OPIC are also co-financed or co-insured with foreign investment insurance agencies. This will only lead to the designing out American goods and services from a particular deal and will not produce the desired results. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the majority for their willingness to work together on this bill and I look forward to supporting final passage and eventually seeing an OPIC reauthorization bill signed into law by the President.

   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, title II of the Democrats' energy dependence bill seeks to reduce global climate change by spending $1.2 billion to increase Washington bureaucracy. 
   Instead of debating whether or not global warming exists and, if so, to what extent, we should all unite behind an effort to combat all forms of global pollution and promote the sale of U.S. environmental exports. Then we can spend more time and effort on cleaning up the environment rather than engaging in partisan disputes. 
   Nevertheless, as the senior Republican on the Global Environment Subcommittee, I believe this title is fatally flawed for three main reasons: 
   First, it combats air pollution, even though numerous reports and study show that conflict over access to clean water and contaminated food is just as important, if not more important, an immediate threat to the national and economic security. Therefore, we should expand the scope of it.

I would like to thank the author of this resolution, Congressman Hastings, as well as Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, Congressman Wexler, and Congressman Kirk, who have fought for opening access to the Holocaust archives in Bad Arolsen, Germany. 
   The archives there have been the largest closed Holocaust-era collection of documents in the world, containing millions of records about the fates of over 17 million victims of Nazi Germany. The archive became open to the public in November of last year after 11 countries of its governing body ratified the agreement that allowed the collection to become open and for those documents to be transferred to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem in Israel. 
   Open access to these records will provide many Holocaust survivors and their families with the information about their loved ones. Additionally, it will present researchers and scholars with materials necessary to enhance the public knowledge about the Holocaust. 
   Now that the archive is open and the U.S. Holocaust Museum is able to answer requests, it is very important that the survivors and their family members are aware of these services and are able to immediately submit requests for information about their loved ones.

Greece is the birthplace of Western Civilization and modern democracy, and it is from Greece that our Founding Fathers drew so many important principles of government, law, and freedom. Today, our two nations continue to share the values that we hold dear: liberty, freedom, and democracy. 
   Greece and the United States have also stood together resolutely throughout difficult times during the last century, particularly during the Second World War. Greece, in fact, is one of the few nations that has supported America in every major conflict over the past century. 
   After the end of World War II, Greece joined in a formal alliance with the United States, through NATO, and went on to broaden its commitment to  democracy, freedom, and human rights through its notable contributions to international peacekeeping and stability missions. 
   Today, as America faces a complex array of threats posed by extremism around the world, Greece indeed remains a valuable strategic partner. Most notably, Greece provided access to its airspace for American military aircraft en route to Iraq and allowed our U.S. Navy ships to refuel in its ports. 
   Through its substantial economic investment and aid to the Balkans, Greece has also sought to play an important role as an agent of stability in that important region, supplementing the efforts by the United States and the European Union to end the conflicts in that region. Recent efforts on the part of the Government of Greece to deal constructively with its neighbor Turkey on outstanding issues where they have differences show hope for ensuring future stability throughout the Aegean Sea region, an outcome the United States seeks as well. 
   Madam Speaker, this resolution notes that this year marks the 187th anniversary of the beginning of the revolution that led to the independence of Greece. There are approximately 1.3 million Americans of Greek descent living in the United States. A large number of Greek Americans live in northern Illinois, particularly the Chicago area. Greek Americans contribute significantly as community leaders, entrepreneurs, and mentors for young children. The Greek Orthodox Church in the United States and important Greek community organizations are positive forces and should be recognized also. 
   So I welcome the opportunity afforded by our consideration of this resolution to point out the friendship and shared interests of our two countries. I congratulate the country and people of Greece for the progress they have made over the past 187 years, and I urge the adoption of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I am really just distressed over the manner in which this bill has come to the floor. When the Republicans were in the majority, any bill that was in excess of $100 million had to go through the regular process, was subject to amendments on the floor, et cetera; and now we are bringing on the Suspension Calendar, which is for naming post offices and minor things like that, a bill that would spend $6.2 billion over the next 5 years. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, the estimated current outlay in fiscal year 2008 for existing Federal community service and volunteer programs is already $607 million a year. Spending under this bill would go up $884 million in fiscal year 2008, $942 million in 2009, $1.058 billion in fiscal year 2010, $1.154 billion in fiscal year 2011, and $1.235 billion in fiscal year 2012 for a total new spending for volunteers of $4.1 billion over 5 years. 
   That's outrageous to pay for volunteer programs to have the bill not subject to any amendment on the floor such as an amendment to pare down the size of the spending. 
   And I think in a time when we have a fiscal crisis on our hands, where the stock market is tanking and people are losing their homes and people are not sure of having a job, for this Congress to come in and use this extraordinary procedure to waive all the rules, including a way to amend the bill and spend an additional $4.1 billion over 5 years, that really cracks the back of fiscal responsibility.     
   The majority has shown unequivocally here that it is not the party of fiscal responsibility, and I would therefore encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (COMMEMORATING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to recognize the 175th anniversary of the strong and enduring relationship between the people of the United States and the people of Thailand. The United States has no older ally in the Asia-Pacific region than the Kingdom of Thailand. 
   It was in the early days of our Republic, during the administration of Andrew Jackson, that the Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed with King Rama III. Thailand has been a staunch friend of the United States ever since. 
   Remarkably, during the dark days of our Civil War, the King of Thailand offered to send President Lincoln a herd of elephants to help lead the Union to victory. While Lincoln did not take up the offer, the gesture was greatly appreciated. 
   More recently, Thailand provided support for our military forces during the Vietnam War. It has also served for more than a quarter century as the host for our Pacific Command's annual multinational military training exercise known as ``Cobra Gold.'' 
   Our two nations have worked closely together on humanitarian issues as well. Thailand was of great assistance as the host nation for many of the refugees who came out of Indochina after the war there. More recently, Thailand has provided a safe haven for Burmese and North Korean refugees. Thailand also came together with the United States in launching joint relief operations following the tragic tsunami which caused its devastation in 2004. 
   Thailand is America's 20th largest trading partner. A half million Americans are of Thai descent, including the remarkable Tiger Woods. These are indeed the ties that bind. 
   It is my strong hope that the Government of Thailand with build on last year's successful parliamentary elections by ensuring that all parties in Thailand are brought into the political process. 
   Thailand's rebirth of diplomacy is something which all Americans welcome. I therefore urge my colleagues to support this resolution which recognizes our oldest and one of our most loyal Asian allies. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2272, AMERICA COMPETES ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker I reluctantly rise today in opposition to the America COMPETES Act of 2007, H.R. 2272. I am a firm supporter of education and innovation in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math. Unfortunately, I cannot endorse a bill that creates 40 new programs and spends tens of billions of dollars. 
   I devote a great amount of my time working on manufacturing issues. The congressional district I represent has over 2,500 industries. Manufacturing has several components, one of which is getting workers with adequate skills to be machinists, plus having an adequate supply of engineers and others involved in that aspect of manufacturing. At present I am involved in trying to solve workforce problems, which in turn, in many cases, depend upon people who have a good understanding of science, tech, engineering and math. I am a member of the Council on Competitiveness, a co-chair of the Manufacturing Caucus, and Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee Task Force on Manufacturing. As previous Chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, I held countless hearings on competitiveness. I travel this country and overseas studying machine tools, manufacturing efficiencies, global supply chains, manufacturing financing, IP protection, export controls, etc. I've also lectured extensively on America's need to be globally competitive. 
   In a good faith effort by both parties to make America more competitive, I believe we may be sliding a slope very few realize even exists. For example, this bill forgives student loans for individuals who teach math and science. While this is a noble idea, this sets the precedent for other vocations to receive loan forgiveness. When will we draw the line? Will we forgive loans for firefighters, policemen, federal government employees, doctors, and lawyers? Who decides which profession deserves preferential treatment? Extending the years of loan payment or perhaps reducing interest rates on critical professions in underserved areas may be a consideration, but loan forgiveness can put us on the road to ``free'' federal education for everybody. The price tag is unimaginable. 
   Furthermore, today's bill is a composite of five different bills which have already passed the House. Attaching these bills together is not prudent legislation because it forces a Member of Congress to vote for or against the entire package even though he may have been in favor of a more modest approach. For example, I voted in favor of the authorizations for the National Science Foundation (H.R. 1867) and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (H.R. 1868)--two agencies whose missions are vital to America's competitiveness. In addition, a third bill, H.R. 1068, updating research goals of the National High-Performance Computing Program, is also worthy  and actually passed on a voice vote. However, these three bills were combined with: H.R. 362, 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act and H.R. 363, Sowing the Seeds through Science and Engineering Research Act. These two latter bills forced me to reluctantly vote against the whole package--especially since this combined bill contains $20.3 billion more than the five original bills and creates forty new science, tech, engineering and math (STEM) programs. I find this to be particularly wasteful when considering the fact that scores of current programs have not been found to be effective as evidenced in three separate studies by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the US Department of Education (DOE), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
   The GAO in October, 2005, issued a report stating that in fiscal year 2004 there were over 207 different science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs spending approximately $2.8 billion annually spread throughout 13 agencies. Only half of the programs have been internally evaluated, with the reporting agencies stating the programs were effective and met established goals of attracting more students to study STEM courses, but, GAO added, ``some programs that have not been evaluated have operated for many years.'' These agencies made suggestions to GAO, but GAO concluded that before adopting any suggestions ``it is important to know the extent to which existing STEM education programs are appropriately targeted'' so as to make the best use of available federal resources. The purpose of GAO is to determine whether taxpayers' money is being spent wisely. GAO's language indicates there is no basis to make that conclusion because too many programs simply have never been evaluated for efficiency. 
   The second study--a Report of the Academic Competitiveness Council conducted by the U.S. Department of Education in May of 2007--showed 115 evaluations were submitted for 105 STEM programs and only ten evaluations were found to be ``scientifically rigorous.'' The report went on to say that, ``[b]ased on the 115 evaluations, the ACC's review that despite decades of significant federal investment in science and math education, there is a general dearth of evidence of effective practices and activities in STEM education (emphasis original).'' 
   The third study was conducted by the OMB through a Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) Analysis of 88 programs within the Department of Education and only four were proven to be effective. Among those programs whose results were not demonstrated was the Department of Education Mathematics and Science Partnership program. This program provides grants to state and local education agencies to improve student's academic achievement in math and sciences. The program was not found to be well managed, and it did not establish performance measures. 
   On the basis of the information provided by GAO, DOE, and OMB, I am surprised that we are considering the creation of 40 additional STEM programs. We should be evaluating and consolidating all existing STEM programs, and save money at the same time. Instead, the House of Representatives is adding more programs and spending tens of billions more. 
   While I continue to remain a firm supporter of U.S. industry and competitiveness, I believe that there are better ways to accomplish this than spending billions of dollars on new and unproven programs while hundreds of programs continue with little or no accountability. That is why I encourage my colleagues to vote for the Motion to Recommit, which still spends too much money, but as opposed to the combined bill reduces the overall spending of the combined bill by $20.3 billion.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, temporary tax relief should not be offset with permanent tax increases that will stifle foreign direct investment into this country. 
   The Alternative Minimum Tax is a mistaken tax policy. Originally designed to tax the super-rich, it now covers many in the middle class, particularly those with large families, because of inflation. Without relief, 19 million Americans will see a tax increase of $2,000 next year. 
   However, to temporarily correct this error by permanently raising nearly $7 billion from foreigners who invest in the United States simply makes a bad situation worse. We are finally attracting more foreign investment into the United States. In 2007, foreign direct investment rose to its highest levels in seven years, reaching over $204 billion. 
   U.S. subsidiaries of companies headquartered abroad now employ 5.3 million Americans, of which 30 percent work in the manufacturing sector. Nineteen percent of all U.S. exports came from these firms and they reinvested nearly $71 billion back into their U.S. operations. 
   In Illinois, U.S. subsidiaries of companies headquartered abroad employed over 226,000 workers, of which over 61,000 were in the manufacturing sector. In fact, there are over 30 U.S. subsidiaries of companies headquartered abroad that employ over 6,000 workers in the northern Illinois district that I am proud to represent. 
   The offset used to ``pay for'' part of this AMT bill will strongly discourage future foreign investment in the United States and will halt any future progress on negotiating tax treaties with other countries. 
   For example, Nissan USA, which is owned by Nissan headquartered in Japan, borrows money from their finance unit based in the Netherlands. Under our current tax treaty with the Netherlands, no tax is applied. However, under this bill a new 10 percent tax would be applied to this transaction. The Netherlands will then most likely view this as an abrogation of our tax treaty and will either seek renegotiation or outright annulment, thus hurting our overall trade with the Netherlands. 
   This is all a silly exercise. We all know how this will turn out because the Senate will not agree to these offsets. However, this bill sends a chilling message to our friends overseas that they will be subject to a higher tax next year because this is the second time that the Democratic Party has proposed this offset. Vote no on H.R. 6275 to preserve jobs in your district and to send a signal that the U.S. remains open to foreign direct investment.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 3, a bill that compels taxpayers to support the destruction of early human life. 
   This legislation, which calls for taxpayer funding of embryonic stem cell research, is unnecessary. 
   First, it is already legal to conduct research on human embryos with private or State funds. It is also legal to conduct research on embryonic stem cell lines that come from human embryos already destroyed prior to August 9 of 2001. Thus, the debate today is not aimed at stopping embryonic stem cell research; it is aimed at prohibiting the Federal funding of it because it is so controversial. 
   Second, plenty of more successful alternatives of non-embryonic stem cell research already exist and are treating  patients every day. Despite a quarter-century's research in mouse embryonic stem cells and 7 years in human variety, embryonic stem cells have yet to yield any successful clinical trials in humans. Adult stem cells, however, have treated patients suffering from 72 different diseases in published clinical applications. Researchers have also achieved similar results with stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, treating more than 70 different types of diseases. 
   And just last week, Wake Forest and Harvard University announced breakthrough technology in amniotic fluids. 
   In May of 2006, a poll conducted by the International Communications Research showed 48 percent of Americans oppose Federal funding of stem cell research that requires the destruction of human embryos, and only 39 percent support such funding. 
   I believe the most effective way to counter disease in the long run is to support research that will prevent the occurrence of the disease. That is why I strongly supported efforts in 1998 to double the funding for the National Institutes of Health, which we accomplished over a 5-year period of time. We should continue to prioritize that research and continue to work on the stem cell research that does not involve the taking of the human life.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND MANUFACTURING STIMULATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Chair, I will not use the 5 minutes, and submit my full remarks in the Record. 
   This amendment is very simple. It authorizes $2 million for NIST to develop a software package so that manufacturers have basic information about all the Federal programs available to assist them, particularly in the area of research and development. It will provide a link so that manufacturers would know the latest status of all Federal R&D projects relating to manufacturing. 
   I first realized the need for this software after speaking at a speaking engagement in Nashville, Tennessee. I was walking on the showroom floor and found a major manufacturer from Kansas City with a display that was very familiar to me. The display had a miniature spur gear mounted near the nose of Lincoln on a Lincoln penny. The EIGERlab in Rockford, Illinois has this exact same way of displaying their miniature spur gear. I asked the employees of the major manufacturer if they had heard of the micro machining work done at the EIGERlab. The Kansas City manufacturer had done its work by using an EDM. The EIGERlab had done its work using a milling process. Neither of these parties had known of each other. It dawned on me that I was the only person that knew these two places were making the exact same product, although by different methods, and both were being funded by the Defense Department. 
   The story illustrates the need for software that allows users to monitor and track where and to whom research money has been granted relating to manufacturing and the status and purpose of the research. My vision for the system would be that the final product would be easily accessible on NIST's Web site. NIST would also be authorized by my amendment to charge a nominal fee for the use of the service, if they so choose, to establish and maintain the Web site. If a fee is imposed, I would encourage that the fee be as small as possible to reflect the actual cost. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  
   Madam Chairman, I am proud to represent a district that has a county with the second highest concentration of manufacturing as a percentage its share of the local economy in the entire Nation. Only one other county in America with a population of 250,000 or less has more manufacturing than the county that surrounds the second largest city in Illinois--Rockford. I have made it my life mission to get to know all about manufacturing. I have visited literally hundreds of factories and small shops all around the world to enhance my education about this vital sector of our economy. 
   I crafted this amendment because I have been frustrated during my time in Congress that no one has a complete picture of who is doing what in the Federal government concerning manufacturing. No one has a complete list of the federal programs available to help manufacturers, not even the Manufacturing Czar at Commerce. Right now, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) is finalizing a report at my request to document all of the programs that deal with manufacturing. Thus far, they have informed me that there are over 280 programs spread throughout the Federal agencies that focus in some aspect on manufacturing. 
   This problem is compounded further by a lack of transparency among Federal agencies in terms of funding that is approved for certain projects. Plus, manufacturers who would like to avail themselves of various Federal programs do not know where to turn for answers. You would think that somewhere a matrix exists that details what firms are receiving Federal R&D money and how it is being used, but I can tell you that it does not. Let me share with you one clear example. 
   After a speaking engagement in Tennessee, I was walking the showroom floor and found a major manufacturer out of Kansas City, Missouri with a display that was very familiar to me. The display had a miniature spur gear mounted near the nose of Lincoln on a penny. The penny was enclosed in a plastic box with a magnified top so that you can see the gear. The EIGERlab in Rockford, Illinois has this exact same way of displaying their miniature spur gear. I asked the employees of this major 
   manufacturer if they had heard of the EIGERlab and the work they are doing on micromachining. They had not. It dawned on me that I was the only person that knew these two places were making the exact same product and both were being funded by the Defense Department. 
   This story illustrates well the need for software that allows users to monitor and track where and to whom research money has been granted related to manufacturing, and the status and purpose of the research. This software would allow users to input the material type or process being used and it would scan for all federal dollars being put towards the searched criteria. The purpose of this amendment is to cut down on the possible duplication of research going on even within the same agency. 
   My amendment would authorize a $2 million dollar set aside for software to develop this system so that manufacturers would have basic information about all the federal programs available to assist them and also to provide a link so that they would be able to know the latest status on all of the federal R&D projects related to manufacturing. NIST could either develop this software system themselves or contract it out to someone else. My vision for this system would be that the final product would be easily accessible on NIST's web site. NIST would also be authorized by my amendment to charge a nominal fee for the use of this service if they so choose to help establish and maintain the web site just as the Department of Commerce does with other services such as in-depth market research for exporters. The fee could be a yearly subscription for frequent users or a per visit charge. If a fee is imposed, I would encourage that the fee be as small as possible to reflect actual cost. 
   This is a very important amendment and I urge my colleagues to support it. If this interactive software can be established, this will be a huge accomplishment, particularly for small manufacturers.  
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (PATENT REFORM ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 1908. Mr. Michaud and I just came from the Rules Committee a few minutes ago, which is in the process of preparing the rule under which the bill would be brought to the floor tomorrow. And we showed up at the hearing, which was set for 3:00, found out that an 18-page manager's amendment had been filed at 2:47, and during the course of our testimony before the Rules Committee, another manager's amendment consisting of 18 pages was filed at 3:50 p.m. So the Rules Committee was taking a look at still further amendments to a bill, not even knowing what the final form of the bill would be at the time we were there to testify either in favor of it or against it. 
   Anytime you have a bill that presents a fundamental change in law, it should be a consensus bill; and there's a reason for that. 
   Why hurt anybody on something so basic and so important as a patent bill? 
   Why can't you protect the holders of patents, both large and small, the universities that have a stake in it, the labor unions whose people are employed by manufacturers who hold patents? Everybody really has the same stake here, and the stake is to have the United States be pre-eminent in research and engineering and to use the patent system as a means to further research and development and manufacturing in this country. 
   But this bill that's being presented has a very interesting split of people in favor and people against, and that's what's disconcerting about the entire bill. 
   In fact, the last patent bill that was passed and signed into law never even made its way to the Senate. We passed it here in the House, and it was tacked on to an omnibus appropriations bill. The Senate never even read it or considered it. It got tucked into a massive multi-, hundred-page bill. It's a good thing that we had come up with a good bill by the time it passed here. 
   And now we are hearing proponents of this bill say, just a second, we didn't use the subcommittee process to refine it, and we didn't use the committee process to refine it. This is a work in action that we continue to work on it as we go. And that's how we end up with bad law, when Members of Congress do not really have the opportunity to examine and to know what they're voting on. 
   And I don't know anything as complicated as patent law. I've been here several terms; so has Mr. Rohrabacher. I look at patent laws through the eyes of a piece of machinery. I've spent my life in Congress involved in manufacturing. I have one of the most industrialized congressional districts in the country. One out of four people is directly employed in manufacturing. 
   And I spend time on the floors, I've visited hundreds of factories in the United States, Europe, China, given speeches all over. I go to forums that deal with manufacturing processes and try to keep up on the latest in manufacturing so I can share those, not only with my constituents, but with my colleagues who are in Congress, on a bipartisan basis. In fact, we formed the Manufacturing Caucus for the purpose of making sure that the latest in manufacturing techniques is shared with Members so as to strengthen our manufacturing base to make us more competitive in this world. 
   But this bill's opposed by the National Association of Manufacturers. Those are large and small manufacturers, the little guys and the big guys. And the reason they're concerned is that the manufacturers are the ones that make things, make things with their hands. They make the exotic machines, and they're very much concerned about international piracy already going on and the fact that this will actually, this bill will actually lend itself to that. 
   And I met this morning with people from the pharmaceutical industry, the biotech industry, the food industry, people concerned that processes involved in food preparations would be protected. And it was the most incredible group of people that I've ever seen come together on an issue in opposition. 
   And one of the reasons that they're so opposed, and I'm just going to speak on one of those, it's on the damage issue, because there are so many other issues that are extremely important. 
   We just found out that the administration now opposes H.R. 1908 because, again, it limits the courts' discretion in determining the damages for infringement. Now, that's the damage issue. And I'm glad they came out with that, and that's important. And let's explain why. 
   H.R. 1908 will reduce the value of U.S. patents because patent holders will no longer be able to receive the fair market value of their patent when infringed upon. It mandates this apportionment of damages be the pre-eminent factor and exclusion of all the other market factors considered in infringement cases. 
   Current law, the law that's used today, states that juries should consider 15 factors, many of which are based on market forces and competitive pricing which allow the patent holder to receive the market value of the invention that was infringed upon. And that's always been the standard of damages. What is the value? 
   They'll take a look at its incorporation into the device. What value does it add to it? What price would the holder of the completed product have paid for this? 
   It has been established over a period of years of long series of judicial decisions, and it's not the legislature abandoning our role in this issue, but it's allowing the courts' working their way through technology changes to say these are the factors that we should take a look at. 
   The change of law requires a judge to determine the economic value of the invention by subtracting the value of prior art. That means subtracting the value of other existing components in the invention. And this complex economic analysis is not something we want to leave the district court judges. Even Judge Michael, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, agrees. 
   But what's dangerous about this provision is that the bill allows a new set of damages, a new standard when it's never been tested. It's nothing more than a theory.

   Mr. MANZULLO. But I would like to just bring up one thing. The proponents of the bill are saying this is tort reform. And how could this be tort reform when the National Association of Manufacturers are on the other side, oppose it? It is not really tort reform. It is an all-out assault upon awarding reasonable damages to the inventor. That is done in two ways. One is through extreme limitation of damages, and the second is finding a way to lengthen the process of litigation. 
   Now, another portion of this bill says, well, you shouldn't be able to shop for venue. And in America it has always been the tradition that you can bring a suit in any area, any county, any State where damage has occurred, and with a widely distributed product, you should be able to bring a lawsuit really wherever you want. And now, of course, the proposed reform says, well, you can't bring it in certain areas unless you have a certain nexus. 
   Here's the problem: If you bring this in Chicago, the little guy, it's 5 years. If you bring it in Washington, D.C.'s ``rocket docket,'' it's called, you get it there in 1 year. Well, who is to gain by taking litigation and lengthening the time of it? It's the big guys versus the small guys. And if there had been a problem in these rocket dockets, and there are three or four across the country where you can move something fast, but if there had been a problem such as in Madison County, Illinois, which has been known for abuse of class action lawsuits, we would know it. But the judges in these rocket dockets willingly take the case because they have become experts on patent law. People trust their judgment, and they have come down in favor of the inventor as many times as they have come down opposed to the inventor. 
   Thank you for your leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (AWARDING CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this very important effort to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Aung San Suu Kyi. She is one of the most honorable advocates for democracy and human rights the world will ever know. Ms. Suu Kyi is the world's only Nobel Peace Prize winner to remain a political prisoner. Ironically, the daughter  of Burma's revolutionary hero is herself a captive in the very country that her father freed from colonial rule. 
   I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague and good friend from New York (Mr. Crowley) for being a leader on such an important matter. His drive and commitment to awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Ms. Suu Kyi is not only impressive, but it is a true testament to his character. I am honored that he reached out to me to help drive this measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, Burma's military junta has held Aung San Suu Kyi captive for most of the 18 years she has spent inside that country. In fact, she was placed under house arrest in 1989, after she formed the National League for Democracy. And even after that party won the decisive election in 1990, with Ms. Suu Kyi elected as Prime Minister, the junta continues to not recognize the election results and the fact that the people have spoken. Except for brief occasions, Ms. Suu Kyi has remained a prisoner. She even was not allowed to attend her husband's funeral and remains separated from her children. 
   In September of this year, the Burmese people held the largest peaceful protests that country has seen in the past 20 years. They protested the poor economic decisions of the junta as well as the continued denial of democratic and human rights of the Burmese people. An estimated 100,000 people marched through Rangoon, peacefully demanding the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. The world watched and hoped that this time the Saffron Revolution would lead to meaningful change. But, rather than listening to its people, the regime of Than Shwe turned its guns against the people, as they did in 1988. The U.N. Special Envoy for Human Rights reported recently that at least 31 people were killed in September and over 1,000 people remain incarcerated. 
   Last week, we gathered here in this House to pass a bill sponsored by two champions of freedom, my good friends Mr. Lantos, chairman, and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The Block Burmese JADE Act of 2007 can be an important tool to add even more pressure to the regime to change its ways, particularly if our government encourages more countries to adopt similar economic sanctions. I note that the European Union is following a similar approach in response to the killings. Even Burma's immediate neighbors have issued strong statements condemning the massacre. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are outraged and disgusted by the severe use of force on the protestors and the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi. Shortly after the protest, the Subcommittee on Asia, Pacific, and Global Environment, on which I serve as ranking Republican member, with Congressman ENI FALEOMAVAEGA as chairman, held a hearing on the situation in Burma. We heard dramatic testimony from experts within the administration and from nongovernmental organizations. All the witnesses agree that Burma's fall from a prosperous country to pariah state was a direct consequence of the dictatorship. 
   So that is why we are here today, to state for the record that it is time the military junta recognize the will of the Burmese people, and of most countries of the world, and open the door for true reconciliation. By awarding Ms. Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal, we Americans send a strong message that totalitarianism in Burma needs to come to an end. 
   I urge all Members to support H.R. 4286 so that we can voice our full support for Burma's first daughter and for all the people of Burma. This will remind the military junta of the American people's unwavering support for Aung San Suu Kyi. We need to pass the bill so there can be no mistaking our support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the Small Business Contracting Program Improvements Act (H.R. 3867). The aims of this legislation are noble. The purpose of this bill is to make a variety of changes--some long overdue--to several of the sub-small business federal contracting goals. 
   I commend the authors of H.R. 3867 for strengthening the procurement set-aside program for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses in Title I. I also praise the effort to finally get the women's procurement program off the ground. During my tenure as chairman of the Small Business Committee, I was proud of my bipartisan work to pressure the SBA to implement this initiative. However, I remind my colleagues that under the new leadership of the administrator of the Small Business Administration, SBA, Steven Preston, more action has been taken in the past year to implement the women's procurement program than in the previous seven since the program was first created. The SBA is near completion of a final rule, which will pass constitutional muster, on the women's procurement program. Thus, I counsel continued patience and I hope that Title III in H.R. 3867 will not be needed. 
   However, I am disappointed that the increase in the size in contracts available to small manufacturers awarded without competition is not significantly increased. While Section 204 of H.R. 3867 provides a long-overdue inflationary increase to the contract limitation level for other small businesses, from $3 million to $5.1 million, the size for small manufacturers is increased by just $500,000--from $5 million to $5.5 million. This small increase diminishes the value of this benefit to U.S. small manufacturers, particularly as compared to other small businesses. To keep up with inflation and provide an equivalent benefit, this contract limitation should be increased to $8.5 million for small manufacturers. 
   This bill also unfortunately pits two sets of small businesses against each other--a minority small business development program 8(a) versus a procurement preference program that encourages small businesses to develop and hire local workers in economically-distressed areas of the country, otherwise known as Historically Underutilized Business, HUB, Zones. When I was chairman of the Small Business Committee, I never brought a bill to the House floor that helped one set of small businesses at the expense of another group of small businesses, particularly those  firms that are committed to redeveloping economically-distressed areas in both urban and rural America. 
   H.R. 3867 makes the 8(a) program more attractive while putting more hurdles in front of the HUBZone program. This is ironic because the Federal government has never met the 3 percent goal for HUBZones since its creation in 1996 but routinely meets and exceeds the 5 percent goal for minority or Small Disadvantaged Businesses, SDBs, of which 8(a) firms is a part. 
   A key blow to the HUBZone program is contained in Section 101(b) of H.R. 3867. This provision makes the HUBZone program discretionary or optional on the part of Federal contracting officers. This will only further discourage the use of HUBZone firms by the government to fulfill its procurement needs. 
   H.R. 3867 also requires an on-site inspection by SBA personnel of a small business to confirm HUBZone status prior to the award of their second program-related contract. Because of the limited resources at the SBA, this could delay the completion of contracts by weeks, if not months, while the HUBZone firm awaits this audit. Again, a Federal contracting official would be disinclined to use a HUBZone firm if it meant a longer time before a Federal agency would receive the good or service that was put out to bid. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates that this provision alone would cost $62 million over the next 5 years to complete 5,000 on-site visits that would be performed each year. There are other ways to accomplish the same goal of making sure that HUBZone firms are in compliance with all the requirements of the law, including a closer review by the SBA of HUBZone applications, an expedited protest process by other small businesses, and enhanced criminal and civil penalties for false or misleading statements. 
   Finally, H.R. 3867 prohibits HUBZone construction firms from participating in projects more than 150 miles from its headquarters location. This would put a severe competitive disadvantage to HUBZone firms located in rural areas from performing work on Federal Government construction contracts located far away. 
   In the northern Illinois congressional district I am proud to represent, two entire mostly rural counties--Carroll and Stephenson--are HUBZones. Also, HUBZones are located in certain urban parts of Winnebago County, mostly in the city center areas of Rockford along the Rock River that have suffered from the closure of numerous manufacturing facilities. This bill would put a further competitive disadvantage to any HUBZone firms located in the 16th District to compete for Federal business located even as close as the nearest major Federal procuring center in Illinois--Scott Air Force Base, which is about 300 miles away from Rockford and Freeport, Illinois. 
   While claiming to correct alleged abuses and fraud in the HUBZone program, H.R. 3867 opens up the 8(a) program to potential abuse by increasing the economic disadvantage threshold test above the average rate of inflation and applying this test only once upon entry into the program. The current economic disadvantage threshold level, which has not been changed since 1988, is $250,000. I agree that this level needs to be increased to compensate for inflation. However, H.R. 3867 raises this level to $550,000 even though the rate of inflation since 1988 would produce a result of $440,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Also, the SBA currently applies this wealth test annually to ensure that the 8(a) program truly serves economically disadvantaged small business owners. Eliminating this yearly test could potentially lead to fraud if a wealthy person seeking entry into the 8(a) program is creative in shifting around their assets. H.R. 3867 would also allow multi-millionaires to remain in the 8(a) program for 10 years once they pass the first economic disadvantage test. 
   Most critically, H.R. 3867 does not deal with the fundamental problem in the 8(a) program cited in numerous SBA Office of Inspector General reports that 50 percent of the dollars obligated against 8(a) contracts went to a mere 1.7 percent of the 8(a) firms and over 70 percent of the eligible firms received no 8(a) contract benefit at all. Finally, H.R. 3867 also does not deal with the problem of large Alaska Native Corporations, ANCs, being able to participate in the 8(a) program and receive sole-sourced multi-million dollar contracts. 
   Because of these and other problems, the Bush Administration has issued a statement strongly opposing H.R. 3867, which I include for the RECORD. Thus, I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation in order for these problems to be fixed.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee, specifically my good friend, Representative DUNCAN HUNTER of California, for including a provision in the Fiscal Year 2009 Defense Authorization bill that finally provides for consideration of our Nation's defense industrial base when contracting officials evaluate major Federal defense contract proposals. 
   Few people are aware that the Pentagon is prevented by law from including defense industrial base considerations when deciding to award a major defense contract. A contract award determination is made primarily by examining which party has the ``best value'' in terms of price, quality, quantity, and delivery. However, how many jobs a particular contract would produce or retain in America or how many suppliers would be able to stay in business in America because of a particular contract is currently not part of the ``best value'' evaluation by the Pentagon. Most believe that  the Buy American Act protects the interests of American workers. However, because of a series of Memorandums of Understanding, MOUs, signed years ago between the Pentagon and other foreign defense agencies, a product can be made completely in Europe and be considered as if made in America and thus compliant with the Buy American Act. In return, U.S. defense articles are supposed to be considered by European procurement officials on the same grounds as European products. However, Europe protected its economic interests in these agreements by including European defense industrial base protections as one criterion in their source selection process. This didn't used to be a problem in the past. However, with the consolidation of major prime defense contractors in the United States and the relatively recent creation of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, EADS, there has been more and more conflict in major U.S. defense procurements. 
   Section 805 of H.R. 5658 seeks to copy Europe's example. It simply allows the Pentagon to consider impacts on the U.S. industrial base during source selection for major defense acquisition programs. This section also authorizes defense acquisition officials to impose penalties on a contractor who misleads the Government regarding potential domestic industrial base impacts. 
   The bill also asks the Secretary of Defense to notify congressional defense committees at least 30 days before requesting a proposal for any major defense acquisition program that will not use a domestic industrial base evaluation factor during the source selection process. It also includes second and third level suppliers as part of the defense industrial base because the health of this sector of the economy cannot be measured solely by looking at the stock price of the large prime defense contractors. 
   As someone who voted for every free trade agreement since being elected to Congress in 1992, this section is not protectionism. Back in 1776, Adam Smith argued in his celebrated ``Wealth of Nations''; that ``(i)t is of importance that the kingdom should depend as little as possible upon its neighbors for the manufactures necessary for its defense.'' He supported a bounty--or a tax--on the export of British sailcloth and gunpowder to prevent other nations and potential enemies from benefiting from Great Britain's advantage in these products. If the founder of modern-day capitalism and free trade supported an exception to the free flow of trade in defense goods, then domestic sourcing preferences to protect our national security and defense industrial base must be considered consistent with the very foundation of free trade and capitalism. 
   Congress has a duty to be concerned with our nation's ability to build the weapons and equipment necessary to defend itself. Any argument founded merely on shopping for the best value without considering the larger defense industrial base will leave our great nation exposed and vulnerable. A nation that cannot produce the materials necessary for its defense will eventually become a second-rate power. 
   Now, some analysts have argued that we should not press for more domestic sourcing of defense articles because Europe and other nations buy more U.S. defense technology that we buy from them. These statistics, however, fail to account for the offsets in defense sales required by other governments, including our friends in Europe. 
   According to a 2007 report entitled Offsets in Defense Trade prepared by the Bureau of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce, over 98 percent of all U.S. defense sales to Europe were ``offset'' from 1993 to 2006. In other words, for every dollar a European government spent on U.S. defense equipment, the U.S. prime defense contractors had to provide 98 cents in industrial compensation arrangements to that government. These compensation arrangements range from requiring re-locating a share of the production of that defense item to that country to marketing that country's goods in the United States. However, the United States is prohibited by law to require of a foreign defense contractor to ``offset'' part of the cost of the proposed acquisition. thus, our two-way defense trade with Europe is already heavily weighted in their favor. 
   Finally, Section 805 of H.R. 5658 will not launch a trade war because there have been several occasions in the past when European governments refused to buy from American companies because of their own defense industrial base concerns. In 2003, Pratt & Whitney lost a bid to EuroProp International (EPI) to supply the engine for the A400M European military troop transport plane despite the fact that their initial bid was 20 percent lower, they had a higher quality engine, and they committed to build a new assembly line in Europe and include 75 percent European content in the engine. According to the Financial Times on June 13, 2003, Airbus effectively declared Pratt & Whitney the winner until European governments intervened and promised financial support to EPI so it could drop its price and clinch the deal with a redesigned engine in order to keep all the work in Europe. 
   Similarly, in 2003, when Italy wanted to build a new fleet of search and rescue helicopters, Skirosky and MD Helicopters were interested in bidding on the contract but were not even given the opportunity. The Italian government decided instead to award the contract without any competition to their national helicopter company--Augusta/Westland--on the grounds of ``homeland security.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, encouraging the Pentagon to consider the defense industrial base as one factor in their contract decision-making process will help us safeguard over the long-term the knowledge and innovation that make our defense industry the best in the world. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5658 and, in particular, Section 805, throughout the legislative process.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2262, HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I come from northern Illinois, an area that has over 2,500 factories. I've spent about three-fourths of my time in Congress dealing with manufacturing issues and traveled the world working on different projects that have different processes, and this bill is really, really bad for people who are interested in keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States. Therefore, I rise in opposition to the rule governing the Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007. 
   Twenty-six amendments from both Democrats and Republicans were submitted, but only seven were approved for the House for debate for 10 minutes apiece. The bill proposes to make huge changes to an important sector of our economy, and the bill, therefore, deserves more than a little over 2 hours of debate. 
   If the underlying bill is enacted as currently drafted, it poses an unacceptable threat to the health of our manufacturing and defense industrial base. Without agriculture, mining and manufacturing, we become a Third World Nation. 
   U.S. mining operations provide approximately 50 percent of the metals needed by American manufacturers. Everybody in Congress, Mr. Speaker, interested in manufacturing needs to listen to this, because if this bill passes, this makes us more dependent upon China to get our minerals for manufacturing. 
   Many of these minerals, gold, silver, copper, platinum, molybdenum, beryllium, titanium, zinc, magnesium and nickel are used in manufacturing applications from industrial motors to satellites. Thus, the core of our industrial minerals is what we're discussing today. Over the past few years, the cost of these raw materials has gone through the roof. We're putting the viability of our manufacturers in America at stake. 
   When I chaired the Small Business Committee, I held two historic hearings on the spike in metal prices and what it means for manufacturers, both large and small. No one recommended at those hearings that we should make it more difficult, and thus more expensive, to mine in the United States. 
   Many of the alternative sources of these minerals are also located in countries that are not close allies of us. Many of these minerals are also critical for the production of defense equipment. I'm concerned that we may find that just as America's energy security is largely dependent on the goodwill of OPEC, our national security will be largely dependent on China's goodwill as we compete for the metals and rare Earth minerals that feed our defense industrial base. 
   Over half of the high-end magnet production that contains aluminum, nickel, and cobalt comes from China, and 100 percent of the rare Earth minerals used in magnets is found in China. The magnets are used in advanced missile guidance systems such as JDAM. 
   I'm not aware of anybody that has claimed that the increased regulatory burden, an 8 percent gross income royalty interest in new production and a 4 percent increase on retroactive production, will help to improve the domestic supply of minerals or help lower their costs. 
   Our manufacturing workers are the best and most productive workers in the world. They have been beset by cheap labor overseas, rising energy costs, unfair trade practices. And now this Congress, this Congress, Mr. Speaker, will make it more difficult for the American worker to keep his job in manufacturing because this Congress will make the raw materials so expensive that what will happen, the U.S. mining companies may go out of business, and then we will be totally dependent on foreign countries to keep up the mineral supply for our manufacturing base. 
   This is an issue that if you vote ``yes'' on this rule, if you vote ``yes'' on the bill, it will destroy America's manufacturing jobs. Maybe I get too passionate when it comes to protecting America's manufacturing jobs. I've visited hundreds and hundreds of factories throughout the world to make sure that the United States is way out front in technology and innovation, and in fact, when I hear so much talk going on on the other side of the aisle about innovation, about competitiveness, then you come right back and the very feedstock for American manufacturing you want to tax out of business. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a bad bill for American workers. This is a bad bill for American workers. This is a bad bill for American workers because it says let's just tax the minerals you need to make things that go out the door out of business. You might as well put another tax on natural gas. In fact, the Democrats did the same thing by taking away the tax break for exploration of natural gas, which is 80 percent of the feedstocks for plastics. 
   And so here we are again, this Congress destroying American manufacturing jobs. Vote ``no'' on the rule and ``no'' on the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, it's not without irony that just this past week Congressman Joe Crowley and I, representing the House, and Senators Feinstein and McConnell, representing the Senate, the other body, were at the White House for the signing of the bill that awarded the Congressional gold medal to Aung San Suu Kyi, and it was a very interesting moment there. The First Lady joined the President at the bill signing, which was quite unusual. And the First Lady, the day before, had actually conducted a press conference, which is quite unusual for her, talking about the untold suffering that is occurring in this country. 
   And while we discussed the issue, it was apparent the intensity with which the President and the First Lady, and indeed the entire Nation is viewing the impact of the fact that the junta in Burma simply would not allow humanitarian aid to flow into that country. And so at the time, when we honor somebody with the Congressional Gold Medal, somebody who represents a bulwark of freedom and democracy, the country gets hit with this horrible tragedy. 
   Our purpose here today is simply to encourage the junta to follow the humanitarian strain which is written in the soul of every individual, and that is to set aside the politics, to allow the American aid that is available and, indeed, world aid that is available, in order to alleviate the suffering.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, we have a unique opportunity today to improve national security, support our foreign policy interests, and help American manufacturers. 
   H.R. 5916 is a product of nearly 18 months of work. We closely worked with the executive branch, the business community and non-proliferation nongovernment organizations. Without this legislation, foreign customers will continue to search out products that are ITAR-free to avoid being entangled in U.S. export control laws. The process improvements in this bill will make U.S. manufacturers more competitive in the international marketplace, creating and retaining American jobs, and supporting economic growth here in the United States. 
   This legislation permits the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to hire more staff, reducing the backlog of defense trade license applications and improving our scrutiny of the most sensitive technologies. 
   The bill creates a special licensing authorization for American-made spare and replacement parts. It also establishes some goals for licensing processing, including a 7-day deadline for defense trade licenses for those countries who support our combat, peacekeeping or humanitarian operations. 
   I appreciate the Foreign Affairs Committee's efforts, particularly the outstanding leadership of my good friend from California, Mr. Sherman, on this very delicate issue. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (PASSPORT BACKLOG REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 966, which gives the Department of State the authority to re-hire Foreign Service retirees without harming their pensions through October 1, 2010 to temporarily increase more personnel to reduce the backlog on passport applications. S. 966 has already passed the Senate and it is time to send this bill on its way to the President's desk for his signature. I appreciate the expeditious consideration of this legislation to give the State Department another tool to help them deal with the massive increase in the number of passport applications. 
   I hate to say ``I told you so'' but in 2005 I predicted this train wreck. When I chaired the Small Business Committee, I held a hearing on the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) in 2005 primarily to examine the effect of WHTI on small business. At the time, I said that because of the amount of commerce within the Western Hemisphere it ``may make it next to impossible to fulfill the statutory mandate to require this enhanced documentation.'' 
   I recognize that Congress gave the Departments of State and Homeland Security a difficult mission to implement within a short time period. I was one of the 75 Members to vote against the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 that contained the WHTI mandate. 
   However, since WHTI was implemented on January 23, my office has been inundated with frantic calls from constituents seeking passports to travel overseas. So far this year, my office has assisted 491 individuals with problems in obtaining their passports for travel. For all of 2006, my office helped just 51 constituents with passport problems. These calls are dominating the time of the caseworkers in my district offices. 
   Although we have been 99 percent successful in getting people the passports they need to travel, it has not been easy. Our caseworkers spend countless hours on the phone each day with panicked constituents who face the prospect of losing thousands of dollars and missing out on dream vacations if we cannot help them. And it seems we are always in crisis mode. Many passports do not get issued until two to three days before departure, and that is done with a continual push from my staff. 
   Despite constant monitoring and advocacy by my staff, some constituents do not receive their passports within 48 hours of departure. The last resort for these constituents is to take a day off work and travel to downtown Chicago--about two hours away--to get their passports on an emergency basis. I am told that although these constituents arrive before the required 7:00 a.m. opening time, it generally takes all day to get their passports. 
   Madam Speaker, you might not feel as bad if these were people who did not follow the rules and who waited until the last minute to get their passports. But a vast majority of the people who seek our assistance have done everything our Government asked of them. They applied for their passports well within the allotted time to receive their passports on time for their departures. And yet, their vacations and thousands of dollars of investments are in jeopardy. 
   I applaud the State Department and DHS for trying to ease the situation last month when they agreed to allow people traveling to Mexico, Canada or the Caribbean to depart as long as they had receipts in hand showing they had applied for their U.S. passports. But problems still occur. Some have applied, but  the State Department website indicates their applications cannot be found and thus a receipt cannot be secured. In addition, some of the cruise lines in the Caribbean do not accept these receipts. This situation causes even more anxiety for my constituents. 
   I understand the goal of the WHTI, but its implementation has been difficult. It has caused unnecessary anxiety and enormous amounts of work for my constituents and my staff. We must come up with an alternative way to enhance our security or make severe adjustments in the way we manage WHTI so we don't leave high and dry the people who followed the rules to get their passports. 
   That is why I applaud the prompt scheduling of S. 966 so shortly after the Senate passed the bill at the end of last month. I urge my colleagues to pass S. 966 so that the bill can be signed into law by the President as soon as possible.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. 
   According to the International Trade Administration, approximately 91 percent of U.S. exports to Peru are manufactured products. Currently, all of these goods are assessed high tariffs--in some instances at double-digit rates. Peruvian manufacturers are not assessed any tariffs when selling to the U.S. market. This market-opening trade agreement levels the playing field for America's manufacturers by eliminating high tariffs on all U.S. manufactured goods within 10 years. Eighty percent of Peruvian tariffs on consumer and industrial goods would be eliminated immediately upon this agreement coming into force.  
   To put the cost of these tariffs into perspective, a Caterpillar off-highway truck made in Illinois used for mining exported to Peru costs the end-user an additional $100,000 because of the tariffs. This agreement eliminates this duty immediately. Because Peru does not have a free trade agreement with Japan, H.R. 3688 gives a competitive advantage to Caterpillar over its global competitors such as Komatsu of Japan. The northern Illinois district I am proud to represent has many suppliers to Caterpillar, many of them small manufacturers, selling about $150 million worth of product each year. Having an agreement like this insures the long-term viability of the manufacturing jobs at these firms that may not even know that their product they make eventually finds its way to export markets like Peru. 
   Madam Speaker, this agreement will greatly benefit other manufacturers of Illinois as well. In 2001, Illinois machinery manufacturers exported $65.8 million worth of goods to Peru. In 2006, that number more than tripled to $198.2 million. Our manufacturers were able to do this in spite of the high tariffs. Imagine what they will be able to do when these tariffs are removed! The independent International Trade Commission estimates that U.S. exports to Peru will increase by $1.1 billion once this agreement is fully implemented. We have seen examples of other market opening agreements that resulted in increasing U.S. exports. Since the adoption of the market-opening agreement with Chile in 2004, U.S. exports to Chile leapt by 33 percent in 2004, 43 percent in 2005, and 38 percent in 2006! Our trade agreement with Australia also helped boost U.S. exports ``down under'' by 25 percent in just two years. 
   I urge my colleagues to support America's manufacturers by voting ``yes'' for this agreement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3355 requires the Treasury Department to offer low-cost subsidized Federal loans to State reinsurance funds. This bill employs the lesser used loan approach for States, rather than block grants or emergency funding, the usual methods of Federal assistance. 
   The concept of the loan is unique from a block grant, as a loan implies a temporary extension of funds with agreed-upon terms of repayment. The concept of a loan also implies that there are consequences for those who do not abide by the terms of the loan, such as ineligibility to receive additional loans should one become delinquent on a current loan. It is not in the lender's interest to lend money to someone who has proven that he or she will not pay it back according to the contracted terms. 
   This bill contains no prohibition on continued lending to States that are delinquent on loans authorized under this bill or extended through other Federal entities as found in other Federal loan programs. This consequence free-lending program will also allow States that choose to ignore the repayment responsibility to treat the loans as being in a state of eternal deferral, and expose the taxpayer to a tremendous amount of risk. 
   My amendment seeks to protect the taxpayer by insuring that Federal loans go only to States with a proven track record of fiscal responsibility. Specifically, this fiscally responsible amendment will disqualify States that are delinquent on any Federal disaster loans from receiving additional loans under this program. 
   H.R. 3355 already entitles these States to subsidized loans at below-market rates from the Federal Government. It only makes sense that they should be held to the same responsible standard that applies in the private market and elsewhere in the Federal Government. Without this standard, the loan program becomes no different than a block grant or a taxpayer-financed giveaway.     
   H.R. 3355 requires very little of the States in the way of mitigation to reduce the cost to taxpayers. By ensuring that States act responsibly before receiving another subsidized loan, my amendment is a small but important step towards protecting the interest of the tax-paying Americans that will be funding this bill. 
   I urge support for this amendment and would cite as precedent TANF  funds, for example, under title 42, chapter 7, a failure to timely repay a Federal loan fund for State welfare programs, if the Secretary determines that a State has failed to repay any amounts borrowed from the Federal loan program, then they become ineligible or that the amounts they receive in the future are deducted to pay the prior amounts that are due. 
   I would urge support of this amendment. This makes sure that this is a loan program and not a grant program. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. MANZULLO. Thank you. 
   I actually concur with what the gentleman from Florida said. But what he was talking about was in terms of the traditional FEMA emergency funds. That's not the topic of this bill. Those funds are totally separate and independent of the topic that we have here. 
   What we are talking about is making loans to the reinsurance fund of the State. We're not talking about emergency grants under FEMA, nor are we talking about emergency loans under the Small Business Administration for purpose of reconstruction or for loss of business, et cetera. This is an entirely separate program to make sure that the reinsurance fund of each State remains solvent. 
   What we are saying here is that we want to make this as ironclad as possible that this not become a grant program but that it is a loan program. And the only way to make sure that that is the case is that those States that are delinquent as to repayment on these funds simply do not qualify to accept any more funds. What that does is it places the responsibility upon the States to come up with a plan themselves in order to make sure that their reinsurance fund would remain solvent.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1908, PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, we are hearing this argument, let's just fix it in conference. Well, the last patent reform bill that passed, H.R. 1561, passed the House on March 3 of 2004. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed their bill, but it never saw action before the full Senate. The bill that the House passed never made it to conference, but it became law because someone stuffed it into the giant multi-thousand page omnibus consolidated appropriations bill which became law. 
   And besides that, we are Members of Congress. For us to stand up here and say, well, this is too confusing for us to understand, excuse me; that's what we're paid for. And if we have to take a considerable period of our time to study and learn patent law, that's our job. If we don't do that, we are failing in our obligation to the people that we represent. 
   So, what happened last time was good for making sausage. You stuffed the House-passed bill which never passed the Senate, never made it into conference, into a giant omnibus bill, but that's not how you make legislation. 
   Now, look what's going on here. We were told that we had to file by 5 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon any amendments to this bill. I went to the Rules Committee at 3 p.m. yesterday, where we met on the bill. At 2:43 p.m., the first manager's amendment was filed, 18 pages long. While we were still discussing the first manager's amendment, the second manager's amendment got filed at 3:50 p.m. 
   At 5:30 in the afternoon, the general public found out what was in it. I just found out in an analysis done on the second manager's amendment that this would be crippling to the small inventor. It would be horrifying to the patent holders in this country, that it would favor overseas patent holders as opposed to the American inventor. 
   All I asked for in that Rules Committee was for an extra hour of debate, just 2 hours of debate on one of the most important topics this place has ever had, and we were denied that. And people turn on C-SPAN. They see us. We'll take a half an hour to debate a post office, an hour to debate two post offices, the naming of the post offices, but 1 hour, just 1 hour to debate one of the most important issues that has ever come before this Congress in 50 years, 50 years. That's just fairness. Just fairness is all we're asking for. 
   I feel like asking for a motion to adjourn, but I'm not going to. That would not be fair to the Members that have other things to do. 
   But to tell the American people the Members of Congress really don't need  to know the details, that we'll take care of the details for you, that's an abandonment of our obligation here. 
   We come here with the obligation to learn every issue on which we vote. We may not know all the nuances, we may not know all the details, but nobody's going to tell us that this is too confusing for you to understand, because that's not what the American people send us here for. 
   And so I would just urge you, urge the folks, that there is no way possible in the limited amount of time that we can discuss this bill. 
   Let me show you what this does. This is Caterpillar, this is RIM. It puts two companies against each other. RIM has a lot of American parts. The bill should be written to accommodate both, to accommodate the American inventions in both of these manufactured products. 
   Vote ``no'' on the rule.

   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, if we had to patent the way Congress is considering this bill, no one would claim to be its inventor. This is a disgrace. One of the most important bills to come before this Nation in 60 years concerning manufacturing and patentability of articles and processes is so limited that the Democrats have given just 4 minutes of their 30 to two people on the other side. They owe them an apology. They owe them at least another hour of debate. The American people deserve a lot more debate than that. 
   An amendment was filed at 2:46 yesterday before the Rules Committee, the manager's amendment. One of the groups that contacted us representing pharmacies and labor unions and Caterpillar and all kinds of manufacturing organizations got a hold of it, finally had to analyze it overnight because of the complexity of the issues, and said, my gosh, this could destroy the system of patent law and protection of patent holders in this country. 
   What we are asking for is the opportunity to be able to explain it. Members of Congress should not be placed in the position of choosing between innovation. 
   Let me give you an example. Caterpillar is on one side, in Peoria, Illinois, Phil Hare's district. Hundreds of thousands of suppliers across the country, including the Midwest. Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, is on the other side of the issue, in favor of it. But inside of the BlackBerry is this motherboard. It is magnesium. It is made by Chicago White Metals. They have the finest processes for magnesium hot-chamber diecasting, a company that is the only diecasting company in the country that is rated ISO 14001 for its higher environmental standards. 
   You have to get on the inside of these machines to understand the importance of this law. You have to be able to take every single word that is added at the last minute and be able to study it to see the impact upon American innovation. That is what this debate is about. It is simply asking for more time. 
   The first thing we learn as Members of Congress is do no harm. Why should we place ourselves in the position of choosing winners and losers in something as important as patent law, with the excuse that we have to harmonize and we have to adopt Asian and European standards of patent law? What is wrong with the American system? We are the innovators, we are the ones with the great minds. It is our system that is placed, in effect, in the entire world, all the products and the processes and the ideas that have made us free. 
   I would therefore ask the Members, even if you lean towards this bill, to vote against it as a matter of free speech principle. The American people are entitled to more debate, because they need to know more about this bill.

   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, while I was in the Rules Committee yesterday, the gentleman from California said with regard to the types of damages and the standard for damages that could be used that the judge would have the discretion to determine that. 
   Well, taking a look at the manager's amendment. That discretion has been taken away, and now there is a presumption in favor of the most onerous provision dealing with damages, and that really would impact the small inventor. 
   Let's take a look at what would happen with the majority's view on patent damage reform. The Wright brothers' airplane, here is the patent, I have got a picture of it right here. 
   The flying machine, if it had been patented today, or, no, if the rules that the majority is suggesting now were in effect at the time that the Wright brothers got their patent, the amount that they recovered would have been limited to the fractional value of the surface controls alone, that's it, even though everything else went on what was called an airplane, but the thing never flew. 
   That's what this does to innovation. If you want to get something for your trim tab and your ailerons and whatever else they put on an aircraft, that's fine. 
   But this is an example, nobody else in the entire debate has given one example except me. This is the only opportunity that the people opposed to this bill have had to talk about the actual impact of the law upon a factual situation.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (TAKING RESPONSIBLE ACTION FOR COMMUNITY SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, this bill is quite interesting because, if you take a look at the Surface Transportation Board's weighing an application for a merger, one would think that items such as the safety of the people, the backup of traffic, incremental delays at crossings, and hundreds of school bus crossings per day on impacted tracks would have some type of a consideration.     
   The problem is that under the present law, in an oversight made in 1995, whenever the Surface Transportation Board tries to weigh the impacts on local communities, the only criteria that is used is whether or not it violates antitrust laws. And ironically, issues of safety are not taken into consideration. And that's shocking. 
   It's apparent that there is a big problem in this bill. The bill has application across the country. It has particular application to northern Illinois to tens of thousands of my constituents that have to travel through the town of Barrington, which is in Congresswoman Bean's district. To these folks, the backup of traffic is significant. The inability to get to work on time; the fact that, from what we understand, Canadian National plans on putting in trains that are 2 miles long clogging all three intersections in the village of Barrington at the same time. And it's through that village that there are 800 school bus crossings each day. 
   And it's amazing that this bill tries to correct something so elementary as to say whenever there is a request to merge railroad companies, that safety should be a consideration.  
   I'm here today to offer my unqualified support for the Taking Responsible Action for Community Safety Act (H.R. 6707). This bill, which I'm proud to co-sponsor, will help solve a left-over problem from when Congress abolished the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1995. The Surface Transportation Board, STB, took over the functions of the ICC with the missions of resolving railroad rate and service disputes and reviewing proposed railroad mergers. Current law gives the STB considerable discretion to disapprove transactions involving at least two Class I rail carriers but allows much less flexibility to disapprove transactions like CN's proposed acquisition of the EJ&E. In fact, the law states that the STB ``shall'' approve the transaction ``unless'' the Board determines it will hurt competitiveness, restrain trade, or fail to meet significant transportation needs. In plain English, this means that the STB will not stop a transaction because of local community concerns unrelated to anti-trust issues. This may seem like semantics, but it's an important distinction that has long tipped the scale toward privately owned rail carriers and away from the communities who have to live with them. 
   In northern Illinois, the community of Barrington is unalterably opposed to the proposed sale of the EJ&E line to the Canadian National, CN, Railway, as evidenced by the thousands of people that showed up to the STB scoping session last January and their formal hearing last August. This is not because of a NIMBY syndrome--everyone understands the need to improve the national rail transportation network and would be willing to compromise. But having additional freight train traffic traverse on the existing aging EJ&E track will not be just a simple minor inconvenience--it will fundamentally alter the entire nature of this picturesque town. 
   While I do not directly represent Barrington, Illinois, I am honored to serve the thousands of commuters who live in southern McHenry County who must travel through Barrington, either by car or rail, to get to work or to perform daily errands. While I've been concerned about this deal since day one, a Draft Environmental Impact Statement recently relesed by the STB confirmed many of my worst fears about increased accident risks, increased air pollution, increased exposure to hazardous material, and increased traffic. The report also acknowledged that railroads traditionally only contribute 5 to 10 percent of the costs to mitigate these problems. That would leave taxpayers paying the tab for a transaction that solely benefits a private company's bottom line. 
   I say it's not about what's traditional. It's about what's fair. And the people from the 16th District of Illinois, who I've had a plenty of chances to talk with over the past few weeks, agree with me. 
   H.R. 6707 corrects an oversight made in 1995 and requires the STB to weigh impacts on local communities more heavily when considering any railroad transaction. In fact, the STB would have to reject a proposed acquisition if it finds that transaction's impacts on the affected communities outweigh the transportation benefits. Congress should learn from this experience with this particular transaction and make sure that no community in the Nation will ever have to go through what Barrington is experiencing now. 
   In this particular case, I understand that this transaction could have some macrobenefits, but CN accomplishes that goal primarily by exporting the train congestion problems in downtown Chicago to outlying suburban areas such as Barrington. Tens of thousands of motorists in northern Illinois--especially those in McHenry County--travel through Barrington on their way to work each day, crossing the EJ&E line at Route 14, Route 59, and Lake-Cook Road. Approximately another 4,000 commuters from McHenry County ride Metra rail to work in the Chicago-land area each day, crossing the EJ&E line in Barrington. All of these people will be affected by additional CN freight traffic. 
   At the very least, they are going to encounter inconvenient delays and increases in air pollution. At the worst, it could become a matter of life and death. Not only could emergency responder vehicles become trapped on all sides by a train, but school buses in the Barrington school district cross the EJ&E lines about 800 times a day. Additional freight trains could quadruple the safety risk of students who traverse the crossings each day. 
   In closing, l'd like to express my appreciation to my friend Jim Oberstar, the chairman of the Transportation Committee, for introducing this piece of legislation and for working with me and others in the suburban Chicago delegation in a bipartisan manner. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6707 today.

   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Rules Committee for allowing debate on the Manzullo amendment to help the EQIP program. However, I'm deeply concerned about the Democrats' attempt to pit people who work for manufacturers against agriculture by a midnight tax increase against manufacturing workers. 
   The offset to pay for part of the farm bill would strongly discourage future foreign investment in the United States. 
   Nissan USA, owned by Nissan based in Japan, borrows money from their finance unit based in the Netherlands. Under our current tax treaty with the Netherlands, no tax is applied. However, under the Doggett amendment, a new 10 percent tax would be applied to this transaction, and the Netherlands would then most likely view this as an abrogation of our tax treaty and seek renegotiation or outright annulment,  thus hurting our overall trade with the Netherlands. 
   In the northern Illinois district that I represent, the one which led the Nation in unemployment in 1980 at 25 percent, 14,000 manufacturing workers lost their jobs, 200 companies closed up. I just lost another one yesterday. Nissan Forklift in Marengo, Illinois, would be hit with a 10 percent increase. They're not based in Bermuda. 
   These are common American people, the ones who get up at the crack of dawn. They represent the manufacturing people of this country, and the Democrats are hurting them. 
   Don't hurt my workers. Don't raise taxes on a bill you have had no hearings on because you don't know. You have to examine what it does to the everyday worker. The Japanese, the English, the Italians, the Swedes, the Germans have all saved manufacturing jobs in my congressional district. I know what I'm talking about. 
   Vote against this rule. Vote against this bill. Vote for the American worker, who is glad to have his job because somebody came in and invested the money in American manufacturing.

   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I find it ironic. What we are trying to do over here is to save the taxpayers what could be up to $15 million, and we are accused of wasting the time and taxes of the American people by engaging in a debate to save $15 million. 
   The purpose of the House of Representatives, the purpose of the people on this side, is to save money. This whole debate is about saving money. This could be easily resolved if the Speaker of the House would say: I am willing to take the smaller aircraft to land halfway in Kansas or Illinois or anywhere else, fuel up again, and head on to San Francisco. That would probably save the taxpayers $10 million. It would be a much smaller aircraft, and it would inconvenience her by about an hour to 1 1/2 hours. This is what this is all about. 
   But what really bothers me, Mr. Chairman, is the fact that those of us who are engaging in debate, this is the type of debate that the American people want because it is the type of debate that saves them money. It is all about saving the taxpayers' money. If this is not the debate that should take place, I really don't know what should take place.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great honor and a sense of humility as the senior Republican from the Land of Lincoln that I offer this resolution to celebrate the birthday of our Nation's 16th President. I want to first offer my deep thanks and gratitude to the chairman and ranking minority member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. WAXMAN of California and Mr. DAVIS of Virginia, respectively, for allowing this resolution to come up on the floor to coincide with President Lincoln's birthday. I recognize that this was an unusual procedure and that normal committee protocol was waived to expedite consideration of this resolution to time with Lincoln's birthday today. I also want to offer my profound appreciation to my good friend and fellow Illinoisan, Representative DANNY DAVIS of Chicago, who made all of this possible to happen today. 
   Abraham Lincoln was born 199 years ago today to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks at Knob Creek Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky, in Hardin County. Today starts a series of celebrations over the next 2 years to commemorate the life of Abraham Lincoln based on the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission Act, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 2000. These commemorations include a special kick-off ceremony at Lincoln's boyhood home, the redesign of the Lincoln penny, a special bicentennial postage stamp, a rededication of the Lincoln Memorial, and a special joint session or meeting of Congress for ceremonies and activities related to Abraham Lincoln. I am absolutely delighted that the House will join in this kick-off celebration in Kentucky, albeit delayed because of an ice storm, with the debate over this resolution. This resolution will continue honoring Lincoln's legacy beyond the next 2 years by requesting the President to issue a proclamation every year in his honor as he does for many other great figures of American history. 
   In the fall of 1816, Thomas and Nancy Lincoln packed their belongings and their two children--Sarah, 9, and Abraham, 7--and left Kentucky bound for the new frontier of Spencer County in southern Indiana. Abraham Lincoln lived in Indiana for the next 14 years until he was 21 years old. However, in October 1818, when Abraham was 9 years old, his mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln, died. His feelings for her were still strong some 40 years later when he said, ``All that I am or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.'' 
   In 1830, Thomas Lincoln, then re-married, decided to move the family to another new frontier--this time to the tiny village of Decatur, Illinois, located in Macon County. Hard working and intellectually inquisitive, Abraham Lincoln's first foray into public service came in 1832 when he was elected and served as a captain of an Illinois militia company during the Black Hawk War. Following his military service, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature in 1834 from Sangamon County and was successively reelected until 1840. In 1846, Abraham Lincoln was elected to serve in this great House, where he ably represented central Illinois in the seat now held by my good friend and colleague, Representative RAY LAHOOD. 
   Lincoln grew to prominence as an attorney and a legislator with a reputation for fairness, honesty, and a belief that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. He founded these beliefs in the ideals of the Declaration of Independence--a document which, as President, he would cite frequently as his inspiration for saving the Union and as the basis for his opposition to slavery. During a speech at Independence Hall in 1861, Lincoln stated, ``I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence ..... [it is these sentiments] which gave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time.'' Lincoln's belief in the principles espoused by the Declaration formed the motivating moral and natural law principle for his opposition to the spread of slavery and his belief in slavery's ultimate demise. 
   Lincoln found his belief in the equality of men to be directly at odds with the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1856. This legislation promulgated the concept of ``popular sovereignty''--the idea that State citizens should be able to determine the presence of slavery in their State by popular referendum. Lincoln's strong feelings against the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act propelled Lincoln to return to politics, and he began a bid for the U.S. Senate. 
   During his campaign for the Senate, Lincoln engaged in a series of seven debates with his opponent, Stephen Douglas. Now known as the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln's eloquence and studied opposition to the spread of slavery brought him into national prominence. 
   The second of these debates was held in Freeport, Illinois, a city in the district that I am privileged to represent, and was the origin of what is now known as the ``Freeport Doctrine.'' Cornered by Lincoln into choosing between the notion of popular sovereignty or the prohibition against outlawing slavery put forth by the infamous Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, Stephen Douglas responded that slavery could be prevented from any territory by the refusal of the people living in that territory to pass laws favorable to slavery. Likewise, if the people of the territory supported slavery, legislation would provide for its continued existence. While this doctrine would see Douglas reelected to the Senate over Lincoln, it would be a key factor in his loss in the 1860 Presidential election. 
   Lincoln's performance in the debates won him national prominence and a reputation for courage, character, and patriotism. These factors played heavily into his election to office as the 16th President of the United States on November 6, 1860. 
   Upon taking office, Lincoln was thrust into the throes of the Civil War. Leading a partitioned Union, Lincoln relied heavily on his political ideals born of the Declaration of Independence. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued what would become the most iconic document of his Presidency--the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all the slaves in southern States that seceded from the Union. His commitment to the promises of the Declaration of Independence were further evidenced in the opening lines of his greatest speech at Gettysburg: ``Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.'' 
   On November 8, 1864, Abraham Lincoln was reelected to the Presidency by 55 percent of the popular vote. He continued to act as a courageous and principled leader until he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865. Abraham Lincoln died on April 15, 1865. 
   Abraham Lincoln's profound and courageous belief in the equality of men and the sacredness of the American Union propelled him forward as one of the greatest Presidents our Nation has known. Last Sunday, at a White House ceremony honoring Abraham Lincoln, President George W. Bush said, ``he, of all the successors to George Washington, none had greater impact on the presidency and on the country ..... He was a fabulous man, a great President. His life was one of humble beginnings, and steadfast convictions. And so we celebrate his deeds, we lift up his ideals, and we honor this good man.'' 
   Lincoln is a hero to so many of us here in this House on both sides of the aisle, as he is to me. The prominence of President Abraham Lincoln is an undisputed fact of American history. The man best known for freeing the slaves and saving an imperiled Union has attained iconic status among historians and citizens alike as evidenced by best selling books such as Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin that documented the political genius of Lincoln in winning the Presidency and governing the Nation. 
   And yet, this man of great genius, compassion and acumen lacks official Federal recognition for the day of his birth, February 12, because what is popularly known as President's Day is legally Washington's Birthday. While I do not wish to diminish the contributions George Washington made to the establishment of this great country, this resolution will finally give Lincoln his due without the cost of a separate Federal holiday by simply requesting the President each year to issue a proclamation honoring this great man and encouraging the people of the United States to observe his birthday with appropriate ceremonies and activities. The resolution also encourages State and local governments and local educational agencies to study and appreciate the reverence and respect Abraham Lincoln had for the Declaration of Independence in the development of American history, jurisprudence, and the spread of freedom around the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Abraham Lincoln today and in recognizing the profound influence the Declaration of Independence had upon Lincoln's political philosophy as a model for us to emulate.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (RECOGNIZING AND WELCOMING THE LEADERS OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 355 welcoming the Leaders from the Pacific Island nations to the Eighth Pacific Island Conference being held in Washington. I commend my distinguished friend and colleague, Chairman FALEOMAVAEGA, for introducing this resolution. 
   The United States and the Pacific Island nations share strong economic and cultural ties  that have endured the test of time. The triennial meeting of the Pacific Island Conference is an important event that allows the U.S. to reaffirm its friendship and ties with the 20 nations participating in the Conference. This year's meeting will take place in Washington, DC, for the first time. 
   Our friends in the Pacific Island nations have stood by us steadfastly during the darkest moments of this Nation's history. A great number of the sons and daughters from the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau currently serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. They stand side by side with volunteers from American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, Guam, Hawaii, and other states to protect our freedom. 
   America's ties with the countries in the South Pacific date back centuries from the early days when American whalers sought safety in Fiji and Tonga and continuing through to the Pacific campaign during World War II. To this day, Pacific Island nations represent some of America's strongest allies at the United Nations. 
   I applaud the Administration and the East West Center for elevating the importance of this year's Pacific Island Conference to the highest level by holding it in our nation's capitol. I look forward to meeting with the Leaders during their visit to Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased that we are this point in the legislative process to send to the President's desk a bipartisan, bicameral reform of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS, process. I first became interested in CFIUS reform when a Chinese state-owned enterprise was in competition with a private Italian and a Canadian firm to purchase a very sensitive machine tool division of Ingersoll Milling. The Chinese eventually decided not to attempt to buy the very sensitive machine tool division of Ingersoll but were able to purchase the non-sensitive production line division, which saved hundreds of jobs. It came up again when IBM decided to sell its personal computer division to Lenovo, partially owned by the Chinese government. It emerged again when the China National Offshore Oil Company, CNOOC, another Chinese state-owned enterprise, was ready to outbid a private firm to acquire Unocal. 
   Let me make clear that I am a strong supporter of foreign direct investment into the United States. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies employ 5.1 million Americans, of which 31 percent are in the manufacturing sector; have a payroll of $325 billion; and account for 19 percent of all U.S. exported goods. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. is important because in many cases it provides capital to purchase companies in the U.S. where there is no domestic financing or interest, thus saving thousands of U.S. jobs. Many foreign companies retained numerous firms and jobs in the northern Illinois district I am proud to represent including Ingersoll Machine Milling (Italy) and Ingersoll Cutting Tools (Israel) in Rockford; Nissan Forklift (Japan) in Marengo; Eisenmann Corporation (Germany) in Crystal Lake; and Cadbury-Schweppes (United Kingdom), which owns the Adams confectionary plant in Loves Park. In fact, Illinois is fifth in the United States in terms of the number of employees supported by U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies per State. 
   The House is now prepared to send a comprehensive CFIUS reform bill to the President because of the legitimate concern over a year ago of Dubai Ports (DP) World's proposed acquisition of the London-based Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O) management operations of 27 terminals at 6 major U.S. ports east of the Mississippi River. Many Americans were legitimately concerned about the national security implications of this deal. However, it was often overlooked that DP World is a state-owned enterprise, owned by the royal family of Dubai. What does it mean for our national interest when foreign governments acquire private sector companies in America? 
   In the P&O case, the New York Times reported on February 24, 2006 that this sale came down to a ``battle between two foreign, state-backed companies''--DP World and PSA, which is part of the investment arm of the Singapore government. ``The acquisition price (for P&O) reflects the advantage that a number of the fastest growing companies enjoy--their government's deep pockets.'' Here is the key, Mr. Speaker--``DP World paid about 20 percent more (for P&O) than analysts thought the company was worth. Publicly traded companies that were potential bidders were scared off long before DP World's final offer.'' 
   You would think this would be a factor in the CFIUS decisionmaking process, particularly after Congress in 1992 required a 45-day review process for acquisitions by state-owned enterprises in reaction to the proposed sale of LTV's missile division to Thomson-CSF, the American subsidiary of a French firm that was then 58 percent owned by the French Government. Yet, CFIUS initially declined to subject the DP World's proposed acquisition of P&O through the additional 45-day review process until pressured by Congress. 
   I am pleased that H.R. 556 incorporates my main suggestion to mandate all proposed acquisitions of U.S. assets by a foreign state-owned enterprise undergo the more rigorous additional 45-day review process. The free market cannot work if foreign governments subsidize the purchase of U.S. assets. H.R. 556 will make absolutely crystal clear that in every case where there is a proposed acquisition by a foreign state-owned enterprise, it will undergo heightened scrutiny to ensure that there is no hidden agenda by a foreign government that could undermine our national security. We owe it to our constituents to make sure that foreign governments do not undermine our open free market system as a tool to advance their national interests. I congratulate the Chairmen and Ranking Members in both Houses of Congress for working together to produce a bill that will merit the President's signature. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 556.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment that will exempt the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP, from a $60,000 payment limitation that this bill proposes for conservation purposes. 
   This program provides farmers with financial and technical assistance to plan and implement soil and water conservation practices and has the full support of the environmental and farming community. 
   This amendment is more of a technical correction, as all it does is return the EQIP payment limitation to its current level of $450,000 over the life of the farm bill. The amendment does not  impact the increased payment limitation for direct payments. The amendment is narrowly tailored to only impact payments for EQIP-specific projects. 
   Currently, 60 percent of EQIP payments go to livestock producers, who use those cost-share payments to establish environmentally sound structures and practices on their farms. Without these payments, these structures and practices in many cases will not meet EPA standards for environmental care. 
   The problem with the proposed $60,000 limitation is that these EQIP programs are so expensive that the farmers, in many cases, probably in most cases in my district, won't choose to take it because of the cost. 
   To give you an example, we have two methane digesters in my congressional district. Each of them cost over a half a million dollars. The farmer could get up to 50 percent and sometimes even more of the costs of that from the present EQIP program, but under the proposed law, he could only get $60,000. 
   When I was in private practice, I practiced agricultural law and had to work with farmers to come into compliance with the EPA; and even though EQIP was not around at that time, the remedial measures that we took for runoff, et cetera, to be in compliance with EPA in many cases ran into the several hundred thousand dollars. 
   This is what I'm hearing from the constituents that I represent, that they respect the fact that EQIP is there, but $60,000 simply would not go long enough or far enough. 
   So our proposal is to return it to its present standard. It spends no more money. It makes money available to build these expensive facilities. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, in answer to the question of the gentleman from Minnesota, conservation is different from trying to meet an EPA mandate. You can do a tremendous amount of conservation programs for $60,000, but EQIP programs, by their very nature, cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's the problem. 
   The problem that we have here is that the $60,000 limitation goes into effect. Money may not be available for farmers to be able to meet environmental standards. So this really is a pro-environmental vote. I don't really want to talk about geese. I am talking about cattle. But this all applies to chicken farms and the tremendous runoff that we have. 
   By allowing this amendment and removing the $60,000 cap, this will increase the number of environmentally protected areas in farming across the country. That's the reason for it. It costs no more money, and you might want to spread these programs across the board. I can understand that on conservation, but not on these mandated programs that are title II. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MANZULLO. The problem is that the EQIP program is already being doubled in the amount from $1 to $2 billion, where the caps are being lowered to $60,000. This is not a conservation. 
   The purpose of this is so that cow manure and pig manure and chicken manure don't flow into the rivers and the streams. That's the problem with the Chesapeake. It's the chicken manure that's destroying the Chesapeake. 
   When you have the EQIP cap, that means less chicken producers will be able to afford retention systems in order to comply with EPA. So this is a pro-environmental vote, and there is plenty of money because the chairman recognizes the fact that the total amount has been doubled. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, the payment limitations of the farm bill go from $2 million to $1 million. Under the EQIP programs it goes from $450,000 down to $60,000. This is not for wealthy farmers. This is not for factory farms. These are for the little guys that I represented when I practiced law in Ogle County, Illinois, for 22 years. 
   If we had a program like this, the money would have gone a long way. But even with a modest herd of 300 head, it costs several hundred thousand to build a retention system or a methane digest, if you want to go into doing that. Our methane digesters in our district, the one that has 500 dairy cattle, they are able to run a city of 500 people, of 500 homes; thus, it conserves electricity from the nuclear plant and also from coal-burning facilities. The problem is getting onto the grid and getting a reasonable price. 
   I was a chairman of the Small Business Committee. When I practiced law, the guys that use this, these are all little guys around me. We don't have people with thousands and thousands of cattle in northern Illinois. So I would suggest that for the small business farmer, to make this program go even further, that we should allow this amendment.

   The gentleman from Minnesota has 30 seconds remaining.

<DOCNO>Mr. MANZULLO. (RIGHT TO LIFE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in this hour to speak for the millions of innocent voices that have been silenced due to the passage of Roe v. Wade on this day, 35 years ago. 
   Since the passage of Roe v. Wade, the National Right to Life estimates that nearly. 50 million lives have been lost. This number is staggering. 
   What do the deaths of 50 million children, say about the state of our Nation? It says that the Declaration of Independence is no longer absolute, as its ``unalienable'' right to life only applies when it is convenient. It says that Congress can make a Federal crime out of roosters crossing State lines, but when a defenseless child is taken across state lines to have an abortion, it is merely a ``right''--a choice being exercised. It says that seven unelected Supreme Court justices ignored the separation of powers, and appointed themselves as a superior legislature in order to decide the abortion issue. 
   But what is the good news? The good news is that citizens who believe that the Constitution protects life in all its seasons have worked to educate the public about abortion and the biological development of the unborn child, as well as to provide support and options for women when they need it the most. As a result, abortion numbers continue to drop from a high of over 1.6 million in 1990 to 1.2 million in 2005--proving that when given the right options and the whole truth about abortion, many women will choose life. 
   However, even as the pro-life movement continues to have an impact all over the United States, science has opened other doors that threaten the sanctity of life in the United States. Mass production of cloned embryos to be destroyed in research promotes the same principle as abortion--that human life only matters when it is chosen to matter. We must continue to be vigilant in protecting human life at its creation--whether in the womb or in the lab.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Speaker, we have all heard the adage that one reaps what he sows. As we seek to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac today, Congress is reaping what it has sown for so many years. 
   These organizations were supposed to help Americans buy their homes by making the mortgage market work better. But in pursuit of this goal, Congress and the regulators allowed these two organizations to shun good governance in pursuit of high profits. What was supposed to be a boost to the taxpayers, has turned into a raw deal characterized by privatized profits for socialized risk. 
   And now, Congress is in a bind: allow Fannie and Freddie to realize the results of their risky behavior and deal a catastrophic blow to an already troubled economy; or fulfill the implicit promise made to shareholders and bail out these two organizations. Congress created its own trap by allowing Fannie and Freddie to become too big to fail, and given their huge market exposure, it has become obvious that a bailout of some sort is necessary. 
   But this is a bailout of the worst kind, one that does not even seek to mimic the actions of the private market in punishing those who take too many risks. Unlike other bills we have passed that required government intervention into the private market, there is no mandate that the taxpayer be repaid. Fannie's and Freddie's CEOs don't get paid any less; the board of directors remains the same; and Fannie and Freddie are specifically allowed to continue the risky practices that got us into this mess in the first place. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is absurd. If we are going to put billions of dollars of taxpayers' money on the line, we need to make sure that something like this never, ever happens again. We need the reforms that are necessary in order to make sure that these two government-sponsored enterprises act more like an enterprise than they do like somebody that is putting the tab on the taxpayers' pocketbook.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MANZULLO. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of the amendment to reinstate the Mexico City Policy. This policy ensures that U.S. bilateral family planning programs are not conduits for exporting abortions internationally. 
   Let me be clear from the beginning: the Mexico City Policy is NOT anti-family planning. In no way does this policy reduce the $425 million that the United States provides in family planning assistance. What this amendment does do is to put a wall between contraception and abortion, thereby preventing this Congress from making the American taxpayers an implicit partner in the aborting of unborn children. It sends the message that as Americans, we stand for the life and liberty of all individuals--those whose voices can be heard, and those whose voices cry from the womb. 
   This Democrat-led Congress has voted to protect roosters from cockfighting and horses from slaughter. Doesn't it would seem logical that this Congress would stand up and protect the fragile lives of the unborn? 
   But this Congress has shown that it is only selectively sympathetic to the furtherance of life. As when horses are killed, or roosters are hurt. But not when a tiny, human life is stamped out with the approval of our government. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.
