   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I would ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 minutes of debate on this bill for debate purposes only, equally divided between the majority and the minority. So, the minority would get 15 extra minutes, and the majority would get 15 extra minutes.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this piece of legislation. I want to start by the simple statement that the House of Representatives, which is the body closest to the people of the United States, is considering a bill that wasn't written apparently until this morning. There hasn't been a committee hearing on the issue. There hasn't been a committee markup or a subcommittee markup. We could not even get the text from the committee of jurisdiction's majority counsel last  evening at approximately 7:30 because they didn't have it. Apparently, the text that was prepared in the middle of the night was changed some time early this morning at the request of unidentified parties. 
   In an economy where we're paying some of the highest gasoline prices in the world, and certainly the highest gasoline prices the United States has ever paid in terms of absolute dollars, where our truckers are paying $5 for diesel and our airlines are hemorrhaging cash because of their fuel costs, we are now bringing to the floor a piece of legislation that nobody has really seen or vetted. 
   I think that is absolutely unacceptable, terrible public policy and a travesty on the process of the House of Representatives. I can't object more strongly to the process that even the majority counsel on the committee of jurisdiction didn't have the text last evening. So on process grounds alone, we ought to reject this legislation. 
   Now let's talk about the policy. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established in 1975 as a consequence of the Arab oil embargo by OPEC against the United States of America where there was a conscience effort to prevent oil supplies from coming to this country. President Ford signed the SPR Act into law in December of 1975. It authorized 1 billion barrels of oil to be put into a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And that oil was only to be used in the event of a severe supply interruption that would result in severe economic harm to this country as a result of a Presidential declaration of emergency. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as established, was not intended to be used in a manipulative way to control or affect prices. 
   Now we haven't had any hearings, we haven't had a law that has changed the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. What we have before us is a piece of legislation that was put together by unknown parties. I could give some pretty good guesses about who some of those parties are. But officially I don't know who they are. It's on the floor. It allows 70 million barrels of oil to be released from the reserve. But not just any 70 million barrels. It allows the sweet light crude, which is the best oil in the reserve, to be released with apparently the intent to lower prices. 
   Now, the problem on policy grounds with this particular SPR release is that it also requires that that oil has to be replaced beginning no later than 6 months and within 5 years with heavy crude, which is some of the worst oil in the world. Do you know who has the heavy crude available today? Saudi Arabia. So we're going to sell oil, the light sweet crude, out of the reserve--right now, up to 70 million barrels--and we're going to replace it theoretically over time with heavy crude that is not nearly as easy to refine and not nearly as amenable to the various product differentials as the sweet light crude is, and the only place to get it is Saudi Arabia, which is, as we know, in the Middle East, one of the most unstable regions of the world. 
   So what we are really doing, apparently, is helping out our Saudi friends to make sure that the crude oil that they can't sell on the world market right now because it's too heavy and there's not a market, we will buy it and put it in the reserve, and we will use up the best oil in our reserve for some short-term price fix here in the U.S. market. 
   Well, what kind of a price impact will we get, Mr. Speaker? We have got a supply-demand problem in the world oil markets. We are using about 85 million barrels a day. And there is only about 85 to 86 million barrels a day of production available on the world market. If you put up to 2 to 3 million barrels a day of this oil on the market and sustain it, you probably will have a temporary price decrease. If you can get the supply-demand equation up to a 2 or 3 percent differential, I would say that oil prices will come down temporarily. But since we're only selling 70 million barrels, if we sold 3 million barrels, you can pump about 4 million barrels a day out of the reserve. So let's say we pumped it out at maximum. That would give us about 17 days of oil. So for 17 days, you might see a price decline. But on the 18th day, when there is no more oil to come out of the reserve, what is going to happen? You have not created new supply in the world. The price is going to shoot back up. Speculators are going to step back in, and the reserve is going to be 70 million barrels less. 
   I mean if this isn't a cynical political ploy to hopefully lower oil prices for the next 2 months before the election, then I have never seen one. We ought to vote against this. If you want to have a real debate on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if you really want to change the purpose for which it was intended, let's go through the committee system. Let's hold hearings. Let's have a give and take. Maybe we can come up with a way to use the SPR somewhat differently than what it was intended to be used. But unless you're willing to change the current Federal law on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, bringing up this piece of legislation is just a political sham to, A, maybe show the country that something is being done; B, help the Saudi oil ministry who can't sell their heavy crude on the market today; and, C, maybe get the price down for the next couple of months to help our majority friends in the upcoming election. 
   I can't more strongly emphasize that we ought to vote against it on not only procedural grounds but also on policy grounds. The SPR was intended to be a buffer if we have a severe supply interruption that would harm the U.S. economy in a significant way. We don't have that today. We have high energy prices in America and high gasoline prices in America because we are not producing energy in America that we could produce. 
   Let's bring an OCS drilling bill, an ANWR bill, a shale bill and a coal-to-liquids bill. Bring those bills to the floor, Mr. Speaker, and actually show the world that America will develop its own energy resources. If we do that, you're going to see the speculators get out of the market. And you're going to see that as the supply goes up and we hold demand constant, then you're going to see the price go down. And that will be permanent and productive for the American economy. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am going to recognize myself for 2 minutes. 
   I want to respond to what my good friend from Illinois just said. He is absolutely right that in July of 2005 we put an Energy Policy Act on the floor of this body. I would like to point out that that was a conference report that every relevant committee in the House of Representatives had had hearings and open markups on; we had a full conference with the Senate that was open, that the ranking member on the Democratic side at the time which was in the minority, Mr. Dingell, signed the conference report. The ranking member in the Senate, Mr. Bingaman of New Mexico voted for the conference report. 
   And I said on the House floor when that conference report passed that it was an excellent bill for stationary energy, but it was not an excellent bill on mobility energy because we did not have in that report to drill in ANWR. We did not have in that bill to drill and explore in the Outer Continental Shelf, for the simple reason we didn't have the votes, primarily in the other body, to put those things in the bill. 
   But the conference report that was voted on was bipartisan, it went through the regular process, it was not done the night before or the morning of and put on the floor under a suspension rule. And where it was, what was in the bill was good and is working today. 
   But I said on the floor at the time, you can go back and look at it in the Congressional Record, on mobility energy, it was not as good as I think it should have been because simply we didn't have the votes. 
   Today, the American people support drilling in ANWR. Today, the American people want to drill in the OCS, or at least explore what is in there, and we can't get those bills to the floor, Mr. Speaker. 
   So I would ask that, at some point in time, after these political shams are concluded, we put some of those bills on the floor and see where the votes are. I think there is a bipartisan majority for those bills right now on the floor of this House.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   First, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Georgia for yielding 3 minutes of his time. I sincerely appreciate it. 
   I want to point out some of the fallacies in the debate as quickly as I can. 
   The first fallacy is that nothing that we do in terms of developing domestic energy supplies in the United States is going to take effect for 10 years. That's poppycock. We can convert coal to liquids within the next 2 years. We can be drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, if it's allowed, within the next year. We can be doing major pilot projects on our shale oil resources within the next year. We can be drilling in parts of Federal lands that are currently snafued because of Federal permitting within the next year. Those are all things that can be done very quickly. 
   Even up in ANWR, it's not going to take 10 years if we give the green light to drill and develop ANWR. It will definitely take more than 2 to 3 years, but you could have production in ANWR, I'm told, within 5 years. 
   The thing that we have got to do in this country if we're going to bring energy prices down and keep them down is change the fundamental difference between supply and demand in the world oil market. You have got 85 million barrels of oil we're using worldwide, and we've got approximately 86 million barrels of oil that's available. That less than 1 percent supply margin is what brings these high prices. 
   A gimmick like we have today where we take some oil out of the SPR for 60 days and then hopefully put it in within the next 6 years is not going to change that fundamental. If it has a temporary supply price decrease, that's a positive. I'll admit that.     
   But if it has, it's only temporary because you are not changing the fundamental supply-demand equation on the world oil market. 
   So what Republicans are saying is, let's have a strategic plan. Perhaps releasing some oil from the SPR is part of that plan, perhaps. That's what hearings are about. That's what a regular order process in the committee system would be about. So we're not saying that we never want to release any oil from the SPR, but we are saying it ought to be a part of a strategic plan, and part of that strategic plan has got to be to develop domestic American energy resources. 
   And Speaker Pelosi, for some reason, is adamantly afraid of that kind of a bill coming to the floor. I don't care if it's a GENE GREEN bill, a JOHN DINGELL bill, a RICK BOUCHER bill, a STENY HOYER bill; but let a bill come up that's got some real domestic energy supply in it and have an honest debate, and let's see where the votes are. Let's don't have an energy gimmick of the week. 
   That's what this is. It's the latest energy gimmick of the week, and if it has a positive effect--and I say that as an if--it will be temporary because if you take 70 million barrels--and oh, by the way, I want to give a hint to my friends on the majority side who drafted the bill. You've got a drafting error in the bill. It won't do what you think it will do, but I will let you find it. If it were to become law, which it won't, but if it were, it won't put 70 million barrels of oil on the market. So you find the mistake. You developed it in the midnight. You find the mistake. 
   With that, vote ``no'' on the bill, and let's bring a rational, long-term, strategic plan to the floor in the next 2 weeks.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, on the next bill, the Consumer Product Safety Commission reauthorization bill, I will be standing in this very spot saying extremely complimentary things about Chairman Dingell, the process that he has used and that Speaker Pelosi has used to bring the Consumer Product Safety Commission reauthorization bill to the floor of the House of Representatives. But that's the next bill. 
   On this bill, I must say I still have the greatest personal respect for our distinguished chairman, Mr. Dingell, and our subcommittee chairman, Mr. Pallone, but I cannot say anything kind about the product of the legislation that they're bringing to the body today. 
   At the beginning of this Congress, Madam Speaker, our Speaker for the entire full House of Representatives, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi said, ``Bills should generally come to floor under a  procedure that allows open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the Minority the right to offer its alternatives.'' 
   That's not the case with this bill, Madam Speaker. The final product that's before us was given to the minority at about 1:05 this afternoon, which is approximately 3 hours and 5 minutes ago. We did have a committee markup. We did have some process. We did have some hearings in Mr. Pallone's subcommittee. We did have a legislative hearing on the bill, but once that was concluded, the bill disappeared into a sinkhole, only to reemerge today as a suspension bill. 
   As you know, Madam Speaker, suspensions are theoretically about noncontroversial items in which there is little controversy and no disagreement between Members of the body on either side of the aisle. It's not the case on this bill, Madam Speaker. 
   This bill will cost jobs in the agricultural sector. This bill has been so controversial that we, as I said earlier, didn't even get a work product until early this afternoon. 
   On the substance of the bill, I disagree with the central premise, that the Food and Drug Administration should have the authority under this bill that actually certifies that tobacco is a responsible product. Isn't that an ironic thing? This bill is, in my opinion, a marketing allocation bill more than it is a regulation bill. 
   The FDA does not have the resources to do this new responsibility. The FDA is not the tobacco police. The FDA should not be responsible for going into every convenience store and grocery store and tobacco shop in America making sure that the tobacco products are sold exactly as required. 
   I could go on and on. I could quote Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman PALLONE and Chairman Waxman of the Government Reform Committee where in a letter they said back in January about how short the FDA was of resources. I'm not going to do that. I might put it in the Record, but I won't quote them at this time. 
   The FDA has only increased its total number of employees in the last decade by 646. Its appropriations in adjusted dollars is about $300 million less than the inflation-adjusted dollars that the FDA says it needs. Yet we're going to give the FDA another huge responsibility and not give them the resources to do the work that the bill says they should do. 
   If we really need to do more to restrict advertising for tobacco products or to prevent marketing to children, we can do that by going to other agencies that have that responsibility in the marketplace right now. If there should be more enforcement to prevent children from buying cigarettes because they're under age, we should bring a bill to the floor that would strengthen the Synar amendment, a former congressman from Oklahoma and a former member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   We could certainly encourage States to actually use their master settlement agreement funds to do things like the smoking cessation programs. It's ironic to me that less than 30 percent of the funds that have been given to the States under the master settlement agreement are being used for anti-smoking campaigns. That would be one area where I think both sides of the aisle, Republicans and the Democrats, could have bipartisan agreement. 
   In short, Madam Speaker, what we don't need is creating at the FDA a new, Draconian bureaucracy since they're already overburdened and have more work than they know what to do with. 
   I do agree that cigarettes are bad for people's health. I have never smoked a cigarette. I don't allow smoking in my office. I don't take any kind of campaign funds from tobacco companies. So I do practice what I preach, Madam Speaker, but I do not believe that this bill addresses the underlying problem in a satisfactory way. 
   And for that purpose, I will strongly urge a ``no'' vote--again, since this is a suspension bill which on process alone, it shouldn't be but it is--it only takes one-third vote to defeat the bill.     
   That would be the perfect solution to this bill, would be to send it to the boneyard of other suspension bills that shouldn't be on the suspension calendar in the first place.  
   Madam Speaker, it is getting a little tiresome to keep saying here we go again, but here we go again. 
   Once again we come to the House floor to consider a major piece of legislation under suspension of the rules. Traditionally, we suspend the normal rules for things like naming post offices and other noncontroversial bills. For those watching on C-SPAN, suspension of the rules means limited debate and no amendments. We all remember that Speaker PELOSI told us that--and I'm quoting here--``bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives.'' The reality has been different. Promise made, promise unmade. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill is hardly ordinary. Honestly noncontroversial bills do not require committee mark-ups that stretch over multiple days. Noncontroversial bills do not contain billion-dollar tax hikes. Noncontroversial bills do not cause working people to lose their jobs or their farms. In fact, the provisions of the bill were so controversial that the majority could not even produce a bill to be seen in public until this morning because they couldn't agree among themselves about what should be in it. Madam Speaker, handling legislation of this importance in this way is not the open and transparent process that was promised. It is the opposite. 
   Now, on the substance of the bill, I disagree with the central premise of the bill that the Food and Drug Administration should be given this responsibility. The FDA is tasked with protecting the safety of the food we eat, and ensuring the drugs we take, and the medical devices we use are safe and effective. It is an agency that we have held numerous hearings on and have come to a bipartisan conclusion that the agency lacks sufficient resources to do its current mission. Congress affirmed that conclusion when we appropriated an additional $150 million in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for the FDA. Speaker, the FDA is still the wrong agency, at the wrong time, to become the tobacco police. They need to focus on their current mission. 
   Here's what Chairman Dingell, Chairman Pallone and Chairman Waxman said about the current problem in a January 23, 2008 letter to FDA:  
   Experts from every affected sector agree that this desperate funding situation has rendered FDA unable to protect the American public from even the most basic threats, including contaminated food, tainted and dangerous drugs, and faulty medical devices. According to FDA's own Science Board ..... American lives are now at risk.  
   FDA has plenty to do just to save those lives that are at risk. We, the Congress, have passed 125 laws over the last 20 years that directly impact FDA's regulatory responsibilities, yet our appropriated resources to the agency have not kept pace. During the same time period, FDA has only increased its total number of employees by 646 people; and its appropriations are about $300 million less now in inflation-adjusted dollars. We're pretty good at telling FDA what to do and how to do it, but not so good at paying for what we order. And here we go again. Instead of making it possible for FDA to do the jobs we've already given it, we are here today adding new regulatory responsibilities that dwarf any of those given to the FDA in the past two decades. 
   If we need to do more to restrict advertising or prevent marketing to children, we can find the right agency to do that. If there should be more enforcement to prevent children from buying cigarettes, we can strengthen the Synar amendment. The best way to reduce smoking is for States to use more of their Master Settlement Agreement funds on things like smoking cessation products. So let's talk about encouraging States to use more of their MSA funds for this purpose. 
   These are problems we can solve without creating a new, draconian bureaucracy at an already over-burdened agency that Members on both sides of the aisle agree needs to do a much better job at conducting its current mission. 
   Cigarettes are bad for people's health, period. Madam Speaker, if people believe there should be an increased Federal role in tobacco regulation, we can do better than this deceptive process and we can do better than this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and send a message that promises are meant to be kept.  
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I want to point out a couple of things. This bill does not ban tobacco. Most of the rhetoric on the other side has, rightfully so, been about the evils of tobacco. But the bill before us doesn't ban tobacco. In truth, what the bill before us does is allocate market share of the existing marketers of tobacco in the United States. It also sets up a huge regulatory machine at FDA, where the Food and Drug Administration literally has to go into every convenience store apparently in America and make sure that certain displays are at a certain eye level and all this kind of thing. 
   It bans, as I understand it, flavored cigarettes, except for menthol, in which it requires a study of menthol cigarettes to be reported by a date certain, which I think is 1 year. And then, in order to pay for this huge new bureaucracy that has to be created for the tobacco police, it sets up some sort of a gimmick in the Tax Code for people to choose between a thrift savings account and a Roth IRA. If you invest in a Roth IRA, you pay taxes before you put the money in the account. If you decide to invest in a thrift savings account, you don't have to pay taxes until you take the money out of the account. 
   Somehow, and we don't know much about this because we only got the bill with this section about 3 hours ago, there's something in there that they think scores about $2 billion over 10 years because more people will opt to take the Roth IRA, where they pay taxes up front. 
   Last, but not least, Madam Speaker, it sets up some sort of a records inspection for the Secretary of HHS to go in and look at the records to make sure that tobacco products are not smuggled or counterfeited unless those tobacco products are sold on Indian lands, in which case the Indian tribe has the right to opt out of that, which I think is going to set up a huge loophole because my guess is that the Indian tribes, not being foolish, are going to obviously opt out of Federal regulation of this inspection program. 
   In short, this is a bill that, while noble in intent, is very flawed in implementation. It shouldn't be on the suspension calendar. It shouldn't have come up only 3 hours before it's debated. 
   We should vote this bill down. If you really want to do something about tobacco products, let it go through the  regular process. I would urge a ``no'' vote on the pending legislation. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, first let me say how delighted I am to see my good friend Bobby Rush back on the floor. We have missed him, but in his recovery from his situation, he has been a strong conferee. He hasn't known how strong he has been, I am sure, but he has been a stalwart in bringing this conference report to the floor, and we are delighted he is on the floor to taste the fruits of victory, which is well deserved because of his leadership on this issue at the subcommittee and on the conference. 
   Madam Speaker, we have a rare thing before us. We have a conference report that has actually gone through the regular process. I want to commend my good friend, John Dingell of Michigan, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, for his extremely positive leadership on this issue. 
   I want to compliment all of the House conferees: Mr. Waxman, Ms. DeGette, Ms. Schakowsky and Mr. Rush on the majority side, and Mr. Whitfield and Mr. Stearns on the minority side. The House conferees, under Mr. Dingell's leadership, have met numerous times at the principal level and uncounted times at the staff level. 
   The negotiations on this conference have not been easy. They have not been simplistic. They have been tense and hard-fought. On more than one occasion I have felt like getting up and walking away. I hate to admit it, with Mr. Rush being a minister, but I have thought bad thoughts about some of the conferees. But having said that, the end product is worthy of support by everybody. 
   This conference report shows how the House of Representatives should work. We took an issue that is not an easy issue. Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman Rush had a legislative hearing. They had a subcommittee markup. We had a full committee markup. We brought a bill to the floor. We had a motion to recommit. Mr. Dingell then got the House conferees together to make sure that we had a unified House position, and, when we couldn't, he kept bringing us together until we could. As has been pointed out, the leadership of the staffs on both sides have worked together. 
   Under the conference chairman's leadership, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, the conference actually met. The Senate made proposals, the House responded, and vice a versa. The end result is a conference report that I believe every House conferee signed, and, as far as I know, every Senate conferee signed. 
   So that is a rarity, Madam Speaker, but the result is going to be a bill on the suspension calendar which for once deserves to be on the suspension calendar. I fully expect to get the same sort of vote on the conference report that we got on the House bill, and I believe the House bill, that passed something like 407-0 or 407-1, I am hopeful that this bill will pass with that same margin. 
   Now let me talk about what is actually in the bill. This is a strong bill. It gives the Consumer Product Safety Commission added authority to inspect and test children's toys. It creates for the first time a national laboratory that is headed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. It gives States the right to set up independent laboratories in the State or to do third-party testing of products. It sets the toughest lead standards in the world for products that are going to be used by our children. 
   Because of Senator Stevens' leadership in the other body, it bans three-wheel ATVs from the American market. These insidious products are products that have begun to creep back into the market after the lapse of the consent agreement between the industry and the Justice Department that this body helped negotiate when I was a junior Member 15 or 20 years ago. It requires a rulemaking for four-wheel ATVs. 
   On a chemical compound called phthalates, it outlaws three specific phthalates that there is adequate evidence that they might be harmful in children's products. It sets up a science-based study on three other phthalates that gives the CPSC the authority to also outlaw them if the science shows that they should be. But it does also require that there be real science, that we don't ban or outlaw products on no science or bad science. There has to be reputable science that is peer-reviewed. 
   I want to commend Mr. Waxman, who was one of the House conferees. He and I disagreed on a number of issues, but we also agreed that we should try to find compromise. And we did; the bill reflects that. One of the main reasons that we have a conference report is because Chairman Waxman was willing to compromise, and I want to compliment him for doing that. 
   I could go on and on, Madam Speaker, and I will during the course of the debate, but let me simply say that this bill represents the Congress at its best. It represents a tough issue where we used the process, where we gave everybody a voice. Chairman Dingell has been exemplary in allowing the minority to participate and to provide input and ideas. 
   This is not the perfect bill that I would have had if I had been the only conferee. But it is a very, very good bill. It is a strong bill. It will protect America's children, it is worthy of support, and I hope that every Member this body votes in the affirmative for the bill later this afternoon. 
   Madam Speaker, with thanks, I want to reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, as we go through the debate this afternoon, I will mention some of the specifics in the bill. I would like to point out that the bill before us does have Federal preemptions so that there is one Federal standard and there is one agency to enforce that standard with regards to the safety of children's products, and that is the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
   This is important to note, because if we didn't have that, you could have each of the 50 States setting different standards; you could have a conglomeration of rules that would make it very difficult for interstate commerce. So one of the compromises in the bill is that there is Federal preemption, that there is one standard for all the States, and I am very pleased that that is in the bill. 
   I would also like to point out that the pending bill gives the Commission new authority, gives the Commission new resources, increases the number of commissioners from three to five, and, as I have already pointed out, does create a CPSC testing laboratory so that our children's toys will be tested in the laboratory before they are tested by our children on the living room floors of America. 
   I would also like to compliment the staffs on both sides, as has already been done by full committee Chairman Dingell and subcommittee Chairman Rush. But on the Democratic staff, Consuela Washington actually I think served as the key that kept all of the staffs working together, and her patience was just extraordinary. She was even patient with members like me, and I appreciate that tremendously. Judith Bailey, Christian Fjeld, Andrew Woelfling, Valerie Baron all worked very, very hard on the majority side at the staff level. On the minority side, I am very proud of Will Carty, Shannon Weinberg, Brian McCullough, Chad Grant, Jerry Couri, and even our interns, Beth Manzullo, and John Hammond had some input into the work product, and I want to commend them, especially this past weekend where they worked both Saturday and Sunday so this conference report could come to the floor today. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I again want to talk about some of the specifics in the legislation. The bill before us would give the Commission new tools, such as greater authority to expedite recalls; would give the Commission the authority to strengthen reporting requirements to facilitate the identification of the origin of the problems that arise in the supply chain. 
   We also give the Commission expanded authority to better monitor  and regulate the tremendous increase in the number of products that we import from overseas. The Commission, for the first time, has got explicit authority to consult with United States Customs and Border Protection Service to better identify dangerous products before they enter the country. 
   The bill, as I have said earlier, also provides national uniform standards for many children's products, rather than relying on a patchwork of disparate State and local rules. 
   As has been pointed out, the bill before us has the toughest standard on lead, which is basically no lead in children's products as they come into the national market, whether they are manufactured here in the United States or overseas. 
   There is a concern on some part about the implementation for the schedule for manufacturers to comply with this new lead requirement, but I am confident that they have the resources to do so and will do so. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I want to yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope I can get that quote and frame it, that I was right. It is good to know that I have been right about something in this Congress. I will take that home and show it to my family and my children, and maybe they will appreciate me a little bit more. 
   I want to keep going through some of the substance on the conference report, Madam Speaker. I want to talk now, in this little segment, about the chemical compound called phthalates. Phthalates are the product, compound that are used in plastics to make them soft. There has been some evidence in the last several years that, in large quantities, in certain products, if a child were to ingest them, that it could cause problems in the development of that child in their teenage years. The science is uncertain, but there is growing concern. 
   Some States have begun to ban these products. The European Union has banned certain of these phthalates and, as a result, in the other body, the Senate bill had a prohibition based on a California standard on a large number of these particular compounds. I didn't believe then, and I am still uncertain whether it is necessary to specifically ban these compounds because they have been used in products for a large number of years and there is no known instance of any kind of a phthalate poisoning or phthalate deformity in humans. 
   Having said that, when Congresswoman Diana DeGette came to my office unannounced as I was trying to gather support to sustain a veto of what I thought would be a different bill, I did agree to work with Mr. Waxman and Senator Boxer in the other body and come up with a compromise. 
   I must also say that Chairman Dingell was instrumental in that, as he counseled me, in only the way that Chairman Dingell can, about the need for bipartisan compromise. The result is the bill before us where three specific phthalates are banned outright, and another three are temporarily prohibited while we do a comprehensive scientific study. That is the essence of compromise.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 minute. 
   And I do want to give, as I said, in the conference, Congresswoman DeGette should get the Henry Kissinger award for diplomacy because she actually was apparently shuttling between my office, Chairman Dingell's office, Mr. Waxman's office and maybe even Congresswoman Schakowsky's office. That was a tremendous amount of effort on her part, and it does show that when there is trust and bipartisan willingness to cooperate and, as Lyndon Johnson, the great former President and Member of this body once said, ``There is nothing that is not compromisable.'' And certainly, this conference report shows that that is a true statement.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, in previous comments I have thanked the committee staffs. On this occasion, I want to thank some of our friends at the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
   I want to thank Cheri Falvey, who is general counsel; Gib Mullan, who is the director of compliance; Lowell Martin, the deputy general counsel; Quin Dodd, chief of staff to Acting Chairman Nord; Jack Horner, director of congressional relations. They've all worked very hard on this legislation. 
   We also want to thank some of our hearing witnesses: Dr. Marilyn Wind, who is a pharmacologist who testified before the other body; Dr. Michael Babich, a chemist, who testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee. Some of our database presenters were Pat Weddle, who is director of IT services, and DeWayne Ray, deputy CIO. Some of the laboratory people who talked to us about how to detect lead: Dr. Joel Recht. 
   And finally some of the staff, some of the Commission staffers who worked with us on the budget numbers: Mr. Ed Quist, who is the director of financial management of CPSC; and N.J. Scheers, director of planning and budget. 
   Those are some of the staff people in the CPSC and the witnesses who helped us prepare this legislation. We should commend them for their efforts. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I think we've seen in the debate today that when the Congress does decide to work in a cooperative spirit, the end product is a product that's worthy of support by all Members on both sides of the aisle, in most cases regardless of their philosophical affiliation. 
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission is a necessary and vital part of our effort here in the United States to make sure that the products that are sold to the American public are the safest in the world. The emphasis on this bill, in addition to reauthorizing the Consumer Product Safety Commission, has really been to beef up the standards and the enforcement authority and the technical ability of the CPSC for children's toys and children's products. 
   As Congresswoman Schakowsky pointed out, there are some very specific things in this bill that should provide over the years, as it is implemented, the prohibition of some of the unwanted tragedies that we unfortunately have seen in the past, and in her case on the crib issue that she's been so diligent in bringing forward. 
   We increase the number of commissioners; we increase the budget of the commission; we create a new laboratory; we in certain cases ban certain products, specifically three-wheel ATVs that are coming into the country; we require a study on four-wheel ATVs. As we have said on numerous occasions, for the first time we prohibit certain phthalates from being used in children's products, and we require a science-based study on three other phthalates. We have the toughest standard for lead in the world today. 
   By any definition, this is a strong bill. It is a pro-consumer bill. But yet it is also a bill that will allow the manufacturers of children's products to have the ability to manufacture in a safe way and to market in a safe way these products to the American public. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, I want to say something about the distinguished chairman of the committee, Chairman Dingell. I am not a person who normally initially is willing to compromise. I don't think if you ask a Member of this body who's been in it very long who knows me does JOE BARTON change his mind very often, I think the answer you would get is ``not frequently.'' But it became apparent as we went to conference with the Senate that compromise was going to be a necessity. 
   On the issue of phthalates, being a registered professional engineer, I was not a believer that we should automatically ban the number of phthalates that the other body's bill did and I was not somebody who was really seriously interested in finding a compromise. My position was the House position, which was we don't do single products. We should leave that up--if the science shows it should be banned later on, so be it. 
   Chairman Dingell came to me and said, ``You're going to have to take another look at that.'' And I said, ``Mr. Chairman, I don't want to. I don't think we need to take another look at it.'' 
   And he said, ``JOE, I really hope that you will find it in your heart to really study this phthalate issue.'' And because of my respect for JOHN DINGELL, I promised him that I would do that.     
   And I spent the next week, both at the staff level and in phone conversations, with the leading scientists in the United States that actually manufacture and distribute the product, studying that issue. 
   And as a consequence of that, since I am an engineer, if the facts say something, you've got to look at the facts. And I was convinced, based on those conversations from the staff on the minority side and some of the scientists that there was some doubt and there was some reason on certain of the phthalates, that there should be a prohibition. 
   And we put forward a proposal from the minority side to Chairman Dingell. He massaged it. He put forward a position as a conference. It was not accepted, but it was a starting point for negotiations, and Congresswoman DeGette got into the discussion. She went to Mr. Waxman. Mr. Waxman went to the other body, to Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein, and the result is we actually have a conference report that is a good compromise. 
   So I want to commend all of those, but I especially want to commend JOHN DINGELL because he is the dean of the House. He has served in this body over half a century, and if he had not had the wisdom and the leadership to say that you had to try to find a compromise, we wouldn't be here. We would, on my side, be rallying support to sustain a Presidential veto, and on the majority side, be trying to make sure that this got the two-thirds vote. 
   So, Madam Speaker and Members of the body, I have the utmost admiration for Chairman Dingell, and I have the utmost respect for the institution, of the process of the House of Representatives, and that shows in this bill. 
   Vote for the conference report. 
   I yield back my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, most of us are too young to remember, but in the early days of the movies there was a series of movies based on the ``Perils of Pauline.'' Pauline was a heroine who always got tied to the railroad track, and just as the train was bearing down on her the hero would come out and rescue her for another adventure in the next movie reel. 
   Well, this bill before us has kind of experienced the Perils of Pauline. It started out in a tremendous positive bipartisan spirit here in the House. Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman Pallone on the majority and Mr. Deal and myself on the minority side and our colleagues in the rank-and-file worked together. We reported a bill, and I don't remember how many votes it got on the House floor, but I believe it was over 400. It got over to the other body, and they modified it in some ways that were somewhat different than the House bill. The negotiations broke down, and it looked for a while this week that the Food and Drug Administration was going to have to send out reduction in force notices to over 2,000 employees at the Food and Drug Administration. But thanks to the tremendous leadership of Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman Pallone and the help of people like Congressman Waxman and others on the majority side, we've been able to come back together and create a unified House position and work with our friends in the other body. And they've accepted the compromise that's before us to say that here, at 3 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, we're going to rescue Pauline and pass the PDUFA, I hope by unanimous consent on the suspension calendar, the PDUFA reauthorization bill, and lots of good things are going to happen. 
   I am honored to be the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, along with Subcommittee  Ranking Member Deal, who has worked with the majority to put this compromise together. 
   I want to stress the sensitivity of completing the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Program and the Medical Device User Fee Program right now. As I said earlier, if we were not to have done that by the end of this week, over 2,000 employees at the FDA would probably have received a reduction in force notice sometime next week or the week after. These are dedicated experts who are responsible for reviewing and approving new drugs, biologics and medical devices. If we were to lose those individuals, we would probably never get them back. That would have severe negative repercussions for everybody in this country. 
   The legislation before us will promote advancement in pediatric therapies both for pharmaceuticals and for medical devices. The Pediatric Rule and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act have helped to fill a void in pediatric medicine. Prior to these acts, many children were not getting the best treatment because the information was simply not available to determine how a drug would act on them. Drugs do perform differently in different patients, which is especially true when that patient is a child. These acts have begun to provide physicians the information they need to make the best decisions for their pediatric patients. These two acts work together to ensure that accurate, timely pediatric use information is developed to ensure the best medical outcomes for the Nation's children. 
   The bill preserves the 6-month incentive that companies receive to do additional testing in pediatric populations. I want to emphasize that. The bill before us preserves the 6-month pediatric exclusivity provision in current law, and I think that's a real accomplishment. Chairman Dingell should be commended for his leadership on that effort. I was glad to support him in that insistence on that particular provision. I would also like to thank Congresswoman Anna Eshoo for her work on that provision. 
   Finally, the legislation addresses the issue of drug safety. No drug is completely safe. All drugs have some risk. The goal of the Food and Drug Administration is to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh any potential risks and ensure that patients have access to life-saving and life-improving medications. 
   The legislation before us today strives to ensure that the FDA has the authority to monitor drugs to ensure that the balance between the benefit and the risk remains in equilibrium. The FDA will now have the authority to require that drug sponsors conduct postmarket clinical trials. The FDA will now have the authority to require that a drug make a label change. The FDA will also now have the authority to impose additional requirements on a drug in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy when it is needed to ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh its risk. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a bipartisan compromise that does strengthen the FDA, it will improve children's health, and it will reauthorize programs that are essential to ensuring that patients have timely access to drugs and medical devices. 
   Before I reserve the balance of my time, I again want to thank Chairman Dingell, Subcommittee Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Deal, and all the rank-and-file members. I also want to especially thank Ryan Long on the minority staff, the gentleman that is sitting to my left. He stayed up all last night working on these final nuances. I shouldn't say this, but I'm told that he has the same clothes on today that he had on yesterday because he has worked so hard on this bill. We do want to give him special commendation. And I would urge that he take the appropriate hygienic provisions as soon as possible. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I respectfully disagree with our distinguished majority leader. The bill before us is a change. It may be historic, but it is not positive. We are moving from a market-based energy policy, which has served this country well for over 150 years, to a government-mandated energy policy.     
   We are mandating 36 billion gallons of biofuels which don't exist and probably won't exist. We are mandating that 15 percent of all investor-owned utilities be generated by renewable means, where in some States that is physically impossible. We are mandating that we improve automobile fuel economy to 35 miles per gallon by a date certain, which, if that is technically feasible, it is going to be very expensive and probably raise the average price of an automobile several thousands of dollars. 
   We are mandating all of these things in the interests of energy security, which is a noble goal. I think we would be better off developing the domestic resources of our great land, just like it says up there in the quote from Daniel Webster, instead of engaging in government mandates which will raise costs and probably not increase supplies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have before us a bill that has not gone through the regular process in the House of Representatives. That almost goes without saying. This is not a conference report. It is the result of some negotiations primarily between select Members of the majority here in the House and the majority in the Senate. It does put this Nation on a different path. It puts us  on a path of moving away from market-based, free capital energy production to government mandates. Now, that may be what the majority of the House of Representatives wants to do, but I don't think it is what the American people want to do. 
   We have a 36 billion biofuels mandate with submandates for separate categories of biofuels that under current technology simply doesn't exist, can't be met. We already have an ethanol mandate from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that has exceeded its wildest expectation in terms of spurring incentives for ethanol. In fact, it's been so successful, the price of corn has doubled and cattle producers and chicken producers, hog farmers are having trouble buying feed for their animals because of the increase in the price of corn. 
   We have a mandate in this bill for Federal energy efficiency building code standards with the goal by a date certain of having most buildings in the United States on a net basis not using any energy at all. There doesn't appear to be a cost-effective benefit analysis requirement in that particular mandate. 
   As I have already said, we have the mandate to increase fuel efficiency for our cars and trucks to 35 miles a gallon by the year 2020. It does maintain a separate standard for trucks and cars. We need to thank Chairman Dingell for making that happen in negotiations with the Senate. But this mandate is technically possible to meet. Keep in mind that under current regulations there are only eight cars and trucks in the United States that meet 35 miles to the gallon. We are certainly going to raise the price of cars and trucks and probably reduce the amount of jobs in this country that are effective in the automobile assembly and manufacture and their vendor components industry. We have appliance standards. 
   I could go on and on, Mr. Speaker. Suffice it to say I don't think the country wants the government controlling energy, and that's what this bill leads us to. I hope we would vote against it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in the interest of comity, the Republican whip is not on the floor, so I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the renewable portfolio standard that is in the bill. This would require investor-owned utilities in the country to generate 15 percent of their electricity by renewable means by a date certain. And there was a phase-in so that beginning, I believe, in 2010 or 2011 there is a cascade stair step that each year they have to meet a higher percentage. Information that we have received from the Department of Energy indicates that of the 50 States, there are only seven that currently meet that requirement. Those are Alaska, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington, Vermont, and California. There is another handful of States that come close: North Dakota, New Hampshire, Wyoming, New Mexico, Idaho, South Dakota, Alabama, and Iowa all meet within 10 percent to 8 percent. The rest of the States, which is approximately 40 States, don't even come close, and some of them, like Delaware and Missouri, are at 0 percent. 
   So you would think that a 15 percent requirement might be doable. The problem is definitional, what is defined as ``renewable.'' New hydro is not defined as renewable. New nuclear is not defined as renewable. New clean coal technology is not defined as a renewable. So it has to be from geothermal, wind power, solar power, or biomass or hydro refitting. Now, when you look at it in that regard, this 15 percent requirement in certain parts of the country is almost impossible to meet. 
   To compound the problem, the legislation before us says that States that don't meet the requirement can't go out; they can only buy credits to offset that requirement. I believe it says up to 27 percent of their amount that they have to meet. So you are going to put a State like Florida, a State like Georgia, some of the States that are at the lower end of the curve, Arizona, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Illinois, Utah, Maryland, New Jersey, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, these States are all somewhere between 0 to 2 percent. They're simply not going to be able to do it. They are not going to be able to do it. 
   So while a renewable portfolio standard for electricity generation might seem like it's a wise idea in principle, when you put it into actuality, it is going to be almost an impossible idea to meet. And this bill says ``tough.'' So I would hope that we vote ``no'' on the bill.  
   Since January the process for energy legislation has been a disgrace. H.R. 6 was never considered by any Committees, no hearings no mark-ups. H.R. 3221, a second try at an energy bill, was also bad. Only hours notice of the bill before mark-up; limited floor amendments; many bad provisions never considered in hearings; final passage on a Saturday with many members absent. 
   The process since then has been far worse. I am aware of no Member discussions since August 4. If they have taken place no Member on my side of the aisle was invited or informed. The result: the terrible legislation before us today. 
   The Pelosi ``energy bill'' consciously raises consumer costs for fuel, vehicles, and electricity while reducing consumer choices. It favors a few special interest investors at the expense of ordinary Americans and the U.S. economy. 
   On CAFE: The bill raises fuel efficiency standards so high that consumers will face only three possible consequences: far smaller cars and trucks, far more expensive cars and trucks, or--more likely--both. 
   I'm told that all but 8 out of some 350 models currently available in American showrooms would be banned from the market as the new fuel standards fully phase in. Moderate income consumers will be hardest hit. They don't buy hybrids today because the multi-thousand dollar premium for electric hybrid technology cannot pay for itself in fuel savings, even at today's sky-high fuel costs. 
   Because consumers will prefer their older vehicles that match their needs better than the  new car inventory, they will postpone trading in as long as possible. New car sales will plummet; manufacturing companies and their employees will suffer. The ones who won't agree are simply in denial. 
   On renewable fuel mandates: The levels of corn-based and other biofuels required to be part of the U.S. fuel mix will drive up all fuel costs dramatically, even over today's high prices. Diverting corn from food and feed use to fuel has already cost consumers plenty in rising chicken, turkey, beef, and soft drink prices. This bill will only make that problem worse. 
   It also mandates advanced biofuels that exist today only in laboratories and which may never be commercially available. It's like passing a law mandating that a horse not even born yet grow up to win the Kentucky Derby. The only way to do that is to bar other horses from the competition, as this bill does. 
   On the Renewable Electricity Mandate: The bill would require electric companies across the United States (except in Hawaii and Alaska--they have special carve-outs) to generate 15 percent of their power from ``renewable energy.'' 
   States that have the natural renewable resource base needed to meet such mandates already have them under state law. Remaining States that cannot meet the standard will have to buy their way out at consumer expense, as the bill provides. 
   While the bill has some non-controversial energy efficiency provisions some sections are particularly harmful to consumers and small businesses. 
   A section on regional standards for HVAC equipment would authorize DOE to create a program that could lead to penalties and lawsuits aimed at the small businesses in every Congressional district that install and repair our air conditioners and heat pumps. 
   The punishment would likely kick in if the repairman installs, the wrong air conditioner, e.g., a Georgia-rated air conditioner on the wrong side of the Florida state line. It would dictate efficiency levels by state or region without regard to price, size, or even energy savings payback. 
   Another provision gives DOE authority to dictate energy efficiency standards for manufactured housing. HUD already has a successful program that is improving efficiency while keeping manufactured housing affordable. 
   DOE's ``price-is-no-object'' track record on energy efficiency could mean that manufactured housing will no longer be affordable for the moderate income Americans who rely on it today. And jobs will be lost. 
   Bad as the bill was that passed the House on August 4, this one is far worse. Vote ``no'', do not be tempted.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished member of the Rules Committee for yielding to me. 
   I have, in the 23 years that I have been in this body, engaged in, I would say, approximately two dozen, maybe three dozen, debates on various energy bills. Almost every Congress we have some sort of energy bill that comes before this body. 
   I have to say that my heart is sad today because, in the debate so far in this Congress on energy legislation, it has been fairly one-sided. It has been the majority trying to put their blueprint for America on energy in the committee and on the floor and in the Rules Committee with really no input and no debate from the minority party. 
   I understand that the majority in the House has the right to work its will. We are not the other body, the Senate on the other side of the Capitol. We have a Rules Committee that is two to one plus one. We stack the deck so that the majority can make things happen. And that's a good thing. 
   But the majority has responsibilities. One of the responsibilities is to hear the minority and give the minority the opportunity to have input and to have a debate and have their ideas voted on. 
   In this Congress on energy legislation, the only Republican amendment that has been debated on the floor of the House is the motion to recommit. In the last energy bill, we were given a motion to recommit and we offered a full substitute that had clean coal technology, alternative fuels technology, that had some real energy, had some supply incentives. That motion to recommit was defeated, but at least it was debated. The rule before us today does not give the minority an option to have a motion to recommit. The rule before us today does not give the minority an option to have a substitute amendment. 
   Once again we are on the floor of the House with one of the major components of our economy, energy legislation, and it is the majority way or no way. Well, I hope we would vote this rule down and go back to the Rules Committee and let us have either a Republican substitute, a Republican motion to recommit, some amendments, the Shimkus amendment on alternative fuels, the Upton amendment on renewable portfolio standards. They were all offered in the Rules Committee last night. They are substantive and real. They would improve the bill if they were allowed to be made in order. But this rule once again is a closed rule with one amendment, a Democrat substitute, no motion to recommit. 
   The underlying bill is over a thousand pages. The underlying bill had not been seen in public until about 8:30 last evening. Obviously you can't digest a thousand-page bill overnight. I have been reading the table of contents trying to look at some summaries what is in the bill. Most is recycled. It is  things that have been here before, but there are some new things. 
   There is some provision for the State of New York, for example, in the tax title that diverts State income taxes that would normally be paid to the Federal Government, they are kept by either the State or the City of New York, and it is worth about $2 billion. There has been no debate on that.     
   Now, I've got to give Chairman Rangel, I would assume I would give him credit for easing the tax burden of the people of his city and the people of his State. But there's not been a public debate on that. That's just a little $2 billion deal in the tax title of the bill. It may have showed up, it may have been there all along, but I just saw it reading through the summary about 10 minutes ago. 
   So I don't think, if you're going to have a major policy debate on energy, which is worthwhile, and if the majority wants to change the energy policy, that's worthwhile too. But there ought to be a real debate and there ought to be real amendments, and we ought to let this body vote. This rule doesn't do that. This rule doesn't do that. 
   And most of the things that are being extolled in the bill are things that were in the energy policy act 2 years ago. They're being extended. They're being expanded. That may or may not be a good thing, but we ought to have a debate about it. 
   Do we really want to put a 36-billion gallon mandate for renewable fuels that can't be met by the current technology on the backs of the American people? This bill does that. 
   I'm all for renewable fuels. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 had an $8-billion gallon mandate for renewable fuels. The market is exceeding that. But it's a stretch to go from 8 billion, which is current law, to 36 billion. And the technology doesn't currently exist. So maybe we ought to have a debate, maybe we ought to have some off-ramps, some triggers that we set the goal, but make sure that we have the ability to meet that goal before we put that mandate in. 
   On the renewable portfolio standard for electricity generators, it only applies to investor owned; doesn't apply to nonprofits and to co-ops. I don't think that's a good idea. It doesn't allow all forms of renewable. For example, new hydro is not included as a renewable. You know, some sort of a clean coal alternative which would be an alternative form is not included. It's very restrictive. 
   The wind part of this bill, we're for wind power. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded the tax credit for wind. This bill rescinds part of that. So there's a renewable form that they're being regressive. 
   So just in summary, I would hope that the majority understands that being in the majority gives you the right to set the agenda, but it shouldn't give you the right to stifle debate so that the minority has absolutely no input. And in this bill that's before us today, the minority in the House of Representatives has had zero, nada, zip, no input; and that's not good for democracy. 
   So I hope that we'll defeat the rule, take it back to the Rules Committee, let's have a debate. Let's have some amendments made in order and then bring a real energy bill that's bipartisan back to the floor of the House of Representatives.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (DRILL RESPONSIBLY IN LEASED LANDS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6515. The bill was introduced yesterday. It is on the floor today. That is pretty fast work. No hearings, no committee process. It is primarily a restatement of existing Federal law with a couple of exceptions. It does have a prohibition of any oil that is found in Alaska going anywhere but the lower 48. Chairman Rahall and I had a little debate about that on the House floor earlier this week. I certainly don't have any opposition. It is somewhat meaningless because oil is fungible and it can go wherever it needs to go; but if that is the price we have to pay to get more oil drilled and produced in Alaska, I am actually for that section of the bill. 
   Having said that, this bill is counterproductive if we really want to find new oil and gas because it doesn't open up any new areas.     
   If you only allow drilling where we have already been allowed to drill, for example, in the great State of Texas that I represent, we have drilled over 2 million oil wells since 1901. The probability of finding a major new oil field in Texas today is much closer to zero than it is to 100 percent, because we have already drilled so many wells. 
   Eighty-five percent of the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States of America is off-limits. This bill does nothing about that. It says, let's expedite leasing in the Alaska Naval Petroleum Reserve. Fine, but we can already drill for oil in the Alaska Naval Petroleum Reserve. 
   What about ANWR? ANPR is to the west of Prudhoe Bay. ANWR is to the east. We think there are 10 billion barrels of oil in a 2,000-acre section of ANWR, 10 billion barrels. Drill 10 wells, and you get 1 billion barrels a well. 
   If we drill on an expedited basis in ANPR, certainly there is oil to be found there, but we can already drill there, and it won't get 1 billion barrels per well. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday evening, at Nationals Stadium, we had the 47th Annual Congressional Baseball Game. The true winners of the game were the Washington Literacy Council and the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Washington, D.C. area. 
   In terms of the score on the field, in the most thrilling game that I have been associated with in the last 21 years that I have played, coached or managed, in the bottom of the seventh with the bases loaded and one out and the Democrats leading 10-9, Connie Mack hit a dart back to the pitcher, Mr. Baca, who threw home for a force out making two outs. And then unfortunately for my friends on the Democratic side, the catcher overthrew the first baseman allowing two runs to score, the winning run by the speedy Adam Putnam of Florida for a thrilling 11-10 victory. Our MVP on the Republican side was Kevin Brady of The Woodlands, Texas. 
   The class of 1996, which includes Kevin Brady, MVP; Kenny Hulshof, who was our first baseman, Chip Pickering; the third baseman; Jeff Flake, center fielder; Virgil Goode, right fielder; Tom Davis, one of our tricaptains; Pete Sessions, our third-base coach; and Sam Graves who was a pinch runner and hitter, those players in the 12 years that they have played in the game have an 11-1 record, which I think is amazing. 
   I want to thank Speaker  Nancy Pelosi for attending the game, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer for attending the game, and I want to thank my good friend, Mike Doyle, for his excellent job of managing. It can truly be said that this year, the Democrats had victory in their grasp and took pity on us and allowed us to win one more time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have spent most of today actually trying to read the bill. I have the bill in front of me. In this 2-minute period, I want to discuss section 605 of the bill. Section 605 of the bill has the title: ``No Federal funding for illegal aliens.'' It is a very brief section, two lines: ``Nothing in this act allows Federal payment for individuals who are not legal residents.'' That is it. 
   So the title of section 605 would have you believe there's going to be no Federal funding for illegal aliens. When you specifically read the section, it just says nothing in the act allows payment. It doesn't prohibit it. 
   Now, if the authors of section 605 really don't want illegal aliens to receive funding under this bill, this section ought to read something like this: ``This act prohibits Federal payments for individuals who are not legal residents or citizens.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask unanimous consent to substitute the language that I just read: ``This act prohibits Federal payments for individuals who are not legal residents or citizens.''

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, since we have not had a markup and since we have not had a legislative hearing, and I know it is cumbersome to actually refer to specific sections of the bill on the floor, especially of what is portrayed to be a conference report, which this is not, which is not amendable, but I want to go back and talk about this eligibility. 
   There is a section in the bill, section 203: ``State option to rely on findings from an express lane agency to conduct simplified eligibility determinations.'' On the face of it, that would seem to be a good thing. This section is very complicated. It is 10 to 15 pages long. 
   But it does say in this section that a parent of a child that might be eligible can self-verify. If you are approached by one of these express lane agencies, it is up to the parent of the child to self-determine, to self-certify that they are indeed eligible. That would appear to be something that we need to work on. 
   Then it goes on when it defines the actual express lane agencies on page 123 of the bill, in subparagraph (F), it goes through and lists the kind of public agencies that are express lane agencies. They apparently include Medicare part D, Medicaid, Food Stamp Act, Head Start Act, National School Lunch Act, Child Nutrition Act, Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, United States Housing Act, Native American Housing Assistance Act, and so on and so on. 
   Again on the face of it, those are all agencies that might be of some assistance, but I doubt that their requirements are the same as the requirements for the base bill for SCHIP in  terms of income eligibility and age determination. For example, I doubt that the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act has an age requirement at all. 
   So again, when the President vetoes this bill and we are back working together on a bipartisan basis, these are the kinds of things I hope to clarify and tighten up.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. And since I really have a real minute and a half, I'm going to try to go through this as quickly as possible. 
   Republicans want to reauthorize the SCHIP program. We do want to refocus it on the original intent of the program, which was near-low-income children in families between 100 and 200 percent of poverty. We understand that  in the 10 years of the program's existence that waivers have been given and there are some States that cover up to 350 percent of poverty, and some States cover adults. 
   But as our distinguished Speaker just said, Republicans are for the children, and we want to focus the SCHIP funds on those children and those families that don't have private insurance and aren't covered by Medicaid; and we believe that that is children in families somewhere between 100 percent of poverty and 200 percent of poverty. 
   And when the President rightfully vetoes this bill, and when the House of Representatives rightfully sustains the President's veto, it is my hope that we will get with the other body and the Democratic leadership at the leadership level and Chairman Dingell and Chairman Rangel, and we will work out a bipartisan compromise that does cover the health care needs of the needy children of America that currently, in spite of our best efforts, do not have the health insurance and the health coverage that they need. 
   To make that possible, we have to defeat this bill, or at least get enough votes to sustain the President's veto of this bill, and then work together in the near future to do some of the things that we have talked about on the floor this evening. 
   Vote ``no'' on the SCHIP bill this evening.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, here we are again. 
   Once again, we are being forced by the Democratic Leadership of the House to vote on a bill of vital importance to millions of our constituents without the ability to actually analyze its contents. 
   Once again, Mr. Speaker, we are being forced by the Democratic Leadership to vote less than 24 hours after they introduced a bill that is hundreds of pages long and spends hundreds of billions of the taxpayers' dollars. 
   Once again, Mr. Speaker, we are being forced to vote on a bill that was concocted in secret and unveiled in the middle of the night. 
   When this sort of thing happens, everybody wonders what the Majority is trying to hide, and why they need to hide anything. 
   I truly hope that the Democratic Leadership does not expect me to vote in favor of a 299-page bill that Republicans saw for the first time at 6:36 p.m. yesterday evening. I believe in faith, but not in blind faith. 
   I challenge the supporters of this bill to come to the floor of this House, look people in the eye, and say that they understand all of the provisions that are actually in this bill. Because I have some questions for you. 
   Mr. Speaker, it would be a compliment to say that the so-called process which produced this bill is an abuse of our democratic system of government. It was so much worse than garden-variety abuse. It was a travesty and an abomination, and it was pathetic. Yet, I'm sure that some will show up here with a handful of talking points from the staff who actually wrote this legislation, and explain to us that it is not a pathetic abomination, but a wondrous triumph of bipartisanship. 
   I challenge any Member that would claim that this bill is bipartisan to give me the name of one Republican in the entire House of Representatives who directly participated in these discussions. Name just one. 
   I know that the authors of this bill certainly did not consult with either Mr. DEAL or myself; I know that they have not included any Members of the Republican Leadership in the House; and I'm not aware of a single Republican Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee or the Ways and Means Committee being invited to participate in this process. 
   Now we have not had time to analyze this product that the Democrats are going to bring to the floor today but the Congressional Budget Office has. Yesterday at the Rules Committee, it was stated that this bill would put 4.4 million new people on to SCHIP. However, according to the CBO close to a million of those children were already enrolled in Medicaid and over 1.5 million of those newly enrolled in SCHIP were already enrolled in private coverage. 
   It was also stated last night at the Rules Committee that this bill does not expand eligibility under SCHIP. If that is the case then why does the CBO estimate 1.2 million of the newly enrolled people in SCHIP come from expanding the populations that are eligible for the program? Now those comments last night could have been misstatements because people just really do not know what is in this bill. It is difficult to know what is in a bill that no one has seen. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wonder if someone can explain to me why the Democratic Leadership has decided to wait until just days before SCHIP expires to bring their reauthorization to the House floor. We have known for well over 10 years that the current SCHIP authorization would expire on September 30, 2007, and the Democratic Leadership in the House and the Senate have known since early November that they would be in charge of actually producing a bill to reauthorize this vital health care program for low-income, uninsured children. Yet, here they are, a full 10 months later, jamming a bill through the House with fewer than three legislative days before the entire program expires and children's health care stops. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, I was not sent here by the 6th District of Texas to be quiet and do what the gentle lady from San Francisco instructs me to do. I was sent here to represent my constituents' best interests and I demand the ability to do what I have sworn to do. 
   We all know that the President has promised to veto this version of the bill, so why are we wasting precious time on a bill that we all know doesn't stand a chance of ever becoming law? 
   While we are down here on the floor participating in this Theatre of the Absurd, the  Democratic Leadership is in the back rooms trying to figure how they will extend the SCHIP program for another 6 months or a year. We all know this to be a fact, but I guess the Democrats want to pick a fight with the president so they can pretend that he is against children, and only then will they permit everybody to do the right thing and extend SCHIP. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm sorry it's come to this. The pettiness of this transparent political strategy to damage and weaken the president is a new low. I regret that the state of political strategy has come to this. 
   I'd hoped that we would not engage in this game, and it's still not too late to stop it. We could start debating how to best extend the SCHIP program so that we can actually do the job people sent us here to do. We still have a chance to write a responsible, long-term reauthorization of the SCHIP program. Now, it's true that writing a solid, bipartisan bill will not give the president a black eye, but that's the price that Democrats will have to pay. Given that millions of needy children are depending on us, it doesn't seem like a big price.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am going to speak extemporaneously since my prepared remarks are in the Record. I remind the body that the Democratic majority took over the House and the Senate in January of this year. They set the schedule. They set the agenda. They decide what hearings are held. They decide what bills are marked up. They decide which issues come to the floor of both bodies. Not the Republicans. 
   It is insulting to sit here and be told that somehow when the same party, of which I am not a member, controls the agenda in both legislative bodies of this great Congress that somehow the Republicans are responsible for this late effort to reauthorize SCHIP. 
   I told the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee the day after the election last November, Mr. Dingell of Michigan, that I was looking forward to working with him on SCHIP reauthorization, and while I don't know it as a fact, I am fairly certain that Mr. McCrery had a similar conversation with the distinguished chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel of New York. 
   Now, how much bipartisan cooperation have we had in the House of Representatives? The answer is almost none. It is my understanding that Mr. Rangel and Mr. McCrery did talk some in their committee, but in the Energy and Commerce Committee we held a number of generic hearings. We never held a hearing specifically on SCHIP. We never held a legislative markup in subcommittee. We never held a legislative hearing or markup in full committee. We got a 565-page bill the night before the scheduled markup, and it was take it or leave it. Well, we left it. And that bill passed the House, but barely. 
   What has happened since that bill passed? There have been discussions in the Senate between the Republicans and the Democrats apparently, and the House Democratic leadership have participated. But the House Republicans have not been allowed to participate. So what is the result of that? The result of that is a 300-page bill that the House Republicans saw at about 6:14 last evening and a Rules Committee in which it was voted to not give a Republican substitute, not give a Republican amendment, not even give a Republican motion to recommit. 
   So we are going to have twice now a major bill in which there is bipartisan support for is going to come to the House of Representatives with no Republican input, not even a motion to recommit. 
   Now, I don't know how many times the Republicans did that to the Democrats in the last several Congresses when we were in the majority, but I bet I could count them on the fingers of one hand, and I might be able to count them on the fingers of one finger. 
   Don't you think the American people deserve at least a substitute or a motion to recommit? Now, we are going to be given a chance later this evening to have 1 hour of debate, 1 hour of debate, and then an up-or-down vote, and we are going to get enough votes to sustain the President's veto, and maybe next week Mr. Dingell and Mr. Rangel and Ms. Pelosi will contact Mr. Boehner, Mr. Barton, and Mr. McCrery, and we may yet get this bipartisan agreement. We may get it next week, and I hope we do. But I don't want the American people to be under any illusion. The bill that's coming before the floor tonight is a backroom deal that the most that can be said for it is that it does have money in it for the children of America, which we support. And there are lots of reforms that we probably support, too, if we are ever given the chance to have that discussion. 
   I would hope we would vote ``no'' on this rule, take it back to the Rules Committee, at least make a substitute or a motion to recommit in order, and put back in the rule in terms of earmarks. There are at least two earmarks that we know in the bill that nobody has talked about. 
   One of the earmarks is from the great State of Michigan, $1.2 billion over 10 years. It's just a gift of $1.2 billion for their FMAP program. And if that's not an earmark, I don't know what is. And under the Democratic leadership's own rule in this Congress, that should have at least been disclosed. And last night at the Rules Committee, they said there were no earmarks in the bill. And I believe when Ms. Slaughter, the distinguished chairman, said that, she believed it. I don't think she knew it was in the bill. But it is. That at least ought to be corrected. 
   Vote ``no'' on the rule and send it back to the committee.  
   Mr. Speaker, this rule is an apt reflection of the underlying SCRIP legislation. Like the bill, it tramples democracy in a feckless commitment to bad politics over good policy. The House Democratic leadership wants to embarrass and weaken the President, and that goal is more important to them than extending health care to needy children. 
   So we're being instructed--not even asked--to swallow a multi-billion-dollar bill without having a legislative hearing at any level, without having a subcommittee markup and without having a conference. We're each supposed to analyze and comprehend a 299-page enigma that was unveiled last night. There'll be no amendments, of course, and no motion to recommit. This is getting to be a bad habit, isn't it? 
   Each of us represents several hundred thousand people, and most of them come from families that work hard and pay taxes. They do their part, and we should, too. But we can't do much more than voting object when we are not even able to know what's in the bills we're voting on. 
   Most of what we know about this SCHIP bill is what we hear in the halls and see in the newspapers. For some, that's enough because the harder we listen and the more we look, the more we discover that is troubling. What on earth is the $1.2 billion earmark for Michigan all about, anyway? And how many more like it are tucked away in this bill? 
   We cannot actually know most of what's in this bill, but we can suspect much. We can certainly suspect the State Children's Health Insurance Program grew from a fraction of the House SCHIP bill to become an entire pretend conference report. All we know for sure is that we're being asked to pass another major  piece of legislation based on blind faith and guesswork. 
   I wonder why we can't do now what we're surely going to do later--pass a simple extension of the SCRIP program and then have the honest public debate about policy changes that should have occurred over the last 10 months. Mr. DEAL and I propose to extend the authorization of SCRIP for an additional 18 months, and more than a hundred of our colleagues have agreed. There are no gimmicks, no budget trickery, no politics and no changes. 
   But the majority will want their pound of the President's flesh first. Everybody gets that, and maybe it won't work so well as they hope because, after all, everybody gets it. This rule and this legislation aren't about children or health. They are about a cynical exercise of raw power for the sake of a fleeting political advantage. 
   I wish the Democrats wouldn't do it this way, but I'm under no illusion that wishin' or hopin' will change the speaker's mind. I look forward to the President's inevitable veto because it will give us a chance to have a real discussion and write a transparent bill instead of foisting this mystery package on the taxpayers and the needy children of America. 
   We can work together and do this right, and I believe that eventually, we will. The best first step would be to reject this pathetic rule and start working on real legislation now instead of later.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (MEDICARE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in 1965 the hot car on the American market was a Ford Mustang, which cost less than $2,000. The President of the United States was Lyndon Johnson. The entire Federal budget was less than $100 billion. The war that was on the front pages was the war in south Vietnam. The Super Bowl didn't exist. Cell phones didn't exist. If you wanted to use a computer, you typed out your program on data index cards and submitted them in a batch to a mainframe computer. I believe the dominant mainframe was an IBM 360. Gasoline cost approximately 25 cents a gallon, and a little-noticed program was put into effect to help our senior citizens with their health care costs called Medicare. 
   Forty-three years later, that Medicare program is going to expend over $400 billion to provide health care for over 45 million senior citizens in every State and territory of the United States. If something is not changed between now and the year 2018, in the year 2018, or 2019, the Medicare Trust Fund is going to be bankrupt. 
   If we look back in 1965 at how health care was provided and look at how it's provided in 2008, you would see numerous differences. We now focus, in Medicare, through the Medicare Advantage programs, which 20 percent of our seniors have chosen, on preventive care. A lot of Medicare spending today is through drug therapy, as opposed to surgery, things of this sort. 
   But the one thing that's constant has been the continuing escalation in cost. Medicare has averaged double digit increases in cost the last 10 years, and it's expected, by the year 2018, to be over $800 billion. 
   Medicare spending this year of over $400 billion is going to exceed by a factor of 4 the entire Federal budget back in 1965, the year that was created. 
   So because of the increase in the population, the increase in the complexity, the diversity of health care therapies, several years ago the Congress put into place what's called the Medicare trigger. The Medicare trigger says that in any year that Medicare spending or Medicare revenues come from 45 percent or more of the general revenue, i.e., the premiums that Medicare beneficiaries and the cost share that companies and Medicare payors pay into the system, when more than 45 percent of the funds going into Medicare come from the general U.S. Treasury, the Medicare trustees have to issue to the Congress a report. And if this happens 2 years in a row, the President of the United States has to submit a proposal to the Congress on how to bring spending back below the 45 percent trigger. That happened for the first time last year, in fiscal year 2006, and it's happened again this year, in the fiscal year that just ended, fiscal year 2007. 
   So several weeks ago the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services presented to this Congress a report that did two things: Number 1, it did announce that the spending had exceeded 45 percent of the revenues of the general treasury, and Number 2, it put forward an outline of the proposal on how to bring that spending back below the 45 percent trigger.     
   The Congress does not have to act on the President's proposal. The Congress can initiate one of its own. In fact, if 70 Members of this House decide that they want a different proposal than the President of the United States, if 70 Members will sign a letter, I believe, to the Speaker of the House and also to the chairman of the Budget Committee, those 70 Members will present their proposal to the Budget Committee. If the Budget Committee holds hearings and certifies that the proposal that's been submitted by the 70 Members does, in fact, meet the requirements of the law, that proposal then is ordered reported to the House of Representatives for an up-or-down vote. 
   So sometime in the next several months, you are going to hopefully see a number of proposals submitted to the Budget Committee on how to deal with the pending crisis in Medicare. And I would encourage all Members of this body, since we all have Medicare recipients in our congressional districts, to be a part of some group that tries to address this problem. 
   Now, the President's proposal, again, it is not a definitive legislative language developed proposal. It's more of an outline of policy objectives, but the policy objectives are pretty straight forward: number one, Medicare beneficiaries that have higher incomes would pay slightly more in their premiums so you would begin to have a graduated means-tested premium increase based on your ability to pay the Medicare premium; number two would be a Medicare liability reform proposal that has been talked about for years. That, by itself, would probably save $180 billion over 5 years or so. There would be a requirement for more pricing transparency and more openness, so that Medicare beneficiaries could see what prices they're paying or are being paid on their behalf. And also there are some proposals, I believe, on quality indexing, quality of reporting so that, again, before the beneficiary decides where to have a particular procedure done or which doctor to use, he or she might have some data on the quality of the health care that's provided by various Medicare providers. 
   All in all, the President's proposal is very modest, but it's certainly one that needs to be seriously considered; and, again, the need for doing something on Medicare is something that we need to  begin to address as a Congress. The Medicare trustees have reported that if current policies are not changed within the next 11 years, the Medicare trust fund will go bankrupt. What that means is if you are 54 years old or younger, when you retire there will be no money in the Medicare trust fund to pay your Medicare benefits which you are, by law, entitled to at age 65. 
   So this is a problem that we can't put off for 20 years or 50 years. In my opinion, we can't put it off for any years. Again, we need to begin to address it immediately, we need to address it in this Congress, and we need to hopefully address it in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I now yield to the distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer).

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (MEDICARE CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to recapitulate why we are here this evening taking this Special Order. As I pointed out earlier, Medicare is a mandatory program for senior citizens over age 65. It was established in 1965, which is 43 years ago. I don't exactly remember in the first year how many citizens were covered and how much money was expended, but my recollection is that several million senior citizens were covered and expenses were in the order of a magnitude of 6 or $700 million. In the last year that we have numbers for, 45 million Americans were covered and the costs were over 400 billion. 
   Now, it is a good thing that we have 45 million senior citizens in this country. Those are our grandparents and great grandparents and great aunts and uncles. They are certainly the generation that has been pointed out that fought the great wars of World War II and Korea and Vietnam. They have ushered in an amazing American economy unsurpassed in the history of the world in terms of its ability to generate wealth and economic prosperity. And they are well deserving of the benefits that we are paying out for Medicare. 
   So the problem is not that our senior citizens don't deserve the best health care in the world, and it is not that we are living healthier and longer. The problem is, quite simply, how do we pay for it. Average expenditures for Medicare are on the order of magnitude of about $7,000 per person per year. And to put that in perspective, that is more than most families pay per person for their food or for their housing. 
   If nothing is done on the current Medicare program in terms of its policies and the way it's structured in 11 years, in 2019, the Medicare trust fund is going to be bankrupt. As I pointed out earlier, if you are 54 years young or younger, when you retire, there will be no Medicare. Now I'm 58. So if I were to retire at age 65, in 7 years I would have 3 years of Medicare benefits before the program went bankrupt. My wife, Terry, who's younger than me, when she retires, she would have no benefits. None of my children would have benefits. None of my grandchildren would have benefits. 
   So this is not a program that we can just let go on automatic pilot. We need to begin to fundamentally and in a focused way look at the Medicare program as it exists today, not cut people off the program, not change it so that there are fewer benefits. We need to look at Medicare and try to bring our technology to bear, bring our management processes to bear, all of the innovations that have happened in the last 40 years. 
   As I pointed out earlier, if we were still making the 1964 Mustang, that was a great car in 1964, 1965. But it's hardly the car that people want to buy today. We didn't have cell phones in 1965. Today, everybody in America has a cell phone. In fact, there are more cell phones than there are hard line phones. If you look at computers, the computer in 1965 was a mainframe computer that you had to go to a central location to use. I would guess that almost every American citizen has some access to a personal computer today. 
   So a lot has changed in many fields since 1965. But in Medicare, we have the same basic program funded the same basic way.     
   So we need to look at ways to change that program and to bring it into the 21st century. I think some of those ideas are going to be in the form of preventive medicine, like we have in those seniors, about 20 percent of those 9 million that have chosen a Medicare Advantage plan. There may be some ways in terms of sharing costs; as the President has suggested, Medicare beneficiaries that are more well-to-do could pay a higher share of their premium. 
   We have the whole issue of health information technology, or health IT. It's suspected and predicted that if we would bring health information technology to bear on Medicare, you could save tens of billions, perhaps more, each year just by using that technology that's currently in the private sector. 
   So, there are a number of great ideas, but because of this Medicare trigger, this year, a certain percent of Members, I believe it is 70 Members, but a  number on that order of magnitude, if they have a plan to restructure Medicare, to reform it, to bring the spending in total below 45 percent of general revenue, they can submit their plan to the chairman of the Budget Committee. The chairman of the Budget Committee will hold hearings to certify that the plan does, in fact, meet the Medicare trigger recommendations. And if it does, my understanding of the law is that those plans have to be brought to the floor; they have to be voted on by the House of Representatives. Now, I'm not clear exactly the procedure for the rules for bringing these proposals to the floor, whether every proposal is given a vote on the floor or whether there are only certain proposals that are certified by the Rules Committee, but my understanding is that all proposals that meet the budgetary cutoff do get an up or down vote on the House floor. 
   So, if you're a member of the majority, of the Democrat Party, and you've got an idea and you can get 70 Members to support it, your plan can be voted on. If a bipartisan group of Members bring a proposal, that plan can be voted on. If the Republican leadership, whom I'm doing this Special Order for, has a plan, it can be voted on. If the President can get 70 Members to sign under his plan, it can be voted on. I personally don't see any problem with having different plans on the floor. The bottom line is to vote on some plan that begins to restructure and reform Medicare. Again, not trying to cut people off the program, not trying to tell our senior citizens we're going to do away with Medicare; what we should be telling our senior citizens is that we want Medicare to be there not just for another 11 years, but we want it to be there for another 50 years, another 60 years, not for people that are just now over 60 and over 70, but for our children and our grandchildren. 
   This is a program that, again, in 1965, my recollection is it cost less than $1 billion a year. This past year it cost over $400 billion. And by 2018, it's going to cost over $800 billion. And by 2036, it's going to cost more than the entire Federal budget today, which is over $2 trillion. 
   So this is not something that we can just put on the back shelf and not do anything about. It is something that we need to take action on. And again, because of the Medicare trigger, we have the ability, under expedited rules, to put these proposals to the Budget Committee, the Budget Committee certifies its proposal will meet the cost savings requirement, those plans will come to the floor and be voted on sometime this year before we go home in October for the elections in November. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to bring to the attention of the House the Medicare trigger language and that it does require the President to submit a proposal. He has done so. It does require the Budget Committee to meet on that proposal and any other proposals that 70 Members of the body can put before the Budget Committee. And it does require that the House vote on the bill, or the bills, later this year. 
   We need to address it. The Medicare trustees have pointed out that for 2 years in a row the spending has exceeded 45 percent of the general revenues going into the program, and so it is time for us to begin to address it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I see no other Members present. So with that, I would humbly suggest that everybody begin to think about what to do to protect and reform Medicare.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we have had this debate before, so I am going to refer people to the Congressional Record at the appropriate place for my basic remarks on the underlying issue. I simply want to clarify why we are having this particular debate today. 
   We passed this early in this Congress, this particular piece of legislation. It passed the Senate, and it went to the President, and the President vetoed the bill. Many of those who support embryonic stem cell research think that we ought to be able to find a little finer middle ground, that we might yet get the President to support a version of the bill. So the sponsors, Mr. Castle and Ms. DeGette, have added the Senate language from the last Congress that Mr. Specter and Mr. Santorum passed as a stand-alone bill that I think passed the other body 100-0, which is a very strong vote. It has been added to this bill. 
   I might add that, apparently, the motion to recommit is going to be something like that language that Mr. Gingrey has offered to the motion to recommit. 
   So what we are trying to do here today is slice the cheese a little bit finer so that those in the pro-life community like myself who have a 100 percent pro-life voting record, over 23 years except for this one vote, can vote for it, those that believe that we should fund a broader array of embryonic stem cell research can vote for it, and the President can accept it. That is what this particular bill is all about. 
   I plan to vote for it. I plan to vote against the motion to recommit not because I am opposed to the policy on the motion to recommit, but if we were to accept the motion to recommit, that would send the bill back to the Energy and Commerce Committee and require further consideration, which may or may not result in the bill's coming back to the floor. 
   So Members have voted on this in this body this year already once. Those of us that served in the last Congress got to vote on it in the last Congress. So there are not too many undecideds. But we are hoping the addition of this Specter-Santorum language, which is also sponsored in the House by Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Gingrey, will result in a little bit finer slice of the cheese, that we will yet get a bill through the House and through the Senate that the President will accept. So that is what this is about. 
   I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill and a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit.  
   Mr. Speaker, stem cell legislation has been well debated on this floor, and I support it. This bill has again been brought to the floor with no committee process. When I was chairman we handled this important issue with full consultation with our minority. That is the preferable way to legislate. 
   This bill is designed to create enough lines of embryonic stem cells to allow basic scientific research to move forward. Most of the scientific community has articulated that once we can identify a perfect, undifferentiated stem cell, it will lead to significant scientific breakthroughs and the discovery of cures for many diseases. 
   For numerous reasons, not all of the potential stem cell lines that were thought to be available for research when the President announced his policy in August 2001 are actually viable for research purposes. The number of stem cell lines available for scientific research is actually well below the estimated number of stem cell lines that were thought to exist in August of 2001. 
   We will also eventually need additional embryonic stem cell lines to make further scientific advances. In order to produce clinical therapies, it is likely that researchers will also need more embryonic stem cell lines, of different genetic variations, than are presently eligible to receive Federal support. 
   Understandably, this is not a simple vote for anyone on this floor. There is no ideological cloak under which we can take cover. This is a vote of conscience for all members. In the 109th Congress, similar legislation was agreed to by a vote of 238 to 194 in the House and later passed the Senate by a vote of 63 to 37.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2446, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act of 2007. 
   This bill reauthorizes the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002, which has made a huge impact in the stability and security of a new democracy in that country. 
   Since 2002, we've seen major reconstruction of schools and infrastructure in that country, as well as the birth of a democratic nation. 
   Reauthorization of this bill is crucial ensuring that Afghanistan continues to strengthen its government and that its people start to feel safe and secure in a nation that has been riddled with so much violence and terrorism. 
   H.R. 2446 also makes some important enhancements to the original Act by dealing with a rising narcotics problem related to heroine and poppy production that is threatening to endanger Afghanistan's security. 
   H.R. 2446 also takes a strong step towards building international diplomacy and shared responsibility in the region with our allies. 
   The Act expresses the sense of Congress that greater humanitarian assistance is needed in the country for civilians, that the United Nations should play a larger role in assisting the people of Afghanistan and also provides means to train military from foreign countries to share responsibility in Afghanistan. 
   We also set strong benchmarks for accountability in the region by requiring more reporting, a better overall strategy for Afghanistan, and by pursuing policies that foster regional cooperation. 
   This bill will make Afghanistan stronger and more secure while securing our own homeland in the fight against global terrorism. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (HUMAN CLONING PROHIBITION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I don't normally come to the floor to talk on suspension bills because normally, suspension bills have been cleared by the majority with the minority and they are bills that we have if not unanimous agreement on, we have general agreement on. But I feel very strongly about this particular bill and the way it is being done. 
   The gentlelady, who is the chief sponsor of the bill, the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) is a good friend of mine. When I was chairman, I helped her and Mr. Castle bring to the floor the stem cell bill which was very controversial and which the President ultimately vetoed. I voted for that bill, and spoke for the bill on the floor. We had an arrangement between Mr. Dingell and myself about how we were going to bring that bill to the floor. Ms. DeGette and Mr. Castle were part of that discussion. 
   This bill was introduced after 7 p.m. last night. JOHN DINGELL didn't call me. DIANE DEGETTE didn't call me. We can't find anybody from the majority who called anybody on the minority. There have been no hearings on the bill. There has been no markup of the bill. We just basically take the gentlelady's word that it is what it is. 
   We know that cloning is controversial. We know that most of us in this body are opposed to human cloning, for whatever purpose. There is a good chance if we had a legislative hearing, we had a markup, we could probably come to a consensus on a bill that Mr. Weldon could support and Mr. Smith could support and Ms. DeGette could support; but not this bill. Not this process.  
   A bill is introduced at 7:30 one night and is on the floor of the suspension calendar the next day, there have been no hearings, no process, and you can't amend it because it is under suspension of the rules. I think that is a subversion of the process. 
   It is a way to give some Members a vote for political cover because tomorrow when the main stem cell bill comes up, which was noticed last week, the last time the stem cell bill was on the floor, the minority who has the right to offer a motion to recommit, part of the motion to recommit dealt with cloning, and some of the Members in the majority voted for it.     
   So this is a way for the majority to give some Members of their party a way to vote for a cloning bill so they can vote against the motion to recommit tomorrow, if that's what it is. So I understand the political strategy, but I don't understand the process of ignoring the Energy and Commerce Committee repeatedly, and I don't understand a bill as controversial as this being brought under suspension with no hearings and a bill that wasn't even introduced until after dark last night. 
   That's wrong. I hope we vote ``no,'' N-O, ``no.''

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the bill we are considering today--the Towns-Bono SPY Act--is an important piece of legislation to me. We've been working on this bill for 4 years now, before many of us ever heard the term ``spyware.'' I applaud the bipartisan sponsors for their unwavering commitment to pass this legislation. 
   The surreptitious installation of spyware on your computer without your knowledge and without your consent is a little like sneaking into your home and planting a bug: it is an invasion of your privacy and it is clearly wrong. This bill prohibits all the nefarious conduct that is used to harm consumers. The legislation provides the FTC a strong mandate to go after bad actors and their destructive behavior. 
   There are many important and legitimate business functions of the Internet, and I have no problem with businesses trying to compete and sell their goods and services. And I recognize advertising is a part of commerce. But I feel strongly that there is a line that should not be crossed regarding the sharing of my personal information without first obtaining my consent. Consumers have the right to know if they are being profiled, if their personal information is going to be shared, and with whom it might be shared. My computer and my personal information are my property. This legislation will ensure I have control over both. 
   This bill strikes a fair balance between the need to protect the functions of legitimate business tools and punishing bad actors. 
   In closing, I want to thank Chairman RUSH, Chairman DINGELL, and Ranking Member STEARNS for moving the bill through the Committee. I commend MARY BONO and ED TOWNS for their tireless efforts to address this insidious activity. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this important piece of legislation and hope that our Senate colleagues will do the same.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1808. I am proud to be the first non-Georgian sponsor of the bill after the entire Georgia delegation. 
   I knew Congressman Norwood very well. He was one of my very best friends in the House. I can think of no better tribute than to name the Veterans Affairs Center at One Freedom Way in Augusta the Charlie Norwood Medical Center. 
   Congressman Norwood was a strong advocate for veterans. He was a veteran himself. He was very active in health care issues and veterans health care issues on the House floor. This is a fitting tribute to his service in the Congress and his service to the country when he was in the military and served so nobly and ably in Vietnam. 
   I rise in strong support and hope we get unanimous support for this bill at the appropriate time.  
   I have had the pleasure of working with many great men and women in my 22 years in the House, and I can say with all honesty that Charlie Norwood was one of the best. I knew Charlie well, both as an outspoken member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a good friend. His devotion to people of the Tenth District of Georgia was undeniable, as was his passion for improving this country's healthcare and the lives of its veterans. 
   Charlie Norwood's service to his country began long before his election to the House of Representatives. Charlie volunteered to serve in the United States Dental Corp during the Vietnam War. Captain Norwood provided dental, emergency medical, and surgical care for United States personnel, Vietnamese civilians, and prisoners-of-war. The Dental Corp operating procedures that he helped develop while in combat conditions have now become standard. 
   Upon returning stateside, Charlie settled in the Augusta area and set up a private dental practice serving local residents as well as providing care for military personnel, retirees, and dependents under Department of Defense programs and for low-income patients under Georgia Medicaid. His work on behalf of veterans and military personnel continued throughout his twelve years in the House of Representatives. 
   Throughout his congressional service from 1995 to 2007, Congressman Norwood repeatedly defeated attempts to reduce Federal support for the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia. I think it only appropriate that we gather here today to honor the memory of this great man by placing his name on the institution that he fought so hard for. I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to Congressman Charlie Norwood.

Those two groups will receive in the neighborhood of $90,000 thanks to the Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. 
   It was a hard-fought game. There were excellent plays on both sides, but when the dust had cleared, for the seventh time in a row, the Republican team, playing on a level playing field with fair rules won a hard-fought 5-2 victory. 
   John Shimkus and Chip Pickering were our MVPs, but the entire Republican team, every member of the Republican team got into the game through pitching, batting or running. Some did better than others in those endeavors, but we had a good time and nobody was hurt.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, it is ironic that we just had that point of order offered by my good friend, Mr. Dicks. Under the Armey rule, the former majority leader, the chairmen of the authorizing committees could send letters to the Rules Committee on appropriation bills and any part of the appropriation bill that was actually legislating on an appropriation bill, there was a standing point of order made in order that you could strike it. 
   So we wouldn't have had the Sullivan amendment and we would not have the amendment that I am about to offer if the current chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, had sent such a letter to the Rules Committee asking to reserve the point of order on this section 501. But Chairman Dingell didn't do that, and so it is in the bill and Mr. Dicks can make a point of order that an amendment to it should be struck because it is legislating on an appropriation bill. What a great place this body is that we work in. 
   So what my amendment does is pretty straightforward. It strikes section 501. That cannot be ruled out of order. It can be voted down, and we will have a vote on this. But the Davis amendment that I am offering on his behalf can't be struck on a point of order. 
   What is it about this section 501 that is so onerous? Let me briefly synthesize what it says. I think it says some things that are factually incorrect. 
   It says that the Congress finds that greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere are causing average temperatures to rise at a rate outside the range of natural variability. I think that a factually incorrect statement. It is a true statement that the temperature apparently is rising compared to what it was 150 years ago. In the late 1840s and early 1850s, temperature averages at most places that kept temperature records at that time were 1 to 2 degrees cooler than they are now. And the temperature appears to be going up. That is a true statement. 
   But I don't think that it is true that the temperature rate increase is outside the range of natural variability. The one thing about climate that is constant is that it is constantly changing. 
   The second incorrect statement is subparagraph 2 where it says there is a growing scientific consensus that human activity is a substantial cause of greenhouse gas accumulation. 
   Now I think it is indisputable that as we burn many of the hydrocarbons, obviously they are releasing CO  
   2 which is a greenhouse gas and that is accumulating in the atmosphere. That is a true statement. But whether that is a substantial cause is yet to be determined. 
   I would point out that the largest greenhouse gas by far is H  
   2O, water vapor. When you see a cloud in the sky, you are seeing a greenhouse gas accumulation in the sky. And water vapor is over 90 percent of all greenhouse gases. CO 
   2, carbon dioxide, is less than \3/10\ of 1 percent. So how could something that is such a small percentage be the cause of this temperature increase? It is an interesting theory, but it is yet to be proven. 
   In any event, because of these first two paragraphs, we get to the meat of the issue in section 501, and that is mandatory steps are required to slow or stop the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. Mandatory. Coercive. You have to do it whether you want to or not. You have to do it whether it makes sense or not.  
   We are far from a place, in my opinion, where we need to begin to legislate mandatory approaches, and that's what is so bad about this section 501. Now you may argue it is a sense of the Congress what is it going to do. It is just to show where we are. Well, I would point out that in the late 1970s, early 1980s, you begin to have these temporary 1-year moratoriums on drilling off the coast of various parts of our country. They seemed relatively harmless at the time. What could be wrong with that?     
   That has grown into such a significant part that it's almost impossible right now to drill anywhere in the United States that we haven't already been drilling for the last hundred years. There's a limit to how many holes we can drill in Texas. We've drilled over 2 million since 1901. We've found a lot of oil and gas, but at some point in time, we've got to drill where we haven't drilled before. In any event, section 501 is bad public policy and this amendment would strike it.

   I just want to comment briefly on what Chairman Dicks said about this being in the bill last year. He is factually correct. We reserved a point of order on it last year. And the member of the committee that I chaired at the time who was supposed to make the point of order was caught in the cloakroom eating a candy bar, and the crafty appropriators closed the title before we could make the point of order. So it was in the bill last year only because we were asleep at the switch when it was our turn to raise the point of order. At least I'm not asleep at the switch this year.

That is the apparent attempt to say that some of these leases that were granted in 1997 and 1998 were somehow flawed, and that there were mistakes made and things were covered up and the oil companies tried to renegotiate some of these leases to get a sweetheart deal. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   On November 28, 1995, President Clinton signed Public Law 104-58. It was entitled the Outer Continental Shelf Deepwater Royalty Relief Act, Royalty Relief Act. It was the intent of this act to offer royalty relief, royalty suspension in certain tracts in the Gulf of Mexico in order to create an incentive to get the oil companies, both large and small, to actually bid on these leases, to spend money to promote them, develop them and hopefully find some commercial production. 
   There was no mistake about it. It was the intention of the act to sign some leases that did not have royalty or had a lesser royalty than was commonly in place. Now, remember at this point in time oil was selling for $10 to $15 a barrel, and there was no production, there was no exploration, or very little exploration going on. 
   Section 303 of that act established a new bidding system that allowed the Secretary of the Interior to offer tracts with royalty suspensions for a period, volume or value that the Secretary so determines. Now, section 304 of that ACT went on and says that all tracts, a-l-l, all tracts that were off within 5 years of the date of enactment in deepwater; that is, water that is at least 200 meters deep, had to be offered under a new bidding system, had to be, not could be, might be, had to be. 
   This new bidding system had a royalty clause in it, but the royalty clause was based on volume of production and is also based on the depth of the water. The deeper the water was, the less the volume was that you had to produce before you triggered a royalty. 
   In other words, if you were in the deepest water in the gulf that was leased, you could produce up to 87 million barrels of oil without paying a royalty. That is a lot of oil, 87 million barrels is a lot of oil. 
   So we, those of us that were in the Congress, in the mid-1990s, passed a Royalty Relief Act, it is in the title. It says, if you will put your hard-earned dollars and go out and bid on these leases, and you win one of those leases, if it is in the deepwater, we are putting in a bidding system, and under this bidding system you may have to pay a royalty based on how much you produce but you won't pay a royalty based on the price. 
   Now, we only offered these leases for, I think, 2 years, 571 were actually bid on. Of those, about half, I think, were accepted. Of those, we discovered we have current production in 19 of them, 19. 
   Now, after the fact, we can come back here in 2007, when prices are at $50 a barrel, and say that was a bad deal 12 years ago, we should not have done it. But 12 years ago oil was at $10 a barrel. We had no domestic exploration going on. We passed a specific act of Congress that said give this royalty relief. Today we are, in hindsight, saying take it away. That is wrong, and I oppose the bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, during the 2006 campaign we were promised civility and ``playing by the rules, following regular order.'' Today, like the  rest of the 110th Congress so far, we face the extreme opposite: government by martial law and bumper sticker. Mr. Speaker, your bumper stickers worked in the campaign but they are not governance worthy of the American people and it won't take time for the people to understand the difference. 
   The last major energy legislation enacted by Congress was the Energy Policy Act of 2005. It was a long and heavy lift. We had countless hours of hearings before the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Committee mark-up seemed to take forever because of the many amendments offered by Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   And then there was the exhausting conference with the Senate. Many provisions were negotiated in excruciating detail. What did it give us? One of the most important, historic, and consequential pieces of comprehensive legislation in history. It has already directly accounted for several liquefied gas facilities, new nuclear plant announcements, vastly improved electricity transmission reliability, and impressive capital investment in solar, wind, and other renewables. 
   Did the minority party participation slow things down? You bet it did, but it also improved the product. I am proud of the 70 Democrat votes on final passage but especially of one vote, that of our new chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the gentleman from Michigan. We earned each other's support for the final product. 
   Today, by contrast, we have a bumper sticker: ``Stick it to Big Oil.'' That's a cute bumper sticker, but, please, Mr. Speaker, don't use it to govern with because you are only hurting the very people who sent us all here. 
   In 2004 we agreed that the JOBS Act was important for keeping American manufacturing and production here at home in the face of an increasingly competitive global market. Today we're saying, ``all that is still true--let's keep the JOBS Act, except we will carve out one industry for which we don't want American production, American manufacturing, American jobs: the energy industry. No, we'd rather tip the scales so that global companies with American operations in the energy industry will take their jobs and production off shore where they are more welcome: say Nigeria, or Iran, or Venezuela. 
   Last year virtually all Members recognized the disturbing shortage of U.S. based refining capacity. We had various ideas to address it and virtually every Member of this body voted for one or the other. But driving refineries off shore was on nobody's agenda. Why is it on your's? 
   Meanwhile, as off-shore energy prices spike as a direct, inevitable result, so do consumer prices for commuters, and soccer moms, and grandmothers struggling to pay home heating. 
   These prices matter to our constituents in places like Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Texas, and other States. 
   Mr. Speaker, why must you turn every bumper sticker into more taxes and more spending? Why throw $14 billion into the Department of Energy to produce energy? In its entire history with all its billions, how much electricity, how much transportation fuel has DOE really created? 
   Let's step back, see this H.R. 6 bumper sticker for what it really is and have the courage to say, ``The bumper sticker was for last year, now it's time to govern and to put the people of America first.'' I urge a ``no'' vote on final passage.                          
   AGENCY: Minerals Management Service (MMS), Interior.     
   ACTION: Final rule.     
   SUMMARY: The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to offer Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) tracts in parts of the Gulf of Mexico for lease with suspension of royalties for a volume, value, or period of production. This applies to tracts in water depths of 200 meters or more. This final rule specifies the royalty-suspension terms for lease sales using this bidding system.     
   DATES: This final rule is effective February 17, 1998.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 556 the National Security Foreign Investment Reform and Strengthening Transparency Act of 2007. I want more foreign investment in America, not less, but I do not want the kind that threatens our security. CFIUS exists to make the distinction, and we need to know that it's doing a good job. 
   We don't automatically fear foreign investors here in America. The money provided by foreign investors creates jobs, growth and opportunity here at home. I just want to ensure the investment we attract does not jeopardize national security. 
   H.R. 556 provides consistent criteria with appropriate discretion and will improve the review process without impairing our ability to attract significant and needed foreign investment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I fully support the legislation before us. Importantly, it provides for mandatory review of foreign-government controlled transactions and any transaction that affects national security. Additionally, it provides clear and consistent review criteria for all other commercial investments, it adds the Secretary of Energy to the Committee, and it makes the Secretary of Commerce a co-vice chair of the Committee. Most important, it adds transparency in the process for Congressional oversight and establishes new reporting requirements many of us feel are essential to this process. 
   I support H.R. 556 and urge my colleagues to approve the measure.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, it's interesting how different people can see the same set of circumstances and come to totally different conclusions. 
   In the last Congress, we passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 on a bipartisan basis. There were open markups in the House and the Senate. There was an open conference committee that was televised in some cases. We had, I believe, a majority of the Democrats vote for that bill on the House floor, a majority of the Democrats in the Senate, and obviously almost all the Republicans in both bodies. It was the most comprehensive energy bill to be signed into law in probably the last 30 or 40 years. 
   Many of the things in that bill are going to be undone if and when this bill passes and the President signs it, which he is expected to do so. I understand the consequences of elections. I understand there is a new majority. I do not understand how what made sense 2 years ago doesn't make sense today. 
   Let's take the issue of fuel economy standards. If there is a crown jewel in this bill, it apparently is that we're going to raise CAFE standards significantly for the first time in 30 years. On the surface, that may appear to be a good thing, but let me point out a few things. 
   There are over 350 models of automobiles and trucks that are currently available for sale to the American public. There are only eight vehicles that get 35 miles to the gallon. They are the Honda Fit, the Honda Civic, the Honda Civic Hybrid, the Toyota Yaris, both manual and automatic, Toyota Corolla, Toyota Camry Hybrid, and the Toyota Prius. That's it. 
   Now, let's look at the top eight selling vehicles that the American public have bought so far this year. Number one is the Ford F-series pickup. Number two is the Chevrolet Silverado pickup. Number three is the Toyota Camry, not the Camry Hybrid. Number four is the Dodge Ram pickup. Number five is the Honda Accord. Number six is the Toyota Corolla. Number seven is the Honda Civic. Number eight is the Nissan Altima. Only two or three of those get 35 miles to the gallon. 
   I will stipulate, as smart as our engineers in Detroit are, it is going to be very, very difficult, if not impossible, for the Ford F-series pickups, the Chevy Silverado and the Dodge Ram pickup to get 35 miles to the gallon by the year 2020. 
   There are vehicles that meet the standard. Some of those make the top list of sales, but three of the top four do not. I will stipulate by setting the standard at 35 miles to the gallon, will we improve fuel economy? Yes, we will. Will we reach the holy grail of 35 miles per gallon on a fleet average by 2020? If I had to guess, I would bet we'll be back on this floor within the next 10 years providing for an extension of that because I think it's going to be technologically very difficult, if not impossible. And I think economically it's not going to be possible at all. 
   What the bill before us is is a mandatory conservation bill. Now, conservation in and of itself is a good thing. I won't deny that. But conservation without some supply is a bad thing, and that's what this bill is. We're preempting State and local building codes with Federal building standards for so-called ``green buildings.'' We're mandating 35 billion gallons of alternative fuels that right now the technology simply doesn't exist. Hopefully our engineers and scientists can make that happen, but what if they don't? 
   We are also basically just changing the way that we operate in a market economy for energy in this country to the government knows the best and the government is going to tell the American people what's best for them, whether the American people like it or not. I think that's a mistake, Mr.  Speaker. And for that reason, I would hope we vote against the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, we don't get elected to come to Congress and be against things. As the chairman of the Energy Committee in the last Congress, I was honored to chair the conference committee which passed the most comprehensive energy bill to become law in the last 20 to 30 years, so it is with a heavy heart that I come to the floor today to oppose this particular energy bill. 
   I don't oppose it out of spite and I don't oppose it because there is a different majority; I oppose it because of what is in it and what is not in it. Let's talk about what's not in it. 
   There is nothing in it for coal to liquids. There is nothing in it for the domestic oil and gas industry. There is very little in it for the nuclear industry. So for all of the conventional energy sources that fuel this great Nation, this is basically a no-energy bill. 
   We are not a have-not Nation in terms of energy. We have the ability, if we wish to, to be close to self-sufficient in energy production for our own consumption in this Nation. 
   Hypothetically, this bill may do something to reduce the amount of oil that we import, but only hypothetically. We use about 12 million barrels of oil per day that is converted to gasoline, and my guess is, in the year 2020, we are going to use more than 12 million barrels of oil a day to convert to gasoline and diesel fuel. So while it will certainly save some energy, because of the growth, I would argue that we will probably end up using as much imported oil as we do today. 
   What this bill really is is a recipe for recession. Why do I say that? The cost of fuel is going to go up if this bill does what it is supposed to do, and that is going to be an incentive for recession. The cost of building our homes is going to go up because of all of the new building code restrictions for so-called green buildings in this bill. The cost of electricity is going to go up. The cost of manufacturing our automobiles and our trucks is going to go up. 
   In 1966, my father's Ford Fairlane 500 got 17 miles to the gallon. It cost about $4,000 in 1966 dollars. That equivalent vehicle today would cost, in the order of magnitude, $25,000. The vehicles that are going to be made to meet this 35-mile-per-gallon standard in the year 2020 are probably going to cost, in order of magnitude, $10,000 to $15,000 more than they do today. That is a recipe for recession. 
   The cost of appliances is going to go up because of all of the new efficiency standards we are putting in for appliances. And even the cost of light bulbs is going to go up. The light bulbs that light this Chamber right now will be illegal when this bill becomes completely implemented. The incandescent light bulb that you can get for 90 cents or 50 cents at Wal-Mart is going to be outlawed. You will have to pay $8 to $10 for these new fancy light bulbs. That is a cause for recession. 
   So what happens when all of these costs go up, Mr. Speaker? Jobs go down. Jobs in our real estate and home construction building are going to go down. Jobs in manufacturing are going to go down. Jobs in our automobile assembly industry are going to go down. Jobs in retail sales are going to go down. Costs are going to go up and jobs are going to go down. 
   And the shame of it is that we could have passed an energy bill in this Congress that we could have all voted for. We could have put some of the things that are in this bill. We are not opposed to some increase in CAFE. We could have had an agreement on CAFE that balanced an increase in supply perhaps by drilling in ANWR so we get more oil production domestically, we get some energy conservation domestically. That is a doable deal. We could have done a coal-to-liquids title in this bill. Vote ``no'' on the bill.

   In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me simply say, as I have already said, this is not a have-not Nation, but the energy bill before us today is acting as if we are a have-not Nation. 
   We can use the domestic resources. We can produce more energy, and yes, we can conserve energy. We can lead the world as we have led the world in the post-World War II era, but this bill is, in my opinion, a recipe for recession, and I would strongly urge a ``no'' vote.

Nuclear power must be a part of our future energy supply. Companies that are planning to build new nuclear plants estimate that they will request a loan of $20 to $25 billion in FY '08. The companies expect to complete loan guarantee agreements in FY '08 because they must have financing in place in order to maintain their current schedules. Without loan guarantees for new nuclear plants, we risk a delay in bringing more safe and emission free nuclear plants online at a time when we are trying to diversify our supplies of power as quickly as possible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. And I am not opposed to it for political reasons, I am not opposed to it for partisan reasons, I am not opposed to it for emotional reasons. I am opposed to it because fundamentally it doesn't address the problem that needs to be addressed. We have a crisis in our financial markets, we have a crisis of confidence in our credit markets, and this bill only indirectly addresses those problems. 
   First and foremost, from the taxpayers' standpoint, it is not paid for. The underlying bill is going to raise the national debt ceiling $1.5 trillion. That is $1,500 billion. If you add the tax extender package that came over from the Senate, you end up with a price tag of approximately $2 trillion. Absolutely nothing in the bill addresses how to pay for those $2 trillion that puts taxpayers at risk. Really, for that one reason we should vote against the bill. 
   We have talked a lot about the crisis in the credit markets. My good friend from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) just put up a chart on the LIBOR rate, which is the overnight interbank loan rate from London. It is at 4 percent. It was at 4.5 percent 1 year ago. It is within its normal range. The spread has gone up between the overnight Treasury rate and the LIBOR rate, but that is because the Treasury rate has gone down to 2 percent. 
   An auto loan that my good friend was talking about, the distinguished Financial Services chairman, the auto rate loan right now is 6.5 percent, about what it was a year ago. The credit markets are working, but there are some people holding back credit, hoping that the taxpayers will bail them out. 
   Fundamentally, we need to address the American economy. This bill doesn't do that. You want the value of the dollar to go up? How about cutting spending and lowering the deficit? You want to do something on auto sales? How about produce more domestic energy to bring gasoline prices down. 
   Madam Speaker, this is not the bill to address the problem. I hope we will vote ``no.''

   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and in opposition to the underlying bill. The bill is trying to treat a symptom, not the disease. It's like you have a fire and instead of sending the fire truck to put the fire out, you develop a climate change model to cause it to rain everywhere so some of that rain may put the particular fire out that you're trying to put out. 
   The reason that our economy is in distress is because fundamentally we're becoming less competitive in international markets. If we want to do something to restore the value of the dollar, how about cutting spending here in the Congress? How about coming up with a tax program that encourages entrepreneurship in America? I could go on and on, Madam Speaker. We need to solve this problem, but we need to do it in a targeted way. 
   The underlying bill that has come back to us from the other body is basically the same bill we voted down Monday with some sweeteners to try to bribe enough Members to vote for it so that it will pass.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I want to thank Congressman Deal for his excellent leadership of this issue and floor time and his demeanor and ability to coordinate the effort. I really appreciate that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I, along with every Member of this body, am very concerned about the almost invisible illness which we call mental illness. There is absolutely no question that it is real. There is no question that we need to do more to alleviate it and treat it and, if possible, make it possible for those that have it to be cured of it. Unfortunately, the bill before us today doesn't do that.  
   We are in the process of putting together a bill that, if it passes in its current form, does nothing more than bureaucratize, in my opinion, the treatment of mental illness. It goes so far as to put the entire catalog of various diagnoses into Federal statute. I don't think that makes a lot of sense. This Diagnostic and Statistical Manual has numerous categories that are very real abuses, very real problems, but I think it is a debatable proposition whether they constitute mental illness. 
   For example, code V71.01 of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual covers professional thieves, racketeers, and dealers in illegal substances. Now in my book, those are thugs and criminals; they are not people suffering from a mental illness. And I don't want, if this bill were to become law and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual be put into Federal statute, for a criminal defense attorney to stand up in court and cite this law as a reason that their client should be treated for mental illness and not be subject to criminal penalties and hopefully, if proven guilty, put behind bars. 
   There is a better bill. It is a bill that has come out of the other body. It is a bill that was put together in the other body with bipartisan support. In my opinion, it is a better bill than the bill before us. I would hope that at the appropriate time we might work with the other body and adopt more of that language than the language before us. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that this bill came before us under a closed rule. We did have an open debate in the committee and I want to commend Chairman Dingell for that. But coming to the floor, we were offered no substitute. We were offered no amendments. 
   I am also concerned about the offset. The offset is an attack on physician-owned hospitals. And it is kind of odd that the same provision that the CBO now scores as saving hundreds of millions of dollars over 5 years and billions over 10 years, 3 years ago had no savings at all when we looked at a similar provision in the Budget Reconciliation Act. 
   So I would oppose this on procedural reasons and also policy reasons and hope we would defeat it and then work with the other body on some version of the bill that has already come out of the other body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Well, the former chairman, the ranking member now. 
   When I think of Paul Gillmor, I think of two words, ``team player.'' Earlier this year, when the Republicans lost the majority, we had to downsize the number of Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I made a decision, as the ranking member, to try not to have to kick anybody off the committee and not bump off our junior members. So I went to the senior members of the committee and asked if there were any volunteers who might want to take a leave of absence to allow the junior members not to have to be bumped off, and of course Paul Gillmor was one of the ones who volunteered to take a leave of absence so he could serve on the Financial Services Committee and keep his seniority on the Energy and Commerce Committee.     
   Because of that, several of our junior members were able to stay on the committee. 
   Well, about a month ago, we had a contentious mark-up coming up. Sure enough, one of the junior members had a personal family situation that they couldn't get out of. They were going to have to take a leave of absence. We needed every vote. So I went to Paul, and I said, ``Would you be willing to come back on the committee for 1 or 2 days?'' He kind of grumped a little bit about it, but he said, ``If you need me, I'll be there.'' Not only did he come back on the committee, but he offered amendments and was there all of the time and didn't complain, whine, moan or groan about how tough it was. He was a team player. He did a good job. 
   When we were in the majority, Paul was the chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials, which is not one of the more glamorous subcommittees of this Congress. It deals with such things as the Superfund and the Clean Water Act and all these international treaties. It's a tough job. Paul did it not only with good grace, but he did it in an excellent fashion. 
   Paul Gillmor is going to be missed as a friend. He is going to be missed as a Congressman. He is going to be missed as a statesman for this country. My sympathy goes out to his wife, Karen, and his family. We will definitely miss the services of the Honorable Paul Gillmor in the House of Representatives. 
   God bless him, and God bless his family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill on substance and in adamant opposition of the process. 
   Now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the substance of this bill. It has two distinguished cosponsors, one in the majority party, one in the minority party. The underlying substance is eminently fair, and we are not going to ask for a rollcall vote. If it passes on a voice vote, so be it. 
   But having said that, I want to say in the strongest possible terms how extremely disappointed, and I mean extremely disappointed, that we have a bill that is in two committees of jurisdiction, the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the bill had not even been introduced, had not even been introduced until this morning. There was no bill number. 
   Now, when you put a bill on the Suspension Calendar, theoretically the majority party, the chairman or chairmen or chairwomen ask the ranking member of the minority party if there is any problem with the bill. If there is not, then they approve it. Then the Speaker of the House or the majority leader of the House calls the minority leader of the House and says, ``We want to put this bill on the Suspension Calendar.'' And you do it. 
   Now, we have a bill before us that was not even introduced until the House convened this morning. There has been no hearing, there is no record, there has been no phone call. Chairman Dingell did not call me yesterday, he did not call me this morning. I don't know if Chairman Rangel called Ranking Member McCrery. I do know that Nancy Pelosi or Steny Hoyer did not call John Boehner. 
   So we are now in a situation, we have a little extra time, let's introduce a bill and pass it in the next 30 minutes. We did not do that when we were in the majority. 
   Now, this is a good bill. Mr. Thompson and Mr. Johnson deserve accolades for seeing a flaw in the current Social Security law, the Medicare law, and rectifying it. That is not the issue. 
   The new majority campaigned on a platform of fairness and openness. Is this fair? Is this open? 
   This happens to be a good bill. What if it weren't? What if it weren't? 
   The only two Members that really know anything about it are the two cosponsors, and thankfully they are both decent, honorable men, and we have read the substance of the bill and it is okay. But this is not the way the House of Representatives should be run. It is just wrong, W-R-O-N-G, wrong. 
   So I support the substance of the bill, but I am adamantly opposed to the process. I hope this thing goes on a voice vote. If it is a rollcall vote, I am going to vote ``present'' and express, when I see Mr. Dingell, in the strongest possible terms how upset I am about the process.

   I do stand by what I said, though, in terms of the committee process. We've got two bills on the suspension calendar from the Energy and Commerce Committee. Neither bill had a legislative hearing. Neither bill had a markup at subcommittee or full committee. Neither bill was introduced in its current form as of 2:45 yesterday afternoon. Both bills are on the floor today on the suspension calendar. That does call into question whether we even need an Energy and Commerce Committee, given that everything apparently comes to the floor without going through the committee process. 
   But we support the underlying principles of this bill, and we certainly support the patriotism and courage of the two sponsors. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me first say that it is appropriate that the House bring this type of legislation in this Congress before the body because gasoline prices are high, and the American public is concerned about those high prices, so it is not inappropriate to consider legislation of this type. We did it twice in the last Congress, passed an anti-price-gouging bill, once as part of a larger energy package and once as a stand-alone piece of legislation. So there is nothing inappropriate about bringing this before the body. 
   Having said that, I think it is fair to say that it is inappropriate, at least in my opinion, to bring it before the body in the way it has been brought. The bill  that is actually before us, I don't know how many Members of the majority saw this bill as it is currently configured, but nobody in the minority saw it until approximately 2:45 p.m. yesterday afternoon. 
   When I left the Capitol at approximately 6:15, it had still not been noticed that it was going to be on the suspension calendar this morning. It may have been noticed and I just didn't get that notice, but I was told it was up at 10 a.m. this morning, and now it's 10:45. So those of us in the minority have a certain sense of concern that we've not been contacted. We've not been asked for our input.     
   We've not been allowed to negotiate, participate in any shape, form or fashion. All we've been allowed to do is come onto the floor, in my case at 10:45, and speak on the bill, and at some point in time, I assume there will be a vote on it. 
   I did study the bill last evening. I have lots of concerns about this bill. I don't know what ``unconscionably excessive'' means. It's not defined in statute. As far as I can tell, it's not been defined in any case law. Apparently, it's going to be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
   I also asked my staff to check around, see if there had been price-gouging lawsuits brought in the various States. Over half of the States of our great Union have price-gouging statutes on the books. We're aware of one State, in the State of Kentucky, the Kentucky Attorney General has either filed a suit or prepared to file a lawsuit in Kentucky. There may be others, but that's the only one that I know of. 
   There's certainly no systemic outbreak of price-gouging lawsuits being filed around the country, and if we really had pandemic price gouging going on, I think the States that have price-gouging statutes would be using their State statues. They're not doing that. 
   Why is that? Well, again, I'm not a trained economist, but it seems to me that what we have is a case of the chickens coming home to roost. We have not done much, if any, on the supply side for our oil situation in this country in the last 30 years; haven't built a refinery, brand new, from scratch, in almost 35 years. We've put almost every place that has any potential for new oil development off-limits. Can't drill up in ANWR, Alaska; can't drill off the coast of California; can't drill off the coast of Florida; can't drill off the coast of South Carolina, North Carolina; can't drill off a lot of portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. 
   And funny things happen. As we've kind of sat on our supply haunches and not done anything, demand worldwide and domestically has gone up, and as demand goes up, if you don't have some ability to increase the supply, sooner or later that price is going to go up. 
   Now, I wasn't here to hear Mr. Stupak's opening statement, and he may not have said this, but he said yesterday in the oversight hearing the price of crude oil has dipped slightly. He doesn't understand why the price of gasoline has gone up. And all you have to do is look at the housing market in northern Virginia to get the answer to that. 
   I had supper last evening with my son who is working at the Department of Energy. They are living in a home that's probably 35 years old. I don't know what that home cost brand new when it was built, but a good guess would be $30-, $40,000. That price at the time was based on the cost of construction, the cost of the land, fair profit for the builder and real estate agent. So you could say the cost of that property was $30- or $40,000. Well, the people that own the home have just sold it. It wouldn't be appropriate to tell the exact selling price. My son is renting it, but it's over $700,000. 
   Now, is that price gouging? No. It's what the market demand for housing in northern Virginia is. It's not related to the cost of the property, it's related to the demand for housing in northern Virginia. So those folks have made a nice profit. 
   Well, the same thing in the oil industry. Demand for oil is going up in China, demand for oil is going up in Europe, demand for oil is going up in Asia, demand for oil is going up in the United States, and if you don't have more of it, price is going to go up. Is that price gouging? No. It is what the market requires to balance limited supply with increasing demand. 
   The price of gasoline in the United States 3 years ago doubled. Demand actually increased 1 percent. Now, eventually, last time prices got to about $3 a gallon demand did dip slightly, supply increased a little bit, price went back down. Right before the last election, the price in Texas for gasoline got down to about $1.90 a gallon. Since my friends on the other side have won the election and taken over, the price has gone back up to what we see today. Is it their fault? It is not their fault right now. It's not Bobby Rush's fault, it's not Bart Stupak's fault, it's not John Dingell's fault. It's not Ed Markey's fault over there in the corner. Although I'm tempted to blame Mr. Markey, but it wouldn't be fair. 
   Demand has gone up and supply has not gone up and the price has gone up, and it's going to keep going up until we do something, both on the demand side and the supply side. 
   So, is this the worst bill that's ever been on the floor of the House of Representatives? No, it's not. Is it the best bill that's ever been on the floor? No, it's not. You know, I think it is a flawed bill. The definitions are not there. The mitigating factors are not there. 
   We would be well-served, since it's on the Suspension Calendar, to defeat it, get 140, 150 votes, then go back to committee, have some hearings, try to develop a little bipartisanship, bring a different bill to the floor, and probably pass with an overwhelming margin. 
   So I'm going to vote against this bill, and I'm going to ask that all my colleagues take a serious look at it, vote against it, so we can figure out the right thing to do. And the next time we bring an energy package, don't just bring something that's symbolic to the floor. Let's bring a bill that helps build new refineries. Let's bring a bill that actually increases the supply. Yes, let's bring a bill that might do something to limit demand. I think the time has come to look at some of those bills seriously. 
   Let's bring a package that actually might do something, other than rhetorical, to bring gasoline prices in the United States back down to levels that we think are more appropriate.  
   I don't like to pay 3 dollars or more for gas anymore than our constituents do, but this legislation won't do a single thing to keep market prices down or address the reasons gas prices are rising. What it will do is threaten legitimate businesses with huge fines and hard-working people with long jail terms. Furthermore, the bill could quite possibly lead to price controls and 1970s-style gas lines. I oppose the legislation before us today for substantive reasons, as well as based on the process--or lack of process--that has brought this bill to the Floor. 
   First, Mr. Speaker, I want the American public to understand how the legislative process has broken down in this case. In light of your unprecedented intent to remove the minority's right to a motion to recommit, it should not surprise anyone in this chamber that the bill before us has bypassed the Committee of jurisdiction--The Energy and Commerce Committee--to come straight to the House Floor. The Committee did not hold a legislative hearing. The Committee did not hold a mark up. The only opportunity my Committee Members had to seek input from the Federal regulators with expertise on legislation was yesterday afternoon during an oversight hearing--a hearing in which the Democratic majority did not even have a witness testify who represents the independent gas stations. It's really too bad their voice was not heard, because the little Mom-and-Pop gas store owner who sells 60 percent of the gas in the U.S. could go to jail for up to 10 years under this bill if they price their gas wrong. 
   On top of my concern for the absence of certain witnesses at our oversight hearing, a new version of this bill was circulated only yesterday afternoon. That's right: we have had less than 24 hours to review the changes, but we are supposed to vote on it. Mr. Speaker, I thought things were going to be fair in this Congress, but I seem to have been mistaken. 
   The Administration has issued a Statement of Administration Policy Against this bill. It indicates that it will lead to gas shortages and do nothing to help consumers. 
   On the substance of this legislation, I have serious concerns that this won't have the intended effect. The Federal Trade Commission is the expert on competition policy and has conducted several studies and investigations of the oil and gas markets markets. In its most recent investigation, the FTC studied each  segment of the industry after Hurricane Katrina. Guess what they found? No evidence of price manipulation at the refining level. To the contrary, they found a competitive market. Transportation sector? No evidence of manipulation. Inventory levels? Again, no evidence of manipulation. Gasoline futures? 
   You guessed it, Mr. Speaker, no evidence of manipulation. 
   What the FTC found was a competitive market that responded to the Katrina crisis by changing their priorities and shipping products to the areas that needed it. The FTC has studied the issue repeatedly, and has not found any evidence of price increases that were not a result of a change in market conditions or other factors that may affect the price. 
   It may surprise Members that the FTC is opposed to a Federal price gouging law. Why? Because they're concerned that it could do more harm to consumers than good. The Secretary of the Department of Energy opposes it, as well as the National Association of Convenience Stores, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Society of Independent Gas Marketers of America, the American Petroleum Institute, and just about every economist who knows that price controls harm consumers when they cause shortages. What is better, higher-priced gas, or no gas at all? 
   Mr. Speaker, I agree with the sponsor of this bill that people who take unfair advantage of others should be punished. But we already have laws on the books to address those issues at the Federal and state level. Now we are going to add a Federal standard to the patchwork of state laws for gouging--a term which has no legal or economic meaning. I believe it is unnecessary and fear it will return us to the 1970s gas shortages. No retailer will want to supply the market at a higher price and risk being fined millions and going to jail for years. And what wholesaler will risk $150 million in fines and possible jail time if they raise their price more than a competitor? 
   Mr. Speaker, I know many here would like to go home to their constituents over Memorial Day recess with a gas price gouging bill rather than address substantive Federal Energy Policy that might actually address the factors causing gasoline prices to rise. Republicans were able to pass many energy-related bills when we were in the Majority, though Democrats in the House and Senate voted against almost every piece of legislation that would have increased our domestic energy supply. 
   I can understand a visitor to California might suspect they are being gouged at the pump when they fill up in San Francisco for upwards of $4 a gallon, but that is just a result of the Federal, State and Local taxes and other state fuel requirements. If something is broken, Mr. Speaker, it is not the free market. This Congress must act to increase domestic supply of gasoline, not enact feel-good legislation that is ill-conceived and ineffective.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to bring a little bit of  openness to this debate and this process. Those of us on the minority side are not concerned about the overall scope of the Homeland Security bill. 
   Chairman Price and Ranking Member Rogers, I think, have done an outstanding job on the substance of the bill. But we are very concerned about the lack of openness and transparency on what are called ``earmarks,'' because the majority party campaigned specifically for openness and transparency on this particular issue, and this is the first appropriation bill, and there is no openness and transparency on earmarks. 
   So I am going to start a precedent at least for the Sixth Congressional District, which is the district that I represent. I am going to put my earmarks in the Record on this bill. I have two of them. 
   The first one is for the City of Arlington, Texas. It is a request for $10 million to replace all of the radio equipment and communication equipment for the City of Arlington Police Department so they meet the new Project 25 interoperability requirement. So that is my first earmark. The second earmark is also for the City of Arlington, Texas. It is a $2 million request for the Narcotics Task Force. 
   Now, my very first congressional earmark, way back in 1985, or maybe 1986, was to set up the first anti-drug Narcotics Task Force in Tarrant County. 
   I went to Jamie Whiten, who was the powerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I went to that corner office right off the floor and on trembling knees asked Mr. Whiten for $1 million to have the first anti-drug task force in Tarrant County, Texas, with the main city being Fort Worth in Arlington, Texas, and, lo and behold, I got it. So this request for $2 million is in a sense a continuation, an expansion. That task force has obviously expanded since the mid-1980s, but this is a $2 million request for the Narcotics Task Force. 
   I have also signed a delegation letter. I won't list every Member who signed it, but in Congressman Edwards' district down in College Station, Texas, Texas A&M is the home of a National Emergency Response and Rescue Training Center. I have asked, along with a number of other Members, for an additional $13 million for that national center. 
   Those are all my earmark requests. Under the new rules, I have to sign a letter, like every other Member, to Mr. Price and to Mr. Rogers stating what my earmark request is, and then I certify that neither myself nor my spouse has any financial interest in this project. 
   So I want to put these earmark requests in the record so that at least one Member of Congress is being open and transparent in the process. 
   I want to say something about the process. There is absolutely nothing wrong with trying to make earmark requests open. But it is disingenuous, to say the least, to campaign on openness and transparency and then not deliver. I happen to think Chairman Obey is doing an outstanding job. It is a tough job being chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Just ask former Chairman Lewis. But to have one Member of Congress responsible for vetting every earmark request, and apparently this year the number is 32,000, which is an average of about 80 per Member, which is an average of about 7 per appropriations bill, that is an impossible task. 
   Let's come up with some system to put the earmarks in the bills as they come to the floor. Let there be a debate. Some would fall out, some would shift around, but the American people would know what the process is all about. 
   Mr. Chairman, I include my earmark requests for the Record.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (TRUTH IN CALLER ID ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 251, the ``Truth in Caller ID Act of 2007,'' which I co-authored with my friend, Representative Engel from New York. This bill protects consumers by prohibiting the deceptive manipulation of caller identification information--a practice is known as caller ID ``spoofing.'' 
   Caller ID technology is an invaluable tool. Millions of people rely daily on the caller identification information that appears when their phones ring. Unfortunately, criminals are using ``spoofing'' to perpetrate fraud. ``Spoofing'' occurs when a caller masquerades as someone else by falsifying the name or number that appears on the recipient's caller ID display. Those who answer the phone and see the number of a legitimate company or charity are far more likely to fall victim to an illegitimate request for money or personal information. 
   Even worse, the Internet has made ``spoofing'' easy. Numerous websites sell simple web interfaces to caller ID systems that allow criminals to appear to be calling from any number they choose. Some of these services boast that they do not maintain logs or provide any contact information of their customers. Some even offer voice scrambling services to enable a caller to sound like someone of the opposite sex. 
   H.R. 251 prohibits sending misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the intent to defraud or cause harm. The bill is drafted so that it will go after bad actors, but at the same time preserve the ability to mask or block caller ID information for legitimate purposes. 
   This is an important piece of bipartisan consumer protection legislation. 
   I urge you to support H.R. 251, the ``Truth in Caller ID Act.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I am pleased to offer my support of H. Res. 455 offered by my colleague, Representative Melissa Bean. 
   The power of the Internet has revolutionized communications and affected the lives of people in every comer of the planet. It does more good than most of us can imagine. It's also no secret that the Internet also can be dangerous, especially for trusting children who go online without parents or teachers looking over their shoulders. 
   Studies say that more than a billion people use the Internet, and none of us need a study to know that some of them are wretched predators. In the United States, 35,000,000 children in kindergarten through 12th grade have Internet access. Of those students, 61 percent admit to using the Internet unsafely or inappropriately. As many as 47 percent of parents feel unable to fully monitor and shelter their children from inappropriate material. 
   We on the Energy and Commerce Committee are acutely aware of the Internet's value to commerce and communication, but we have also seen the evil that people can do when they use the Internet to attract and abuse children. And yet many parents and children are simply unaware of hazards that exist only one click away. 
   We want our children to feel safe at home, and they do, but that sense of safety can also cause them to let down their guard with the strangers they meet by computer. The consequences can range from unhappy experiences with cyber-bullying to tragic involvement in kiddy porn. 
   June is National Internet Safety Month, a time used to promote education and awareness of these issues and stress their preventability through an ad campaign. The campaign focuses on advice to parents in educating their children on the dangers of the Internet along with true stories of children succumbing to predators. It also provides important links and information on how to report an offender. 
   H. Res. 455, promoting National Internet Safety Month, commends national and community organizations for promoting awareness of the dangers of the Internet and providing information and training that develops critical thinking and decision making skills that are necessary in order to safely utilize the Internet. The House also recognizes the continued involvement of parents, educators, law enforcement, and community leaders as vital to the online safety of America's children. 
   Designating June as National Internet Safety Month reminds us that we should always be on guard to protect our children from potential online threats.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (ENERGY IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, most Americans think that Members of Congress are somehow privileged and above the ordinary everyday concerns of the constituencies that we represent. I think all 434 of my House colleagues know that that's not true. By normal standards, we do get a very adequate salary, $162,500 a year, but out of that we have to pay our expenses of living in our districts and here in Washington, D.C. We have the same expenses that every other American family has. 
   This morning, before I left to fly to Washington, DC, I opened our credit card bill. We have a MasterCard. And on that bill we put most of our gasoline expenses and our routine living expenses. And my wife, Terry, has been working very, very hard this year to minimize the amount of expenses on that credit card. And we've both made an effort to make sure we only put things that we have to put on the credit card. So the vast majority of our MasterCard is now for gasoline. 
   And I just happened to look down the list of all the gasoline expenses from the early part of last month to right now, and it added up to over $600. Now, $600 is not an extraordinary amount, but a year ago that same amount of gasoline would have been about $300, maybe $350, and 2 or 3 years ago, it would have been about $150. And now it's over $600. And that's not taking any trips. That's not driving to see our families. That is my wife and my step-daughter and my day-to-day drive to work, drive to school, drive to the grocery store, do all the things that we do in everyday living in central Texas. 
   Now, as I said earlier, I make a very adequate salary and my wife makes an adequate salary. And it pinches us, but we can afford it. But what if my wife and I were on an income of, say, $4,000 a month, $48,000 a year? Having to spend $600 a month for gasoline just to go back and forth to work and to go to school and to go to church and to go to the grocery store would be a real struggle. 
   So we have a situation today where the new Democratic majority in the House has come in promising to bring energy prices down and a new commonsense plan for energy. Here we are, with approximately 5 months to go in this session of Congress, at least through the election in November, and energy prices are up almost 200 percent, gasoline prices, since the day that our Speaker, Mrs. Pelosi, took the gavel from Mr. Hastert. 
   And the response to the higher energy prices, at least so far, has been, at best, symbolic. We passed a bill giving the right to sue OPEC. OPEC supplies about 40 percent right now of our energy, our oil, so we're going to sue OPEC if that bill were to become law. 
   Several weeks ago we passed a bill suspending shipments of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; that's about 60 to 70 thousand barrels of oil a day. There were great predictions that day that passage of that one bill would bring prices down $25 a barrel, and I think one Member said 50 cents a gallon. Well, the day the bill passed, oil prices went up almost $2 a barrel. And a week after that, they hit an all-time high of $135 a barrel. They have now come down a little bit, but they're still, I believe today's price is about $127 a barrel. 
   So I think it's fair to ask my friends in the majority, where is our energy policy to really bring energy prices down for America? I'm not happy that in my little part of America I'm having to spend over $600 this month when we pay our MasterCard bill just for gasoline. And if the projections are true, later this summer I may have to spend seven, eight, even nine hundred dollars a month just for basic transportation in Arlington, Texas. 
   Most people think that we're helpless, that we can't do anything about these high energy prices, that they're almost like one of the Ten Commandments. Luckily, and hopefully, the truth is not that; we have tremendous energy resources in this country that have yet to be developed. 
   We can do something about these energy prices, and we can do it with made-in-America energy. We've been debating whether we should drill up in Alaska and ANWR for the last 20 years. We actually passed a bill and sent it to the President that would have allowed that in 1996. The President at the time, President Clinton, vetoed that bill. Had he not vetoed that bill or had we been able to override his veto, projections are that ANWR would probably be producing in the neighborhood of two to three million barrels of oil per day right now. I say projections because you never know until you actually drill the wells and start to produce the oil. But there are huge oil reserves in ANWR. And the minimum assumption would be half a million barrels a day within 3 to 4 years of the go-ahead to begin production. And that's just one oil field. 
   If we want to go off the coast of California where we drilled the original offshore oil wells, where you still have oil seeps that naturally come to the surface, where you do have some producing platforms that were in existence prior to 1968, it's estimated that we probably have three to five billion barrels of oil available right there, and that we could produce another half a million to a million barrels just off the coast of California. 
   If you want to go to the east coast, where we've done almost no exploration at all because of various moratoria, if the Gulf of Mexico is any indication, we probably have billions and billions of barrels of oil reserves and natural gas reserves off of that coast. 
   We know that there is oil and gas off the coast of Florida that's not being drilled right now because of a moratorium. Interestingly, the communist Chinese are drilling off the coast of Florida through a lease arrangement with Mr. Castro and the Cuban dictatorship in Cuba. It would be ironic if the communist Chinese ended up getting more oil and gas off the coast of Florida than Americans do. 
   If you don't want to drill offshore, what about onshore lower 48? We have probably two trillion--trillion is a thousand billion--we have two trillion barrels of shale oil reserves in Wyoming and Colorado. In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, we passed a procedure to inventory those and to do an expedited permitting process of the Minerals Management Service so that they could perhaps come into production, but on the floor of the House last year this Congress put a moratorium on implementing those rules. So we're putting our shale oil reserves off limits. 
   So it comes as no surprise, if you look at all these areas where we've put the stop sign up, that oil production in the United States is going down. At our peek, we produced over 10 million barrels of oil per day in the United States of America. At one time we were the number one producer of oil in the world. That's down to a little less than six million barrels a day. We use the equivalent of nine to ten million barrels of oil per day just for mobility purposes. We're only producing in the neighborhood of six million barrels. 
   We have tremendous energy reserves in this country. And if we want to bring these prices down, we don't have to look overseas to the Middle East, we don't have to beg OPEC, we don't have to sue OPEC, we do have to take our energy future into our own hands and begin to produce more American energy. 
   It's more than just oil and gas, obviously. We have tremendous coal resources in the United States. We have somewhere between 250 and 400 years of coal reserves. We've got lots of research being done to convert that coal to a liquid, a diesel-like fuel that we could use to fuel our transportation fleet. 
   When we had the debate on the so-called energy bill last year in this Congress, the rules were set up so that no amendment on coal-to-liquids was made in order in the Energy and Commerce Committee, the committee of principal jurisdiction, nor in the Rules Committee, nor on the floor of the House of Representatives. So we passed an energy bill which I voted against because there really wasn't any energy in it. It had no coal in it. It certainly had no oil or gas drilling in it. It was basically a mandatory conservation bill. 
   So my statement to the American people this evening, Mr. Speaker, is pretty straightforward. We've got tremendous energy resources in this great Nation of ours. We've got the ability, within a reasonably short period of time, and I would say that would be 2 to 4 years, maybe 2 to 5 years, if we made a decision in this Congress to produce some of the energy reserves that we know we have, we could, in all probability, double the amount of oil  that we're producing right now. We could certainly increase it by three to four million barrels a day, if not double it. And if we did that, energy prices would come down. 
   On the world market, oil is a fungible product, which means it can move anywhere, it's a commodity. We have the ability, worldwide, to produce on an average day around 85, 86 million barrels of oil. Unfortunately, the demand for oil is about 85 or 86 million barrels per day, give or take a million barrels or so. So we have a situation where you don't have a cushion, you don't have a capacity cushion. And the econometric models have shown that if you don't have about a 5 percent cushion, which would be about four or five million barrels a day, that price is going to tend to spike upwards. And that's what we have today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. We have a demand-driven price because we do not have on the world markets enough cushion to dampen the speculation, so the American consumers are having to pay right now on average right at $4 a gallon. I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker, but I don't think American voters and the American citizens are going to be really happy if, in the face of these higher prices, our decision as a Congress is to just shake our fists and say we have the ability to sue the foreign cartel which we call OPEC. 
   So I have the ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee. I have been working for the last 6 months with a group of Republicans both on and off the committee. Several weeks ago, we put in a package of 15 bills. These bills, taken together, would produce more American-made energy for American workers and energy consumers. They run the gamut. I'm not going to go through every bill right now, but we look at the oil and gas industry, the coal industry, the nuclear power industry, the alternative energy industry. You name it. We take a look at it, and do something to bring into play American-made resources for American energy consumption. 
   I would encourage all of our Members of Congress to take a look at these bills. We are going to try to get them to the floor as quickly as possible. I certainly think that if we are naming post offices and are commending watermelon festivals and things of this sort that we certainly can find room to have some real energy bills on the floor and to have a debate and to, hopefully, pass those bills to the other body. 
   At this point in time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield to my good friend from Ohio, Congressman Latta. Congressman Latta comes from a distinguished family of congressmen. His father was the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee when I was a young pup. Our current Congressman Latta has come to Washington with the same common sense that his father exhibited 20 years ago. 
   So I would yield as much time as he may consume to Mr. Latta of Ohio.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio's insightful comments. 
   As he has pointed out, it's not a lack of American energy; it's a lack of willpower on this floor to develop that energy. What we need is American-made energy for America's families and factories. 
   To talk a little bit more about that, I want to recognize the distinguished conference secretary of the Republican Conference, the gentleman from Williamson County, Round Rock, Texas, Congressman Carter, for such time as he may consume.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I think you begin to get the point we are trying to put across this evening. America has got great energy resources. We are not using those resources right now. For various political reasons, we have put them off limits. 
   We are not allowing any exploration or production in ANWR in Alaska. We are not allowing any exploration or production off the West Coast of the United States. We are not allowing any exploration or production off the East Coast of the United States. We are not allowing our shale oil resources to be developed in the interior of the United States. We are not developing our coal resources with the clean coal technology that the gentleman from Ohio spoke about. So we are a victim of self-inflicted wounds in this country. 
   I would like to say that it can't get any worse, but it can. I was just on a congressional delegation that visited Europe. We went to Slovenia and to Italy to interact with the European parliament and then toured some NATO bases in Italy. They are paying the equivalent of $9 a gallon for gasoline, $9. So even though we think $4 a gallon is way too high, there are other parts of the world that are paying double what we are paying. 
   If our energy prices continue to go up, there will be consequences. General Motors just announced yesterday they are closing four of their automobile assembly plants in this country. Ford Motor Company, one of the icons of American industry, their stock is selling at almost an all-time low, at least a modern era all-time low. They just divested part of their company. They sold it to an Indian automobile company. The higher prices go, the more uncompetitive America is in world markets and the more Americans are thrown out of work. It is kind of a self-propelling cycle. 
   We need to do something about it. The good news is that we can do something about it. We have the ability more than any other Nation in the world to produce our own energy for consumption here in the United States. American-made energy for American families and factories is a doable deal. It is not a pipe dream. But we have to start in this Congress. 
   Now, we have a package of 15 energy bills that have been introduced at various times in this Congress. They are active. They have bill numbers. The Speaker of the House and the majority leader and the chairwoman of the Rules Committee and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee could schedule these bills for committee action, could schedule these bills for floor action and bring them to the floor. 
   It wouldn't bother me a bit if the Speaker wanted to bring these to the floor under an open rule; let Members of both political parties go to the Rules Committee and have amendments made in order. Let's have a full, fair, open debate in committee, the Rules Committee and on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   Some of these bills would probably pass on a suspension calendar if they were brought to the floor. Some of the bills would be very controversial. The access bill, opening up ANWR, H.R. 6107, would be a close vote, no question about that, but I think a majority of the House of Representatives would vote in the affirmative to let us develop an energy resource that could have as much as 10 billion barrels of oil in it. On a daily basis that would be somewhere between 1 and 2 million barrels per day with existing technology, if we were to make the decision to let that go and to start producing it. 
   We have a shale oil reserve bill. We have an alternative fuel for defense and aviation bill. Mr. Gingrey talked about that. We have a-coal-to-liquids bill that is Mr. Shimkus' bill that has a Democrat sponsor, Mr. Boucher, the subcommittee chairman of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. We have a renewable fuel standard bill that would take the renewable fuel standard back to the 2005 Energy Policy Act. We have a bill to encourage new refineries, Congresswoman HEATHER WILSON's bill. We have a bill on speculation that was introduced by myself. We have a boutique fuels bill, H.R. 2493, introduced by our Republican whip, Mr. Blunt. We have a bill that provides for some tax provisions by Mr. Terry of Nebraska. We have some bills on nuclear energy. We have an Outer  Continental Shelf bill that has been introduced by Congresswoman Myrick of North Carolina. 
   I could go on and on. The point I am trying to make is we have American energy resources that could be developed and I think should be developed. We are not hopeless, we are not helpless, but right now we have a majority that, for some reason, has decided that it is okay for American citizens to pay these high energy prices, and, as I said earlier, if we sit here on our hands and do nothing, the prices are going to go up and up and up, which is not a good thing for our economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, we are planning a series of special orders. We are going to continue to try to educate the American people on the energy situation. But we are not just out here complaining and whining and bemoaning our fate. We have a positive solution that, if implemented and sent to the President and signed into law, would begin to bring immediate results in the terms of additional energy resources and lower energy prices. 
   Let's work together. As Daniel Webster says in the saying above the Speaker's rostrum, let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote its great interests, and see whether we also in our day and our generation can do something that will be seemed worthy to be remembered by future generations.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to rise in support of the McHenry amendment. And I want to compliment the subcommittee chairwoman, Ms. DeLauro, for her openness and bipartisanship in preparing the ag appropriation bill and working with Ranking Member Kingston. 
   I asked Mr. Kingston, I said, have y'all held hearings on the bill? He said, yes, we held lots of hearings. I said, did you prepare a draft that was circulated in a timely fashion? He said, yes, we prepared a draft, circulated in a timely fashion. I said, was there an open markup where Members could offer amendments on both sides of the aisle? And he said, yes, there was an open markup. So I want to compliment you. 
   Now, I want to contrast that to the SCHIP bill. We've had one hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee in which SCHIP was the focus of Mr. Pallone's subcommittee. The bill came over the transom last Tuesday night at 11:36 p.m. The markup was scheduled, I believe, at 10 a.m. the next morning. Chairman Dingell did delay that until 4 o'clock the next afternoon, and then again delayed the actual markup after opening statements a little bit further. 
   We didn't have any witnesses testify. We didn't have any open process. We didn't have a circulation of a draft. We got a 465-page bill at 11:36 last Tuesday evening. So that's, I mean, I'm in awe of Ms. DeLauro and the way she's operated her subcommittee, and Mr. Obey and the way he's operating the full appropriations committee, actually using the process. We're not doing that in the Energy and Commerce Committee or the Ways and Means Committee on the SCHIP bill.  
   Now, I'm told, I don't know this for a fact.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I appreciate that gentleman's comment. But my response to the distinguished chairman of the full Appropriations Committee is, you've got to pick up your buckets where you stand. And this is our only forum. 
   I'm told that the Rules Committee is going to meet at midnight or 1 a.m. this morning to consider a same-day rule for SCHIP. Now, keep in mind, last Tuesday night at 11:36 p.m., after the House is through with its last vote of the day, we get a 465-page SCHIP bill that hasn't had any hearings on it, that hasn't had any witnesses on, that hasn't had a draft circulated. And now the Rules Committee is going to meet at midnight allegedly, or 1 o'clock this morning, to consider a same-day rule to consider that bill tomorrow. 
   So I respect Mr. Obey and I respect Subcommittee Chairman DeLauro for doing the process the right way. But our only recourse, unfortunately, under the rules is to come out on this floor under the open rule to strike the requisite number of words to speak on the ag appropriation bill and then talk about the travesty that may be hoisted on the American public tomorrow in which a $227 billion cut in Medicare over the next 10 years is going to be voted on, with not one witness testifying in favor or opposition, not one draft that's been circulated, not any process at all. 
   So I support the McHenry amendment, and I also support an open process on the largest health care issue that's going to be before this Congress this year. 
   We should not have the Rules Committee vote tonight at midnight to bring a same-day rule. We ought to send the SCHIP bills back to the committee, have a normal process, and then bring them to the floor later this fall where we could have an open debate in the full House. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to comment on one aspect of H.R. 1483: the effect of the designation of National Heritage Areas on the development and siting of needed energy infrastructure. Some of these National Heritage Areas fall within National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors that were recently designated by the Department of Energy. Development and siting of new electric transmission was an important part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and the designation of National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors is a critical component in getting that new transmission built. 
   Originally, there was concern that the designation of National Heritage Areas could impede the development of new energy infrastructure, even if that infrastructure were in a National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor. Bipartisan compromise language that has been added to the bill, along with language in the Committee Report accompanying H.R. 1483, makes it clear that the designation of a National Heritage Area should not impede the development of necessary energy infrastructure. Specifically, I understand that compromise language has been added to clarify that nothing in the bill ``alters any duly adopted land use regulation, approved land use plan, or other regulatory authority (such as the authority to make safety improvements or increase the capacity of existing roads or to construct new roads) of any Federal, State, Tribal, or local agency, or conveys any land use or other regulatory authority to any local coordinating entity, including but not necessarily limited to development and management of energy or water or water-related infrastructure.'' I believe that this language and the accompanying report language makes it clear that a State public utility commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should not consider the fact that an area is a National Heritage Area as a basis to deny siting of energy infrastructure. 
   I commend the bill's authors for including this important clarification.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I would recognize myself, Mr. Speaker, for 3 1/2 minutes. 
   Members of the House, we have before us a bill that proclaims to be one thing but which is, in reality, something entirely different. My good friend from Texas, the Honorable GENE GREEN, whose district has just been hit so hard by Hurricane Ike, made the point that under Republican majorities we only opened--his term was 8 million  acres and this bill pretends to open 300 million so it's a better bill. 
   Well, I would point out that if we put in the bill that you can drill anywhere in the Pacific Ocean beyond 200 miles or anywhere in the Atlantic Ocean beyond 200 miles, which is the international limit, that we could claim to open up for exploration literally billions of acres. 
   The point is we don't have the technology in many cases to utilize that. And in any event, there is no prohibition now. 
   What we need to do is have an energy development bill for America that makes it possible to develop the energy resources where we think we have the highest probability of actually finding and developing, in an environmentally and economically safe fashion, those resources. This bill doesn't do that. It simply doesn't do that. 
   I would have liked in prior Congresses when I was chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee or subcommittee chairman of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee to have opened up more of our domestic energy resources. But in those Congresses, we literally didn't have the votes. We did have debate on the floor, we had amendments offered, we had an open process in committee and on the floor; but in some of those cases, we lost those votes. 
   This bill, we're not allowed to even have the amendment. I offered a number of amendments to the Rules Committee last evening, and they were not made in order. This is a closed rule, you know. Why not have this as the base text and then have a number of amendments to see what the will of the House is? That would be a fair process. 
   This is not a fair process. 
   When the first title, section 101 of your bill, is a title called ``Prohibition on Leasing'' and in the very first paragraph, notwithstanding any other provision of the Outer Continental Shelf and several other laws, no leasing shall be allowed unless expressly authorized in this bill itself, that's not a pro-energy development bill. That's not a pro-energy development bill. 
   So this is a bill that pretends to be one thing, Mr. Speaker, but in actuality is something completely different. If we had any kind of a regular process where the bill went through the gentleman's committee, the Resources Committee and the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Agriculture Committee and the Science Committee so that we had these issues vetted, that would be a different thing. 
   This is a 290-page bill. Nobody knows what is in the bill in its entirety. None of this has been vetted. I think it will come as a surprise to some Members of the majority that you have mandatory random drug testing in this bill. I don't know that everybody on the majority side--I happen to think that's one of the few good things in the bill. But it is in the bill. Now, I have participated in floor debates in prior Congresses where we tried to do mandatory drug testing, and huge majorities of the current majority opposed that. 
   So, again, we've got a flawed process; we have a flawed bill. What we have is a title that pretends to be one thing and the substance of the bill is something else. We should vote this down and go back and have a bipartisan process. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would point out for those States that are not coastal States, if they have Federal or State lands that have mineral development or hydrocarbon development, those States do get a royalty share if it's public. Now, if it's on private land, then the royalty goes to the private landowner, but if it's on public land--State or Federal--and it's on an onshore State, there is a royalty that the Federal Government pays to the State. 
   We are here this evening because this is the climactic day, apparently, or evening on whether we're going to have a domestic energy production program for America that comes out of this Congress. The bill before us pretends to be just that bill. 
   The problem is in section 101. The first title of the bill is a leasing prohibition bill. There are so many prohibitions throughout the bill that, in point of fact, when you sort it all through, you have tax increases on coal because there's an existing coal tax that is set to expire in 2014, and it's extended to 2018. You have huge prohibitions against existing oil companies bidding on any of these new leases that might eventually come up. If you substitute Hollywood for Big Oil, that's like saying we won't let George Lucas or we won't let Steven Spielberg produce another movie because Star Wars or something like that made so much money the last time, which is simply silly. 
   We want our major oil companies to be out there producing and developing these leases because they're the ones most likely to actually find something and to produce it in a cost-effective fashion. I would point out that, for every dollar of profit our major oil companies make, they pay 3 1/2 times that in taxes. It's a 3-to-1 return to the taxpayer when an oil company actually finds, develops, produces, and sells energy for America. 
   The bill before us has absolutely no permitting reform. As Congressman Shadegg has pointed out, if you eliminated all of the moratoria and just did that and really let any area that's in the public domain be leased, it still wouldn't be developed because the national environmental groups preemptively file these lawsuits. 
   If you really want to have development and production, we have to do something on permitting reform, and that is not in this bill either. We really do need to be working together. Congressman Abercrombie and Congressman Peterson have developed a bipartisan bill that, I believe, has over 100 cosponsors, I would assume, equally divided between the Republicans and the Democrats. Very little of that bill is in this bill. 
   We simply must stop posturing politically and must really start developing good, sound public policy. The way to do that, in my opinion, would be to defeat the base text, to vote for a motion to recommit or to send the whole thing back and start over, I guess, next week with a clean sheet of paper. 
   Vote ``no'' on the bill that's before us.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New Mexico. 
   My comments on this last 1 minute are more on the process. I have spoken at length on the policy, or lack thereof. I thought it was ironic that we had Congressman Abercrombie and Congressman Peterson on the floor earlier speaking about their efforts to come up with a bipartisan compromise bill. I think they made a noble effort. 
   I went to John Dingell, the chairman of the Energy Committee, and asked if he would like to work with me on the Energy and Commerce section of the bill; and he said that, quite frankly, he wasn't able to do that. 
   I just asked Don Young if he was ever asked by Mr. Rahall to work on a bill in his committee, and Mr. Young said that never happened. 
   My guess is that if I asked Jim McCrery, the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, if he was asked by Mr. Rangel, the chairman, that Mr. McCrery would also say that he was never asked. 
   The point of fact is we have a 290-page bill that is being voted on the day after the evening it was introduced. There is no way you can have a substantive vetting, debate on this massive amount of legislation in less than a 24-hour period. And none of the relevant committees on a bipartisan basis have held a markup, have held a hearing, any kind of a legislative drafting session at all. And yet we are asking the 435 Members of this body and the delegates that are allowed to vote on the floor to vote on the most important domestic public policy issue before this Congress. 
   That is not fair to the American people. It is a disservice to the process; and for that reason alone, the bill should be voted down.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. First of all, all you need to know about this bill is the title of section 1 of the bill. This is title 1, section 1, section 101, prohibition on leasing. Prohibition on leasing. This is a pretend bill. This is a bill that has, once again, been put together in the dead of night. I was notified by my staff about 10:30 last evening that the Rules Committee was going to meet at approximately 10:45 in the evening. I'm not sure what time they did meet. We had prepared a number of amendments. We were led to believe that it might be a rule that if you had an amendment to the Rules Committee, it might be made in order. We were even led to believe there might be a Republican substitute made in order. So we were prepared for all of those, ``we'' being the Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   Of course this is a closed rule, which means there are no amendments made in order. There is a motion to recommit. It is a 260-page bill. It has over 100 titles. If this bill were to become law, which it won't, but if it were, there wouldn't be one barrel of oil developed as a consequence of this bill because of title 1, section 1. This puts a permanent moratorium in place on any area that is currently not under lease unless you comply with the very specific instructions in this bill. And amongst those are if you have an existing lease in the Gulf of Mexico that was authorized under the Deep Royalty Relief Act, I believe, of 1998, you have to go in and renegotiate that lease before you can bid on any of these new leases. This is a bad bill. It is a terrible process.

The day before the election in the last Congress, the price for gasoline in Texas was approximately $2 a gallon. The day Speaker Pelosi became Speaker, it was $2.33. Today it's  pushing $4.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I am willing to not speak at all if Mr. Obey is willing to take my amendment without me talking about it. 
   I was chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the last Congress, and one of the things that I am most proud of was that in the late stages of that Congress we passed the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act of 2006. It's a 3-year reauthorization act. It was a bipartisan, bicameral compromise. 
   Some of the House Members that worked on it included Congresswoman Mary Bono on the Republican side, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo on the Democrat side, Senator Enzi, Senator Kennedy, Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein, Congressman Dingell, of course myself, and many, many others. 
   One of the cornerstones of that reauthorization was a formula change in the dispensation of HIV/AIDS funding to more reflect where the epidemic is actually still in play in this country. Under the old formula you had one-half of funds based on a formula based on population, things like this, and then you had one-half of the funds based on a discretionary fund. 
   Under the reauthorization we changed that to two-thirds formula and one-third discretionary. But because we were changing the formula, we did put in a hold-harmless provision for the formula funding. 
   What we were trying to do was make more funds available to those areas of the country where the epidemic was still prevalent and growing, and less funds on a discretionary basis where the epidemic had once been centered but was now thankfully not as prevalent. The pending bill before us changes that formula. 
   Now, normally, that would be considered legislation on an appropriations act, and a point of order would have been reserved by Chairman Dingell of the committee, and all we would have to do is make a point of order, and it would be sustained. Chairman Dingell did not reserve that point of order, so I have to rise to try to strike it. 
   My amendment does not change the amount of funding for HIV/AIDS. It does prevent this reversion of the formula so that we would keep the bipartisan, bicameral agreement, that we would have two-thirds of funds based on a traditional formula and one-third of the funding based on discretionary. 
   Now, the effect of the pending legislation that I am attempting to strike, if we don't strike it, two cities will benefit, Newark, New Jersey, and San Francisco, California. Every other city that currently receives AIDS funding and HIV funding will be disproportionately disadvantaged. 
   So I hope that the House will accept my amendment, and we will keep the formula that was agreed to after intense negotiations where we have a two-thirds and one-third split based on formula and discretionary, and a hold-harmless on the formula side but not a hold-harmless on the discretionary side. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. In the reauthorization bill that was carefully negotiated on both sides of the aisle and the Senate, we maintained a hold-harmless provision for the formula funding under the bill, but we did not put that hold-harmless provision to the discretionary funding in the bill. 
   Discretionary funds are based on actual active case counts, how many HIV/AIDS patients you have. There is a methodology to determine how many of those individuals there are, and then the discretionary funds are distributed based on need. 
   In the legislation that's pending in the appropriations bill, the hold-harmless provision, which in the authorization bill we had on the formula side, is also applied to the discretionary side. The effect of that would be that an area that at one time had a large number of HIV/AIDS patients, but those patients had either passed away or been cured or moved out of the area, they wouldn't get to use the old patient count for their discretionary request. They could only count for discretionary purposes the number of active cases that they currently had in their area.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Under the old law, the funding was based one-half on a formula and one-half on discretionary, and the discretionary counted active cases and also cumulatively, I believe, cases of individuals who had expired because of the infection. Under the new formula that we passed in the reauthorization bill, we changed the formula to two-thirds instead of one-half, and we reduced the discretionary from one-half to one-third. 
   We did put a hold harmless provision in on the formula side, but we did not apply that hold harmless to the discretionary side. So we also had a specific hold harmless for the first year of the  new authorization which we are currently in. 
   The effect of the language that is in the pending bill basically puts hold harmless not only on the formula funding, which we increase from one-half to two-thirds, but it also puts it on the discretionary side, the effect of which would be areas which don't have as large a patient count as they once did would get more discretionary funding; conversely, those areas that 5 or 6 years ago, perhaps, didn't have much of an HIV/AIDS epidemic would be shortchanged.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I want to point out in the brief time that the gentleman from California still has, the Barton amendment doesn't lessen funding for this; it doesn't change the total amount of dollars at all. It simply protects the agreed-upon compromise that the stakeholders, the House, and the Senate on both sides of the aisle agreed to in the last Congress. And what the compromise was is, we moved more to a formula funding mechanism, two-thirds, and one-third for discretionary. And on the discretionary side, that is totally based on active HIV/AIDS case counts. It does not include people who have passed away from AIDS. 
   And the gentlelady that spoke earlier about the number of people in San Francisco that have contracted the disease and have passed away is totally right that those people, unfortunately, are no longer here. They should not be counted for the discretionary funding because you can't help them now.     
   We want the funding from the discretionary side to go to those that actually still have the infection.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I don't want to belabor this, but I do want people to understand what the compromise was. Those that represent, as has been characterized, the epicenter of the original contagion on AIDS/HIV, are protected in the compromise. 
   Two-thirds of the funding is based on a formula that advantages those areas where the epidemic started. And we hold that formula harmless. You can't have, on the formula funding, more than a 5 percent cut the first year. That's this year. Then next year you get 100 percent of what you got this year, and the third year you get 100 percent of what you got the second  year. So there's no drastic, there are some reductions because on the discretionary side the population centers are changing. And on the discretionary side, the compromise was not to have a hold-harmless, but to base those on actual active HIV/AIDS counts. 
   Now, if you accept the base bill and reject the Barton amendment, you're going to have two areas, primarily, I'm told San Francisco and Newark, that get more funding, and every other area in the country gets less. 
   And since all the AIDS groups supported the bipartisan compromise, and both Chambers did, I don't think it's fair to change that by putting something in a base text that there were no hearings on, there were no amendments on, it wasn't debated in the subcommittee or the full committee, the appropriations, it was just put in, and our only opportunity is to try to amend that bill right now. 
   And again, if a point of order had been raised against it, all we'd have to do is make the point of order, but it wasn't reserved. So I think what the compromise was in the last Congress is eminently fair, and was carefully crafted and, as Mr. Burgess has pointed out, worked out with everybody having input, and that the Barton amendment, which just reverts it back to that base compromise should be supported. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Chairman, one of the things I am most proud of in my service in the Congress was the reauthorization on a bipartisan basis of the National Institutes of Health in the last Congress. It is the first time the NIH has been reauthorized in over 13 years. It is the stellar institution for health care research in this country. 
   As a part of that reauthorization, I promised the stakeholder community that I would support increased funding for NIH this year, and I have done the best I can to follow through on that commitment. Unfortunately, because of the press of funding that this particular appropriation bill has, the NIH increase in H.R. 3043 is only 1.6 percent. I am glad that it is that much. I wish it were more. 
   The amendment before the body at this point in time would make sure that all of that money actually goes to the NIH. Sadly, a lot of the increase in NIH is going to be immediately siphoned off to two different funds. One is a global AIDS fund, which will take $300 million. The other is called a ``tap,'' which takes about $600 million to another line item outside of NIH. So what this Barton amendment would do was keep that $600 million that would be siphoned off for the tap fund and keep it in the NIH. 
   I am not opposed to the amount that the appropriators have increased it. I wish it were more. But at least I want to keep as much of that money that has been increased within the NIH. That is what this amendment would do. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute in rebuttal. 
   First of all, we are not talking about a small amount of money. The 2.4 percent tap transfer is almost $700 million. That is a lot of money when you are only increasing the NIH 1.6 percent, or $750 million. It doesn't make any sense to me to then take $700 million of that and give to other programs that have their own line items. 
   One of the programs that the gentleman from Wisconsin talked about has $329 million in its own line item. So we are saying if you are going to increase the NIH, congratulations. We are for it. Let's keep the money in the NIH.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, we honor the memory and celebrate the life of former First Lady, Claudia Taylor (Lady Bird) Johnson, and the contributions she has given to the people of a country she so dearly loved. I had the privilege of knowing Lady Bird through the White House Fellows program and as anyone who knew her as an individual would agree, she was a person of grace, charm, and an absolute delight to know. As a native Texan, a wife, a mother, a businesswoman, and First Lady, she emitted beauty through her presence and through her actions leaving a legacy that will not soon be forgotten. 
   Lady Bird met Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1934 and in seven short months, had captured his heart as he asked for her hand in marriage. Mrs. Johnson stood by her husband and supported his endeavors with a perseverance and tenacity that one rarely finds. When LBJ volunteered for naval service during World War II, Lady Bird stepped in and kept his congressional office running and except for voting, served the need of every constituent. She again came to the rescue in 1955 helping staff keep things under control when her husband suffered a severe heart attack while serving as Senate Majority Leader. The former President once remarked that voters ``would happily have elected her over me.'' 
   In 1960 Mrs. Johnson traveled over thirty-five thousand miles of campaign trail as she pushed LBJ towards a successful bid for the Vice-Presidency. During this tenure, she visited thirty-three foreign countries as an ambassador of goodwill. Lady Bird again stood by and supported her husband as he became the thirty-sixth President of the United States and helped console the hearts and minds of an entire country as they mourned the loss of President John F. Kennedy. 
   As First Lady, Mrs. Johnson was highly involved in the President's initiatives supporting education and working to alleviate poverty. Under her own ambition, she created a First Lady's Committee for a More Beautiful Capital which later expanded to include an entire nation. Lady Bird was also the inspiration behind the Beautification Act of 1965 which transformed the landscape of our national highways. Never tiring in her life's work, at the age of 70, Mrs. Johnson founded the National Wildflower Research Center which is dedicated to the preservation and re-establishment of native plants in natural and planned landscapes.  
   Lady Bird Johnson should be remembered by all as a person with elegance, grace and a tireless work ethic. She dedicated her life in service to others and gave so much of herself in support of her husband, family, and country. Today, as we celebrate the life of Lady Bird Johnson, we honor her contributions to the people of the United States and recognize that we have lost a great American that will be dearly missed.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (BREAST CANCER PATIENT PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Thank you, Dr. Burgess. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to rise in strongest possible support for H.R. 758, the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act. 
   As you know, as our distinguished subcommittee chairman Congressman Pallone has already said, this bill will guarantee that every woman in America in need of a mastectomy and certain other procedures related to breast cancer will have access to such care and, with her doctor's consent, will be allowed to stay in the hospital for up to 48 hours after that operation has been conducted. This is an important protection for every woman in America; and as Congressman Pallone said, while it is allowed in some States, it's not allowed in other States. 
   One of the things in this bill that I want to speak briefly about, Mr. Speaker, is that for the first time we put into Federal law a provision that says if an individual has a policy that's not a group policy but an individual policy and that individual has to have a procedure and the insurer, in looking into the primary procedure, discovers that there was some inadvertent omission of information on the person's health record that's not directly related to the procedure in question, then that person's health insurance coverage cannot be canceled.     
   I had a situation in my district, Mr. Speaker, within the last several months where a woman had decided to move out of State to take care of her parents. And when she did that, she lost her group coverage and she converted her group plan to a private insurance plan. 
   She moved, took care of her family, came back to Texas, and in a routine examination discovered that she had breast cancer. Her doctor recommended an immediate mastectomy. And when they went to schedule that, the insurance coverer began to go through her insurance application with a fine tooth comb and finally canceled it based on the proposition that she had failed to inform, in her private application, the fact that several years before she had been treated briefly for hypertension and taken some blood pressure medicine. She was no longer being treated and was no longer under medicine, but the fact that she failed to state on her original application that she had been in the past, the insurance carrier canceled her policy. 
   Now this is a woman who has been diagnosed with breast cancer. As we all know, if the treatment option that is recommended by the doctor is a mastectomy, that should be done as quickly as possible, yet this insurance carrier looked for a reason and finally found a reason and canceled her policy. Under the bill before us, Mr. Speaker, that would no longer be possible. The coverage would continue in force. And if it was discovered that there was an intentional fraudulent omission, then the coverage could be canceled; but if that's not the case, if it's truly inadvertent, it's not directly related, then you cannot cancel the insurance policy. 
   This bill and this amendment, if the other body passes it and it becomes law, literally can save tens of thousands of women's lives every year in America. So I am very honored to have played a small part in bringing this bill to the floor. And I am extremely pleased that the members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, on a bipartisan basis, included my amendment that I have just spoken about. 
   I urge this passage in the strongest possible terms. I thank my friend, Dr. Burgess from Texas, for yielding me time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I want to thank Congressman Graves for his gracious allocation of time. 
   I rise in strong support for H.R. 584, a bill to name the Department of Education headquarters in Washington, D.C., as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building. I am proud to be the primary Republican sponsor of this legislation, and I believe that all the Republicans in the Texas delegation have also cosponsored this particular piece of legislation. 
   I commend Mr. Green of Texas for being the primary sponsor of the overall bill and his tireless work on this. He has worked on it for a number of years now, and it is good to see that it has finally come to fruition. 
   I never had the privilege to meet the late President Lyndon Baines Johnson. I wish I had. I am a great admirer of his in many ways, not so much some of the policies that he pursued, but I am a great admirer of the enthusiasm and the tenacity with which he pursued those policies. 
   In my first campaign for Congress in 1984, I read the first Caro book, ``Path to Power,'' the first installment of that, and required all my campaign staff to read that book; because President Johnson, when he ran for Congress in the 1930s in the middle of the Depression, he made it a motto of his that he would literally search out the voters of his congressional district one by one, whether they were in the fields plowing or in the stores working or at church socials or wherever. He went where the people were to spread his message. 
   And I took that to heart, and numerous times traveled hundreds of miles to meet with small groups and in a few cases one or two people just so I could have an option. On one occasion, I went and met with a gentleman at 6 a.m. because he didn't think I would show up at 6 a.m., and so he said meet him at 6 a.m. when he opened his business. And I was there at 5:45. On another occasion, a banker in Houston couldn't see me. I waited in his waiting room from 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 8:30 that evening, and finally, in exasperation, he agreed to see me and, before I left, had given me a substantial contribution and agreed to let me use his name on my steering committee. Those were both things that I got from the way President Johnson ran his campaign. 
   In terms of his policies, the two bills that he supported that became law that had the greatest impact on my life were the creation of the White House Fellows program in 1965. I was a White House Fellow in 1981 and 1982. That is a program that President Johnson established to bring young Americans to Washington for a year to work in the Cabinet agencies, and then either go back to their areas or to stay in Washington. And so far, there have been about, I believe, 700 young Americans have gone through that program. Texans like Henry Cisneros come to mind, a former White House Fellow. Colin Powell is a former White House Fellow, Senator Sam Brownback in the other body is a former White House Fellow. But it had a tremendous impact on my life and led me for the first time to think about trying to become a Member of this body. 
   Another program that President Johnson established was the Head Start program. And in the summer I believe of 1964 or 1965, when that program was established in Waco, Texas, my mother became a Head Start assistant at Brooke Avenue Elementary School in Waco, Texas, at a time when my family was in need of financial income, and so she decided to work part time outside the home and went to work at a Head Start program; and, because of that, became a school secretary and spent her career in education. The impact on me that summer was, I was the oldest child, and it forced me to learn to cook, learn to clean and learn to take care of my three younger brothers and sisters. 
   I will never forget the day that my father showed up for lunch and I had been trying to make gravy. To this day, that gravy is still in the pan because it would not come out of the pan when you turned it upside down. That was my one and only attempt to learn how to make gravy. And my father said, ``From now on, son, if you need to make gravy, ask your mother to do it or ask me to do it, but nobody can eat what you are trying to make.'' So thanks to President Johnson, I never had to learn to cook, because that was one of the few times I even attempted it. 
   So I rise in strong support of this piece of legislation. President Johnson was a great President, he was a great American, and he was obviously a great Texan. And there are still people in Washington today that are effective in the political arena. People that come to mind that are still active in Washington, Jack Valenti who was for many years the president of the Motion Picture Association of America who came to Washington with President Johnson, and an attorney named Harry McPherson who is still active in his practice, he, too, was involved with the President. Some of the former members of this body, the late Jake Pickle, the late Jack Brooks, were LBJ proteges. And then former Governor of Texas, John Connelly, a good friend of mine who helped me politically when I was getting started, is another protege of Lyndon Johnson. 
   So I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill with Congressman Green. I think it is right to honor President Johnson with this building. He wanted to be known as the ``educational president'' and did many, many things to bring forth public education for our citizens.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (CHARLIE W. NORWOOD LIVING ORGAN DONATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman PALLONE and Ranking Member DEAL and Congressman Inslee for expediting consideration of this specific piece of legislation. 
   As I have pointed out earlier on the House floor after notification of Congressman Norwood's passing, he wrote me a letter the last day he was in Washington before he flew home to Georgia, and this particular piece of legislation was the primary issue in that letter. It is very, very heartwarming, and I am very grateful that the majority would move this piece of legislation as quickly as they have done. I want to thank them sincerely for doing that. 
   As has been pointed out, this piece of legislation will be called the Charlie Norwood Living Kidney Organ Donation Clarification Act, and it is in honor of Congressman Norwood, the late Congressman from the Tenth District of Georgia. 
   There are over 78,000 Americans who need kidney transplants. The average wait is over 4 years. Paired donation can create greater access to kidney transplants. A paired donation consists of a transplant candidate and an incompatible living donor who are matched with another similar pair so as to enable two transplants that would otherwise not occur. 
   The legislation before us today clarifies the ability to perform paired transplantations through the National Organ Transplant Act, or NOTA. This legislation clarifies that paired donations are not considered a valuable consideration. 
   This legislation has received the strong support of all the major transplant organizations, including the United Network for Organ Sharing, the American Society of Transplantation, the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, the National Kidney Foundation, the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology, the Cedars Sinai Health Systems, Johns Hopkins, and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons. 
   As a consequence of the legislation that Congressman Norwood and Congressman Inslee have crafted, we assume that at least an additional 2,000 organ transplants a year will occur. That is truly a gift of living that will keep on giving for many, many years to come. 
   This legislation, unfortunately, will be the last of many great pieces of legislation that Congressman Norwood helped to pass when he was a colleague of ours in this body. He was a true statesman and sincerely a warm, personal friend of mine. I will miss him greatly. 
   Before I yield back, I want to tell a story about Charlie and then read something into the Record. 
   Congressman Norwood always considered himself to be very prepared. He was always ready for almost any contingency. 
   The night that we voted the Medicare Modernization Act part D prescription drug benefit on this floor will be a time that will long be remembered because it was such a close vote and it took so long to get it passed. Charlie and myself and three other members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on the Republican side had been a part of a group to craft an alternative program for the part D prescription drug benefit. Some of our alternative program was in the final legislation, but not all of it. As a consequence, Charlie was listed as a ``lean no.'' He was in reality a ``hard no,'' but he listed himself as a ``lean no.'' 
   As we all know, when the climactic vote occurred, there weren't enough yeses on the board to pass it. So I went to one of the senior leaders of the majority party, I am not going to say which one, but I went to one of the senior leaders and I said, ``I think we can get Charlie Norwood to vote for this bill.'' They said, ``No, you're not going to get Charlie to vote for the bill.'' I said, ``I think we can, if you'll talk to him.'' 
   So I went to Charlie and I said, ``Would you talk?'' Charlie said, ``I don't want to talk to anybody. I'm going to vote against the bill.'' 
   I went back and forth. I finally arranged a meeting back in the Republican cloakroom where Charlie would discuss this particular piece of legislation. 
   Now, he had been a no, no, no, no, no for the last 2 weeks. So when I finally got the two parties together, Norwood immediately pulled out a list from his pocket. Now, he is deceased, so whatever the statute of limitations is has expired. And this Congressman, who had been a lean no, lean no, lean no, had a list of 10 things, 10, that if the senior leadership on the Republican side would consider, he would consider voting for the bill. Ten. 
   Obviously, that discussion didn't go too far, so he ended up voting no. But he was prepared, and he had a list of things. 
   Now, in that same sense of being prepared, Mr. Inslee has already put into the RECORD Congressman Norwood's statement on this bill. Isn't that amazing? I am going to read it into the Record. This is the floor statement in support of this bill by the late Congressman Charlie Norwood of the 10th District of Georgia. 
   ``Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also offer a sincere thank you to Ranking Member Barton, Chairman Dingell and Mr. Inslee for all of their help moving this bill. Committee staff, including Katherine Martin, John Ford and Peter Goodloe should be acknowledged for their aid as well. A special thank you to Nick Shipley with Mr. Inslee's office who worked with J.P. from my staff from day one as a tireless advocate to get this bill into law. 
   ``It has been said that common sense is the knack of seeing things as they are and doing things as they ought to be done. Well, let me tell you how things were being done. For years, people missed or were delayed in an opportunity to have a life-saving kidney transplant simply because a member of the executive branch couldn't grasp the  true intent of the National Organ Transplant Act's valuable consideration clause. The valuable consideration clause was meant to outlaw the buying and selling of organs, which everyone agrees is proper. 
   ``Now, there are two types of transplant donors, living and cadaveric, or deceased. As a lung transplant recipient, I benefited from the latter, but in the case of the first, a friend or a relative wanting to spare 
   their loved ones from death or dialysis graciously offers to give up one of their kidneys. Regardless of the method, both patient and donor must be biologically compatible. 
   ``In recent years doctors discovered that by using the simple database methods that we use in our everyday lives and business, a paired donation could take place with these living donors. 
   ``In the process of a kidney paired donor transplant, a pair consisting of a kidney transplant candidate and an incompatible living donor is matched with another such incompatible pair to enable two transplants that otherwise would not occur. 
   ``Now, I'm just an old country dentist, but isn't this just common sense? I want to give to someone, but I'm not compatible, but I can give to another patient. Their willing, yet also incompatible, friend can give to my loved one. As a result, two people live; two more slots are opened on the list for even more transplants to take place. Common sense, Mr. Speaker. 
   ``However, instead of every single transplant center undertaking this commonsense approach, some folks were denied the chance to be cross-matched and, instead, their loved one suffered and even died while awaiting a transplant. 
   ``73,652. That is roughly the number, Mr. Speaker, of people waiting for a kidney transplant. I can't imagine looking at any of those people and telling them `I am sorry, some bureaucrat 10 years ago inspired fear around the simple process to save you today, so you will have to languish on the list and hope for the best.' 
   ``I will tell you what: That is hogwash. Times have changed. Paired donation is saving lives today and will save even more once we get this bill done. H.R. 710 has the support of every major transplant organization, from the United Network for Organ Sharing, who will manage the national list, to the surgeons who will perform the transplants, to the patient advocates to the hospitals. 
   ``In fact, a study published in the Journal of Transplantation predicts a 14 percent increase in the live kidney donor transplants performed each year if paired donation were allowed. Moreover, for each patient who receives a kidney, Medicare will save $220,000 in dialysis costs. 
   ``In fact, Johns Hopkins just did a five-way paired donation where five people were saved instead of being put on the waiting list. Now imagine the good a national list will do. Thousands will be saved through simple common sense. Paired donation is the way things ought to be done. 
   ``How often can we stand in this well on this floor and know what we are doing will save the government money, improve patient quality of life and save lives? Not too often, Mr. Speaker. I can testify to that. 
   ``What the bureaucracy has failed to correct, this Congress will now step up and take care of, unfortunately for all of those who have not been able to benefit, not a minute too soon. 
   ``I yield back the balance of my time.'' 
   That is the floor statement of the late Congressman Norwood on a bill that, at the time he prepared this, he wasn't sure would get to the floor.     
   Yet because of his tenacity and preparedness and the willingness of Mr. Dingell and Mr. Inslee and Mr. Pallone and Speaker Pelosi, the bill is on the floor. I would urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. I do intend to ask for a rollcall vote and let us leave a living legacy of life for the late Congressman Charlie Norwood. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, before I close, since we have painted Charlie Norwood to be such a saint today, I have got to kind of get a little bit truer picture of him. 
   In the Energy Policy Act debate of 2005, there was a provision in the bill that was not controversial in the overall part of the bill, but it was very controversial in certain areas of the country. One of those areas was in Charlie's area of the southeast. 
   I had been working with him all through the debate to try to get him to help me forge a compromise on this particular issue, and he agreed that the compromise was the best public policy, but it wasn't the policy that his region supported. So he was in a difficult position of agreeing with me, the chairman, on what the good public policy was, but knowing that that was not a vote that he would be supported in taking for his region. 
   I went round and round with him about how to convince him to support this particular item in the bill, and he just flat couldn't do it. But I finally got him to agree that, at the critical moment, he would not be there to vote against it. In other words, he would be absent, meeting a constituent or something, and he just couldn't be there. He and I agreed on this, and our staffs had worked it out so that when the time came to vote, Mr. Norwood would not vote ``no,'' which would make me happy, but he wouldn't vote ``yes'' either, which would have made me even happier. He just wouldn't vote. 
   So, sure enough, the critical moment came, and the vote occurred. True to his word, Charlie Norwood was not around, but as soon as I gaveled the vote, he burst into the room, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, could I be recorded. I said, no, the vote has already expired. He said, what kind of hogwash is this and just raised holy cane, purely for theatrical purposes, but you know, the point had been made. 
   So his constituency felt justified in his support, and I felt justified in he didn't vote against me, and yet he had upstaged his chairman, but in some cases, that was Charlie Norwood. 
   We rise in support of this bill. It does save money. It saves $30 million or $40 million the first year and I think $400 million to $500 million over the 10-year scoring period. So we are going to work with the majority to find a way to put these savings to use so, once again, Congressman Norwood not only is doing a good thing, providing a gift to the living, but this piece of legislation, if it becomes law, will also save the taxpayers money. 
   I would strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, before I get into my comments on the substance of the rule, I want to put to rest a rumor. My good friend Mr. Markey is hobbling around on crutches. My good friend Chairman Dingell is also hobbling around on crutches. It is not because of anything the Republicans have done on the Energy and Commerce Committee. We actually like each other. It is just one of those years I guess for being in the majority and the burdens of leadership, is all I can say. 
   We have a rule before us today on an energy bill. There is not a lot you can say positive about it except that it is a rule. It is a modified closed rule. There are some amendments made in order. There is not a substitute made in order. 
   Now, somewhere I have a press release from the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, the distinguished Congresswoman Slaughter of New York, and I also have a press release from the distinguished Speaker, Speaker Pelosi of California, and they were talking about an open process, and when we had major bills on the floor, that it would be normal procedure for the minority to have a substitute. 
   So we took them at their word. DENNY HASTERT, the former Speaker, and myself and RALPH HALL, the ranking member of the Science Committee, and DON YOUNG, the ranking member of the Resources Committee, and Mr. Mica, the ranking member of the Transportation Committee, we prepared a comprehensive alternative substitute. We took it to the Rules Committee. We asked that it be made in order.  
   Chairman Dingell of the Energy and Commerce Committee supported that it be made in order. The subcommittee chairman, RICK BOUCHER of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, to their credit, said that it should be in order. It is not in order.     
   So you have an energy bill before you that doesn't have any energy. Nothing on coal to liquids, nothing on alternative fuels, nothing on oil and gas. There is a little bit of a cleanup section on loan guarantees for nuclear power plants, but that is kind of offset because you have to use Davis-Bacon to build them now. 
   So, all in all, what we have got is a big bill. Congresswoman Blackburn pointed it out and held it up. But it is kind of a where-is-the-energy energy bill. If they had just made our substitute in order, you would have had a chance to actually have a bipartisan coalition come together on energy. 
   There is a majority on the House floor on both sides of the aisle for a comprehensive energy package. We put it together in the last Congress, ``we'' being JOHN DINGELL and Joe Barton and others. We had an energy conference report that is now law that almost all of the Republicans voted for and almost half of the Democrats. Chairman Dingell signed the conference report, as did several other Democrats who are now chairmen and subcommittee chairmen in this Congress. 
   So if you want lower gasoline prices, if you want more refineries built, if you want LNG facilities sited, if you really want to see alternative fuels jump-started in this country, don't look in that bill that we are going to vote on because of this rule. We will send you a copy of the Republican substitute which isn't going to be considered, and you will find all of those things in our substitute. 
   I would hope that we could vote ``no'' on the rule, send it back to the Rules Committee, make in order the substitute, come out on a bipartisan fashion and actually vote on a comprehensive energy package. 
   What is in the bill is mandatory building codes preempting the States, something called green energy which is good in concept but which would require every building in this country by 2050 be a consumer on a net basis of zero energy, regardless of the cost; a preemption of building codes for manufactured housing which will probably put the manufactured housing business out of business in this country. And, oh, yes, if you are a small mom-and-pop air conditioner repairman, you are probably going to be put out of business, too, because there is a standards section on appliance standards which requires more efficient, which is not a bad idea in concept of air conditioning, which is probably going to be very difficult to implement and put at risk many, many of our small mom-and-pop air conditioning repair businesses in this country. 
   So what you have is no comprehensive energy package. Instead, you get a Federal Government, big brother, preempt the States, preempt the local governments on building codes and telling people what kind of light bulbs to use and what kind of air conditioners to use. 
   This is not my grandfather's energy package. Please vote ``no'' on the rule.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for my good friend from Missouri, who I believe was born in Texas. In fact, I think the gentleman was born in Waxahachie, Texas, so I have utmost respect. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have a GM assembly plant in my district in Arlington, Texas. The lease car that I use in my district is produced there. It is a GM Tahoe. It is a very good vehicle. It is made with union labor, which would make all my friends on the Democratic side happy. I am very happy with it. It has the engine in it that at a certain speed and under certain conditions, four of the eight cylinders stop working so you get increased fuel efficiency. 
   But I don't believe it would be certified as a low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicle. In fact, I am not sure that we have a definition right now in current law of what a low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicle is. 
   I certainly respect the gentleman from Missouri's intent on this. But I think it is premature. I think we need to wait a number of years. Let's see exactly how some of these new vehicles that are currently in the research phase turn out. 
   I drove another GM product around the Capitol not too many weeks ago that runs on hydrogen. That particular vehicle is not available for lease or sale right now. When it is, it probably will be a low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicle. But it is probably 5 or 6 years away from being able to be purchased or leased. 
   Mr. Chairman, again, we understand the intent of the amendment. The intent is noble. But the application and practice, I think, would be impractical at this point in time. So I strongly oppose the amendment and hope that we defeat it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, as our distinguished majority leader and the Speaker leave the floor, I would point out that the vehicles that they drive with their security detail wouldn't qualify for low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicles. I am not sure that we would want to put them in a low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicle at this point in time given the security needs and the needs for rapid acceleration in case there were some sort of an emergency. 
   Again, there is nothing wrong with the intent. But in application, all you have to do is go out outside this Chamber right now and look at some of the vehicles that are strategically placed and look at the security personnel that are inside those vehicles. 
   We need to be practical as we pass some of these legislative items that are under consideration today. This particular amendment, given the current technology and the state of the market, is not practical to be broadly applied. 
   If there are low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicles, and again, I point out we don't have a current definition, but if there are, and a Member of Congress wants to lease them or purchase them for personal use or lease them for government use, there is no prohibition against that. But we certainly don't need to mandate it. 
   Mr. Chairman, again, I would strongly oppose the adoption of this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of the time.

   This is a real energy bill. There's no gimmicks in it. I'm going to try to explain as quickly as I can what's in it so that everybody knows what you're voting on. But it does have ANWR in it, and I know that's controversial. It has OCS drilling for natural gas outside of 100 miles. It has a coal-to-liquids title in it. It has an alternative fuel section in it. It has an L&G terminal siting provision in it. It has a hydrogen research provision in it. It has a hydrogen prize in it. It would have been the substitute had a substitute been made in order, but obviously, as we know now, a substitute was not made in order. 
   So, for Members on both sides of the aisle that want to vote for an energy bill that actually has energy in it, this is your chance on the motion to recommit. 
   It is forthwith. So it would immediately be in play and in this body and could be voted on for final passage. 
   So I strongly urge the passage of the motion to recommit.     
   I yield to Mr. Peterson of Pennsylvania.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. That is correct. 
   In the brief time I have, I want to make one correction. I said the OCS provision was for natural gas drilling outside of 100 miles. I have been informed it would also include oil. Again, in the interest of informed consent, it would allow drilling for both natural gas and oil outside the 100-mile limit. 
   This is the real energy security bill. It's the energy bill that actually has a supply package in it. We're consuming more energy. I know we need to conserve. The current bill before us does have some conservation measures that are worthy of support. This also has a supply package that's worthy of support.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment and I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   First let me say that we're not opposed to all renewable portfolio standards, but we are opposed to this one for a number of reasons. First of all, it only applies to investor-owned electric utilities. It doesn't apply to electric co-ops. It doesn't apply to municipal utilities. It just applies to investor-owned electric utilities. That's one of the reasons that the Edison Electric Institute is opposed to this amendment. 
   It doesn't meet the standards that have been put out for renewable portfolio standards. It should apply to all utilities. This one doesn't. It should complement and not preempt State programs. This one doesn't. It should be technology neutral. This one is not technology neutral. It should provide credit for early action. This doesn't do that. It should allow for a national trading mechanism, including standardized monitoring, verification and distribution of credits. It doesn't do that. And it should include specific provisions assuring cost recovery for retail electric providers. It doesn't do that. It doesn't include nuclear as a renewable energy, and we think that it should. We think all hydros should be included. This one doesn't. 
   So, it is certainly worthy of debate, and I support it being made in order to be debated on the floor, but I would hope that we would oppose it when it comes time for the vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, since I have got a bonus of time here, I am going to yield myself 1 minute to comment on my good friend, Hopalong Markey's, comments.     
   If this is the energy amendment of the decade, what happened to the Markey-Boehlert amendment on CAFE in the last Congress, or the pending Markey amendment on CAFE in this Congress, or the amendment on ANWR in the last Congress, or the pending amendments we are going to have on the climate change bill that is going to come out later this fall, or the vote on the Energy Policy Act conference report, which is the most comprehensive energy bill in the last 40 years that has been adopted? 
   If this is now the energy amendment of the decade, my friends on the majority are not planning on doing much on energy in the next decade. It is a worthy amendment. It is good to have a bipartisan debate. Renewable Portfolio Standards are obviously something that need to be debated and discussed and continually developed. But I do not believe this is the energy amendment vote of the decade. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   We have had a good debate, Mr. Chairman. It is an issue that needs to be debated. But the amendment reminds me of a Hollywood starlet, and the authors remind me of a Hollywood cosmetic surgeon. This amendment has been nipped and tucked so much that it is hard to recognize the original amendment. It is still not ready for its screen test. 
   I would hope that we defeat the amendment so we can then work together on a bipartisan basis on a renewable portfolio standard that could be supported. If you included nuclear power, if you included all sources of biomass, if you included the entire United States of America, and you didn't exempt one from the other, if you included municipal utilities like the Los Angeles Power and Light Utility that Mr. Waxman spoke about, you might have a basis on coming to an agreement that could be agreed upon by both sides of the aisle and some of the people that are now opposed to it. 
   But this particular amendment needs to be opposed for all of the reasons that people like Mr. Boucher has said and Mr. Stearns has said and Mr. Ross and Mr. Boren and others have said. So I do hope when it comes time for the vote that the House rejects this amendment so we can work in the future on something that might be supported. I ask for a ``no'' vote.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I think that those of us who are Members of the House who have watched this debate have seen that, as we have actually debated various amendments, I've gone out of my way to be as supportive of as many of the amendments as possible. We have accepted a number of them with no debate at all. So it's not in any spirit of partisanship or anything like that that I rise in opposition to this. 
   In the Energy Policy Act 2 years ago, at the request and after extensive consultation with stakeholders, we put in a provision that in certain cases gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the authority to go in and arbitrate in some of these interstate transmission, grid transmission lines where the States have not been able to reach agreements among themselves. It's a very limited authority, but part of that does give eminent domain authority that is the intent of this amendment to strike. 
   We don't have enough transmission grid capacity in this country right now. We need to be building more power plants. We also need to be building more transmission lines to get that power to the market. This amendment, if successfully passed, would gut what we just did 2 years ago. 
   There have been a number of other attempts to change this part of the Energy Policy Act. The latest attempt was in June when Congressman Hinchey tried to strip out or gut section 216. It lost on the House floor 174-257. I hope that this amendment has a similar fate if it comes to a rollcall vote. 
   We simply have to have the ability in this country to move electricity from where we generate it to where we consume it, and in some States like Texas, Alaska, some of the large Western States, you can actually generate it in one State and use it in the same  States, which means you are transmitting it in intrastate commerce, but in most of our States, you're going to have transmission lines across State lines. So we have to have some Federal agency to serve as an arbitrator when the States can't agree amongst themselves. 
   And in the Energy Policy Act 2 years ago, we gave that authority, under limited circumstances, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I think it was the appropriate thing to do, and I hope that we keep that authority, and I hope we would, thus, oppose this particular amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me simply say that the Energy Policy Act requires that you go through the State siting process first, including going through the State court system first. If you have a problem there, you then have to get the Department of Energy to designate the particular corridor as an electric transmission corridor that's in the national interest. Then you go to the FERC, and then they go through a hearing process that then can be subject to the Federal court system. 
   What's in current law is carefully crafted to protect States' rights, to protect the local community but also give the ability on rare occasions to get a transmission line built that needs to be built. 
   I urge the defeat of the amendment.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I am only in mild opposition to this, but I am in opposition. I don't really think we need this particular study. It seems to be duplicative. It wouldn't be the worst amendment ever adopted on the House floor, if it were to be adopted, but I don't really think that it's necessary. 
   What I really want to talk about is the current Republican chief of staff to the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Bud Albright, who is in the Chamber behind me. 
   Last evening, the other body confirmed him to be the Under Secretary of Energy, and so he will be leaving in the very near future to try to use some of the great things he has learned from myself and Mr. Dingell and Mr. Boucher and others for the benefit of the Department of Energy and the people of the United States of America as the number three person at the Department. 
   He began his public service career with the Department of Justice, where he was a prosecutor. I got to know him when he came to the Energy and Commerce Committee as my general counsel on the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee back in 1995. He went into private practice for a time. Then, when I became the chairman of the committee 3 1/2 years ago, I asked him to be the majority chief of staff; and he has performed those duties in outstanding fashion. He has performed the duties of the minority chief of staff in an outstanding fashion. He will be leaving us to go to the Department of Energy. 
   I simply wanted to wish him the very best and tell him that he has many, many friends on both sides of the aisle in the House of Representatives. We fully expect him to comply with every Dingellgram and every letter of request for information and witness appearance list for the Department of Energy, which he will shortly be receiving in his new duties as Under Secretary.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, first let me say some positive things. I want to commend Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman BOUCHER for the number of hearings that they have held on this issue in this Congress and this committee. I want to commend them for the draft that they circulated earlier this year in which they attempted to put forward a bipartisan energy bill that actually had real energy in it. Unfortunately, the draft that Subcommittee  Chairman BOUCHER circulated was hijacked. I am not sure what happened to it, but it just kind of disappeared. 
   We had six committee prints that were marked up at subcommittee and full committee. They were artfully crafted in such a way that no amendment that dealt with energy was germane to the committee prints. As I said at the full committee markup, I am in awe of the parliamentary expertise, but I was not in awe of the substance of the actual amendments or the actual committee prints. 
   This is the first Congress that I have served in in which there has not been a bipartisan approach to energy policy. In all the previous Congresses that I have served in, whether you had a Democrat majority or a Republican majority, when it came to energy policy, we tried to be bipartisan. For some reason, so far in this Congress that has not been the case. 
   If you look at the complete text of the bill that is before us, you see things in it that have never been seen before in an energy bill.     
   There is some sort of a Clean Energy Foundation that is appropriated $100 million that apparently has the authority to enter into contracts, perhaps even binding contracts, with foreign governments. That is not from the Energy and Commerce part of the bill, but it is in one of the titles in the bill. 
   We don't have anything on clean coal technology. We don't have anything on oil and gas. There is in the Energy and Commerce section of the bill, there is something to try to clarify the loan guarantees with regard to new construction of nuclear power plants which was considered in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   There are some sections of the bill that deal with building codes, and one could argue that section of the bill preempts State and local building codes. I'm not sure that is the kind of energy policy that we really want to implement, where Washington knows better than your local government what the building codes should be. 
   There is a provision that says ``by date certain''. I think the date certain is 2050, that every building in America has to, on a net basis, consume no energy. There are some exclusions based on reasonableness, but there is no exclusion based on cost, including the building that we are currently in, the Capitol of the United States of America. 
   Can you imagine what it is going to cost if this bill becomes law to make the U.S. Capitol on a net basis use no energy? I am not sure it could even be done, but if it can be done, it is going to be enormously expensive. 
   For some of the reasons I have already outlined, the administration has said they are going to veto the bill. So this is really an exercise in sterile futility because this bill isn't going anywhere. I am not even sure it will be attempted to be conferenced with the other body. 
   This is not the way I conducted energy policy when I was chairman of the Energy Committee. I believe it is probably not the way that the current chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee really wants to conduct energy policy. This is really a political exercise to give some Members of the majority party a forum to put forward their pet ideas and pet projects. But it is not good for the country, and it is not good energy policy, and it should be defeated in the strongest possible terms.  
   Mr. Chairman, U.S. reliance on unstable foreign sources of oil is at an all-time high. The world price of oil set a record just this week. Refinery capacity is shaky and shrinking fast, and I remind everyone here for the umpteenth time that no new refinery has been built in America in more than 30 years. 
   Americans want to know when we will start producing more of our own energy at prices that real people can afford to pay. I want to know how much ordinary Americans have to endure before the Democratic majority takes any action that actually matters on cutting fuel costs to working people? 
   Take natural gas. It used to be cheap, but now it's expensive and we burn too much of it for the purpose of generating electricity. That's a big part of the reason that it costs so much to heat and cool a home, but people also pay extra in the products and services they buy because pricy electricity drives up manufacturing cost. Sometimes it even drives industry and jobs out of the country. 
   Coal is our Nation's most abundant energy source, but the Democratic leadership doesn't see it that way. They are mostly interested in astonishingly costly and barely viable energy sources rather than the cheapest and most abundant, and it will be ordinary working Americans who will pay the cost of their policies. Don't get me wrong. Windmills and solar arrays are worthy of our support, but so is the cheapest and most abundant fuel we have. Yet coal, whether it's clean or liquefied or both, is just not on the Democratic majority's political agenda at any cost. 
   Even the energy efficiency parts of the Democratic bill are more sticks than carrots. For example, nearly everybody thought it would best if air conditioners and furnaces were built to match specific regions' particular energy needs. Who hasn't noticed that the summers in Texas are a little different than the summers in Maine? I'm here to tell you that the winters are different, too. 
   Most of us thought that buyers should get to decide on the heating and cooling equipment that works best for them. But instead of giving consumers information and choices, we're going to punish retailers who have the gall to let their customers decide what they need and want. In the view of the Democratic majority, Washington knows what's best. 
   In 2007, our America faces energy challenges on every front, but on this sorry day, we're not going to do anything about them. We are engaged here today in what is laughingly called a debate about an energy bill. This is hardly a debate, and this is certainly not an energy bill. 
   I hope we can stop this nonsense and start over and get it right. I urge my colleagues to take every opportunity today to achieve that noble goal.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I thank Mr. Castle and Ms. DeGette. I also want to compliment the Speaker on his management of time. He has done an excellent job. I will say it is better to have him up there so he can't debate us down here. So I appreciate that. 
   Mr. Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives, I have been in the Congress for 22 years. Until the last Congress, my pro-life voting record, over 21 years, was 100 percent. One hundred percent. In the last Congress, I did vote for what was then the Castle-DeGette bill. I also voted to override the President's veto. So coming into this Congress, my pro-life voting record is 100 percent, minus two votes. Now, in anybody's book, that has got to be an A-plus. 
   I am going to support what is now DeGette-Castle because I am pro-life, and I strongly support the pro-life effort in every way. But having said that, when it comes to research and when it comes to stem cell research, I think Members on both sides and of all various persuasions in which your view is the pro-life or pro-choice issues, unless you think we shouldn't do research at all, and there are certainly Americans who do not believe it is proper to do medical research, or unless you don't think we should do medical research at all in embryos or in stem cells, then it is appropriate to have a debate about this bill. 
   Now, I hope the amniotic research works. I had a baby son, Jack, 16 months ago. My wife, Terry, and I saved his cord blood. It is stored right now in California, and if he ever needs it, it is there. 
   I hope that the adult stem cell work that is being done is successful. I am disappointed that so far the embryonic stem cell research has not yielded the results that we hope, but it is that one time that works that we are hoping for. 
   The Chicago Cubs have not been in the World Series, since when, 1916? But every spring they start out that they are going to get to the World Series this year. We don't know which researcher will find the cure to Parkinson's or the cure to Alzheimer's, and it may be through adult stem cell or amniotic stem cell, or it might be through embryonic. 
   Now, the bill before us would take the approximately 7,000 to 8,000 embryos a year that are disposed of as medical waste and make it possible for the custodian, the parent, the custodian of those embryos to donate them for medical research purposes that is federally funded. Seven to eight thousand. 
   To me, as a pro-life Congressman for over 22 years, the choice is: Medical research, medical waste; which is the most pro-life? Medical research that might, might find a cure for my mother's Alzheimer's or my brother's liver cancer that he died of, or medical waste that literally goes in the trash bin? That is what is happening now. Why cannot we make it possible to pursue cord blood, amniotic, adult stem cell, and embryonic stem cell? 
   So I respectfully, for those Members yet to cast their vote on this issue, please vote ``yes.''  
   Mr. Speaker, stem cell legislation has been debated on this floor before, and I welcome the opportunity to again speak in support of legislation to expand embryonic stem cell research. 
   In August of 2001, the President issued his policy on federally funded stem cell research. President Bush announced that for the first time Federal research dollars would be available for research using existing stem cell lines. Originally it was believed that there were nearly 60 viable stem cell lines, however, for a variety of reasons, that number was reduced to 22. Furthermore, many of those 22 lines cannot practically be used for research. This legislation will help create enough lines of embryonic stem cells to allow for science and medicine to progress. 
   In order to ensure that these embryonic stem cell lines are ethically derived, the legislation provides strict ethical constructs. The lines must come from embryos that have been donated, that were specifically created for fertilization treatments and would otherwise be discarded. Those donating the embryos must provide written consent and they may not receive financial incentives. 
   Understandably, this is not a simple vote for anyone on this floor. This is a vote of conscience for all members. In the 109th Congress, identical legislation was agreed to by a vote of 238 to 194 in the House and later passed the Senate by a vote of 63 to 37.  However, the House was unable to capture enough votes to override the Presidential veto this past summer, and the legislation never became law. 
   Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have consistently defended human life and opposed all forms of abortion. I also respect the need for progress in medicine that will help protect and improve existing human lives. My decision to support this legislation puts me one vote short of a perfect, 100 percent pro-life voting record, and it was not reached carelessly. It is the product of much personal contemplation and plenty of prayer. I have lost members of my family to illnesses that stem cell research might have cured. I have concluded that I am just not ready to require that sacrifice from other families, to watch lives slip away that could be saved. 
   Recently, a study was issued by Wake Forest University in which the ability to reclaim embryonic stem cells from amniotic fluid was demonstrated. This is an important step forward in stem cell research, and I applaud it. However, this important step should not preclude the use of other forms of stem cell research that could one day become a cure for many diseases that too many Americans suffer. The researcher of this very study has restated his support for passage of H.R. 3. 
   This will be one of the most difficult votes that many of us cast in this Congress. It is literally about life and death. It is about the lives and the deaths of real people, people we know and love. Regardless of our differing positions, this is an issue on which it is impossible to be insincere. I ask that we respect one another during this debate, and that we honor each other's views, especially the ones with which we differ.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to recapitulate the debate as I see it today and start off, as I've already said, with what the Republicans are for. 
   We are for reauthorization of the SCHIP program. This program has been in existence for 10 years. It is a block grant program between the Federal Government and the States where we spend approximately $5 billion each year to help States provide health care and health insurance for low-income and near-low-income children in their States. Some States have received waivers to provide health insurance for adults and for children that are not really in the low income. 
   We, on the Republican side, support reauthorization of the straightforward SCHIP program.     
   We believe that SCHIP should be for children. A Republican substitute, which was not made in order at the Rules Committee last evening, would limit SCHIP to children; that is, individuals in this country that are under 19 years of age or under. 
   We believe that SCHIP should be for low-income and near low-income children. The Republican substitute, again, allowed SCHIP eligibility for up to 200 percent of poverty. We believe that SCHIP should be for citizens of the United States and legal residents of the United States who have been here at least 5 years. 
   We believe that SCHIP should be funded without cutting senior citizens' health care, so the Republican substitute had no cuts in Medicare for our senior citizens. We also believe that we should fund SCHIP without tax increases. The Republican substitute had no tax increases to fund our SCHIP reauthorization. 
   The problems with the pending bill before us have become almost too numerous to mention. But just to go through some of them, first of all, the pending bill changes SCHIP from a block grant program for a limited duration of time to an open-ended entitlement. It has authorized such sums, and there is no time limit on the bill before us. 
   It removes the limitation on income at the Federal level. If a State chose to certify that millionaires were eligible for SCHIP, as far as we can tell, there is no restriction on covering millionaires, if a State chooses to make that certification. 
   There are tax increases in the Democratic-sponsored bill. There is a tobacco tax increase that CBO scores at least $52 billion. And there is a cut in Medicare that CBO scores over a 10-year period at $157 billion. 
   While there is disagreement among my friends on the majority side about this requirement, there are sections of the pending bill that removes the requirement that was put in place several years ago that States have to certify the citizenship of eligible citizens for SCHIP. 
   Of the 465-page bill that was produced in the Energy and Commerce Committee last week, three-fourths of that bill does not deal with children. The Democratic bill is not just about the children. According to the CBO score that we just received today, the pending bill before us in the SCHIP program, by expanding eligibility requirements, would add an additional 1.1 million children, and by adding enrollment within existing eligibility, another 1 million. 
   The SCHIP bill that the Democrats are putting before us, according to the CBO, adds 2.1 million children in the SCHIP categories, so that all the other money and all the other things that they are doing, it is not about the children. It is about a lot of other things. 
   So, I have great respect for the people that are trying to reauthorize SCHIP. I know that at some time this fall, some time in September or maybe in October, we will have a bipartisan effort to reauthorize and send to the President an SCHIP bill that he will sign. But this is not that bill. This bill won't come up in the Senate. This bill won't come up in conference between the House and the Senate in all probability. This bill will be voted on one time, and that is sometime this evening. And then it will just sit there. 
   So I would rather, as Chairman Dingell and I talked about back in November, the day after the election when I called to congratulate him on becoming the new chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I would have rather we spent this spring working on a bipartisan basis to come to an agreement on what we could agree on and bring before this body a bipartisan bill on SCHIP. That has not happened. 
   This bill was presented to the Energy and Commerce Committee at 11:36 last Tuesday evening and the markup was scheduled the next day at 10 a.m. It was presented to the Rules Committee this morning at 12:30 a.m. It was reported out of the Rules Committee at approximately 2:30 a.m. this morning with no amendments and with self-executing changes that nobody had seen, until we had time to look at it this morning. 
   There have been no amendments on either side; not just on our side, but on their side. So the only people that really know what is in the bill, and the only people that really have input into the bill, are those people on the majority side that are working behind the scenes in the dark of night to craft this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope we vote ``no'' on the bill. I hope we vote ``yes'' on the motion to recommit. I hope eventually we will get in a bipartisan mode, work with our friends on the other side of the body, work with the President of the United States, and send to the President some time this fall a bipartisan SCHIP reauthorization bill that is just about the children.  
   Mr. Speaker, today the Democratic majority will make claims that they support reauthorizing the SCHIP program and, by implication, that Republicans do not. I, for one, fully support reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program. I also believe we should ensure that the program is covering the population it was intended to serve, and that's low-income children who don't have health insurance. It isn't for adults or for bureaucrats who think adults should pretend to be children. It isn't for men and women making $100,000 salaries. And it shouldn't be an incentive to pull families out of private health insurance coverage and into a public welfare program. 
   States have used the gaping loopholes in the current SCHIP program to expand coverage to include adults and people with the kinds of salaries that are still a dream to most working people. Our friends on the majority think those are blessings, not problems, and that explains why they've written legislation that makes the list of blessings longer instead of shorter. Their bill is the first giant leap towards government-run, universal health care since Hillarycare collapsed under the weight of its own bureaucracy and deception. More bureaucracy? They're for it. More welfare? They're for it. Rationing health care? They're for it. A blank check? They're for it. In reality, the check isn't exactly blank. The CBO indicates that the cost of this Democratic welfare bill will top $200 billion, and that's only for Federal taxpayers. The States' share of SCHIP will cost the state taxpayers another $300 billion. 
   The majority would spend hundreds of billions of dollars saying that they are trying to cover low-income children who don't have insurance. That's not what CBO says. According to the Congressional Budget Office, of the newly eligible individuals, 60 percent already had private health insurance coverage. 
   Democrats say they are not raising the eligibility levels for SCHIP in this bill. They fail to mention that they allow states to determine income and they also do away with the block-  grant nature of the program by providing states swollen Federal matching funds, even for families making above $200,000 a year. Now, some will say I've got it all wrong, but if I'm wrong and they're right, show me. I challenge my friends on the majority to point to the place in the bill where that would be prohibited. Further evidence that this bill is not about low-income children is that their bill actually allows for bonus payments to states if they eliminate asset tests. It looks like they do want welfare for the rich, and the richer, the better. I ask, should a millionaire's child be on SCHIP or Medicaid? I don't think the American people believe so, but the majority's bill encourages it. 
   Yesterday, on the floor some members spoke about how this bill would pay for services for illegal immigrants. With no true way to refute that assertion the majority, in the managers' amendment that was released after midnight this morning, added a new section that states that no Federal funding can go towards paying for care for illegal immigrants. That was a nice restatement of current law, but it does not change the fact that this bill eliminates the requirement that States verify a person's citizenship before they are enrolled. If we don't verify citizenship, this new section is meaningless. The bill even eliminates the 5-year waiting period that legal immigrants must wait before being enrolled in Medicaid, effectively inviting more illegal immigration. 
   During the morning session, member after member of the majority rose to say that this bill is about children. I ask my colleagues to show me where in this bill limits this Children's Health Program to children. They can't, because the bill will continue the discredited practice of siphoning off money from children's health care to buy health care for adults. We had amendments filed at the Rules Committee to ensure that SCHIP dollars go toward children, not adults, but these amendments were banned. 
   The majority also says this isn't kids versus senior citizens, but Democrats pay for their enormous expansion by cutting $200 billion from Medicare. The Democratic bill makes a particular target of the senior citizens who picked Medicare Advantage, and takes over $150 billion away from them. That means more than 8 million of our seniors will have their choice in health care coverage sharply restricted. This bill disproportionately harms rural and low-income Medicare beneficiaries in particular since it cuts payments in these areas so drastically that plans will be driven out of these markets. 
   The draconian cuts that the Democrats expect the Medicare Advantage program to take will obliterate the benefit. Again, no wonder the Democrats kept this bill away from the public eye. It is hard to explain to seniors why you are cutting their benefits. 
   These plans are an important option for low-income and minority beneficiaries--57 percent of enrolled beneficiaries have incomes less than $30,000. These plans can reduce cost-sharing relative to traditional Medicare. These plans also offer better access to care--more than 80 percent of plans provide coverage for hospital stays beyond the traditional Medicare benefit, and more than 75 percent cover routine eye and hearing tests. Over 98 percent of beneficiaries can enroll in a plan offering preventive dental benefits. 
   These are our most vulnerable seniors. Yes, the Democrats would cut their benefits to pay for the higher income children and adults. They made this decision with no legislative hearings and developing the bill behind closed doors. My friends on the majority claim that they have had seven hearings on this. I would like to set the record straight that the Energy and Commerce Committee held one hearing on SCHIP back in February to discuss the general program, and did not discuss anything that is incorporated in this bill. They did not even invite the people who administer SCHIP at the Department of Health and Human Services to testify. 
   This bill was written in secret, delivered at midnight, and then rewritten from 1 to 3 a.m. this morning. 
   We have had little time to examine this bill, and we have found glaring weaknesses, I urge all members to be very cautious about what you are voting for because the rhetoric of the authors of the bill doesn't match the substance. The majority adjourned the Full Committee markup without disposing of a single amendment or reporting the bill. The rules Committee allowed no amendments in order. We have had more Committee process in this Congress on bills naming post offices. 
   It should come as no surprise that the majority wants to ram this through with no public process provided and no changes allowed. They don't want people to know what's in it, and they certainly don't want people to change it. They claim that they have to do this because the program will expire. They have had 8 months to reauthorize the program since the day that Chairman Dingell and I agreed that SCHIP was to be a high priority in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Where have the Democrats been? They claim that this is of the highest priority, but yet they sat on it until they could create an artificial crisis and then blame Republicans for daring to read their bill. I question why they would treat the reauthorization of SCHIP as a last-minute concern. 
   I feel it's important to note that SCHIP is only part of the Democrats' bill, which also is laden with attacks on Medicare and Medicaid. The legislation pits children against the elderly. It was brought here today out of the night, when no one was looking. 
   I urge Members to vote against this bad bill so we can reauthorize this program in a responsible, transparent, and open way that the powerful Democrat leadership promised to conduct the business of the Nation.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   To follow up on our distinguished minority leader, I want to say what the Republicans are for in this debate before we talk about some of the flaws in the pending bill. 
   We are for authorization of the SCHIP legislation. We are for covering low-income and near-low-income children so they have health care benefits. 
   We are for making sure that the States that are out of funding receive additional funds beginning October, 2007. 
   So we want to reauthorize the SCHIP program. We do believe that it should be maintained as a block grant program and not become an entitlement program. We believe it should be reauthorized for a specific period of time, not become an open-ended entitlement. 
   We believe that SCHIP payments should be restricted to citizens of the United States and legal residents who have been here at least 5 years. We do not believe SCHIP payments should be allowed for illegal aliens who have come into this country without the proper documentation. So we are for reauthorization of SCHIP. We are for covering our low-income and near-low-income children. 
   We disagree with our friends on the majority side on the number of individuals that we are talking about. We believe that children below 200 percent of poverty that do not have health insurance or health coverage today are in the neighborhood of 700,000, not 7 million. 
   But we do understand that if you raise the level to 400 percent, if you allow States to self-certify above that level so there really is no income test, we do understand if you do that, almost every child in America, 78 million children, could be eligible for some sort of SCHIP assistance under the majority Democratic plan. But if you restrict it to low-income and near-low-income children below 200 percent of poverty, we believe that the Republican substitute, which was not made in order by the Rules Committee at 2 a.m. this morning, solves that.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Well, progress is being made. Last night, if you mentioned the word ``SCHIP'' on the House floor, a point of order was made that you couldn't talk about it. At least today we can talk about it. 
   I rise in the strongest possible opposition to this self-executing, closed rule. I want to just recapitulate the history of the SCHIP bill as it's come through the House and the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   Last Tuesday night at 11:36 p.m., after the House had had its last vote, the minority on the Energy and Commerce Committee staff got the 465 SCHIP bill that was scheduled to be marked up the next morning, the following Wednesday, at 10 a.m. So that happened at 11:36 p.m. last Tuesday. 
   As we all know, last night the Rules Committee got the Ways and Means version of the SCHIP bill, I'm told, at 12:30 a.m. this morning, met at 1 a.m. this morning, reported out a closed, self-executing rule, with no amendments. What does that mean? A self-executing rule means if you pass the rule, everything that's in it automatically happens. There's no debate; there's no policy argument or anything. It just happens. 
   Now, this is from my friends on the majority side that when they became the majority said there was going to be openness; there was going to be transparency; Rules Committee wasn't going to meet at midnight; we were going to include the minority in discussions. Such hypocrisy. 
   11:36 p.m. last Tuesday night we get a bill from over the transom that's 465 pages. Midnight last night, or this morning, Rules Committee meets at 1 o'clock, reports out a self-executing closed rule. That is a joke. 
   Vote ``no'' on this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to read a part of a letter. It is dated February 8, 2007. It is to myself. It is from Congressman Norwood. It is the last official correspondence that I received from him. It says: 
   ``Dear Joe. 
   ``When you receive this letter, you will know of my return to Georgia after my decision to forego further medical treatment in the Washington, D.C., area for my ongoing battle with non-small-cell cancer. Needless to say, I hope things turn out for the best. 
   ``I expect to be unavailable for my duties for the foreseeable future. I do, however, expect my staff to continue working on several issues, even if I can't be there in person. 
   ``I will have my staff working on the Living Organ Kidney Donation Clarification Act (H.R. 710). This bipartisan, bicameral bill addresses the issue of paired transplantation, which is a way to solve the dilemma faced by people who want to become living organ donors for a family member or friend, but are unable to do so because they are biologically incompatible. In the process of kidney-paired donor transplants, a pair consisting of a kidney transplant candidate and an incompatible living donor is matched with another such incompatible pair to enable two transplants that otherwise would not occur. This bill is widely supported, has no known opposition, doesn't cost a dime, will save Medicare money, and will save thousands of lives. I urge you to work with Mr. Inslee, Chairman Dingell, and my staff to move this important bill forward.'' 
   I have checked with Chairman Dingell. He has assured me that he is prepared to move the bill if it is as he says it is. Knowing CHARLIE, always telling the truth, it is. So hopefully, very soon on the floor of this body, we will have the Charlie Norwood Living Organ Kidney Donation Clarification Act. 
   There are so many stories, but I want to tell one Norwood story. CHARLIE asked me and now my wife, then my girlfriend, Terri, to go down to the Masters Golf Tournament. I am not golfer and so I discouraged him from asking me. He said you may not like it but Terri will. 
   So we got to go down to the tournament, and on the first day we went to the tournament, CHARLIE was telling me how plugged in he was with all the folks at the Masters and how many people he knew and really he was really a major figure out there. 
   So we pulled up to the driveway to go up to the main clubhouse that you have seen on TV, and the guard at the gate said, May I help you? He said, I am Congressman Norwood, and I have got Congressman Barton of Texas, and we want to go up to the clubhouse. The guard said, Well, Congressman, you are not on the list. He said, I am not on the list? And the guard said, No, Congressman, you are not. So I started giving CHARLIE a hard time from the backseat. 
   I said, CHARLIE, I thought you were a big player around here; you cannot even get up to the clubhouse. So Norwood started giving me a hard time, and I started hoorahing the guard, and he said, Wait a minute; he said you are a Congressman from Texas? And I said, Yes, sir. He said, Congressman Norwood, you park right up there by the clubhouse. 
   So, for that one day, CHARLIE NORWOOD had a better parking spot than Tiger Woods or Arnold Palmer or any of the members of the Masters golf course. 
   He is in heaven now and my guess is he has got the best parking spot in heaven, too. God bless you, CHARLIE NORWOOD, and God bless you, Gloria, and God bless all your family members. You will dearly, dearly be missed.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for giving me a few moments to speak on this bill. 
   I want to congratulate the sponsor of this bill, as well as the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials on coming to agreement on this legislation. Their consensus work is the culmination of 6 weeks of talks among majority and minority Members and staff as well as affected private stakeholders. Significant improvements have been made that make this legislation workable from a realistic and practical standpoint. I support these changes and urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
   A hearing before the Subcommittee on Environment and Hazardous Materials made clear the serious domestic health concerns that elemental mercury pollution presents when it is mishandled in other, less developed countries. Specifically, this form of mercury converts into neuro-toxic, methyl-mercury that comes back to the United States in the form of tainted fish and polluted air. 
   This legislation attempts to break this global transport cycle by banning the export of elemental mercury in 2010. It does not cover coal exports and is not intended to cover fly ash exports from coal combustion, or elemental mercury in manufactured consumer products. 
   This bill also, importantly, assures that domestic stocks of elemental mercury--which currently are a valuable commodity--have some place to safely go. Under the consensus language we are considering, the Department of Energy--which has experience storing elemental mercury--is directed to set up a domestic storage option that will open when the ban commences. Further, the legislation does not preclude private storage solutions. I am glad that this bill allows enterprising folks to facilitate good environmental policy. 
   In addition, I am pleased this bill recognizes that we should not punish people who do the right thing. Under the legislation we are considering today, private entities wishing to take advantage of the DOE-sponsored storage option must pay DOE for the privilege, but in return are indemnified against any environmental damage that is caused once DOE takes possession of the elemental mercury. This is common sense policy and a key feature of ensuring that the proper handling and safe long-term storage of elemental mercury occur. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the Energy and Commerce Committee has produced another example of compromise, bipartisan legislation. It represents serious give and take by all parties. I hope that efforts like this will continue to be more the norm than the exception throughout this Congress. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1534.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (PROTECT OUR CHILDREN ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Virginia, the former chairman of the Agriculture Committee, one of the senior members of the Judiciary Committee. 
   I want to, in a somewhat milder vein, share the concerns that Mr. Goodlatte shared about the process. When I agreed to be the principal Republican sponsor of this legislation, I asked and was told that there would be a committee markup in the Judiciary Committee and that there would be amendments made in order. So I was a little bit surprised last week to find that this was going to be on the Suspension Calendar and expressed that surprise to Ms. Wasserman Schultz and her staff. 
   Having said that, there have been bipartisan discussions, negotiations. There have been changes made in the bill as originally introduced. It is a good bill. And I am proud to be the senior Republican sponsor. 
   This bill needs to be passed. I will agree with Mr. Goodlatte that it's not a perfect bill, and I'll agree that had there been a committee markup or a subcommittee markup and a bipartisan markup amendment process, some of the issues would have been addressed a little bit differently. I'll agree with that. 
   But having said that, let's look at what's positive in the bill. And let's compare the bill to current law. There are over 3 million images of child pornography on the Internet right now. Three million. And in the last Congress, as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, under my direct request as chairman, the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held nine hearings on the problem of Internet child pornography. And it's more than a problem. It is a vicious, malicious, virus, viral disease that has the potential to destroy our children. And at some point in time we have to do something. And this bill, the PROTECT bill that's before us this afternoon, is a good first start. 
   We found out in our hearings last year that the various State and Federal agencies didn't have enough resources. We found out that they didn't coordinate. And so this bill before us, as my good friend, Mr. Goodlatte, has pointed out, it does set up a new special counsel office in the Justice Department. And normally that would probably not be a good thing to do. But in this case, given the lack of coordination under current law, at a minimum, I think it's acceptable. And I personally think that it's commendable.     
   We give additional resources. Not one witness in our hearings last year said that there were sufficient financial resources. The bill before us authorizes, over the course of the next 8 years, over 1 billion additional dollars to fight this infestation of child pornography. It sets up an additional $400 million to increase funding over the next 8 years for the Federal law enforcement agencies: the FBI's Innocent Images Unit, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the United States Postal Service. These are the Federal agencies that are at the forefront in investigating Internet child pornography. 
   The bill also authorizes increased funding for new forensic computer laboratories. One of the things that we found out is that there just wasn't enough law enforcement laboratory capability in terms of forensics to track down the information that was being provided by the agents in the field. This bill recommends and authorizes an additional $7 million each year for 2008 through 2015 for new national forensic computer laboratories. 
   We also found out, as I pointed out, that some of these task forces that have been set up and are well intentioned simply didn't have the resources that they needed. So the bill before us authorizes over $600 million over the next 8 years on a staggered basis for these Internet Crimes Against Children, or ICAC, task forces. That is a huge improvement over the current situation, and I don't think any Member of Congress is going to oppose that. 
   This bill provides additional funding for Federal and State law enforcement, greater coordination of the overall United States law enforcement effort at both the State, Federal, and local level. It establishes a Special Counsel office that I have already talked about. And I want to comment on that. 
   I agree with what Mr. Goodlatte said that the current task force in the current system in terms of allocating resources is doing an acceptable job. So the Special Counsel will coordinate with them. The Special Counsel will have the ability to sign off, but it doesn't have the ability to unilaterally decide where these additional funds are going to go for the very reasons that Mr. Goodlatte said in his statement a few minutes ago. 
   The bill before us brings additional resources that are vitally needed to the fight against the scourge of child pornography on the Internet. Almost all of us have children or grandchildren. And  when you go on the Internet today and you type in www.snowwhite.com, you may well get a pornographic child pornography site. Now, that's unacceptable. It's unacceptable to every Member on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the other body, our friends on the other side of this Capitol. 
   This bill before us may not be a perfect bill, but it is time to act. It is a good start. Anything can be improved. 
   Again, I respect the process questions that have been raised. I have some of those same questions about some issues under the committee that I serve on as jurisdiction. But in this case it really is time to protect our children. It really is time to move forward. And if we have a roll call vote, I hope every Member of the House of Representatives votes ``yes'' on the PROTECT Act because it is a huge step forward in protecting our children. 
   I thank my good friend Mr. Goodlatte for yielding to me.  
   Thank you, Congresswoman WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ, for your hard work and dedication to this bill. 
   Almost 2 years ago, the Energy and Commerce Committee began a wide-ranging investigation of Internet child pornography. During our investigation, we had nine hearings and interviewed numerous witnesses involved in the fight against child sexual exploitation: Federal and local law enforcement, Federal and local prosecutors, victims, educators, Internet service providers, and financial institutions. 
   This investigation helped expose the epidemic that is Internet child pornography. At that time, we learned that the Internet contained approximately three million images of child pornography. Law enforcement testified to the Committee that the images were becoming increasingly violent in nature, and that the victims in the photos were getting younger, some as young as 2 years old. 
   Although law enforcement is working to tackle the epidemic of abuse that exists on the Internet, their resources are taxed, because predators around the world are working just as diligently to continue flooding the Internet with images of child sexual abuse. 
   I am proud to be the lead cosponsor of the PROTECT Act, because this bill provides the resources that are so desperately needed by law enforcement to take the fight to those predators who seek to exploit and abuse children, often for their own financial gain. We will never win the battle against the sexual exploitation of children unless we arm law enforcement with the necessary resources and tools to bring these predators to justice. 
   First, the PROTECT Act authorizes, over fiscal years 2008 to 2015, $400,000,000 in increased funding to the Federal law enforcement agencies--FBI's Innocent Images Unit, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the United States Postal Service--that are at the forefront in investigating Internet child pornography. The funding is directed for the hiring of additional, full-time agents to work child exploitation cases. 
   The bill also authorizes increased funding for forensic computer labs. One of the key findings in the Energy and Commerce Committee's investigation of Internet child pornography is that law enforcement investigations were often hampered by the backlog at forensic computer labs. This backlog sometimes made it difficult for law enforcement to identify predators or obtain subpoenas in a timely manner--a delay that endangers the welfare and safety of the victims of Internet child pornography. To address this problem, the PROTECT Act authorizes $7,000,000 for fiscal years 2008 to 2015 for new regional forensic computer labs. 
   The Energy and Commerce Committee's investigation also found that just as important as the Federal law enforcement effort against child pornography is the effort of State and local law enforcement, in particular, the effort of the state Internet Crimes Against Children, or ICAC task forces. In fact, 70 percent of the cases involving the sexual exploitation of children over the Internet are prosecuted at the state level. While the Department of Justice has provided funding for these ICACs through a grant program, the funding nowhere near matched the needs of these state task forces. 
   Now, through the PROTECT Act, these task forces will finally receive the support they need. The bill authorizes over $600,000,0000 in new funding for ICACs over fiscal years 2008 to 2015. I believe the PROTECT Act's formula for allocating this funding among states strikes the right balance between ensuring a stable base of funding for the individual ICACs and giving the Justice Department the flexibility to direct funds based on need. 
   Not only does the bill provide additional funding for Federal and State law enforcement, it also provides greater coordination of the overall United States law enforcement effort--Federal, State, and local--to investigate and prosecute child sexual exploitation crimes. The bill establishes a Special Counsel office within the Justice Department that is charged with coordinating the efforts and strategy of the Department of Justice and Federal and State law enforcement agencies when investigating child exploitation crimes. While I do not believe that the creation of a new Federal office is always the best solution to a problem, in this instance, I believe that this office will help to ensure that the various law enforcement agencies are receiving the assistance they need and are coordinating their investigations in a way that ensures their valuable resources are not being wasted. 
   This bill brings incredible resources to bear in the fight against child sexual exploitation. We must ensure that the efforts of predators are more than matched by an aggressive law enforcement strategy to bring these criminals to justice. Our children deserve nothing less. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support the PROTECT Act and make the Internet a safer place for our children.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (911 MODERNIZATION AND PUBLIC SAFETY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3403, the ``911 Modernization and Public Safety Act of 2007.'' 
   Each time a new communications technology arrives on the market, we must adapt our 911 system and our laws to accommodate it. In 1999, Congress passed the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act to ensure that emergency 911 calls made from wireless phones would go to the nearest Public Safety Answering Point or ``PSAP''. 
   Today, Voice-over-Internet-Protocol is revolutionizing the way we communicate by adding the flexibility and innovation of the Internet to the traditional phone call. However, unlike wireless carriers, VoIP providers have no rights to interconnect with the 911 infrastructure and only a handful of 911 centers were prepared to receive VoIP calls, until recently. This left VoIP providers with no easy way to deliver 911 or E-911 service to their subscribers. 
   After people using VoIP phones were unable to call 911 when they needed help, the FCC responded in June 2005 by requiring VoIP providers to incorporate E-911 capability into their service. While this forced VoIP providers to deploy E-911 access to almost all of their subscribers through commercial agreements with third parties, the FCC did not have the authority to address all of the important issues. 
   That is why the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed H.R. 3403. This bill seeks to better ensure that consumers using VoIP service can access enhanced 911 emergency services. It puts VoIP providers on the same legal footing as wireless carriers and gives providers the same access as wireless, at the same rates, terms and conditions. It gives VoIP carriers and PSAPs receiving the VoIP 911 calls the same liability protection that is afforded to wireless calls. The bill allows VoIP providers to join wireless carriers in a narrow exemption from the Customer Proprietary Network Information Laws, so that they can transmit customer name and location information during an emergency call. The bill also allows the FCC to delegate to states enforcement of regulations implementing VoIP 911, without disrupting the interstate nature of VoIP service. 
   In addition to ensuring the success of VoIP E-911, H.R. 3403 takes strong steps to improve our 911 system going forward. First, the bill will stop states from raiding their 911 funds by prohibiting states from spending the 911 line-item fee they collect on phone bills for any purpose other than improvements to the 911 system. Second, the bill directs the E-911 Coordination and Implementation Office to develop a nationwide migration plan to an IP-enabled network. An Internet-based emergency network will enhance public safety by allowing for greater flexibility in the types and amount of information that may be transmitted to emergency service providers. Finally, H.R. 3403 alters an existing grant program to allow PSAPs to obtain federal funding for IP-enabled emergency networks. 
   H.R. 3403, the ``911 Modernization and Public Safety Act of 2007'' is about public safety. I want to praise the work of the bill's sponsor, Congressman Bart Gordon, who has provided strong leadership in addressing the VoIP E-911 challenge. I also commend the House co-chairs of the Congressional E-911 Caucus: Congresswoman Eshoo and Congressman Shimkus, for their determined work to advance all 911 issues. I would also like to thank the Telecommunications Subcommittee Chairman Mr. Ed Markey and the chairman of the full committee, Mr. John Dingell, and their staffs, for their leadership and commitment to working with our side in a bipartisan fashion on this bill. 
   H.R. 3403 is an important piece of legislation and I urge my colleagues to vote for it to become law.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, there is politics being played in this body this afternoon, but it's not by the President of the United States. 
   When the SCHIP bill was up for reauthorization back in early September, people like myself asked that we have a regular process, have some time to review the bill, have some markups, learn what was in it, since we had gotten it the night before about midnight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. At that time, we were told that we didn't have time for that, that we had to move that bill before September 30 so that the children of America wouldn't lose their health insurance. Well, that bill, the CHAMP Act, passed this body. It never was brought up in the other body. Thankfully, it is gone. So you would think that with the continuing resolution that passed last week, we would now have some time to look at the SCHIP issue on a bipartisan basis here in the House and come up with a compromise that could be passed and signed by the President before the continuing resolution expires on, I think, November 16. 
   What we are being told today is that since the President vetoed the bill, we don't want to vote on the veto today, we want to postpone it, I believe, until October 18. Now, why is that? If it was such a rush last month, you would think that it would still be a rush now and they would want to get the veto out of the way and then work together to come up with a bill that the President would sign. So it would seem to me that the Democrats are saying, Well, let's have a 2-week period here to try to play politics with this. 
   I think that is wrong. I checked with the Parliamentarian about when was the last time a motion to postpone a veto was authorized by the House. It is not done very often. The last time was 1996. So I would hope we would defeat this motion to postpone and let me offer a substitute motion to refer the veto to the committee of jurisdiction. We then could have a process, have a bipartisan compromise, and bring it up within 2 weeks and vote for it, send it  to the other body and send it to the President, and I bet he would sign it. That is what we should be doing, not voting to postpone a veto vote which we know when that veto vote comes, we will sustain the President's veto. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds. 
   Our speaker talked about Texas's rank in terms of SCHIP. In the first year that SCHIP was in law, Texas is a biennial State in terms of its legislature so we weren't able to get the program up and running. But in the second biennium, we did get it up and running under then-Governor Bush's leadership. Texas now ranks third in terms of the number of absolute children, and I would say in the top five in terms of percentage of eligible children, under SCHIP.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker and distinguished Members of the House of Representatives, I have in my hand a letter dated September 27 from myself and the majority of the Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee asking Speaker Pelosi to refer the SCHIP bill to the Energy and Commerce Committee so that we truly could have a bipartisan compromise. 
   If we could defeat this motion to postpone the veto, we could then move to a motion to refer the bill to the committee and honor the letter that I have sent to our distinguished Speaker. 
   We are going to sustain the President's veto whenever that vote occurs. In the history of the Republic, there have been over 2,000 vetoes of bills. Only 106 of those vetoes have been overridden. This will not be 107. 
   We will sustain the veto when that vote occurs and then hopefully we will begin the bipartisan process that should have begun back in January when the new majority took over. 
   When that day comes, the debate is not going to be about whether there should be a SCHIP program. There should be. The debate is not going to be whether we should cover low-income children. We already do that under Medicaid. The debate is not going to be whether we should cover children between 100 and 200 percent of poverty. We already do that. 
   The debate is going to be, should we cover adults? Most Republicans say no, we should not cover adults. The debate is going to be about illegal residents of our country. Should we cover illegal residents? Most Republicans are going to say no. I am not sure what our friends on the majority side are going to say. They may say no, they may say yes, they may say both. We are going to have that debate. 
   There are 78 million children in America. As far as we can tell, when you compare the numbers between the majority side and the minority side and the President's numbers, we are really having the debate about between 1.2 million and 800,000 children in America today that for some reason are not covered, and they fall within the income eligibility levels that we all tend to agree on, which is at least up to 200 percent, maybe 250 percent of poverty. 
   So we will focus the debate at some point in time, and at that point in time, we will have a bipartisan compromise. The President wants to reauthorize SCHIP. The Republicans want to reauthorize SCHIP. We just don't want to cover high-income Americans, we don't want to cover illegal residents, and we, the Republicans, don't want to cover adults. 
   Let's vote not to postpone the veto. Let's have the veto today and then begin the process that should have begun back in January of this year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, everybody has said all that needs to be said on this debate; we just haven't said it this third or fourth time that we are here on the House floor. 
   As the minority leader pointed out, at some point in time it still may be possible to reach a consensus on reauthorizing the SCHIP program because people on both sides of the aisle want to keep the program moving forward. The problem that most Republicans have is that we support the base program for near low-income children between 100 and 200 percent of poverty. We don't think that the SCHIP program, which was a children's health program, should be for adults. We don't think it should be for illegal aliens. We think it should be for children between 100 percent to 200 percent of poverty, and perhaps slightly higher than that if a good-faith effort has been made to cover children in that income bracket. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle appear to want to use this as a surrogate for universal health care. In some versions, the original version that came out in the CHAMP bill, they wanted to go as high as 300 and 400 percent of poverty. They continue, although they say they don't want to cover noncitizens, they won't agree to enforcement measures that make that possible. And they don't want adults on the program to have to exit the program in some reasonable time period, so we have the impasse that we have today. 
   There haven't been many times in our Nation's history that we have postponed a veto override. I think less than 10 percent of the time, maybe even less than 5 percent of the time, but we have done it twice in a row on this particular bill. So we will postpone the bill until the week of the President's State of the Union so there can be more political posturing on the majority side right before the President comes before a joint session of Congress. 
   This majority is right to try to postpone that vote to that time. It would be better if we went ahead and voted on it tonight, sustained the President's veto tonight so we could then hopefully continue work or start working in a bipartisan way to actually get an SCHIP reauthorization that was more than a 1-month extension at a time. 
   If we have the vote tonight, the President's veto will be sustained. When we have the vote in January, the President's veto will be sustained. At some point in time we may yet get together and try to work out a compromise that both sides can agree to and have a 435-Member vote. Apparently that will not be any time in the near future.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I respect the gentleman from Illinois. I think we should do more of this, quite frankly. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm going to yield myself such time as I may consume now to respond to my good friend from Illinois. I was in the House when SCHIP was passed. I was not in the leadership, but I was on the committee. My recollection is a little bit different than my friend from Illinois. 
   There were some Republicans, I think Senator Hatch was one of the ones in the Senate; Congressman Archer, who was the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. This did come out of the effort to reform welfare as it was then. There was a concern that as we tried to move primarily women who were single head of households off of welfare, if they didn't have a job that had health care, their children, in order for them to work, transition to work, that they needed health care. And President Clinton and the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate did agree that SCHIP was the answer. And it was a bipartisan agreement. I would give the President credit for supporting it, but I would also give the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate credit for supporting it also at that time. 
   The bill that is before us tonight is not the bill that passed in 1997. We have over 600,000 adults on SCHIP, a children's health insurance program. Rhetorically, my friends on the majority side say they really don't want adults to be covered. But nothing in this bill moves those adults off of SCHIP. 
   We don't know how many hundreds of thousands of noncitizens are covered. But most people agree that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Nothing in this bill has an enforcement mechanism to move children who are not U.S. citizens off the rolls. Not one thing moves that. And the 200 percent of poverty, the original SCHIP bill was between 100 and 200 percent of poverty. That's still a good principle. There are not 10 million children in America between 100 and 200 percent of poverty that qualify for SCHIP. The most authoritative number is that there may be an additional 800,000. 
   Now, the current SCHIP bill covers about 6 million children. In order to get to the 10 million number, you have to go way above 200 percent, probably above 300 percent and maybe even as high as 400 percent. So this 10 million number, there are about 80 million children in America. Most of those children, luckily, have health insurance through some sort of a private sector employee-sponsored health insurance program. Six million have it under SCHIP, and then there are several million that have it under Medicaid. But there are not 10 million between 100 and 200 percent of poverty. 
   Those of us on the Republican side, we support SCHIP. We support the original program. We may even support something expanding it beyond the original program. But we don't support some of the ideas that take it up to as high as 300 to 350 percent of poverty, that cover noncitizens and that cover adults. That's what this debate is all about. 
   So we hope that we have an opportunity. We hope that we have a veto vote and that we sustain the President's veto, and then maybe my friend from Illinois and myself can actually enter into a bipartisan negotiation that does exactly what he wants to do and what people like myself want to do.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   I appreciate the gentleman that just spoke, but let's be factually accurate. There are over 600,000 adults under current law on SCHIP right now. They're not all pregnant women. Now, some of them may be, but not all 600,000, and nothing in this bill moves any adult off of SCHIP. Nothing.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, there's a great movie from the sixties or maybe the seventies called ``Cool Hand Luke.'' Paul Newman is Cool Hand Luke, and he gets imprisoned for some minor infraction and he just doesn't conform with the regulations of the prison. And finally in exasperation the prison warden is talking to him in front of the chain gang and utters the famous line, ``What we have here is a failure to communicate.'' 
   Well, what we have here tonight apparently is another failure to communicate. The Republicans in the House of Representatives want to reauthorize SCHIP. Some of the Republicans in the House of Representatives even want to expand SCHIP. But what we don't want to do is make SCHIP the surrogate for universal health care for children that are not in low-income or moderate-income families. We don't want to do that. And the bill before us would do that. 
   It would cover children up to 300 percent of poverty, explicitly, which is above the median income in this country. And it would not have any substantial reform on what are called ``income disregards.'' An income disregard is, some States have said, well, we're going to disregard this amount of income or we're going to disregard that particular expense. So for all practical purposes if a State chooses to disregard income, then there is no cap, and the bill before us doesn't have reforms in that measure. 
   The bill before us, in terms of illegal aliens, does have a paragraph that says no illegal alien can receive the benefit. It has that. But it has no enforcement. It's toothless. It's like saying don't go over 55 miles an hour or 60 miles an hour but you don't have a radar policeman to enforce the speed limit. 
   So what we are saying and what the President of the United States is saying in his veto message is pretty straightforward. Let's continue the SCHIP program. Let's find the children that are below 200 percent of poverty, and let's get them enrolled in the program and perhaps even go as high as 250 percent or 275 percent. Let's find some way to have a real enforcement to make sure that SCHIP is for children and for children of citizens. And then let's find a way to get the adults on the program off the program. 
   There are some States that cover more adults than children. And, again, my friends on the majority agree that that's not an appropriate thing, but they don't do anything in the bill to reform that. 
   So when my friend from New Jersey, the distinguished subcommittee chairman, talks about there may be as many as 6 million additional children that could be covered, I very carefully listened to what he said, and I would agree with what he said because he used the words ``Medicaid'' and ``SCHIP.'' Well there are 25 million children covered under Medicaid right now. There may well be another 5 or 6 million children that are eligible for Medicaid that we need to work with on a bipartisan basis to get in Medicaid. But according to HHS, there are only 800,000 eligible for SCHIP. Even according to the CBO, there are only an additional maybe 1.3 million that would be eligible for SCHIP under the bill that the majority is putting on the floor. 
   So I wish we wouldn't postpone this veto. I wish we would go ahead and have the veto override tonight because we will sustain the veto. And then I wish my good friend JOHN DINGELL from Michigan and Mr. Rangel from New York would work with Mr. McCrery and myself and other Members to really come together on a bipartisan basis. 
   I would like to point out that these negotiations that Mr. Hoyer alluded to did, in fact, happen, but those negotiations were not a conference. This bill is not the result of a conference committee between the House and the Senate. The bill before us is the result of some backroom negotiations and then an effort on an ad hoc basis of some of the senior Members of the majority in this House and some Members of the other body to work with some of our junior Members who had really no official standing but did negotiate in good faith to come up with a compromise. And as Mr. Garrett pointed out, the written proposal the Republicans put forward, I think, to this day has never been answered. Now, I could be wrong on that, but I don't think it has ever been formally addressed. 
   So I sat in on those negotiations for several days, and what we got was a lot of good feeling talk. But when it came time to put it on paper, the majority wouldn't put it on paper. 
   So let's not postpone this override. Let's vote down the motion to postpone, and let's have the veto override tonight. And then in the next week or so if we are still in session, let's really start a bipartisan process that is based on the formal processes of the House and the Senate. 
   With that, I would yield back my time, Madam Speaker.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I want to make a couple of responses. First, we will talk about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   Under the current law, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve cannot be used to manipulate or impact prices. It is specifically in the law. It would take an act of Congress to change that. Under current law, the President has to find a, has to issue a finding, a national emergency on supply that affects the economy of the United States. I think as has been pointed out by Mr. Westmoreland, that would certainly be a hearing that would be worthy in the Oversight subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, perhaps in the Natural Resources Committee that Chairman Rahall chairs. But under current law, we would not be allowed to release oil purely to help alleviate the pricing situation. 
   On the issue of this big oil field, I wasn't listening closely, but is the gentleman referring to the big oil find off the coast of Brazil?

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. There are several things about that. We're not sure that we have the technology right now to develop that field. We certainly don't have the infrastructure in place to produce it or to transport it compared to up in Alaska where ANWR is within 200 miles of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline that is currently over at half capacity and where, as Chairman Rahall pointed out, we certainly would have to go through the permitting process if we were to decide you could drill in ANWR. 
   But I have talked to some of the majors in this country. And they believe if we really adopted an expedited process for the permitting process, they could have production of about 300 barrels a day within 3 to 4 years, and they think they could ramp it up to about 1 million barrels a day or more within say 5 to 8 years. 
   So it's good news if Brazil has done what it has done. But because of where that find is and how deep the water is and some of the technological issues, it's not quite an apples-to-apples comparison.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. If it's allowed, could I give a factual presentation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? 
   We have a little over 700 million barrels in the reserve. I think the average acquisition price is less than $30 a barrel. They have the capacity to produce up to 6 million barrels a day at maximum production from the reserve. That then leaves at least 2 weeks to gear up to do that. World markets today are about 85 million barrels of supply and about 84 million barrels per day of demand. To really impact the price by releasing oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve, most experts think you would have to release at least 2 million barrels per day. And 
   at that rate, you could release it for a year approximately, and then you wouldn't have any oil. 
   So again, it is worthy of a hearing. But I would be very careful about changing the law to allow the SPR to be used for price alleviation. It was a bipartisan agreement in the 1970s. It requires a Presidential directive of a national emergency because of supply interruption that is of severe harm to the American economy. That is the standard for release from the SPR today.  
   So to have a real price impact, given that the world market in oil is fungible, you would probably have to release about 2 million barrels a day. And if you did that for the entire amount of oil, you would have not quite a year's supply.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Let me make a couple of comments about what my good friend Mr. Stupak just said. 
   First, in terms of speculation, I think that most Republicans would agree that there is some speculation in the market. I certainly believe there is. I held hearings when I was full committee chairman in the last Congress and you, Mr. Stupak, have done an excellent job in that hearing that he referred to, I think, on June 23. 
   Some of the things that are in his PUMP bill and some things that are in the bill that I have introduced and Chairman Dingell has introduced, we are going to have a markup in the Energy and Commerce Committee on a bipartisan basis sometime next week and hopefully come to a bipartisan agreement about what to do on speculation, putting some position limits, bringing the foreign exchanges under rules that the U.S. exchanges have to go by, creating a two-tiered system where physical traders play by a different set of rules in terms of margin requirement than people that don't take physical possession or provide for physical delivery. There are a number of issues we have agreement on, and we will be working together. 
   I might also point out that the gentleman's chart that shows the tracking of oil and gold, that is a, to me, a disconcerting chart, because what it shows to me--and I am not an economist--but we have taken oil from a commercial commodity that had value because of the end use that it could be put to, to a commodity that now has become a value of storage like gold. I mean, there is not a big commercial demand for gold in terms of jewelry and dental work. 
   Gold is basically--has historically been a hedge against inflation, and what the world financial community has decided with oil, because of the tightness of the market, since it is almost a necessity in the modern age, it, too, has now become a store of value, and it has a value applied to it above and beyond the commercial value of being used. 
   If we really want to do something to dampen speculation, and, again, we are going to work with Mr. Stupak on a speculation bill, we have got to fundamentally change the supply and demand tightness. Right now, world available supply is about 85 million barrels a day. World demand is about 84 million barrels a day. That supply number, that 85 million barrel a day number hasn't changed significantly in the last 3 years, because most of our major oil fields are growing older, the war in Iraq. 
   I could say corruption in some of the national oil companies, I won't name names, but even with these high prices, we haven't seen that supply and demand tightness go away. We have got to get either the demand down or the supply up, and, so, some of the things that the Republicans are talking about to increase domestic supply would help on the speculation side. 
   My final comment, before I yield back to the majority side for some time, is that in terms of the oil company profits, apparently the gentleman from New York, who is no longer on the floor, has made a big deal about how high these profits are. 
   Well, let me make a couple of comments. If you can't make money at $130 a barrel, you don't deserve to be in business. I mean, we would expect profits to be up when the price is up where it is. Believe it or not, there are some of these nationalized oil companies whose profits have not gone up. 
   Now, one can speculate as to why that is, but in the United States we have a transparent market-based system and our oil companies are not price setters, they are price takers. If the world market is $130 a barrel or $140 a barrel, our national--our private oil companies take that price. Now, the question is, how do we want them to use those profits? 
   Let's unlock these reserves, these domestic resources, 85 percent of the OCS has been off limits? We can't drill in Alaska where we think there is a 10 billion barrel oil field in ANWR? Let's allow our private companies to invest those profits in American-made energy.     
   Increase that supply demand balance so that, as the supply goes up, the price goes down. 
   Now, having said that, I agree with Chairman STUPAK in that we need to do something on speculation. I don't agree with everything in his pump bill, but I do agree with probably 75 percent of it. 
   In the committee markup of the Energy and Commerce Committee that Chairman Dingell has announced to me--and I, hopefully, will publicly announce it soon if he has not already--you will see bipartisan agreement. We have to live within the market structure of the United States and the regulatory structure through the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and through the Securities & Exchange Commission. Certainly, we can do some things to do something on speculation, but if we don't change the fundamental  tightness in the supply and demand situation, all of the speculation bills in the world are not going to make that much difference. 
   With that, I yield back to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. We have 6 minutes. We're going to speak for about 5 minutes, and then we'll give you a minute to close. I think there ought to be balance in terms of closing. We don't have to be exactly right in terms of time. 
   Before I yield to Mr. Westmoreland, let me say that we've got a factual disagreement about the Outer Continental Shelf as to what is available. This chart that's down by Mr. Westmoreland shows that 85 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf is off limits. The entire coast of the Pacific is off limits. I believe the entire Atlantic coast is off limits. The western Gulf of Mexico, where we've been drilling for 60 years, is accessible, and I think some of the eastern Gulf may be accessible. So we have a factual discrepancy that should be resolvable before we do this again because it looks to me like most of the OCS, with the exception of the western Gulf of Mexico, is simply not available because of a congressional moratorium. Now, if we can agree on a bipartisan basis to change that, then we're going to create some areas for our oil companies to invest their funds domestically. 
   With that, I would like to yield to Mr. Westmoreland, who is one of the godfathers of this experiment this evening.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We are going to do something a little bit differently this evening on the House floor. We have a 1-hour Special Order of the minority and a 1-hour Special Order of the majority. The minority leader and the Speaker have agreed to combine those two Special Orders so that both sides can participate in the debate about energy policy. I will be leading the minority side, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Altmire) is going to be leading the majority side. 
   In the first hour, it is my understanding that I will control time for both sides, and in the second hour, the gentleman from Pennsylvania will control the time for both sides. We are going to try to operate in such a fashion of cooperation which, I think, will be refreshing in this Chamber so that both sides end up, at the end of the 2-hour period, with equal amounts of time. 
   In Special Orders, you don't yield for specific amounts of time, so what we're going to attempt to do, between looking at the two clocks that are publicly visible and between the staff members who have clocks, is to make sure that we balance the time out. 
   So, before we get started in the actual substantive debate, I'd be happy to yield to my good friend from Pennsylvania for whatever introductory remarks he wishes to make about the procedure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. 
   I am going to yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, we have before us, as we have this debate on the floor of the House of Representatives, a very serious situation. We have energy prices worldwide, certainly, but in the United States of America, specifically, we have energy prices that have gone up quite a bit in the last several years. 
   If you will look here, you will see that, in February of 2007, as to the price of unleaded gasoline at the pump, the national average was $2.30 a gallon. By the end of June of this year, it was at $4.07. The numbers that were given to me this afternoon when I got off the airplane show that, today, it closed at $4.11 a gallon for gasoline, which is a record. For diesel, it's about $4.82 a gallon. 
   If you will look at natural gas prices, which are used both in industry and to heat our homes in the winter and to cook our food year round, in February of last year, for 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas, it was $6.60. By June, it was up to, which was the average nationally, $10.21. We expect that, by this fall, the average national price is going to be $12 for 1,000 cubic feet. 
   Now, if we sit here in the United States and do nothing, these prices are going to stay where they are and are going to go higher. The good news is that we have more domestic energy resources in this country than in any other country in the world. 
   To just give a comparison, on this chart here, the purple and the green and the blue are the amount of oil imports on an average basis per day that we're importing from three of our largest sources of imports. You can see that, from Nigeria, we're getting approximately 1 million barrels a day, from Venezuela, about 1,250,000 barrels a day and, from Saudi Arabia, about 1,500,000 barrels a day of oil. 
   The orange bar, or the red bar, to the right shows the estimates from the Minerals Management Service, the most recent estimates of the amount of domestic energy supply that could be produced at today's prices and with today's technology. If we were to produce in the Outer Continental Shelf, in the areas that are currently off limits but that we think could be produced in terms of a drilling program, that, by itself, equals the amount of imports from Saudi Arabia.     
   If we add the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve, which we're going to talk about in some detail, that will be another approximately 750,000 to 1 million barrels a day. 
   And then one of the big ones that we really haven't done too much about is our shale oil reserves. We have 2 trillion barrels of shale oil in this country, and if we were to produce that, we think within the next 5 to 10 years we could have almost 2 million, maybe 3 million barrels of production just from that. Then if you add the tar sands, you add coal-to-liquids--which there's a lot of bipartisan support on the floor on both sides of the aisle--our heavy oil reserves, and then our C0  
   2 recovery with C0 
   2 injection into depleted oil fields, if you add all of those up, that's 10 million barrels a day equivalent of production that we could have in the United States of America. 
   Unfortunately, for most of these on the red bar, our friends on the majority side, on the Democratic side, certainly the leadership--I'm not saying that everybody on their side--but the Democratic leadership are not only opposed, but some would say adamantly opposed. And that's what this debate is going to be about this evening. 
   So with that as the opening statement, I would be happy to yield to the distinguished chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, the Honorable Nick Rahall of the great State of West Virginia.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. But this is a debate, and then I will yield to my good friend from Georgia. 
   First of all, I think those on the minority side would love to work with the distinguished chairman of the Natural Resources Committee if he wished to bring a bipartisan bill to the floor on permitting reform on the 68 million acres that are currently available for leasing. 
   I think the gentleman knows that in the Energy Policy Act that passed in 2005, we put some permit reform 
   measures in place on a pilot program basis. And in this Congress, there have been efforts made in H.R. 6 and then also some of the appropriation riders to put some roadblocks in some of those permitting process reforms. So if that's something that we could work together with, I would be happy to do that. 
   The second answer I would give on the acreage that is currently under lease is some of those areas, while they are leased, they don't appear to have significant mineral production even at today's prices. And as they asked the bank robber Clyde Barrow why he robbed banks, he anecdotally is supposed to have answered, ``That's where the money is.'' 
   Well, some of the areas that are currently not under lease is where we think the significant amounts of oil and gas are. But on the current acreage, I think we would be very willing to do an inventory bill, if the gentleman wished to work on an inventory bill. We could certainly do an expedited permit and reform bill if the gentleman and his leadership wished to do that. So there could be some agreement there.

Again, I could be corrected, and if we were all on the Internet, somebody could blog in and tell us because there's somebody out there that knows exactly, but we use approximately 12 million barrels of oil equivalent today for transportation purposes, which would include gasoline and diesel and I think aviation fuel. So 22 million barrels is not quite 2 days' supply.

   As he pointed out, demand for gasoline in the United States is going down--you said eight-tenths of 1 percent, I accept that as a number. In terms of barrels a day, it's about a half a million barrels a day it's gone down.

The price they can get in the market is going down because demand is going down, and yet the price they have to pay for the raw material is going up. So that has really squeezed their margin. And because we've developed this almost-just-in-time refinery system in the United States--again, using your numbers, even though it's at a 5-year high, and I accept that as a good number--it's really only a two or three day supply.

If you can get us to get a vote on the drilling, I would bet we can get a restriction that meets your requirement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the President's veto. I know that's not a popular position to take on this floor since only 59 Members of this body supported the President when the vote was to pass the bill a month or so ago, but I think the position that I take is the right position on policy. 
   The bill before us, if the veto is not sustained, would delay--and I'm being charitable to use that verb--the reform of competitive bidding for durable medical equipment. It would delay that for 18 months, which in all probability would kill a program that would save billions and billions of dollars if implemented. 
   We have over 300 successful bidders for durable medical equipment that are not now going to be able to provide that. We have a program that, according to the Government Accountability Office, 10 percent of all the expenditures are for fraud, and we're going to perpetuate that program. The bill before us delays the reform of competitive bidding. I think that's a mistake. 
   The bill before us does prevent a, I believe, 10 percent cut going into effect for our physicians, and that's a good thing. I don't think any Member of this body wants our physicians that provide services for our Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to have to take a payment cut. So that is the one socially redeeming value of this bill. But it doesn't permanently fix the system, it simply delays the cut for another year. And next year it will be 20 percent, I think 20.7 percent. So there is no long-term fix for that, it's another kick-the-can-down-the-road for one more year. 
   There are some changes in the way pharmacies are reimbursed or are paid for or priced for their prescription drugs, a reform called Average Manufacturing Price, which I think is a good reform. We have had some consultations with the pharmaceutical community and the pharmaceutical manufacturers about how to actually calculate that price, but that reform replaced the system that was ridden with inequity and subject to quite a bit of gamesmanship. The bill before us would revert, as I understand it, back to the old system, which I think is a mistake. 
   So I know it's not politically popular to say we ought to stand on principle and do the right thing, but that's the position that I'm taking. I think that's the position the President is taking. So when the vote comes, I would hope that people would look at the underlying issues and vote to sustain the President's position on this, which is the position that's the best public policy for all Americans. 
   I haven't talked about Medicare Advantage. My good friend from Louisiana I think will make those points, but it's obvious that this bill significantly impacts, in a negative way, Medicare Advantage, which is a program that 10 million of our senior citizens have chosen to participate in to receive their Medicare benefits. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close, and I believe I have 7 minutes, although I don't believe I will take 7 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to try to at least let the American people know what is going on here this afternoon. 
   I think everybody on both sides of the aisle are for our health care providers. We want our doctors to be fairly reimbursed. We want our hospitals to be fairly reimbursed. We want our pharmacists to be fairly reimbursed. We want our durable medical equipment suppliers to be fairly reimbursed. We want our Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and recipients to get quality health care and have the minimum copayments and out-of-pocket expenses necessary for those services. So we have 435 votes for good health care policy in America. 
   The bill before us is not a good government bill. It is an accountability avoidance bill, in my opinion. It is hard to read exactly what CBO scores this bill, but on subtitle D, provisions relating to part C, section 161, it says, phaseout of indirect medical education, that scores over 5 years a saving of $12.5 billion and over 10 years, $47.5 billion. That's a cut. 
   Now I am told, I can't prove it, but I am told that $20 billion to $25 billion of that is coming directly out of Medicare Advantage. Those are reimbursement cuts to the 10 million seniors who have chosen Medicare Advantage. 
   Now the statement has been made on the floor that we are overpaying Medicare Advantage. What happens when there is an overpayment is that 75 percent of that overpayment goes back into the benefit pool for the Medicare beneficiaries that choose that option, and 25 percent goes to the U.S. Treasury. It doesn't go to the insurance companies.     
   Seventy-five percent of an overpayment is reinvested in benefits for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, and 25 percent goes as a savings to the taxpayers who are providing the funds. That sounds to me like a pretty good deal. 
   Now let's talk about the physicians. One of the few good things in the bill is that we are going to delay the physician reimbursement cut of 10 percent that was effective this year. It would have been effective July 1, I believe. That's a good thing. 
   But is there a reform in this package that sets a different formula for next year and the next year and the next year? No. Were there discussions on a bipartisan basis about that? No. Has any effort that I am aware of really been made to fix that program, to fix that fee schedule? No. 
   So what happens on the floor next year? We have a 20 percent cut that will go into effect if we don't do something between now and July of next year. That's not good government.  That's, as I said, accountability avoidance. 
   Let's talk about the pharmaceutical system. There is a good thing in this bill, I have to be honest about that. The prompt pay is a good thing. I support that. But the delay of the average manufacturing price reform is a bad thing. Is a bad thing. 
   Now I admit there are some problems with average manufacturing price, about definitions of what's included in the cost and what kinds of costs are included, but that's a technical detail that could be worked out. But to delay a true reform that tries to reimburse pharmacists for the true cost of the drugs, to me, is another avoidance in accountability. 
   Then let's talk about durable medical equipment. GAO says that 10 percent of everything that we pay for durable medical equipment through Medicare is fraud. What we do is delay for 18 months the competitive bidding system that we have been working on for over 10 years. Now it should tell us something that the industry apparently signed off on an across-the-board cut of about 10 percent in order to avoid competitive bidding. 
   That would tell me that we are overpaying right now for durable medical equipment and oxygen supplies, at least that much, if they are willing to accept an across-the-board cut instead of competitive bidding. The 300 suppliers that won the competitive bidding contracts, they are just out on a limb now. They probably have lawsuit remedies that will cost the taxpayer billions and billions of dollars more. So all we are doing is delaying the reforms that we have worked so hard in the past to implement for 1 year. For 1 year. 
   Now I understand the politics of that. Any time you tell a constituency, we're going to give you more money this year, that's probably a good thing politically. As I said at the start, I'm friends with the physicians in my district, I'm friends with the pharmacists in my district, I'm friends with the durable medical suppliers in my district, and they're good people. They're trying to provide good services. 
   But to simply delay some of these reforms for 1 year or 18 months at the costs that are going to be incurred, as I said at the start of my closing remarks, that's not good government, that's accountability avoidance. 
   I am very happy to support the President's veto. If by some stroke of good public policy we did sustain the veto, we would be happy to work with my friends on both sides of the aisle and in the other body to come up with some true reform, some true changes in public policy that were permanent and would fix this problem, because, mark my words, if we don't sustain the veto, we will be back here next year, and we will probably be doing the same thing that we are doing today. 
   That's not good government. I hope we will vote to sustain the President's veto. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE FILL SUSPENSION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me say at the beginning that I speak for myself, I don't necessarily speak for the House Republican leadership. I have asked if we had a minority position on the bill, and as of 30 minutes ago we did not. So I am speaking for myself as the ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction, the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   And let me say at the beginning that I think it is good to have a piece of energy legislation on the floor at this point in time. I think the American people are fed up with high gasoline prices, they're fed up with increasing imports, they're fed up with rising food prices that are caused, at least in part, by higher energy prices. So I think it's a good thing that we are beginning to debate energy legislation on the floor of the House of Representatives. I think it is a good thing that the chairman of the committee with primary jurisdiction, my good friend, JOHN DINGELL, is leading that debate on the majority side. 
   Having said that, I don't think it's a good thing that we bring a bill on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the floor with no process at all. Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman BOUCHER and I have spoken informally in the last 2 weeks about doing something on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And I am very open to having a full vetting of the issue of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   I am fully supportive of the underlying policy in this bill, which is to suspend taking shipments into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when oil prices are at record levels. I am not supportive of doing that in a way that there is absolutely no input from the minority side. We've had no legislative hearing, no committee hearing, no markup, no nothing. We were notified late yesterday afternoon that the bill would be on the floor this morning, and as far as I can tell the bill wasn't printed until some time this morning. So one reason I'm opposed to the bill is because of process. 
   Now I want to talk about the substance of the bill. Again, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created in the 1970s in response to a coordinated Arab Oil Embargo against the United States of America when shipments of oil were suspended by the OPEC cartel for political reasons. We created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And my guess is, although I wasn't in Congress at that time, that JOHN DINGELL, who was a member of the committee--I don't believe he was chairman in the seventies--probably had a very positive influence on creating the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It was a good idea then and it's a good idea now. So that's a good thing. 
   Now, we have been filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve since the late seventies. Most of the oil was put in under President Reagan's tenure from 1980 to 1988, but even since then we have continued to fill the Reserve. There have been little appropriated funds appropriated to fill it, and in the last 5 or 6 years most of the increase has been by taking what this bill would suspend, which is the royalty-in-kind oil, and putting that into the Reserve. Royalty-in-kind oil is oil that, instead of the oil companies that produce on Federal lands and the Federal OCS, instead of giving money to the Federal Government and to the taxpayer, they give royalty-in-kind oil. And that right now is about 62,000 barrels a day. So it is not a bad idea to suspend taking the royalty-in-kind oil. 
   Where I have a policy difference with this bill is that the bill is either silent or ambiguous on what happens to the royalties that continue to accrue. The fact that you're not taking oil doesn't mean that the Federal Government doesn't have a royalty that should be paid.  
   So one of the questions I would have is, do we receive the money, which 62,000 barrels of oil at $120 a barrel is, over the life of this bill, over a billion dollars. What happens to that billion dollars? Does it just go to the general revenue? Does it just go to the general treasury? 
   If I were drafting the bill, I would direct that some of that royalty, in terms of cash, go into a LIHEAP fund for low-income heating and cooling assistance. I would direct that some of the funds go into a reserve to buy oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when oil falls below the target price in this bill, which I believe is $75 a barrel. I would direct that some of the funds go to an alternative energy fund. Those are things that we would have discussed in committee. Those were the things that we would have had amendments on. And those are the things that we're not allowed to do because this bill is being considered under suspension. 
   As Chairman Dingell has pointed out, the fact that we're not going to take royalty-in-kind oil and put it in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is probably not going to affect the price much on the world market. I think we would have as much impact on prices, if that's our goal, if all the Members on both sides of the aisle went out on the steps of the Capitol and we all clapped our hands three times and said, ``Down prices. Down prices. Down prices.'' That would probably have as much impact as passing this bill. It would be a lot more fun, too. We would all get a little exercise. And it would be a pretty good photo op, the united Congress, you know, dictating that oil prices go down. But it would have about the same impact that this bill does. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, again, I don't quarrel with the fact that we are directing to suspend shipments of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We need to do a lot more than that, however, if we really want to bring oil prices down. And even in doing something on the SPR, I think we should go through committee, we should have a legislative hearing, we should have a markup, and we should really rethink the strategy of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   In the 1970s, the oil markets and the U.S. economy were significantly different than they are today. And the size of the Reserve, the uses of the Reserve are at least subject to a real debate today. And what we're getting is a bill that apparently was drafted in Majority Leader Hoyer's office late last night or early this morning that several Members have put their names on. And we're on a suspension calendar that we have no ability to amend it or do anything about it except vote ``yes'' or ``no,'' so I'm going to encourage Members to vote ``no.'' If we were somehow to get 146 ``no'' votes, then we could have the debate and have the markup process that I've asked about and we could come back next week sometime and do it the right way.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6022, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008. I am opposed to this bill for two reasons: process and substance. 
   First, let's talk about process: I found out that this bill was going to be on the floor today less than 24 hours ago. I am the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over energy in general and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, in particular. While there has been a lot of talk and press recently about the SPR, it has not been the subject of any committee briefings, hearings, or markups at all. I am not even aware of any discussions about this SPR bill at the staff level, except for Chairman Dingell's staff notifying my staff yesterday afternoon that this bill would be on the suspension calendar today. 
   And now we are on the suspension calendar, where we get an up or down vote, with no chance for any amendments. It seems that, once again, the majority leadership of the House is shamelessly dictating the legislative process of the House in a way that demeans the jurisdiction of the Energy & Commerce Committee in order to make us vote on a bill before Memorial Day so the Democrats can send out press releases about how they are addressing the Pelosi Premium. 
   Which leads me to my second point--the substance of this bill. When it comes to dealing with high energy prices, there are two groups in Congress. Those who want to say they are doing something, and those who want to do something. Today's bill is for those who want to say they are doing something. 
   This bill tells the President, as long as oil prices stay above $75 a barrel, to quit filling the SPR for the rest of calendar year 2008, but do it in a way that does not affect current contracts. So, if this bill is signed into law, the real world effect will be to prevent about 11.4 million barrels of oil from going into the SPR between August 1 and December 31 of this year--or about 76 thousand barrels a day for the rest of the year. 
   Will this help with gas prices? We could probably have more effect on lowering gas prices if we stood on the steps of the Capitol and clapped our hands three times and shouted, ``Lower, lower, lower.'' It certainly won't do anything for prices for Memorial Day weekend because it will not start having any effect until August 1st. If the Majority wanted to have an immediate effect, they should have considered a provision to direct the 
   Department of Energy to sell the SPR oil it is currently receiving into the open market. 
   The title of this bill also indicates that it somehow protects consumers, but I cannot find anything in the bill that actually does that. The bill says to quit filling the SPR which would happen in August, but the bill is silent about a number of things: What happens to the Royalty-in-Kind oil that the Departments of Interior and Energy are currently getting? Do these departments sell it? Do the lessees sell it and give the proceeds to the Departments? I assume the lessees still owe the government the royalty payments, so I assume any cash would go into the general treasury. How does this help protect consumers? 
   A better way to protect consumers, or at least help consumers by offsetting the current record energy prices would have been to do something useful with the revenue generated with the SPR oil. Perhaps we could have dedicated a portion of it to low income heating assistance. Or perhaps we could have dedicated a portion of it to developing alternative energy sources. Or, we even could have reserved a portion of it to start replenishing the SPR again sometime in the future when oil prices are not at $125 a barrel. 
   But, since we had no process for this bill, we will never know what could have been. We're faced with an up or down vote, with no chance to discuss the policy of either this bill, or the policy of the SPR generally. 
   I, for one, am in favor of having a policy discussion on the entire Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I think the circumstances of today's energy markets are much different than they were when we created the SPR, and therefore I think it would be a good idea to have a policy debate about the future of the SPR. Ultimately I may end up wanting to continue to have a billion barrel SPR, but I think the policy discussion would be a good thing to have. Unfortunately, the process for this bill does not foster such a debate. 
   So where does this leave those of who want to not just say we're doing something about energy costs, but actually want to do something? 
   In 1985 we produced 9 million barrels of oil per day and imported another 3 million per day. Since 1995 we've cut our domestic production in half and tripled our imports. Why? Because we continue to lock up our domestic resources, particularly in Alaska and in the OCS. 
   Two of the most unstable foreign sources of oil today are Nigeria and Venezuela. That instability is a big factor in high oil prices because of the risk of supply cut-off. ANWR alone could be replacing all our imports from Venezuela or all our imports from Nigeria and only use a few thousand acres of a vast tundra. 
   Better legislation comes from the deliberative process, a process that's inclusive. No sooner will this bill become law than people will be either calling for its repeal or wondering why we bothered at all. But that was true of the 2007 no-energy bill, as well. 
   Let's go back to Committee and do the job we are capable of doing with SPR. Let it do some good for somebody. And let's let Congress turn to the real energy issue facing this country, domestic production.  
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if it's possible, I'd like to enter into a dialogue with any of the three sponsors of the bill. Mr. Markey is on the floor. Mr. Lampson is on the floor. Mr. Welch is on the floor. I'd like to ask them some questions if one of them would like to try to respond on my time. I'm not going to use their time. So Mr. Markey, Mr. Welch or Mr. Lampson. I just want to ask some questions about the bill to the main sponsors.     
   My question, Mr. Speaker, and this is on my time, if either of those three gentlemen would like to respond. I'm not trying to be cute. I'm way too old to be cute. 
   The bill is silent on whether or not the money that is the equivalent cash of the royalty in kind to oil is what's done with it. So my first question I would like one of the sponsors to answer is, instead of getting 62,000 barrels of oil a day, if this bill becomes law, does the general treasury get the equivalent of 62,000 barrels of oil times whatever the market price of oil that day is, which right now is over $120 a barrel? Is that revenue generated, and does it come to the Federal treasury, or do the oil companies keep it? That's my first question.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield myself 1 minute. 
   I want to just comment on what I think is the goal of the legislation, and that would be to lower prices for the American consumer. At least I think that is what I think the goal is. 
   Having said that, 62,000 barrels a day in an 85-million-barrel-a-day oil market is about one twelve hundredth of 1 percent. So if you assume that oil markets are linear, the additional 62,000 barrels on an 85-million-barrel-per-day oil market is going to lower the price perhaps two cents. Maybe. 
   Again, if we just go outside and clap our hands, we would probably have a 2 percent chance of lowering the price of oil by two cents a barrel. Just by clapping our hands. So I don't think this bill does anything except show the American people that we want to do something, but we still don't know exactly what it is we can do that makes any sense. 
   And I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
   To the extent we have an historical record on what this would do, on April 25, 2006, President Bush announced suspension of 67,000-barrels-a-day acquisition for the SPR for the summer driving season. The day before he made that announcement, the price of oil was $70.19. The day he made the announcement, it fell to $67.43 per barrel. And the day after he made the announcement, it went back up to $71.71 per barrel, which was a net increase of 62 cents a barrel. So to say that this is going to lower the price based on the historical record would be inaccurate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my good friend, Chairman JOHN DINGELL of the Energy and Commerce Committee, in support of H.R. 5613, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008. 
   Given the fact that Secretary Leavitt of Health and Human Services indicated that he would recommend to the President of the United States that he veto the bill before us in its current form, I do wish we could have brought the bill to the floor under a rule with several potential amendments and a motion to recommit so that we can have a little bit fuller debate rather than putting it on the suspension calendar. Having said that, I am very glad that it is coming to the floor as a stand-alone bill, and that Chairman Dingell and Chairman PALLONE of the subcommittee have followed regular order in passing this legislation. 
   I want to thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman PALLONE for holding a  legislative hearing as well as a subcommittee markup and a full committee markup on the bill that's now before us. I also want to thank them for having an open process, where staff on both sides of the aisle could work together, amendments could be shared, and some of those amendments could be agreed upon and incorporated into the bill that's before us today. I would not have been able to support H.R. 5613 as originally introduced, but I can support the bill that's before us this afternoon. I'm proud that, on occasion, we do put good public policy ahead of partisan politics, and the bill before us, again, is an example of what I believe to be better public policy. 
   I do hope that we take this opportunity to take the issue before us, if this bill becomes law, and actually work on it for the year that the moratorium is in place. The bill before us would place a year-long moratorium on seven Medicaid rules. It does not mean that the suspended rules themselves are all bad and don't address a problem that needs to be addressed. It does mean that many of the interest groups and many of the States had significant problems with those rules, and so it was felt prudent to have a moratorium where we could hopefully, in the interim, determine how to fine tune and maybe change some of those rules. 
   We do need to save money in Medicaid. We do need to do something on this system of intergovernmental transfers. For those of you who don't understand what an intergovernmental transfer is, as used in Medicaid, a State will give money to the Federal Government that is then matched by the Federal Government and sent back to the State. The State will give some of that money to, in this case a hospital system, but then keep some of the money that it initially gave. So it's kind of a shell game where you put up some money to get it matched, and once you get the matched back, the money you put up you use for another purpose, not for a health purpose, but maybe for a different purpose, like building a highway or something like that. One of the suspended rules would have addressed this intergovernmental transfer, and I hope that in the next year, on a bipartisan basis, we can address the intergovernmental transfer issue itself.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I thank the distinguished chairman. 
   We simply cannot pretend on a day that we're suspending these rules that there are not fundamental financial difficulties facing Medicaid. So while we agree to suspend the rules for the next year, I hope we can also agree, as the chairman just indicated that he did, that we're going to continue to work on the problems these rules were designed to address so that over time we can reach agreement on how to save money under Medicaid. 
   I do believe the bill before us is a good bill. It does have a pay-for. It is, on a net basis, a slight revenue increase to the Federal Treasury, so it is paid for. And if we spend the next year working together, if we implement some of the things in this bill, the bill gives $25 million a year to combat waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, if we use that money wisely, we will uncover some savings. And if we look at some of these suspended rules, we can perhaps work together to fine tune them so that a year from now, at the beginning of the next administration, we don't have to extend the moratorium. 
   In short, Mr. Speaker, while this is not a perfect bill, it's a good bill. Don't let the pursuit of perfection prevent the accomplishment of what is something that is good and possible. 
   I would urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 5613, especially on my side of the aisle, among the Republicans in the House of Representatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I recognize myself for such time as I may consume. 
   Well, here we go again. Depending on how you count it, this is somewhere between the ninth and the 13th time that we have been on the floor of the House in this session of Congress debating the SCHIP program. That seems a little ironic since it's a program that both sides of the aisle support, and I would support enthusiastically. 
   I listened intently to what my good friend from Michigan, the dean of the House, Mr. Dingell just said about the program, and I feel compelled to point out a few things that he failed to mention. Number 1, every American in this country, if they're below 100 percent of poverty, receives health care if they wish it through a program called Medicaid. If you are above 100 percent of poverty and are a child, right now a child is defined as an individual between the ages of birth and 19 years old, between 100 and 200 percent of poverty, you can receive health care through the SCHIP program, which is a State-Federal partnership. 
   The numbers are somewhat in dispute, but we believe that under the current program, in the neighborhood, I believe, of 6 million children and 600 to 700,000 adults are receiving health care through SCHIP. If you're above 200 percent of poverty, hopefully you have insurance through your own health insurance program or through a program provided by your employer. 
   There are some States that cover children up to 250 percent of poverty, and there are some States that cover them up to 300 percent of poverty. And there are a few States that have petitioned to cover them up to 350 percent of poverty. 
   So on the Republican side of the aisle, here are the principles that we adhere to in this debate. If you're a child between the ages, up to the age of 19 and your family income is over 100 percent of poverty or less than 200 percent of poverty, we believe you should have health care through SCHIP and we want to fund it, and we want to work with the States to get as many children in that category covered. 
   If you're an adult, we don't believe you should be covered under SCHIP, so we think that the 6 to 700,000 adults should be transitioned off of SCHIP and put back on Medicaid. 
   If you're above 200 percent of poverty, we want to work with the States. We want to work with the private sector to come up with innovative plans to cover those children that perhaps aren't covered and their family income is above 200 percent of poverty. 
   If you're not a citizen of the United States, we don't believe you should receive health care coverage under SCHIP. 
   So that's what the debate is about. The Democrats want to expand the coverage. There are some of them that want to use it as a surrogate for universal health care for every American in this country. I don't say that all of my friends on the Democratic side do, but some do. 
   So the Republicans' position is, continue the existing program, perhaps increase coverage somewhat above 200 percent of poverty; cover every child in America between 100 and 200 percent; don't cover illegal aliens; and transition adults off of SCHIP. 
   The law of the land, the Barton-Deal bill that we passed in December, extends the basic program that I just outlined, I believe, through March of 2009. 
   So, once again, we're going to have a vote on the President's veto. I predict we're going to sustain that veto. And then I'm still hopeful that Mr. Dingell and Mr. Rangel and Mr. Stark and Mr. Pallone, who are the leaders on this issue in the House, will convene their various committees, and we'll do legislative hearings and then put together a bipartisan bill and mark it up in committee and then bring it to the floor, and we can have a permanent authorization of SCHIP sometime in this Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, constitutionally, when the President vetoes a piece of legislation, to override that veto either the House or the Senate has to muster more than two-thirds of its Members that are present and voting. 
   Now, I am not sure that it is a requirement that you bring a veto vote up or whether it is just a courtesy, but in any event, the majority postponed the veto override vote from back before Christmas until today. If one wants to be cynical, you could say that veto postponement was done for political reasons, since the President is giving the State of the Union next week. In any event, here we are again, and I will predict, and the majority leader when he spoke acknowledged this, that the votes won't be there to override the President's veto. 
   So we will continue to operate under the extension, the Barton-Deal bill that two-thirds of the Republican Conference are cosponsors of, that this House and the Senate passed right back before Christmas, and that the President signed. That bill, as Mr. Camp has pointed out, increases funding by almost $1 billion, or approximately 20 percent, and extends the program through March of next year. So there is no child currently on SCHIP that is going to lose coverage, regardless of the vote today. 
   Now, I do want to compliment my good friend Mr. Pallone, if he is on the floor, I don't see him, but have just  been told that, lo and behold, we are going to have a legislative hearing next week on SCHIP. In his subcommittee, the Health Subcommittee, there is going to be for the first time in this Congress a hearing on SCHIP. So that tells me that there is an outside chance, and maybe better than an outside chance, that sometime in the next 2 to 3 months, if Mr. Dingell agrees and Mr. Stark agrees and Mr. Rangel agrees, we may actually do what we should have done 13 months ago, which is begin to craft a bipartisan compromise on how to permanently reauthorize, or at least reauthorize SCHIP for more than 15 months, and perhaps modify the program, and then expand it to cover some children that are currently not covered. So there is always hope. 
   But while that is yet to materialize, the vote before us today is to sustain the President's veto. I hope we do that, and then we can begin to work next week, hopefully on a bipartisan basis, to craft a compromise that the President will sign, and then we will have a signing ceremony either in the Oval Office or the Rose Garden sometime this year. But, today, vote to sustain the President's veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I hadn't intended to give a 1-minute today, but I just got off the telephone with one of my dear friends, the Senator from the great State of Mississippi, the Honorable TRENT LOTT. 
   Today is his last day in the United States Senate. After a distinguished career in both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, he is resigning effective, I assume, today or tomorrow, whenever the other body goes out. 
   I have known TRENT LOTT for the 23 years that I have been in the House of Representatives. When I first got elected, he was the minority whip here in the House. He is one of the wisest, in terms of political knowledge, men that I have ever been around in my political career. He is a great guy personally. He has a great family. He has served not only his State, but his country, with exemplary distinction for the many-odd years that he has been in the House and the Senate. 
   We are going to miss the Honorable TRENT LOTT of the Magnolia State of Mississippi, and I want to wish him and his family the very best this holiday season and in the years ahead. 
   God bless TRENT LOTT and his family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, it is difficult to speak on this subject because we have debated it so many times in the last 1 1/2 months. Suffice it to say that all is well that ends well, and today we have a bill before us that is going to temporarily fix the physician reimbursement issue. It is going to extend the SCHIP program through March of 2009. It is going to extend the special diabetes program for another year and a number of other things. 
   These are all good things and people on both sides of the aisle support them. It shouldn't have taken all year to do these things, but it has. 
   I want to speak very briefly about the SCHIP program. The language in the bill before us is essentially the Barton-Deal language, which Congressman Deal of Georgia, the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee, and myself introduced 7 or 8 months ago to extend the existing SCHIP program for 18 months, to make sure that all children currently receiving coverage continue to receive coverage, to have a slight increase in funding so that some new enrollments could occur. It is a commonsense approach to an issue while we debate with our friends on the majority side the extent to which we want to expand or change the program. 
   We have had two Presidential vetoes. We have had enough speeches on the House floor and the other body to probably populate a national forest in terms of the amount of paper that has been used to cover those speeches. And yet we are here today doing what we could have done 11 months ago. 
   I am very pleased that the SCHIP program is going to be extended. I am very pleased that no State is going to lose funding. I am very pleased that we are going to continue to cover the children that have been covered. And I look forward in the next year to the same offer that Congressman Deal and Mr. McCrery and Mr. Camp and I have made to our friends on the majority, let's have some hearings. 
   We now have 15 months. We could hold regular hearings. We could introduce draft bills. We could circulate those bills. We could have a bipartisan dialogue. We could have an actual open, transparent committee markup in both the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee. It is still possible in this Congress to have the meetings of the mind on SCHIP in terms of changes to the program, and I hope, Madam Speaker, that that occurs in the next 12 months.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I want to compliment Congresswoman Lowey of New York for working to include the 60 percent fix for the rehabilitation hospitals. I wasn't aware that that was in the bill. I'm very pleased that that is. 
   I would like to, I guess, compliment my friend from California, Chairman Stark, for at least agreeing that this bill is worthy of coming to the floor. 
   I would like to point out that the whole purpose of SCHIP is to cover low- and moderate-income kids. That was the original intent. There are many of us on this side of the aisle that still think that should be the intent. If you want to go to some of the larger numbers of coverage of children that are currently not covered, you have to go above 250 and, in some cases, above 300 percent of poverty. 
   You also are covering right now six to 700,000 adults. There are those like myself that don't think adults need to be covered by SCHIP because those same adults can be covered by Medicaid, which is the coverage for low-income Americans, regardless of how old they are. 
   I would like to point out the obvious. When you're in the minority, the only way you can get anything passed is to work with the majority. That's self-evident. When you're in the majority  you can pass things in the House just by yourself, but if you want them to become law, you normally have to work with the minority. And I hope this debate on SCHIP has shown people on both sides of the aisle that we should be trying to legislate and work together instead of scoring political points for one particular side. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   We have had some problems with the process on this bill. We didn't have a hearing on it. We didn't have a subcommittee markup, but we did have the discussions. Chairman Dingell did postpone consideration of the bill in full committee so we could have those discussions, and we certainly support the intent of the bill, and so we certainly are willing to endorse it and hope that it gets a unanimous vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to start off by congratulating Chairman John Dingell. I have with me today's Congress Daily, one of the news periodicals that tracks what we do. And on page 7 the headline is ``House Panel Easily Passes Consumer Safety Legislation.'' It goes on to say that Dingell said he plans to approach the Speaker and ask her to put the bill on the Suspension Calendar because it passed committee 51-0, and in the next paragraph it says that a leadership aide said it is unlikely that the bill could come to the floor before Congress adjourns for the year. 
   Well, I just want to congratulate the chairman for going to Speaker Pelosi and getting her to agree to put this bill on the floor before we go home because this bill shows how the Congress should work. It didn't pass 51-0 because of serendipity. It passed 51-0 yesterday in the Energy and Commerce Committee because staffs on both sides of the aisle of both the full committee and the subcommittee met for countless hours to negotiate the many compromises necessary to put the bill together. I want to especially compliment Consuela Washington, the majority counsel, Chairman Dingell's counsel, who has worked so hard on this bill. If President Washington were still alive today, he would be very proud of her for the work that she's done because she has not only had to work with the minority staffers and members, she has also had to diligently work with the majority staffers and members as sometimes each side was pulling her in different directions. It's good to know that she's all in one piece and doing well. 
   This bill will strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This bill will create a state-of-the-art testing laboratory to test the products and the toys that we sell to the American public. This bill will enhance the recall ability of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This bill will expand the number of commissioners so that we have a full commission again. This bill increases the fines that the Consumer Product Safety Commission can levy against recalcitrant companies that sell defective products. And this bill has the toughest lead standard in the world for products. 
   I wish it were my line, but it's not. Chairman Rush's line on the lead standard, in response to an amendment in committee to make it even tougher, said that God himself at Mount Horeb where He gave the Ten Commandments to Moses, that may have been the only holy ground in the world that would have met this standard. I thought that was just priceless in terms of trying to put in context how tough this standard is that the Lord Himself would have difficulty meeting the standard in the bill. 
   So this is a good work product. It was done the right way. Negotiations with the stakeholders, negotiations with members, negotiations with the staff; an open markup at subcommittee; adequate time between subcommittee and full committee; a manager's amendment that was circulated so all members had a chance to see it; a full committee markup that lasted 2 days; numerous amendments that were offered, some withdrawn, some accepted, some modified. And the result was a 51-0 vote that occurred in full committee yesterday. And then again, thanks to Chairman Dingell's ability to get things done in the House, a Suspension Calendar vote today so that Members on both sides of the aisle have an attempt to put their stamp of approval on this very important piece of legislation. 
   I'm very proud to have played a small part in this process, and I cannot urge in stronger language that we should pass this and send it to the other body so that they may also reciprocate. 
   I predicted at the press conference 6 weeks ago or 2 months ago that something very close to this bill will be on the President's desk. We will have a bill signing ceremony in the Oval Office or the Rose Garden on this legislation later in this Congress. 
   So I'm very pleased to endorse it. I again thank all Members for their hard work, and a special commendation to Cliff Stearns, the former ranking member of the subcommittee, for his hard work. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I already complimented the majority on their process. I also want to compliment the majority and the minority on both sides on the policy. This bill has the toughest lead standards in the world for children's products. Let me repeat that. The bill before us has the toughest lead standards in the world for children's products. 
   It is phased in. The timetable may not be quite as aggressive as some of our consumer advocates would like it to be, but it is a fact that if this bill gets through the Senate, and I hope it will, the President signs it, and I know he will, we will have the toughest lead standards in the world for children's products. 
   It has a premarket approval process that is a major reform over the current practice, so that no product will be put into the marketplace until it has been adequately and aggressively tested before it goes to market. That is another major change from the current law. 
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission is a small agency. I believe it has less than 500 employees. But it is a very important agency. And I think it is important for the authorizing committees to do due diligence in their oversight and to also do due diligence in reauthorizing their agencies. I was very proud in the last Congress that for the first time in 14 years we reauthorized the National Institutes of Health and put in several major reforms. 
   I am glad in this Congress that we are working on a bipartisan basis to reauthorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I look forward, once we pass this piece of legislation, to work with the majority to take a look at the Federal Communications Commission. I believe it could use some reforms, too, and I know Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman Markey have some of those same concerns that I have. 
   I urge a strong ``yes'' vote on this legislation. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I would yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (PROTECT OUR CHILDREN ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of the ``Protect our Children Act,'' a bill that will authorize funding for law enforcement and the Department of Justice to fight the sexual exploitation of children over the Internet. 
   This bill is the result of over two years of work in the House and the Senate on the issues relating to child sexual exploitation. When I was Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Committee conducted a wide-ranging, comprehensive investigation of Internet child pornography. We had nine hearings and interviewed numerous witnesses involved in the fight against child sexual exploitation: Federal and local law enforcement, Federal and local prosecutors, victims, educators, Internet Service Providers, and financial institutions. 
   What we learned during that investigation was shocking. At that time, three million images of child pornography were on the Internet. Even more disturbing was that law enforcement officers told the Committee that the images were becoming increasingly violent in nature, and that the victims in the photos were getting younger, some as young as two years old. 
   The children shown in those images suffer unspeakable pain and suffering. While law enforcement is working to tackle the epidemic of abuse that existed on the Internet, it was clear to us on the Committee that they did not have the resources to win that fight because child predators were working just as diligently to continue flooding the Internet with images of child sexual abuse. 
   I am proud to be the lead cosponsor of the House version of this bill, H.R. 3845, with Congresswoman WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ. I would like to thank her for her leadership on this issue and her work to get this bill before us today before we adjourn. The Senate did make some changes to the bill we passed last November. While I wish this bill had increased the funding for the law enforcement agencies that work child pornography cases--as our House bill did--this bill provides law enforcement with tools it did not have before to fight those predators who seek to exploit and abuse children, often for their own financial gain. 
   The bill requires that the Department of Justice develop a national strategy for investigating and prosecuting child exploitation cases. A number of law enforcement agencies are involved in investigating these cases: the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Postal Service, and state law enforcement. With a national strategy, the Justice Department must make sure that this fight is a priority, and that everyone is on the same page so that valuable law enforcement resources are not wasted when pursuing these criminals. 
   A national strategy doesn't work, though, if you don't give law enforcement agents the resources they need. The Energy and Commerce Committee investigation found that just as important as the Federal law enforcement effort against child pornography is the effort of State and local law enforcement Internet Crimes Against Children, or ``ICAC'' task forces. The vast majority of child sexual exploitation cases are prosecuted at the state level, but the funding nowhere near matched the needs of these state task forces. By authorizing $60 million per year over the next five years, the Protect Our Children Act ensures that state ICAC agents will finally receive the support they need. 
   Another key problem identified in our investigation was that law enforcement's ability to find and prosecute those predators who create and distribute child pornography was held up by a backlog at forensic computer labs. This is unacceptable, when the price of that backlog is continued child abuse. We address that problem in this bill by authorizing $2 million per year over the next five years to increase the capacity of these labs. 
   The Protect Our Children Act also includes a few provisions that weren't part of our House bill, but I think they strengthen the bill and the ability of law enforcement to prosecute these cases. The bill makes it a crime to change a photo of a child to produce child pornography. In addition, the bill makes clear that it is a crime to transmit live, or streaming, images of child abuse over the Internet. I think these provisions are just common sense, and I am glad they are included in this bill. 
   The bill also clarifies the responsibilities of Internet Service Providers when it comes to reporting child abuse images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Current law requires that Internet Service Providers report to the National Center, but it wasn't clear what information should be reported. This bill sets out what must be included in the reports and what the providers are required to do. This will ensure that law enforcement will have all the evidence the providers have when they pursue child predators. I think this is important, because our investigation showed that Internet child pornography is not just a law enforcement problem. If we are to win the war against child sexual exploitation, everyone must do his part, and this includes the Internet Service Providers. 
   We are long overdue in authorizing the resources law enforcement needs to fight the battle against the sexual exploitation of children over the Internet. The children who have been abused by predators, and who have seen images of that abuse spread over the Internet, cannot wait one more day. We must ensure that the efforts of child predators are more than matched by an aggressive law enforcement strategy to bring these criminals to justice. Our children deserve nothing less. I urge my colleagues to support the Protect Our Children Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (AMERICAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Well, thank you, Congressman Latta, and thank you for hosting this Special Order. 
   It's nice to be on the floor with the cameras on and with the microphones on. I was one of, I think, 135 Republican Members of the House who participated in what I called our American townhall meetings here on the floor during the August work period where we spoke to the tourists who were coming through the Capitol. We talked about the need for a comprehensive energy policy. We did it without the benefit of microphones and with the cameras off, just speaking extemporaneously to educate the American public and to keep a vigil for the American public for a real energy policy. 
   I notice that our distinguished Speaker today held a press conference at which she announced yet another attempt to politically confuse the American people by putting a so-called ``energy package'' on the floor perhaps on Thursday, perhaps on Friday, perhaps some day next week. One of her aides, in response to a question from the press corps after that press conference, said--and I'm not going to say this is an exact quote--that they would never allow the Republican energy package to come onto the floor because it was too radical. Well, that must be a different definition of ``radical'' than is in Webster's Dictionary, because what the Republican energy package is is the radical notion that Americans, themselves, can develop American resources so that we have American-made energy/American-produced energy to keep America's families and America's factories humming and being productive. I don't think that's radical. 
   I want to talk a little bit about a part of that energy policy, the Republican energy policy, which would be to allow drilling in ANWR, up in Alaska. I've been having my staff do a little bit of research, and I thought it might be beneficial to give the benefits of some of that research here to the Members on the floor and to others in the country. 
   In 1910, almost 100 years ago--I think it was while Teddy Roosevelt was President--the Congress passed a law for the development of American resources. That law stated that the Presidents and Congresses could set aside certain portions of Federal lands for different purposes if they felt that there might be some economic development potential in these Federal lands. It was called the Pickett Act. So, in 1924, they decided to create what we now call the Alaska Naval Petroleum Reserve. Now, there is a reason they picked this part of Alaska, which is to the west of Prudhoe Bay, fronting on  the Arctic Ocean. Here is the scientific basis on which they picked the Alaska Naval Petroleum Reserve in 1924. 
   New England whaling ships, as they had gone after whales in the Arctic Ocean, noticed that there were some oil seeps. So, based on that scientific evidence, they set up the Alaska Naval Petroleum Reserve. They didn't have the benefit of modern seismic geology or of any satellite photography or of any of the 3-D seismic differentiation that we have today. Some New England whaling ships, as they went ashore to look for water and things of this sort, noticed some oil seeps. 
   Okay. Fast forward to 1960. Alaska becomes a State, and the Alaska congressional-senatorial delegations decided that we needed to preserve some of these Alaskan lands. Alaska had been a territory. Now Alaska becomes a State. So they passed an act in 1960 that created to the east of Prudhoe Bay an area that we now call ANWR. Now, of course, there was a little bit more science available in 1960. So, when they set up the Alaskan National Wildlife Reserve, they were searching for oil, and they had discovered in what we now call Prudhoe Bay a specific geologic formation that they thought had the potential to find some oil. 
   It turns out they found the largest oil field on the North American continent that has been discovered here today, and so they wanted to set up a wildlife reserve. They already had the petroleum reserve to the west of Prudhoe Bay, so they decided they needed a wildlife reserve, and they set up what we call ANWR, but they had done enough scientific exploration that they knew there was an area that might have a lot of oil and/or gas. It was called section 1102. 
   So, when they created this reserve for wildlife, they put a section in the law that said, in this area, we want to really do some exploration activity to see if there might be something that could be developed commercially. Lo and behold, when they did that exploration activity of the discovery well, which was, I believe, drilled by Texaco, which is yet to be made public--it's proprietary information--there is enough that is known, we think, of that one area, of this one little section that is 3 square miles, that there could be 11 billion barrels of oil. 
   Now, as to the Alaska Naval Petroleum Reserve to the west of Prudhoe Bay, Speaker Pelosi and her Democratic friends have said we can drill over there; we can drill over there, but in the area that's now called ANWR to the east of Prudhoe Bay, you can't drill over there; you can't drill over there. There's no ecological difference. There's no environmental difference. There's really no wildlife habitat difference. 
   Just by happenstance, in the 1920s, we set up the petroleum reserve because whaling ships had seen oil seeps. In the 1950s and early 1960s when we created ANWR, as we were creating the wildlife reserve, we did carve out this section 1102 because we thought that might have some potential, and it appears it has huge potential, but today, we can't drill there because of moratoria that have been put in place in the last 30 years. 
   Now the question is: If we can only drill one well in America next year, where would it be? Would you drill down in Congressman Carter's district in Texas? in Mr. Latta's district in Ohio? in Mr. Broun's district in Georgia? in my district in Texas? 
   Mr. Carter and I represent a State in which we've drilled 2 million wells since 1895, 2 million. The probability of finding an 11 billion-barrel oil field in Texas by drilling one more well is one in 2 million. That's not very good odds. The probability of finding a major oil field in Ohio where they've drilled several hundred thousand wells is a little bit better. It's still not great. The probability of finding a major oil field in Georgia by drilling one well next year--I don't know how many wells have been drilled in Georgia. It's probably several thousand--is not too great. 
   If you drill one well in ANWR, you've got an almost 100 percent chance of finding a well that will produce tens of thousands of barrels a day, millions of barrels a year, billions of barrels over the life of the field, but we can't do it because, in the 1920s, we said the petroleum reserve is to the west of Prudhoe Bay. In the 1960s, we said the wildlife reserve is to the east. Even in section 1102, we put a moratorium in place. 
   Now the question to Mr. Latta and to the Members of the House: Is it radical to say let's drill up in ANWR? 
   Let's see. I don't think that's radical. Is it radical to drill in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which even the Democrats are beginning to think might make some sense? Is it radical to see what's off the Atlantic coast? Do you know how much exploration, how much seismic, how much geologic exploration we're doing off the Atlantic coast? Nada. Zero. None. 
   The Canadians are producing north of Maine. The Cubans are trying, and the Chinese are looking to produce south of Florida, but we've put the entire Atlantic coast off limits. Is it radical to at least see what's out there? I don't think that's radical. 
   Is it radical to try to develop our 2 trillion oil shale reserves, the 2 trillion barrels in Wyoming and in Colorado and in Utah? I don't think so. 
   So, Mr. Latta, if I were the Speaker, which I'm not, instead of these political flimflams that we've had now for the last year, here is what I would do--and I ask my colleagues: Is this a radical proposal? 
   I would pick a group of Republicans and Democrats who are respected in both parties. Let them put together a bipartisan proposal. Then on the proposals that cause the most angst in the liberal left of the Democratic Caucus, pick a conservative Democrat and a pro-energy Republican, and let them offer an amendment to the base package. Bring it to the floor. You don't have to bring the Republican bill to the floor. Bring this bipartisan bill with some amendments where we're not sure of the outcome, and let the House vote. 
   Now, in prior Democratic-controlled Congresses, that's basically why the energy packages were put together. They weren't put together by the Speaker's aides in a back room with no hearings and with no process. It was put together. It was bipartisan. It would come to the floor with amendments. 
   When we elect the Speaker for this body, the majority of the House--which right now is Democrat--elects that Speaker. It's what we did with Newt Gingrich. It's what we did with Denny Hastert when the Republicans were the majority. It's what the Democrats have done with the distinguished lady from San Francisco, Ms. Pelosi. 
   That Speaker has an obligation to, in this case, her party, the Democrats, but the Speaker also has an obligation to the American people. The Constitution and the rules of the House do not say that, once you get to be Speaker, you can only let bills come to the floor of which you know the outcome and that fit the political profile of the majority within your caucus. 
   Let's let there be a real debate on the floor in the next 3 weeks. Let's let there be real amendments. Let's see where the votes are. Now, my guess is the American people are smarter than the Speaker and the Speaker's staff. They want a commonsense, comprehensive energy policy that develops American-made energy for American use in the United States. 
   We'll win those votes, I believe--``we'' being the American people--if we get them. If we don't, as Leader Boehner has said, the Republicans are not going to accept a facade. We want the real deal. We want the real policies debated and voted on on this floor before we break for the elections in November. If we do that, Mr. Latta, the American people will win. Over time, energy prices will come down, and our economy will continue to grow. 
   I'm glad to participate in this Special Order. I appreciate the time. With that, I would yield back to you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee. 
   Before I speak in favor of the Ryan motion to instruct conferees on the budget, let me give you a post-SPR suspension update. The price of oil went up $1.73 on the mercantile market yesterday after we voted to suspend shipments into the SPR. At some point in time I sure hope it does come down and we'll work together, hopefully, in a bipartisan basis to bring oil and energy prices down. But our symbolic vote yesterday had the opposite effect of what it was intended because prices went up. 
   Let me speak now in favor of this motion to instruct. I would point all the Members in the body to the quote above the Speaker's rostrum by Daniel Webster. It says, the very first part of that quote, ``Let us develop the resources of our land.'' And this motion to instruct is a direct descendant of that sentiment. 
   We are not helpless, we are not hopeless in this country in terms of energy. If we will develop the resources of our land, we could, in all probability, within 5, maybe 6, 7 years, double the amount of oil or oil equivalent that we're producing right now in the United States. 
   We're currently producing somewhere between 6 and 7, maybe a little over 7 million barrels. As Congressman Young has just pointed out, if we were to drill in ANWR, it would start out with a production capacity, in all likelihood, of about 300,000 barrels a day. And in the optimum case, it could be ramped up to about 2 million barrels a day within 5 or 6 years. 
   We have over a million barrels a day of production off the coast of California. We have 2 trillion barrels of oil equivalent in the shale oil deposits in Wyoming and Colorado.     
   We haven't even inventoried what is off the coast of the east coast of the United States. We have the Chinese drilling between Cuba and Florida, and yet we're not allowed, because of moratoria, to drill there. 
   So we're not hopeless. We can also develop our coal resources. Congressman Shimkus has a bill on coal-to-liquids that is very helpful, and yet we stand here and refuse to adopt any supply-side policies at all as prices go higher and higher and higher.  
   If you live in an urban area where you don't depend on an automobile, you may not feel those high prices. But if you live in a suburban or rural area, well, you have to drive to work and drive to shop. If you work for a trucking company, if you work for an airline company and you see the price of diesel and the price of aviation fuel go higher and higher and higher, you feel it. It's not an academic exercise. 
   This motion to instruct simply says let's have some domestic development of our resources. Let's try to bring those prices down not with just the conservation component, but with the supply component. And with world markets where they are today, production of oil is somewhere around 85 million barrels a day. The consumption of oil is somewhere around 85 million barrels a day. The demand for oil in the United States in the last 2 months in a row has gone down, but the demand for oil in the rest of the world has gone up. And it's gone up more in the rest of the world than it's gone down here in the United States. 
   But if we were to be producing another 1 million, 2 million, 3 million barrels of oil a day in the United States, that would create a cushion that would take some of the heat out of the market and the price would go down. 
   I can't imagine any Member of this body that doesn't have a constituency that's concerned about higher food prices, higher energy prices, and higher prices of living. 
   Let's vote for the motion to instruct and try to get a supply component to our energy policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6331, the Medicare bill that is put before this Congress today on a suspension vote. 
   Somehow I missed it, but I didn't see the notice of the legislative hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on this. I didn't see the notice of the subcommittee markup on this bill. I didn't see the full committee notice to have a markup. I didn't get any notice of the technical corrections of the bill, which we received at 10 minutes until 10 a.m. this morning. 
   The majority seems to be under the mistaken impression that the less input and the less Republicans know about major bills, the more likely we are to vote for them. Well, I have a news flash. When we were not a part of the process, when we don't have any input into the policy, there is over a 95 to 100 percent we are going to be ``noes'' regardless of the substance of the bill. 
   On this particular bill, had we had some input, we would have strongly opposed the cuts to Medicare Advantage. A large number of us would have opposed the delay in the durable medical equipment competitive bidding that's supposed to go into effect on July 1 and, under the current bill, is also delayed for 18 months. There is obviously a need to fix the current physician reimbursement system. We have been in session now in this Congress almost 18 months, perhaps longer. You would think that in that time period, there could have been some legislative hearings. There could have been some draft proposals floated. There could have been some markups and some discussion and some give and take, and we could have found a compromise that would pass on the suspension calendar. But that has not been the case, as it was not the case on the CHAMP Act that my good friend from New Jersey just referred to. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, on this particular piece of legislation for this morning, I would strongly urge a ``no'' vote and ask all Members of this body that believe in regular process and give and take in policy reform to vote ``no,'' and then sometime when we come back after the July 4th work period, perhaps we can work together to do what needs to be done.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 6331, the Medicare bill put before this Congress today on a suspension vote. While I a agree that we should do something to address the Medicare physician payment cut that will take affect in just a few days, I do not support cutting Medicare Advantage to pay for this short-term fix. 
   This legislation cuts close to $50 billion from Medicare Advantage, a program that benefits seniors in every State and a program in which our seniors are deeply satisfied. I believe people benefit when they have the kind of choices that only market competition can provide, and that certainly includes choice in health care. As we have seen with the Medicare Part D drug benefit, when an entitlement program is subjected to market forces, everyone is a winner. The taxpayer gets lower spending in an entitlement program; the beneficiary pays lower premiums and co-pays; and we get to provide broader access to affordable and accountable health care for our seniors. 
   Yes, it is true that this bill provides temporary relief for payment cuts for physician services for the next year or so. So I guess as  Members we can rest assured that this problem will disappear for the next 18 months. 
   But what else have we signed on to if we are to pass this bill today? We have signed on to massive entitlement expansion through the revisions to the low-income subsidy and Medicare savings program. We have signed on to eliminating private, fee-for-service Medicare Advantage plan options that are currently available in 48 States. We have signed on to significant cuts in payment to all Medicare Advantage plans that work with teaching hospitals across this country. And last but not least, we have signed on to a process by which our own committees are now rendered useless in this Congressional body. 
   Over the course of the past year, there has not been one single Medicare hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Not one. I guess the doc fix is so important that it justifies taking a significant, political, and complex bill straight to the floor under a vote by suspension of the rules. 
   That means no consideration by the committees of jurisdiction and no amendments on the floor. For an issue that the Democrats like to consider bipartisan--avoiding a physician payment crisis--one has to ask, why not work with Republicans to enact something earlier and more meaningful? 
   We know why we are here today. If the Speaker is able to jam this down our throats today, we know that it will hit a brick wall in the Senate. How do we know this? Because this bill is just about like the one that recently failed in the Senate. And, the President has indicated that he will veto it, in the unlikely event that it passes both bodies. 
   So, we see that today's vote for a physician payment fix is merely the political exercise Republicans must endure so that Democrats may turn to their constituents when they return for the holiday next week and say, ``See, I tried to help you but those abominable old Republicans, why they just wouldn't let me. They don't even like puppies, I heard.'' 
   This bill temporarily stops the hemorrhaging, but it does not fix the long-term problem of physician payment. And the cure is likely worse than the illness--the doc fix is at the expense of our senior who enjoy their MA benefit. 
   I oppose this bill. I oppose the process--no committee hearings; no committee markups; no mention of the word Medicare in our committee at all. 
   Last year, I decried the politics of some of debates we had, and I was told that politics is a good thing for this body. Well, we're all elected to these seats, so we know a thing or two about politics, but at some point the people who elected us expect us to quit politicking and start governing. Too often this new Democratic Majority lacks the ideas they need to govern, and so they revert to politics.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I think we are entitled to cabal about the process. We represent about 48 percent of the American people and have had absolutely no input into a multi, multibillion-dollar temporary fix. This would only go into effect for 1 year. It doesn't solve the long-term program. So I think we are entitled to a little caballing, as they said.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, again, I have missed the legislative hearing on this issue in the last 18 months. Maybe they had it in the other body, but we haven't had it here. The actual bill that we are addressing, we got it at 10 minutes until 10 this morning. This is the same group that passed a farm bill that left out a complete title, and we are passing a 278 page bill that the original substance I think we got Friday or Monday, the technical corrected copy we got at 10 until 10. 
   I may be mistaken, but I believe if we had a process that worked and had enough time to think about it, if we had actually been holding hearings and substantive markups and all that is on the books of how the Congress is supposed to work, we would probably have a bill for the suspension calendar that both parties could work for. But the way our friends in the majority are operating these days, the proof is in the pudding. 
   I would strongly recommend a ``no'' vote, and then let's do it right. Let's do it right so we can vote for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. We do have a serious issue here, Mr. Speaker. We have known for several years that we needed to fix the current system for physician reimbursement. We also have known that in some of the other issues that have been put into this bill, that there are areas of reform that need to be implemented. One of the things that I have worked on for over 12 years is a competitive bidding process for durable medical equipment which is supposed to go into effect July 1 of this year. The pending bill has a moratorium on that implementation I believe for 18 months, which I think is ill-advised. 
   But I do think that when each of us gets elected to this body, when we go out and campaign and ask for Members and voters to support us, we don't say: If you vote for me, I will go to Washington and I will make sure that I have no input into major issues, and when they are put up at the last minute I will go vote ``yes'' on the suspension calendar. That is not what we say. 
   This is a serious issue. There are serious issues that need to be addressed in this bill. I am not sure this bill is even a House bill. My understanding is that it is a failed version of a Senate bill that has been patched together for purposes of a vote today just in case there is not a bipartisan compromise later in the week, as Congressman McCrery spoke about earlier. 
   Process does count. Policies are better if there is bipartisan input and you go through the give and take of subcommittee, full committee markup where stakeholders and Congressmen and women on both sides of the aisle can be involved. That has not happened here. 
   Again, this is a multibillion-dollar bill. Even if it were to be passed, it only has the effect for the rest of this year and the next calendar year. It is not a permanent fix. It doesn't address long term these issues. And all of the groups that are supporting the bill today that have been enunciated by the majority, when they have been in to see me they are talking about a permanent fixes, they are not talking about a temporary quick fix, patch it, go on down the road, kick the can fixes, which is what this is if it were to be implemented. 
   So I really hope that we can vote against this. Since it is a suspension vote, it only needs 146 ``no'' votes and it would fail, and then we could work together to perhaps on a permanent way fix some of these in a bipartisan way. So I urge a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6346. I know it is very similar to a bill that my friend introduced a year ago, and I think we even had a vote on the House floor a year ago on the bill, but there are some changes. Let me give the process argument against it, and then I will give the policy argument against it. 
   The process argument against it is a bill that is introduced on one day, is voted out of the House Floor the next day. That certainly shows a speedy government, but it doesn't show due process under the normal rules of the House of Representatives. 
   It would be good to have a legislative hearing on the bill and to have either a subcommittee and/or, and preferably or, a full committee markup. We have a number of bills right now that have been introduced on oil speculation in the futures markets. My friend, Mr. Stupak of Michigan, has introduced a bill, I have introduced a bill. He and I and the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Dingell, are on a bill together on that issue. We had an excellent oversight hearing yesterday that Chairman Stupak chaired. We have got a commitment from Chairman Dingell that we are going to have a legislative hearing and go through regular order on the oil speculation bill. So we will have an oil speculation bill on the floor hopefully within the month that will have gone through the process, that will be bipartisan. This bill doesn't meet that test. It was introduced in its current form yesterday and we are voting on it on the floor today.  
   Now, as to the substance of the bill. Let me read into the record some information on prices. These are national average gasoline prices in the United States of America. 
   In 2006, the average retail price was $2.56 a gallon. This is the national retail price for self-serve unleaded gasoline. The average retail margin was 14 cents, and the average credit card fee was a little over 6 cents. Last year in 2007, the average retail price had gone up to $2.79. The average retail margin was still 14 cents, and the average credit card fee had gone up to 7 cents. 
   So far, for data that we have this year for calendar year 2008, the average retail price has jumped to $3.37. Now we know as a side note that as of today the average national retail price is a little over $4, I believe $4.07. The average retail margin has gone down to 12 cents, so we have lost 2 cents in retail margin, and the average credit card fee has gone up 8.4 cents. 
   So based on, such as there is, the definition of price gouging in this bill, which if you go over to page 3 of the bill, they don't directly have a definition of price gouging, but in the factors considered on page 3 of the bill it does speak about a price that grossly exceeds--we don't know what grossly means--grossly exceeds the average price at which the applicable gasoline or other petroleum distillate offered for sale during the 30 days prior to a proclamation, which is a presidential emergency proclamation, or grossly exceeds the price at which the same or similar gasoline or petroleum distillate was readily obtainable in the same period. 
   So to the extent we have a definition of price gouging in this bill, it is based on an average price 30 days prior or an average price in the same period. 
   Based on that kind of implicit definition, we don't have price gouging, as far as I can tell, going on in the United States of America today. We do have high prices. There is no question that an average national price of $4.08 a gallon for self-service unleaded is a price that we should not be having to pay right now. But the reason we have that price is not because of price gouging at retail. If the average national price is a little over $4, and that is the average, in some parts of the country I am told out in California it is up over $4.20. In my State in Texas, I did not see but I was told that in Dallas near Love Field they were having a gas price war and you could get a gallon for $3.62, which is a price that is certainly preferable to $4 or $4.50. But according to the statistics that I have, we don't have price gouging going on in the United States of America. 
   The second point. I am not aware of any pending State action on price gouging. And almost every State in the Union has State law that gives the State Attorney General the ability to go after price gougers within the boundaries of that State. Now, my friend from Michigan may have information about some price gouging efforts that are going on at the State level, but I don't have that information. That would indicate that we don't--again, we have high gasoline prices and high diesel prices and high fuel oil prices and high aviation fuel prices, but it is not because of retail or wholesale price gouging. 
   The second issue with the bill, it requires the declaration of a Presidential energy emergency. I am going to read that title or that paragraph: 
   The President may issue an energy emergency proclamation for any area within the jurisdiction of the United States during which the prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply. The proclamation shall state the geographic area, the gasoline or other petroleum distillate covered, and the time period that such proclamation shall be in effect. 
   The bill doesn't give any definition as to why the President should declare an energy emergency, but it does say that, in order for the bill to go into effect, the President has to declare that emergency. It has the term in the bill unconscionable pricing, but again does not define it. It just says unconscionably excessive, or the seller is taking unfair advantage. It doesn't define that. 
   So here we have a bill that has not been through any kind of a process, no hearings. My good friend from Michigan did introduce a similar bill last year, and so it is obviously something that perhaps at the Federal level--and I say perhaps. I am not saying it should be, but I will admit that it could be addressed. We passed a price gouging bill in the last Congress in this body. It went to the other body, it went to the Senate, and was not passed over there. 
   So I can't say categorically that I am opposed to any price gouging legislation. But I do think, on process grounds, it ought to go through the committee system. And I think on policy grounds, this bill is undefined, it doesn't state the reasons the President should declare a national emergency, it doesn't define what unconscionably excessive is. It appears to base when you would bring a finding based on an average price that was it in a region 30 days before the current period or a price in the region in the current period that is grossly excessive. And, again, it doesn't define grossly excessive. 
   So Mr. Speaker, I know there is a lot of pressure on the Congress doing something. I would state we would be better served to look at the underlying fundamentals, and the underlying fundamental is pretty straightforward: 
   Oil is a fungible commodity. It can be produced anywhere in the world; and once it is produced, it can be shipped and refined anywhere in the world. We are currently consuming worldwide about 85 million barrels of petroleum products, and we have the capacity to produce about 86 million barrels. So we have about a 1 million barrel per day surplus production capacity. That is less than 1 percent. 
   Any time you get the oil markets less than 3 percent capacity in terms of surplus over the demand, you are going to have what is called a very tight market, and the prices are going to tend to spike because there is enough uncertainty in the market that people will bid up, not necessarily in the United States, but in China and India and the developing countries where demand is high and increasing, they will bid these high prices to get that marginal barrel of oil. 
   What we need to do in this Congress on this floor is bring to the floor bills that address the fundamental supply situation. The United States of America is a treasure house of energy resources. We have 2 trillion barrels of shale oil reserves. We have a 300-year supply of coal that we can convert to liquids. We have hundreds of billions of barrels potentially of oil reserves that are off-limits in the Outer Continental Shelf and in the State of Alaska and on the Federal lands and the lower 48 that we have put off-limits from drilling. 
   Only 6 percent of the Federal lands in the United States have been made available for leasing under current law. We need to unlock our treasure house. We need to at least start the process of letting there be an opportunity to increase American made energy for America's families. And if we do that, we won't need to depend on false remedies like price gouging legislation. We can bring to the floor bills that increase our supply. And as our supply increases, the price we have to pay will go down, will change domestically and in the world the fundamental supply/demand equation. That is why we have high prices. We are not meeting the demand for energy in the United States from American-made energy, but we could do a lot better. 
   So I have great respect for my friend from Michigan. I understand it is difficult to focus on the long term in the mid-term strategy. But bringing bills like this to the floor, they may be politically satisfying, but they do not do anything to address the underlying problems. So I would hope that we would vote against this legislation, and then work together on substantive issues that will address the supply and demand inequality. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. I would like my good friend, Mr. Markey, to stay at the microphone and let's have a little colloquy, if he is willing. 
   I recognize myself for 1 minute just to make an observation. 
   I don't know, Mr. Speaker, that this is a totally true story, so that's why I needed Mr. Markey's input. But I am told when he was a young man, he sold ice cream cones and Popsicles outside of Fenway Park. I am also told that he bought or purchased those ice cream cones and Popsicles at a very low price, and he tended to mark the price to market in a somewhat monopolistic fashion. And so depending on how hot the day was and how heated the Red Sox nation was, he was known to price those Popsicles in a way that maximized his profit. 
   Now my question, if he is willing to answer it, would he consider what he did selling Popsicles and ice cream cones outside of Fenway Park as a young lad, would he consider that unconscionably excessive price gouging, or would he consider that simply being a capitalistic entrepreneur?

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Well, Mr. Speaker, let me just simply say in closing that with regards to the last speaker's comment about the futures market, I tend to agree there may be something that we need to look at. That's why I'm on a bill with Mr. Stupak and Mr. Dingell to look at the futures market. But on page 3 of this bill, there is a line that specifically excludes the futures market from the jurisdiction of the bill that's before us. 
   We have a Federal price gouging bill on the floor right now that deals with retail and wholesale price gouging when there is absolutely no evidence of States' attorneys general conducting prosecutions of price gouging anywhere in this country. And as I pointed out in my opening statement, the average retail price for gasoline is up while retail margins are down, refineries margins are down. 
   Retail prices are up because the wholesale price of crude oil is up over $130 a barrel. We're not doing anything in this bill to address that fundamental supply problem. We are a treasure house of energy resources here in the United States. We could produce more American energy for America's families and factories. 
   You know, a price gouging bill when you don't have any real evidence of price gouging and where the States that think there's price gouging going on in their States have legislation to deal with that seems to me to be superfluous and symbolic. 
   So I would ask for a ``no'' vote on this legislation, and let's work together on issues that would fundamentally address the supply and balance and bring prices down. 
   With that, I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Chairman, this is an unfortunate day. Today, here on the floor of the House of Representatives, we are witnessing a blatant disregard for sound policy, fiscal restraint, and due process by the Majority Leadership. The Farm Bill that we are debating today is not the bill that was reported out of the Committee on Agriculture. It is a product of a late night raid by Leadership on the rules process to insert yet another tax increase. 
   Farm programs have always had their champions and their detractors, but in the 22 years that I have served in this body, it has never been a partisan issue. I have voted in favor of almost every Farm Bill that has come before me, but I cannot vote for this one. I have consistently supported the hard working farmers and ranchers in my district, and I will continue to do so. But I cannot support this tax increase that has been added without debate, and without relevant committee input. 
   Over the past year, I have had the chance to visit with producers from across my district. Practically every single one of them has told me that the Farm Bill we passed in 2002 has proven to be a sound safety net for their various enterprises. The bill that was reported out of the Agriculture Committee continued those proven principals. Unfortunately, this is not that bill. 
   As ranking Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am also concerned that  this bill, which has an entire title (Title 9) devoted to energy, was never seen by our committee. Beyond that, it seems that the left hand of our Majority in this body does not know what its right hand is doing. As the year began, I was a little surprised that the Majority seemed disinclined to work with me or other Members of the Minority in preparing energy legislation. But now I realize that they do not even consult with each other. 
   Take a look at the energy provisions of the Farm Bill. They overlap and duplicate provisions in the legislation reported a few weeks ago by the Committee on Energy & Commerce. 
   The Farm Bill has incentives for increased ethanol production; grants for consumer education on ethanol; a biomass fuel production section, etc. 
   Meanwhile, the Energy & Commerce Committee has provisions to do these and similar things in its bill. Energy & Commerce has grants for cellulosic ethanol production, consumer education for flexible fuel vehicles, a study of ethanol blended gasoline, and others. 
   If the Majority would like, I'll be happy to offer my services to help them sort out and reconcile these provisions among the two bills. 
   Of course, if the Agriculture Committee's bill had been referred to the Energy and Commerce Committee as it should have been, we could have accomplished that reconciliation before the Farm Bill ever got to the floor, avoiding this confusion, conflict, and redundancy. That is why we have rules in this body on jurisdiction and that's why we should go back to following those rules.

   Now I know there are men and women of integrity on the Democratic side of the aisle, because last week the dean of the House, JOHN DINGELL of Michigan, in the Energy and Commerce Committee, when I as a ranking member used a procedural rule to force the reading of bill, he read the bill. It is not what he wanted to do, but it is what the rules allowed and required.

   I have the privilege to represent over 2,500 GM assembly workers and managers at the GM assembly plant in Arlington, Texas. They produce the highest quality products, SUV, hybrids, pickups in the world. They export a fair number of the products that they manufacture, and they manufacture over 200,000 vehicles on an annual basis every year. 
   It would be an absolute shame if we either force these companies into bankruptcy or watch them totally go out of business because they had the misfortune to be in a business cycle where gasoline was $4 a gallon and their product sale fell 40 percent on average in 1 year. 
   If I lost 40 percent of my votes in this last election in 2008, I would not be coming back as a Member-elect of the next Congress. 
   If we can give the AIGs and the Wells Fargos and the J.P. Morgans of the world, each of those individual companies, between 40 and $25 billion, in what amounts to some sort of a very unsecured loan, to be generous about it, certainly we can give the American nameplate automotive industry a $15 billion bridge loan that has a 5 percent interest rate for, I believe, the first 5 years and then a 9 percent interest rate after that; that has an automobile czar appointed by President Bush to oversee the industry, and force them to be accountable on any expenditure over $14 million. 
   I would ask for a ``yes'' vote on the bill.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we are here once again on an issue that should have been solved, like, March of this year. 
   An emergency meeting of the Rules Committee was noticed at 7:30 last evening to be commenced at 8:30. That meeting lasted until midnight. 
   Dr. MICHAEL BURGESS, a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, attended with me to represent the Energy and Commerce Committee in the negotiations before the Rules Committee. He offered an amendment to this bill and was told it was not in order because he didn't get it in time. Didn't get it in time. An emergency meeting that is noticed at 7:30, that starts at 8:30, that lasts till midnight, Dr. Burgess shows up with his amendment and is told, I am sorry, we can't have your amendment in order because it wasn't in time. We didn't even know there was going to be a meeting until 7:30. 
   Once again, we have a closed rule, which means there are no amendments made in order. Once again, we have a bill that was not seen, at least by those of us on the minority side, until approximately 7 to 7:15 last evening. Once again, we have a bill where there have been really no bipartisan negotiations. There have been some consultations with certain members of the minority party, I have to admit that. 
   I don't know what the distance is from here to there, but I am going to guess it's about 12 feet. Let's see. It's 18 feet. Now, if I really wanted to negotiate, and I was in the majority, I would say, let's get together and talk. I would reach out to my left and I would reach out to my right, each of us come about 9 feet, we could negotiate. 
   But here is how the Democrats do it. They haven't even said we wanted you to negotiate, but if they did, they head out the door. They are going around the world to meet us halfway when they could just do it 9 feet apart. I don't understand that. 
   Let's vote the rule down. Then let's get together and really negotiate. 
   Now, I want to give Ms. Slaughter some credit. She was born in Texas. Her instincts are right. We did get a motion to recommit today, for the first time. When we get to the motion to recommit, we are going to have an opportunity to put forward a proposal that is positive for SCHIP that has been put together by the Republicans. 
   I will tell my friends on the majority side, it's not going to be a gimmick. I think it will say ``forthwith,'' which means if we adopt it, we vote on it.     
   So I look forward to the debate, and I look forward to the motion to recommit. If we really want a bill the President would sign, I would say vote for the motion to recommit. But right now, vote against the rule so we can get some amendments made in order and have a real debate.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   I want to talk about enforcement of this 300 percent above the poverty line. The people that wrote the bill claimed that we have got this hard cap above 300 percent in terms of family income. 
   But if you look on page 76 of the bill, the first part of it, starting with line 5, says, ``no payment shall be made under this section for any expenditures for providing child health assistance or health benefits coverage for a targeted low-income child whose effective family income would exceed 300 percent of the poverty line.'' 
   That sounds okay, but then here is the gotcha, beginning on line 13, ``but for the application of a general exclusion of a block of income that is not determined by type of expense or type of income.'' 
   So you leave it up to the States to say you can't have an income level over 300 percent, but you can deduct $20,000 for a housing allowance or you can deduct $15,000 for shelter or whatever.     
   So what you've got here is the classic bait and switch. I would say that the majority has listened to some of the concerns of the minority, but you're not really ready to address them substantively. You put the right verbiage in the first paragraph and then you take it away in the second. At some point in time we need to sit down together and really work these things out to make sure that you not only have the verbiage, you also have the enforcement. Now when that day comes, we will have a bipartisan bill. But that day is not today.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I'm reminded of a homeowner who is getting ready to sell their home. It's a little older shop and it's shopworn and has not seen its best day. So they have a building inspector come out to inspect the home before they put it up for market. And the inspector gives the report, and the inspector says, ``You've got some major termite damage in the walls, and I think you need to really rebuild the walls.'' 
   And the homeowner says, ``We'll paint over it.'' 
   He says, ``Your plumbing is all rusted out. I think you really need to replace the plumbing.'' 
   And the homeowner says, ``We'll paint over it.'' 
   Then he says, ``I think your insulation and your electrical system's very frayed and you need to replace it.'' 
   And the homeowner says, ``Well, we'll paint over it.'' 
   What we have here today is basically the same bill that we had last week where we sustained the President's veto. Our friends on the majority side of the aisle have just painted over it. 
   Now, they are saying the right rhetorical things. They're saying that nobody above 300 percent of poverty is going to get a benefit, but they then disregard the enforcement mechanisms that would enforce that. 
   They say in section 605 that no illegal alien is going to get a benefit, but then they change the enforcement mechanisms so that if somebody has a Social Security card and a name to it, that's all they have to do to prove citizenship, and the Social Security Administration, rightfully so, says that is really not a proof of citizenship if you are able to get a Social Security card. 
   And they claim that they're going to take the adults off the program within a year, but according to the CBO, at least a half million adults are still going to be on the program in 5 years. 
   So it's the same bill with a little bit different paint. In Texas we have a saying, ``You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.'' 
   This bill is a pig. It may be a good pig. It may be a nice pig. It may be intended to be the right kind of pig. But it's still a pig. 
   Vote ``no'' on the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I appreciate my good friend, Mr. Dingell, asking that the motion to recommit be read. I did the same thing in committee on the 593-page bill, so I think payback is fair. So I don't have a problem with that. I hope that the Members in the Chamber actually listened to the reading of the Clerk, because those that did will agree with me on the following things. 
   First of all, we have taken the 293-page bill that we got at approximately 7 p.m. last evening and left most of it untouched. We have changed approximately 15 pages of a 293-page bill. We have listened carefully to our friends on the majority side at what they say they want, and we have tried to implement those changes in this motion to recommit. 
   We start out with the fact that our friends on the majority side agree with us that SCHIP should be for the poor and the near-poor in American society. This motion to recommit eliminates the loophole for income-disregards that would allow States to actually cover children and families in all probability well above 300 percent. So we have an elimination action in this motion to recommit that would eliminate that loophole. 
   We also believe that before you go above 200 percent of poverty, you should cover the children below 200 percent of poverty, so we have a requirement in the motion to recommit that States cannot go above 200 percent of poverty until they have covered at least 90 percent of the eligible SCHIP and Medicare children below 200 percent of the poverty line. 
   We take statements like Chairman Rangel of the Ways and Means Committee and Chairman Dingell of the Energy and Commerce Committee at face value when they say they don't want illegal aliens to be covered in the bill. We put a requirement in the motion to recommit that applies the same citizenship documentation requirements for SCHIP as we have for Medicaid in the Deficit Reduction Act and applies those to the 16 States that it does not currently apply to. 
   We also take the majority at their word when they say that they really want SCHIP to be for children. The motion to recommit would take all adults off the program within 1 year except for pregnant women. We would continue to cover pregnant women under the SCHIP program. 
   We have a concern about when you begin to go above 200 percent of poverty that you actually begin to crowd out the private insurance market, so we do have a requirement in the motion to recommit that if a State wants to go above 200 percent of poverty, they have to have, they must have, a premium support assistance program that would give those families that have private insurance the option to continue to receive the private insurance, and they get premium assistance from that State government.  
   Finally, the motion to recommit has been scored by the CBO as saving at least $10 billion from the pending bill. 
   Also, in full disclosure, I need to point out we do not change in the motion to recommit the pay-for, so the portion of the underlying bill that does have a tobacco tax, we do not touch that. We don't try to move it up, we don't try to move it down, we don't try to substitute for it. The motion to recommit that we offered in August had that same provision, but I think in the interests of full disclosure, we need to put that on the table. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5669, the ``Poison Center Support, Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008.'' I would like to thank my friend from New York, Mr. Towns, and, my friend from Nebraska, Mr. Terry, for introducing this important legislation, and I want to thank Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman Pallone for working in a bipartisan manner as we moved this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   As our primary defense against injury and death from poisoning, poison centers are a vital part of our healthcare system in the United States. Few people realize that poisoning is the second most common form of unintentional death in the United States. In 2005, there were over 26,000 deaths in the United States caused by the ingestion of poisons that resulted from approximately 5 million incidents of poison exposure. And without question, the number of deaths and debilitating injuries resulting from poisoning would be significantly higher if it weren't for the strong network of poison centers we already have, and with passage of the legislation before us today, I am confident that we can make a great program even better. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues for their efforts on this bipartisan bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today, H.R. 3058, represents a thinly veiled attempt to create a partisan fight over a nonpartisan issue. For several years now, Members from both sides of the aisle have struggled to find a way to pay for the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools program.  We have found such a compromise in Congressman Walden's substitute to H.R. 3058. But that is not what we are voting on today. 
   The Walden compromise that has been approved by the stakeholder organizations contains reauthorization of both Payments in Lieu of Taxes and the Secure Rural Schools program which are so vital for people whose counties are majority owned by the Federal Government, and thus don't have the property tax base to support education. But that is not the bill we are voting on today. 
   The proposed Walden compromise addresses our growing energy crisis by expanding state control and protection of the outer continental shelf, and by producing new energy in the deep ocean. It provides funding for front-end engineering and design grants for coal-to-liquids, oil shale, tar sands, carbon sequestration, and enhanced oil recovery. 
   Congressman Walden's compromise proposal contains provisions that have been previously debated on this floor, passed by this body, and approved by the administration. But that is not the bill we are voting on today. 
   The bill we are voting on today breaks contracts that were negotiated in good faith between the previous administration and American energy providers. The bill we are voting on today has prompted a veto threat, and will probably not even make it through the House today. If the majority wants to make this a partisan vote, so be it. That is their prerogative. But let me make one thing clear; the superintendents of Groveton, Crockett, Latexo, Grapeland, Lovelady, and Kennard Independent School Districts do not care about partisanship. The reality of what we are doing today is that these, and thousands of other school administrators, are going to have to cut jobs and programs as they see their revenues shrink drastically. All for the sake of making a political statement. 
   When Congress decided to take land out of the tax base of thousands of rural counties in order to create our National Forest System, we made a promise to help cover the cost of education. We have a chance to fulfill this promise by taking up the Walden compromise for Secure Rural Schools and PILT reauthorization. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the political stab before us today, and I urge majority to bring to the floor Congressman Walden's proposal as soon as possible. Our rural communities depend on it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  
   Madam Speaker, one of the things that has been talked about in this debate is that the pending bill before us does not allow illegal aliens to receive benefits, and there is a section in the bill, section 605 that says that. But it has no enforcement. And in another part of the bill the requirement for citizenship verification is repealed, and the substitution for that is a requirement that a beneficiary or potential beneficiary simply show a Social Security number.     
   And as we all know, there are millions of fraudulent Social Security numbers floating around. So when we actually do get down to negotiating the conference after this veto is sustained, I hope that my friends in the majority will work with us in the minority to make sure that illegal aliens do not get benefits and that we have the appropriate enforcement mechanism in the bill that we send to the President. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, what we have today is a classic case of a Washington, DC, nonintersecting conversation. Since the President vetoed this bill several weeks ago, my friends on the majority side have spent 2 weeks encouraging outside groups and perhaps their political arm, I am not sure about that, to spend millions of dollars in television and radio ads bombarding targeted Republicans to get them to change their vote. 
   Now, that is only the sixth time in history that we know of that a veto has not been brought to the floor immediately on the President's veto. The result is going to be that when we get to the vote in the next hour or so, the next 30 minutes or so, the President's veto will be sustained. Then, hopefully, we will have the real bipartisan negotiations that should have started 6 or 7 months ago. 
   It is interesting to me that we are still having a misunderstanding about the basic facts. And the reason is, we have never had a legislative hearing in either the Ways and Means Committee or the Energy and Commerce Committee. We have not had a subcommittee markup in either of the jurisdictional committees. And we really didn't have a markup at full committee, because the original bill for SCHIP was a 500-page mammoth bill that we got at midnight the day before it was supposed to be marked up in the case of the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   But once we do sustain the President's veto, we are going to have these negotiations I hope. And first we are going to talk about the kids. Both sides are talking about the kids. Well, here are the facts. Under current law, every child in America who is below 100 percent of poverty is covered by Medicaid. Both parties support that. Under current law, every child in America who lives in a family between 100 and 200 percent of poverty is covered by SCHIP if they will sign up. Now, there are some children and families that won't sign up. In Dallas, Texas, I am told that only 33 percent of the eligible SCHIP children are actually in an SCHIP program. That is a travesty. We ought to do something together to reach out to those children and those families to make sure that they either have SCHIP coverage or private insurance, that they have something. We can work together on that on a bipartisan basis. 
   Now, once you get above 200 percent of poverty, we have a difference of opinion. The original House bill said go to 400 percent of poverty. That bill is dead. The bill before us goes to 300 percent. It is a legitimate policy argument: If you want to go above and expand the program, how much do you expand it above 200 percent? Do you go to 300 percent? Do you go to 250 percent? The Republican alternative is, let's cover the lowest income kids first. Once we get 90 percent of those kids covered below 200 percent of poverty, let's let States go to 250 percent. That is the Barton-Deal alternative that we have the discharge petition on. But that is a legitimate policy argument. 
   Now, let's talk about illegal aliens. Under current law, you are not supposed to cover a child of an illegal alien. But they are covered because there is no verification enforcement system. In the pending bill, they have section 605 that says no benefit shall go to children of illegal aliens. But that is  all it says. There is no enforcement mechanism. There is no enforcement mechanism. That is something we can work on in the conference. That is something we can work on together to really put some enforcement to make sure that SCHIP benefits are for citizens and legal residents. We can work on that. 
   Let's vote to sustain the President's veto, and then let's work together to get a program that really is for the kids, not for adults, that really is for citizens, and that we can afford.  
   Well, Madam Speaker, there they go again. Once again, we are being forced by the Democratic Leadership of the House to vote on a bill that exists almost exclusively to help Democrats score political points against the President. 
   We're going to sustain the President's veto today, and we're going to do it because the President did the right thing by vetoing this poorly written expansion of federalized health care that leaves the poorest kids behind. Anybody who cares about needy children can vote against this bad bill proudly. 
   I'm both proud and concerned that Republicans had no part in writing this legislation. Proud because this bill is an embarrassment. Concerned because we're all supposed to be legislating on behalf of children, and as everybody knows, no Republican Member of this House was even asked for an opinion, much less invited to participate in writing the Democratic SCHIP bill. 
   I don't even think the Democrats who wrote it understand what they've done. I challenge the supporters of this bill to look people in the eye and say that they understand all of the provisions that are actually in this bill. Because I have some questions for you. 
   Madam Speaker, it would be a compliment to say that the so-called process which produced this bill is an abuse of our democratic system of Government. It was so much worse than garden-variety abuse. It was pathetic. Yet, I'm sure that some will show up here with a handful of talking points from your Democratic staffers who actually constructed this legislation, and you will explain to us that it is not an abomination at all, but a wondrous triumph of bipartisanship. 
   Give me the name of one Republican in the entire House of Representatives who directly participated in these discussions. Name just one. 
   I know that the authors of this bill certainly did not consult with either Mr. Deal or myself, I know that they have not included any Members of the Republican Leadership in the House; and I'm not aware of a single Republican Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee or the Ways and Means Committee being invited to participate in this process. 
   And although we were excluded from the negotiations and the Democratic Leadership has repeatedly refused to hold a legislative hearing on this bill, we have learned a few facts from the official projections produced by the Congressional Budget Office, and from what I've read, this bill isn't something that I could ever support. 
   For example, we know that the vast majority of the people added to the SCHIP program under the Democrats' bill will either already have private health insurance or they live in families with incomes too high to be eligible for SCHIP coverage today. 
   In fact, the Congressional Budget Office projects that H.R. 976 will lead to over 1.2 million new enrollees will be added to SCHIP as a result of an ``expansion of SCHIP and Medicaid eligibility to new populations.'' This means that these 1.2 million children live in families whose incomes are too high to qualify for the current SCHIP program. On the other hand, CBO projects that only 800,000 currently SCHIP eligible kids will be enrolled as a result of H.R. 976. This means that 50 percent more higher-income kids will be enrolled than currently SCHIP eligible kids. 
   And who will be paying for this expansion of SCHIP eligibility to higher-income families? Well, according to the Congressional Research Service, the vast majority of the $70 billion in additional tobacco tax revenues will come from low-income families. In fact, the Congressional Research Service said that tobacco taxes are ``the most regressive of the federal taxes.'' 
   So, with H.R. 976, the Democrats really are taxing the poor in order to give to the rich. 
   In their defense, I guess it is difficult for the Democratic Leadership to know exactly what is in their own bill since it has neither been subject to a single legislative hearing nor conferenced by the House and the Senate. 
   Madam Speaker, I wonder if someone can explain to me why the Democratic Leadership decided to wait until just days before SCHIP expires to bring their reauthorization to the House floor. We have known for well over 10 years that the current SCHIP authorization would expire on September 30, 2007, and the Democratic Leadership in the House and the Senate have known since early November of 2006 that they would be in charge of actually producing a bill to reauthorize this vital health care program for low-income, uninsured children. Yet, here they were, a full 10 months later, jamming a bill through the House with fewer than three legislative days before the entire program expires and children's health care stops. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, I was not sent here by the 6th District of Texas to be quiet and do what the gentle lady from San Francisco instructs me to do. I was sent here to represent my constituents' best interests and I demand the ability to do what I have sworn to do. 
   We all know that the President promised to veto this version of the bill, so why did we waste precious time on a bill that we all know didn't stand a chance of ever becoming law? 
   While we are down here on the floor participating in this Theatre of the Absurd, the Democratic Leadership is in the back rooms trying to figure how they will extend the SCHIP program for another 6 months or a year. We all know this to be a fact, but I guess the Democrats want to pick a fight with the president so they can pretend that he is against children, and only then will they permit everybody to do the right thing and extend SCHIP. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm sorry it's come to this. The pettiness of this transparent political strategy to damage and weaken the president is a new low. 
   I'd hoped that we would not engage in this game, and it's still not too late to stop it. We could start debating how to best extend the SCHIP program so that we can actually do the job people sent us here to do. We still have a chance to write a responsible, long-term reauthorization of the SCHIP program. Now, it's true that writing a solid, bipartisan bill will not give the Democrats the ``political victory'' that they are hoping for, but that's the price that Democrats will have to pay. Given that millions of needy children are depending on us, it doesn't seem like a big price. 
   I am ready to start today to sit down with the Majority and reach a compromise bill so we can reauthorize this program expeditiously. Short 6-week extensions are irresponsible. We can and should come up with a compromise that can be signed into law and that ensures that low income children continue to have access to the SCHIP program. We should not drag this political process out any longer than today. Let us dispense with politics and commence with legislating. 
   Here's a way that will get me to call the President and urge him to sign up fast. 
   Require that States find and enroll 90 percent of the kids under 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level before they go looking for more people with higher incomes. 
   States should be free to spend their own money, of course, but Federal taxpayers in 49 States shouldn't be made to subsidize the health care premiums for one State making $80,000 a year. 
   No adults except pregnant women, please. No more childless couples and, beginning in 2009, and Medicaid-eligible adults should move to Medicaid. 
   Let's preserve the requirement that States document the citizenship and identity of Medicaid applicants. Just writing down a Social Security number doesn't make you a citizen. 
   A bipartisan effort could pass this bill in a week, and doing so would make sense to poor kids, their families and nearly everybody outside the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

This public safety interoperability problem has gone on far too long, which is why the Energy and Commerce Committee is playing a stronger leadership role in setting the policy direction through its communications jurisdiction. 
   Our Committee authored a section in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that set a final date for the DTV transition that will transfer 24 MHz of spectrum to public safety. To help first responders communicate on this spectrum efficiently, the DTV legislation also established the $1 billion Public Safety Interoperable Communications grant program to leverage NTIA's extensive telecommunications and spectrum policy expertise. 
   To improve interoperability throughout the Nation, Congress directed the NTIA to identify and fund forward-looking, spectrum-efficient, cost-effective and timely solutions. That program was designed to be separate from other programs, with its own criteria, and its own metrics for success. Until our existing, disparate public safety networks can communicate together, we will not truly be equipped to respond to a natural or man-made disaster.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First, I want to apologize to the body. I thought that we went in at 10 o'clock this morning. When I left last evening, that is what it said. My staff did call me last night and tell me I needed to be on the floor by 9:30, but I thought they were gaming me, trying to get me here by 10 and telling me I had to be here by 9:30. Obviously, we did convene at 9, and I showed up at about 10 till. I thought I was 10 minutes early. So I apologize to my brethren for not being here. 
   There is an old saying that an apple a day keeps the doctor away, and a lot of us try to live by that. But in spite of our best efforts, sometimes we need prescription drugs. I am living proof of that. About a year ago, a year and a month ago, I was in a conference here in this Capitol with my friends in the other body, negotiating budget reconciliation instructions, and I had a heart attack. 
   Until that day, I had seldom had to take prescription drugs. Since that day, I take five or six. I take a drug to lower my blood pressure. I take a drug to thin my blood. I take all kinds of drugs so that I don't have a repeat of the heart attack that I had 13 months ago. 
   Now, I am not 65, so I am not covered by Medicare. I am in the standard Federal health benefit plan, Blue Cross/Blue Shield. And it does have a prescription drug benefit that partially pays for those drugs. But if I were to be over 65, which we have some Members of this body that are, I would have to be a part of Medicare and I would have an option under the current law to participate in Medicare part D, the prescription drug benefit program. 
   Now, when my friends on the other side were in the majority for 40 years, from 1954 to 1994, many of them sincerely, consciously wanted prescription drug benefits for Medicare. For whatever reason, it never quite happened. When the Republicans became the majority in 1994 and took over in 1995, it took us a while, we didn't get it done right away, but 3 years ago, we did pass a prescription drug benefit for part D, and it kicked in in the last Congress. 
   It is voluntary. Seniors that don't want to participate don't have to. Approximately 90 percent of the seniors that are eligible, we are led to believe, have chosen some plan for a prescription drug benefit. 
   Now, there are various plans. There are approximately 100 plans. These plans, some of them are very comprehensive. Some are very specific. Some are national, and some are regional. The long and the short of it is that every senior citizen in this country that wants a prescription drug benefit that is covered by Medicare can get one, and about 90 percent have chosen some plan; and of that, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent seem very, very satisfied. 
   The average cost in monthly premium is $22 a month. Twenty-two dollars a month. There are some plans, I am told, that have zero premiums; you don't have to pay to participate. Within those plans, over 4,400 drugs are covered. In some of these plans, generic drugs are free. In some of these plans, the donut hole does not exist. 
   So through diversity and market competition, we have created a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens in America that seems to be working very, very well. 
   Now, my friends on the Democrat side, the new majority, have come in, and they have got this bill up today. They want the government to negotiate prescription drug prices. On the surface, that may seem like a good idea. In reality, it would be a terrible idea. Who is going to do better than market forces with thousands and thousands of people and hundreds of plans and millions of people choosing whether to participate in this plan or that plan? What government bureaucrat, even somebody as smart and distinguished as the current Secretary of HHS, Secretary Levitt, who is going to do better than that? 
   Now, this concept that the government can negotiate a better price is simply not true. The CBO has come out and said it is not true, various think tanks have come out and said it is not true. But if you think it might be true, think of the products for which the government is the only purchaser and ask yourself, do we get the absolute best price? 
   There are not many products that the government is the only purchaser, but there are some. Aircraft carriers. There is not much demand for an aircraft carrier in the private market, so the U.S. Government is the only purchaser of aircraft carriers. An average cost of an aircraft carrier right now, I think, is about $5 billion. Now, we get a very quality product. The USS Reagan is the epitome of an aircraft carrier. But I don't believe we could say that we buy it at the absolute rock bottom price. 
   Now, we may not want to when it comes to some of our military equipment. We may not want to get the absolute best price. We may want to get the absolute best product, and so we are willing to pay a premium for that.     
   But there is really no way that a person in the Federal Government, or a group of people in the Federal Government, is going to replicate the thousands and thousands of market forces that are in play today. 
   So of all the ideas that my friends in the new majority have brought forward in their first 100 hours, I would respectfully say this has got to be the worst one. And I don't mean that in a mean way. 
   We have a program, Medicare part D prescription drug benefit, that is working. The people that can participate are choosing wisely. The premiums are coming down. The cost is coming down. It covers over 4,400 drugs. It is working. 
   As they say in many parts of our country, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. So I would respectfully urge the body later today to defeat this program.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007. This bill reduces access to drugs, creates a massive new pricing bureaucracy, slows access to drugs, and disrupts a  program that works. Let me restate--this program works. Beneficiary premiums are 42 percent lower than expected, overall costs are 30 percent lower than anticipated, and more importantly, seniors like what they are getting. Beneficiary satisfaction with their drug benefit is 80 percent or higher. So if it works, why break it? 
   Upon reading H.R. 4 there are some things that I know, some things that I don't know, and some things that I fear to be the case. Here's what I know. I know that there's a prescription drug benefit available in this country for 43 million Medicare beneficiaries. Of those folks, 90 percent now have some form of drug coverage. 
   I know that premiums are now down to around $22 per month for those that choose to enroll in this new benefit. And that's lower than last year because competition continues to drive the premiums down. 
   I know that beneficiaries like their new drug benefit. I know that beneficiaries are getting the drugs of their choice at the pharmacies of their choice, all at low costs. And I'm told, sometimes at zero cost for some drugs if they choose generics. Should I say that again? That's zero costs for some drugs. Here's a question--how does the government negotiate a lower price than zero? 
   H.R. 4 will not produce any savings. Why do I say that? The Congressional Budget Office has stated multiple times the federal government can not get lower prices than those currently achieved through competition. CBO must also know, what I know, and that is competition works. 
   Here's what else I know--H.R. 4 requires the government to negotiate prices that may be charged for drugs. But what else does H.R. 4 do? That's hard to tell because H.R. 4 doesn't say much more. Is the bill just poorly drafted or is it intentionally silent about the multitude of beneficiary and pharmacy protections in the current drug program that could be eliminated? 
   Upon reading H.R. 4, I do not know if plans will be able to offer the same wide array of drug choices as under the current 
   program. I do not know if our seniors are protected from being stripped down to just one or two drugs offered from the many they may now choose from to best suit their health needs. I do not know if there are protections in place to assure access to robust pharmacy networks, and I do not know if pharmacy reimbursement associated with dispensing drugs could be limited, eliminated, or otherwise restricted. 
   What I fear is that H.R. 4's silence on these very important questions means that such beneficiary and pharmacy protections have not been considered. What I fear is the effect H.R. 4 may have on beneficiary access to drugs and pharmacies. Unfortunately, there have been no hearings or mark-ups to discuss and debate these important issues. 
   And even with knowing that H.R. 4 produces no savings, that beneficiaries overwhelmingly like this benefit, that the benefit works, that pharmacies are participating, and that premiums and overall costs are down, Democrats--led by Speaker Pelosi--feel compelled to blindly undermine this program with no legislative record to back up their claims. I am saddened. I am sad today for America's seniors because H.R. 4 serves no purpose other than a political one. We should not be playing politics with our seniors' access to drugs and pharmacies. We should be encouraging more seniors to enroll in this benefit, not tear it apart. Sadly, that is not what the Democrats have chosen to do in their first 100 hours of power. 
   And for what? We know from the experiences in other countries that government mandated drug formularies and interference in drug pricing leads to substantially less drug innovation and rationing of access to the new medicines that do come to market. Under the current program, a senior can choose a plan that will provide access to new drugs that slow heart disease, ease pain, keep families together longer, cure disease, and provide a longer and higher quality of life. In other countries with government run prescription drug plans citizens must wait years for new therapies. That's if the government chooses to provide the drug at all, just ask the cancer patients in the United Kingdom who waited years for the new breakthrough drug Herceptin to be covered. 
   How big and slow will this Big Government Pricing bureaucracy be? It's hard to tell with no hearings. With over 4,000 drugs, different economic conditions every year, new drugs entering the market all the time, and incredibly complicated questions about how this would work, the Pelosi plan will create a bureaucratic nightmare, but more importantly will endanger access to life improving and lifesaving medications and therapies. If you are as frustrated as I am about the unfairness of how the government pays physicians under Medicare, be prepared for more frustration on getting this political pricing scheme to work. 
   What about the effect of H.R. 4 on taxpayers receiving health coverage through private insurance or other federal purchasers? The non-partisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) said in a 2000 report entitled Expanding Access to Federal Prices Could Cause Other Price Changes that this type of system could raise drug prices for non-governmental purchasers. So according to the GAO, government negotiation in Medicare could lead to higher insurance costs for people with an employer sponsored health plan, a labor union plan, or even an individual insurance policy. Yet the Democrats have not held one hearing on this bill. 
   I ask what we are doing here today. Research firm after research firm has shown that large majorities of beneficiaries have a positive view of the prescription drug benefit. That is probably what is galling the Democrat leadership. A Republican Congress and President has passed and worked hard to administer a very popular program. 
   Within 100 hours the Democrat leadership has reneged on its campaign statement of bipartisanship, reneged on their campaign statement of open and considered legislative process, flip-flopped from a position of non-interference that they held in numerous bills, made hollow their statement of supporting an innovation agenda, and again shown their penchant for favoring Big Government mediocrity over choice, competition and accountability. 
   I was here for Contract with America. Those bills we passed with the Contract had hearings with many witnesses, Committee mark-ups and amendments, and opportunities for amendments on the floor. Who is hurt by lack of process on H.R. 4? Beneficiaries. Taxpayers. Pharmacists. Everyone. Without hearings on H.R. 4, without opportunity to develop solutions to concerns and understand the consequences of our actions, everyone loses. Particularly seniors. 
   In Speaker PELOSI's district there are over 81,000 Medicare beneficiaries and 103 pharmacies. How many hearings have there been to consider whether there are any beneficiary and pharmacy protections under H.R. 4? Zero. 
   Let's build that out a little more. The total number of Medicare beneficiaries represented by Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee is 5.4 million and there are 6800 pharmacies. 
   The total number of Medicare beneficiaries represented by Congress is close to 43 million. There are over 53,000 pharmacies. The consequences of this legislation are potentially grave and yet there has been absolutely no process given to determine how it would affect these important constituencies. 
   I don't mind an open discussion on the new Medicare drug benefit. We have had hearings on the benefit when I was the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I like the fact that the Energy and Commerce Committee plans to hold more hearings this year. It gives me an opportunity to tout the program's successes. Seniors are seeing real savings and the cost of the program continues to decrease thanks to choice and competition. What I don't like is the purely political exercise we are being put through today that will jeopardize the access to needed drugs that the 63,000 beneficiaries in my district currently enjoy. I urge all members to oppose this process and oppose this ill conceived piece of legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes to put into the RECORD the Democrat vote on the motion to recommit to H.R. 4680, rollcall 356 back in 2000. This was a Democrat motion to recommit to the Republican drug benefit that later went to the Senate and was not acted upon. 205, and I assume that was the total number of Democrats in the House, all 205 Democrats voted for it, including Mr. Dingell, Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Rangel, and every member of the Energy and Commerce Committee who is currently serving who was in the body at that time. This was a recommit motion by Mr. Stark of California, and I am going to read what it says:  
   ``Noninterference by the Secretary. In administering the prescription medicine benefit program established under this part, the Secretary may not: 
   One, require a particular formulary, institute a price structure for benefits or in any way ration benefits; 
   Two, interfere in any way with negotiations between benefit administrators and medicine manufacturers or wholesalers; or 
   Three, otherwise interfere with the competitive nature of providing a prescription medicine benefit using private benefit administrators, except as is required to guarantee coverage of the defined benefit.'' 
   This is exactly the opposite to the bill that is currently before us, exactly the opposite. 
   Back in 2000, every Democrat currently in the House at that time, I think, or at least 205, voted for it, including all of our senior members who are leading the fight 180 degrees opposite this today.

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to yield myself 1 minute just to reply to Mr. Waxman. 
   The Congressional Budget Office, as far as I know, is not in the pocket of the drug companies. They say there are going to be no savings to this. The Heritage Foundation, which is admittedly conservative, but I don't think they are in the pocket of the drug companies, says there are going to be no savings. The Veterans Affairs Administration, which is the executive branch part of the Federal Government that is currently operated by President Bush, is opposed to this. They don't think there are going to be any savings. You can go to Wal-Mart right now, whether you are in Medicare or not, and get any number of generic drugs for, I think, a fee of $3 a month. Some of the plans that are out there in the marketplace give generic drugs away. Some of the plans that seniors can choose from have zero premiums. The average premium is $22. 
   I just think it is flat wrong to think that the Federal Government is going to negotiate a lower price than a competitive marketplace. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell).

   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close for the minority side. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am not sure where the Majority Leader's clock is, whether we are at the end of the 100-hour period or the beginning or the middle. I do know that I have been very confused by this process. 
   I understand the effort to bring the minimum wage bill back to the floor. Our new majority, for whatever purpose, didn't feel like they got a fair shake on that issue in the last several Congresses. So I can understand that. 
   The stem cell bill we voted on yesterday is the identical bill from the last Congress, with the exception of the change in the dates and the reversal of the names from Castle-DeGette to DeGette-Castle. I understand that. I even voted with the new majority on that one. 
   But on this one I am puzzled. We have a program that is working. We have a program that has 75 percent approval of the group we are trying to help, which is higher than most of our approvals in our congressional districts and certainly higher than most of our reelection rates. We have a program that the new majority even admits isn't going to really save any money. We certainly have an issue that there have been no hearings on and there have been no amendments made in order. 
   In fact, we don't even have a Rules Committee yet established. If my good friend Mr. Dingell said, Mr. Barton, I will support you on that amendment, there is no place to amend it. We are operating under martial law, and maybe they did it this way in the war between the States; I don't know. I can tell you that in the 12 years that I was in the majority, we always had a Rules Committee you could go to. Now, maybe you didn't get your amendment made in order, but at least you could go to it. So this one is a puzzlement to me. 
   Now, we know that the President has promised to veto this if it should somehow get through the Senate in its current form and come to his desk.     
   In all likelihood it will never come out of the Senate, so this as far as it is going to get. So maybe that is what this is all about is just a political exercise. And I know, and everybody in this Chamber knows, when it comes to the vote, the new majority is going to win. They should win. They won an election. They have a right to bring issues and they have a right to win some. But that doesn't mean it is right and that it is going to be a win for the American people. 
   I hope that once we get this foolishness out of the way, that Mr. Rangel and Mr. Dingell and myself and Mr. McCrery can work together as the leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee on a bipartisan basis, actually hold some hearings. If there is really something wrong with the current Medicare part D prescription drug benefit program, let's work together to fix it. But if there is really not anything wrong with it, and it ain't broke, there will be no need to fix it. 
   So I hope that we vote this down today. I am not myopic, though. I can count how many Democrat votes there are and how many Republican votes. So it will probably pass, and it will probably go to the Senate and it will probably die there, which will be a nice benign death. And then we can get back to being responsible. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I hope that the bill fails today and that the Democrat 100-hour political program fizzles, and then in the next 2 weeks we get down to the serious, bipartisan business of working together for the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to apologize to Mr. Ross if he thought I was being rude to him. I wasn't. 
   We only have 5 minutes on motions to recommit, and I wanted the Members to hear the motion and hopefully others that may be following the proceedings, because it is very short and it is also very simple. 
   We have already heard from the Congressional Budget Office, which is nonpartisan, that the bill before us is not going to save any money in its current form. Having said that, since it is not going to save money, it could still do irreparable harm, if in these negotiations, if they were ever to occur, the Secretary, in trying to save money, would have to look at the following areas: 
   First, he would have to look at some of the very expensive drugs that serve small segments of our population like the HIV drugs and some of those type of drugs. We don't want that to happen, so we explicitly preclude that. 
   He would also have to look at access. The VA program that has been touted as an alternative to Medicare part D, in spite of the fact that over a third of the veterans choose Medicare part D, it achieves many of its savings, number one, by restricting the formulary; and, number two, requiring that most of the drugs be delivered via mail order. In other words, you don't have that local pharmacy point of access. So this motion to recommit explicitly says you have to maintain that access. 
   It also says you can't impact groups like the veterans or any recognizable group that may have a group plan, because we don't want to squeeze, if you start trying to save money somewhere else, you may squeeze them and raise their prices. 
   So this is a very straightforward motion to recommit. We simply say if you are going to give the Secretary of HHS all this negotiating authority, let's be careful that, in doing that, we don't hurt all these other segments of our population.  
   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of political rhetoric today. That is not surprising because the Democrats have made this a political debate and not a debate on substance. That is unfortunate because this issue is too important to too many Americans. 
   There has been a lot of discussion about what this bill does and does not do; the truth of the matter is we don't really know. This bill has been the subject of no hearings; we have heard from no witnesses; we have had no subcommittee or full committee markups; we have had no opportunity to debate or even offer amendments. In fact, the Energy and Commerce Committee didn't even have its first meeting until 2 days ago. 
   Mr. Speaker we do know something about the successes of Medicare part D. We know that tens of millions of our seniors have access to prescription drug coverage for the first time; we know that tens of millions more are saving money when they buy prescription drugs. We also know that seniors can choose from competing plans, have access to the approximately 4300 prescription drugs available, filled at pharmacies of their choice. 
   Proponents of H.R. 4 claim that it will have no impact on beneficiaries' access to pharmacies or to the range of drugs they may take. If that is true then they should all vote in favor of the Motion to Recommit. 
   The motion is simple but critically necessary. The motion guarantees seniors access to all drugs that are available under the current program; the motion ensures that seniors suffering from cancer, ALS, Alzheimer's, and other debilitating diseases get the drugs they need. The motion guarantees that our seniors have access to new and innovative treatments as they become available. 
   The motion ensures that the government cannot limit or restrict beneficiary's access to their local pharmacies; seniors should be able to get their prescriptions filled at pharmacies of their choice. 
   Finally, the motion ensures that the legislation will not end up increasing the cost of drugs for veterans or any other group of Americans. 
   I urge all Members to vote in favor of preserving access to drugs and local pharmacies. Vote in favor of the Motion to Recommit.  
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield to the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee (Mr. McCrery) for 2 minutes.

<DOCNO>Mr. BARTON of Texas. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BARTON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I attended the Charlie Norwood funeral today in Augusta, Georgia. He was a veteran of Vietnam. I think it is ironic that because he was a veteran, we saw at the beginning of the funeral the honor guard walk in carrying the flag of the United States Army and the flag of the United States and all the battle ribbons on that flag, that as 70 to 80 of the Members of this body were showing respect to Charlie and his family, we were having this debate on another war. 
   The resolution before us is a sham resolution. It is nonbinding. I have voted on resolutions of war and peace in my time in this Congress. I voted on the first gulf war resolution back in the early nineties when we thought that there might be tens of thousands of body bags coming back with our troops in them. I voted on the first resolution supporting our President in this war after 9/11. Remember 9/11? We had more American citizens killed in one day in the Twin Towers and in the Pentagon than we have had in all the years that our troops have been in Iraq and Afghanistan. That doesn't demean their sacrifice. I have attended three funerals in my hometown of young men who have been killed in the line of duty in this current war. 
   This nonbinding resolution tries to have it both ways. It says at the first, in part A, we support the troops and in part B, we don't support our President's decision, the Commander in Chief, to send these reinforcements. Well, if it's nonbinding, why have the debate? I think it's commendable that we are having this debate. I wish it would have had some meat on it. Let's put a real resolution on the floor. But the Republicans weren't offered an alternative, so we have to vote for or against a nonbinding resolution that has it both ways in the resolution. I don't think that is very becoming to this Congress. 
   But when the time comes, I am going to vote ``no'' because I believe as Thomas Jefferson believed, and if you go to his monument not too far from here and look up around the ceiling, Thomas Jefferson says, ``I have sworn upon the eternal altar of God unending opposition to all forms of tyranny over the mind of man.'' This Islamic terrorist campaign is a direct attack on our democracy. It is a direct attack on our tolerance. We need to support our President. We need to vote against this nonbinding resolution. And then if we want to have a real resolution, let's bring it to the floor and have that debate.  
   I rise today in opposition to H. Con. Res. 63. This nonbinding resolution serves only to degrade and demoralize the troops currently engaged in forward operations and those additional troops President Bush has called upon. This is not a call for a new direction in Iraq nor is this a call for a new course of action. This is a political distraction and a call to our enemies around the world by showing a lack of resolve and fostering the idea of uncertainty towards support and funding for the men and women of our Armed Forces. 
   Speaker PELOSI and her fellow Democrats have charged that the previous policy did not work, the new policy will not work, and yet amongst all this rhetoric my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not have a constructive alternative to put forth. Instead they offer legislation that if enacted would fuel the call for setting timelines and the withdrawal of our troops. To leave before the job is finished would leave our country in a weaker position globally and leave the Middle East without any hope for democracy to ever take hold. The extremists that oppose us are against freedom and we are right to be engaged in the fight for democracy and tolerance. The stakes are high and our enemies know this. They are not going to quit, but if we pass this resolution it will be the first step in signaling that we will. It is right to support the President as he lays out his plan for securing Iraq and is in our national interest. 
   The necessary framework for democracy has been established and the labor of our brave troops has produced many measurable results. A constitution was written by the Iraqis resulting in democratic elections where nearly 12.5 million people braved the threat of violence to cast their votes. A fair criminal trial was held for Saddam Hussein, the country's former dictator, who denied that right to his own people. I urge my colleagues to let the Iraqis lead and give democracy a chance. Establishing a secure Iraq, a thriving democracy and a noticeable reduction in crime will pave the way for numerous infrastructure improvements. 
   Sustainable achievements in the reconstruction effort include the building of more than 5,000 schools, the training of more then 60,000 teachers, the training and equipping of 323,000 police and military forces, the vaccination of 98 percent of Iraqi children, the ability of more than 7 million people to access phone service, the repair of nearly all of Iraq's railway stations, the restoration of electricity output and oil production to near prewar levels and the increased availability of clean water and sanitation. The milestones that have been reached are a testament to why we should not abandon our presence in Iraq. Progress is being made and we must continue to support our troops and Iraq's democratic government. 
   The President's call for more troops is a decision not made in haste. It is made with careful consideration and thoughtful advice from his commanders both at home and in the field. The additional troops will work with Iraqis to solve serious challenges and to find ways to curb future outbreaks of violence. To achieve success in combating those serious challenges it is important that America stands with Iraq so they can defend their own soil, create a sound economy and govern themselves effectively. The President understands the consequences of failure in Iraq, something this resolution proves the Democrats do not comprehend. 
   I have been to the funerals of men and women from my district that lost their lives in this war. I have pinned medals on the chests of the brave men and women from my district who returned home safely. Visiting with families at home and troops in Iraq I have seen first hand the effects this war has on Americans. This resolution serves to discredit the memories of fallen soldiers, the efforts of those still fighting, and to embolden our enemies. If we remember, our enemies attacked us on September 11th and instead of living in fear and leaving ourselves open to more attacks we chose to take the fight to them. In the time since, there has not been another major terrorist attack on U.S. soil. That is a testament to the fight our men and women are waging to protect the freedoms we so richly enjoy. I remain committed to supporting our forces serving abroad and ensuring they have the funding they need to complete their mission. 
   Some of my colleagues misguidedly stand to dismiss our efforts in Iraq. I stand with the resolve of former President Thomas Jefferson who said, ``I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.'' We must not stand divided and turn our backs on those fighting for democracy where tyranny threatens to reign. We must be steadfast and support them in every way we can. We can not let the difficulty of the task diminish our support for the troops and the cause for which they are so diligently fighting. We must not let this frivolous resolution pass.
