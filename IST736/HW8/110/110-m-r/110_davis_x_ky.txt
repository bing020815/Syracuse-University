<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 will expand transportation options for some commuters. It doesn't address the underlying problem affecting all Americans. 
   The current energy climate has highlighted the critical need for America to develop a national energy strategy that will promote energy independence. We can no longer rely on unstable foreign entities to supply us with the resources we need to keep our country running. We need to use American resources to meet American energy needs. 
   Although section 219 of H.R. 6003 authorizes $1 million to the Department of Transportation to study the potential for renewable biofuels, the bill makes no mention of utilizing the huge proven resources that we have in this country at our fingertips. We need to address the underlying and immediate issues of increasing our domestic supply of energy to reduce prices. This MTR would expand the scope of the study to include those American resources that are now available, like coal, natural gas and oil shale. 
   One year ago, Amtrak was buying fuel for $2.19 a gallon. As of May 22, 2008, Amtrak was forced to pay $4.26 a gallon. This dubious milestone was achieved 776 days after the current Speaker of the House stated that Democrats had a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing fuel prices. That plan has yet to materialize, and a new CNN poll shows that 86 percent of our citizens believe that gas prices will hit $5 a gallon this summer. 
   Indeed, the majority has pursued a misguided energy strategy that tightens the vice on American consumers in the form of higher taxes and higher energy prices. Frankly, we need to use American resources for Americans now. While I don't object to public transportation as a sound alternative to commuting by car, expanding Amtrak service still doesn't lessen our dependency on foreign oil. 
   Skyrocketing fuel prices are affecting every aspect of our daily lives. We all know the impact it is having on our family budgets. But it is also having a dramatic impact on many other budgets, ranging from school districts to local governments to the Armed Forces. Even Amtrak's budget is ballooning with these increasing prices. Their fuel budget for 2008 has increased from $125 million to $215 million. 
   In the areas where American budgets are being hardest hit by gas prices, consuming 16 percent of gross income, they have very little access to Amtrak. How does this bill help those Americans deal with our energy prices? 
   My constituents can literally no longer afford the empty promises and failed policies of this Congress. What we need now is an action plan that focuses on real solutions that use real resources to address our short and long-term needs, putting all the options on the table to be considered. It will unleash American innovation, create American jobs and lower prices for American consumers. 
   We need to focus on increasing our domestic energy supply by exploring the resources that rest at our fingertips on the Outer Continental Shelf and in the Alaskan National Wildlife Reserve. These resources could significantly increase our domestic oil production and supply a considerable amount of our energy needs. Yet the Democratic majority refuses to allow the American people to access resources that are on their own soil. I echo the recent declaration that we need to drill here, we need to drill now, and then we will pay less. 
   We need to promote the research and development of renewable resources while investigating the potential for alternative fuels developed from coal-to-liquids, hydrogen, and other new technologies to lessen our dependency on foreign oil supply shocks. 
   Congress has been historically shortsighted about the use of our most abundant fuel, coal, to boost our energy supply. The United States is estimated to have 40 times the amount of energy stored in coal reserves than we have in our domestic oil reserves. American coal resources in Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois exceed the oil resources of Saudi Arabia and is an excellent source for American energy. With oil prices heading towards $150 a barrel, how can we not afford to explore our own domestic resources?  
   The leaders of this Congress have proven themselves to be out of touch, turning blindly away from any attempt to relieve the American people of their burden with practical solutions. We need to lower prices for the American people. By continually refusing to recognize the problem at hand, the Democratic majority is causing irrevocable harm to our Nation. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support the motion to recommit the bill to broaden the Locomotive Alternative Fuel Study to include American reserves that will increase domestic oil supply, reduce costs and make us more independent from foreign oil. The best thing that we can do for Amtrak is to lower fuel prices. If we use our resources for Americans, we can ignite a third industrial revolution that will create millions of jobs and provide a future for our children. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to honor John Bach, a pillar of our law enforcement community, and a recent retiree from the Kenton County Sheriff's Department. 
   Mr. Bach's career is one that embodies dedication and service to this country. From 1966 to 1970, he served with the 777th Tactical Air Squadron based out of Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina, and was also part of the 556th Reconnaissance Squadron in southeast Asia. 
   After completing his military service, John pursued a degree in business that he completed at Northern Kentucky University. John was quick to answer the call to service in our community. Throughout his career in law enforcement, he protected our communities in the line of duty at the Elsmere Police Department, the Boone County Police Department, the Independence Police Department and the Kenton County Sheriff's Department. 
   I would like to thank John for his brave service to our Nation and for helping to make the communities of northern Kentucky safer for all of our residents as part of local law enforcement. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to wish John and his wife, Linda, all the best as they enter this new chapter of their lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (NATIONAL SECURITY INTERAGENCY REFORM -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my perspective  on an essential reform to ensure the security of our Nation. We must reform our national security system to ensure effective interagency operations. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee and co-chair of the House National Security Interagency Reform Working Group, implementing reform of the national security system is one of my highest priorities. Our current interagency process is broken. There are regulatory, legislative, budgetary, resource and culture impediments to effective interagency operations. These problems are independent of personalities, policies and particular presidential administrations. In order to protect the United States interests and its citizens, it is critical that reform to executive and legislative processes be allowed to better the integration among currently stove-piped departments. 
   A successfully integrated interagency process will empower the United States to more effectively employ our nonmilitary instruments of power abroad. This ability will allow us to more effectively fulfill our interest while reserving the use of lethal force as a last resort. In fact leaders and policy makers need two things; first, an overarching national strategy that frames the intent of all policy on national security; second, a toolbox of resources that can be configured, hopefully in a preventive way, to fulfill our strategic objectives. 
   The current interagency system was devised over 60 years ago for a different era and is based on a very specific national security strategy when security was primarily a function of military capabilities wielded by one department in overseas missions. At the time, major combat operations and nuclear deterrence were the principal focus of U.S. national security strategy. This strategy required limited coordination of activities between vertically structured military and civilian departments and agencies. 
   Today, national security involves a much wider array of issues that can be addressed only with a broader set of capabilities that are highly synchronized and carefully calibrated. 
   Many agencies are not conscious of or prepared to act in their national security roles. Many civilian departments and agencies do not believe they have a role in the national security system, and the cultures of these organizations produce few, if any, incentives for staff to participate in national security missions. These agencies often lack ``expeditionary'' capabilities. Even if they have the desire to help, they may be prevented from doing so by a combination of factors including personnel shortages, lack of resources, lack of statutory authorizations and regulatory constraints. 
   Additionally, interagency operations are not governed by standard concepts and procedures. Without common processes, interagency operations tend to be very ad hoc. For example, Paul Bremer, head of the Coalition For Provisional Authority in postwar Iraq believed that he reported to the President through the Secretary of Defense and did not want to be bogged down by ``the interagency process.'' National Security Adviser Rice's senior deputies, simply to get information, were relegated to checking the CPA website every day to see what new orders Bremer had issued. Such arrangements are enormously inefficient and liable to produce erratic outcomes. 
   We must ensure that civilian agencies have the resources required for effective integration with the Department of Defense. Think what could have been done to deter the growth of criminal militias in Iraq if the Department of Treasury had been able to assist in the rapid implementation of simple electronic banking systems to get money and payroll to the people of Iraq during the post conflict stabilization period. 
   A new National Security Act is needed to update the organization and procedures created by the National Security Act of 1947. We need to codify an adaptive approach that flattens, simplifies and integrates the agencies of the executive branch and the committees of Congress. We must ensure all departments and agencies that have national security roles have specific objectives, responsibilities and operational planning capabilities so they can protect America's interests. 
   Second, we should require that personnel who are selected for the Senior Executive Service in departments and agencies with national security roles have professional development via institutional training and operational assignments in agencies other than their own to better understand the national security interagency system. Third, we should strive to build regional expertise across the departments and agencies to ensure a bench of personnel with the knowledge and skills required to accomplish departmental and agency missions in all regions of the world. For example, we should consider better regional alignment between DOD and the State Department. 
   As my colleagues and I undertake the challenge of crafting reform legislation, I welcome the opportunity to work with all agencies to gain their insights on the way ahead for reform.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (HONORING THE LIFE OF CHIEF PETTY OFFICER GREG BILLITER -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, it's the most solemn duty that I have to honor those who have served our Nation, those who have answered the call of this generation, as us in prior generations have, to answer to that call to be ready to serve and to deploy. 
   I rise today to honor a great American, Navy Chief Petty Officer Greg Billiter. Greg was a native of Villa Hills, Kentucky, a graduate of Covington Latin, and a true fan of his hometown teams, the Cincinnati Bengals and the Cincinnati Reds. 
   Greg was tragically killed in action in Northern Iraq during combat operations. He leaves behind his young son, Cooper, a caring wife, loving family and a legacy that will be honored for generations to come. 
   For Cooper, as you grow into a man, know that your dad loved you. He was a great American. He cared about you and he answered the call of this Nation. 
   I had the opportunity to visit with his family, and they all conveyed similar sentiments of a brave, dedicated and heroic sailor. 
   When I asked his wife, April, about Greg she told me that he truly loved what he was doing. April said, ``He was extremely patriotic, and felt that it was important for him to be part of the war and to help the other soldiers who were serving there.'' His bravery and ultimate sacrifice remind us that they were all part of a larger mission. 
   His parents told a local newspaper that he really felt he was helping to make Iraq a safer place, especially for the children. As an explosive ordnance demolition specialist, he made a tremendous difference in the lives of many, many civilians, military personnel, and especially those children. We wonder today how many will grow up in the future and have a future because of Greg's call and his willingness to answer that call and to go and serve. Indeed, his mother said that he loved what he was doing. He felt what he was doing was right, and he knew that he made a difference. 
   I stand here today to honor his heroic work in Iraq and in the United States Navy, and to thank him and his family for making that ultimate sacrifice. We've lost a great American in Greg, but his work will live on. Thank you, Greg. Thank you April, Cooper, Pat, and Barry, for sharing your husband, father, and son with our Nation. We are forever indebted to him. 
   As Jesus spoke in John 15:13, no greater love has a man than this, that he lay down his lives for his friends. Indeed, Greg literally did that every day in his work to protect other service members, to protect civilians, to make a difference. 
   Greg's reputation as a chief was quite clear. Many of his fellow shipmates came into the funeral and showed a strength of solidarity that was impressive and moving to this old soldier. 
   I have spent many years in uniform and been with thousands and thousands  of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, and one thing spoke out clearly to me was that Greg epitomized the warrior ethos of the civilian who went into the military, who answered the call of the Nation, who grew in character, and was an exemplar in all that he did, representing the will of the founders of this Nation. 
   Indeed, it was clear to me, from his sailors, from his family, that he was a leader, that he was a mentor, that he was a friend, that he was a proud son, that he was a loving husband and father. He was the epitome of all that we call dear and great and honorable in this land.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a distinguished businessman, philanthropist, decorated military officer, fellow West Point graduate and a pillar of our community in northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. 
   Next month Mr. George Schaefer will retire from his position at Fifth Third Bank. Beginning as a management trainee in 1971 after completing his service in the Army, George rose through the ranks at Fifth Third and helped the company to grow into one of the largest financial institutions and bank holding companies in the United States. 
   As George's career grew, so too did his commitment to making the entire Cincinnati metropolitan region a better place to live, work and go to school. He has raised millions of dollars for the United Way and the Cincinnati Fine Arts Fund. For 12 years, he sat on the board of trustees of the University of Cincinnati where he helped the University grow into one of the Nation's premier educational institutions. 
   George, while your talents and leadership will surely be missed at Fifth Third, I know that your inspired work in the community will continue. I wish to thank you and your wife Betty Ann for all of your service and wish you the best as you embark on this new chapter in your life. 
   Thank you for your service to our Nation in uniform, for answering the Nation's call. Thank you for your contributions to our community. Thank you for pouring yourself into so many aspects to improve the quality of lives for our communities in northern Kentucky and the greater Cincinnati area and every city where Fifth Third is involved. 
   We are grateful for that commitment, for the example of service and your upholding the values that we both share of duty, honor and country.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (THE COUNTDOWN CREW -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I just want to share, those who are joining us tonight have joined the Countdown Crew. We meet the first night of votes each legislative week. We can be reached by e-mail at CountdownCrew@mail.Ðhouse.gov. 
   And the one thing that I would like to share from my perspective, we hear a lot of statements about a desire to support the troops. And I have said for the last 2 1/2 years that, if we say we support the troops, it is important that we listen to what they have to say. As a former member of the 82nd Airborne Division and other military units with comrades serving in all the major line Army units, commanding brigades, serving on the senior staffs, receiving e-mail reports on a weekly basis, even from a platoon leader who is in Sadr City right now, we get a somewhat different perspective on the politics and debates that are going on back here in the House Chamber. And I would say this from a perspective of looking at the fiscal implications of decisions. 
   When we talk about the supplemental spending, the vast majority of money, and the original clean bill before politics got involved was designed for one thing, it was designed for troop support, it was designed for equipment reset, it was designed to provide support for provincial reconstruction teams for the transition of Iraqi security forces to be effective in their mission on the ground. 
   Unfortunately, due to the Hatch Act, the troops themselves don't have a voice where they can come into this Chamber and debate, and so as we have seen on numerous occasions, opinion is often substituted for fact. And it is an honest opinion; it is an honest viewpoint. I think we have honest disagreements. I think one thing that both sides can agree on is that there were strategic mistakes that were made early in the campaign due to institutional infrastructure and process issues that are endemic in the United States Government and need to be reformed. 
   But the truth of the matter, at the moment, is we have people in harm's way that are deployed forward who actually watch C-SPAN, who watch these debates. Many of them are friends of mine that I have known for well over 30 years and we have served together, a number of us served together in the Middle East. And the perspective that I would bring is this when we talk about emergency supplemental spending, and it comes back to an aspect of fiscal responsibility, to the gentleman from Pennsylvania's point earlier: a supplemental spending bill is designed specifically to augment needs that were not covered in regularly budgeted, authorized, or appropriated lines.     
   And to put this into context, there are many divisions in the Congress, particularly in the Democratic Caucus, regarding the war. We are all well aware of them. I have many friends on both sides of the aisle. There are honest disagreements and disputes. But the one thing, to quote my friend, Hal Rogers from Kentucky, where he said, ``Attention K-Mart shoppers,'' at the end of the appropriations hearing last week. ``A variety of spending provisions have been placed in a military supplemental bill that have nothing to do with national security in order to encourage those to vote for it.'' 
   And I want to put this into context, that over $20 billion in nonmilitary, nonnational security spending has been included. They include $283 million in milk subsidies that are already funded in other programs. It includes $74 million for peanut storage. 
   Now, when I went to flight school at Fort Rucker, Alabama, at the U.S. Army Aviation Center, there were two great economic engines in the area. One was the United States Army Aviation Center that trained the pilots for the U.S. Army, the rotary wing force that provides our air assault and attack helicopter capability worldwide today, and also the peanut industry. The last time I checked, the peanut industry was not directly related to American national security. 
   Twenty-five million dollars are in payments to spinach producers on a national security supplemental bill. And this also rescinds $89 million in homeland security funding that allegedly would have lapsed in fiscal year 2006. 
   The reason that I bring these up, and the billions of dollars in spending, is  not to highlight honest disagreements about policy issues which have a rightful place in this Chamber. 
   And my friends on the other side are certainly entitled to their views, the basis of their perception. I certainly have my views on the subject which are different from many in the administration and on my side of the aisle as well. But the one thing that I will share is let's translate these dollars into reality from a fiscal perspective. 
   When Secretary Gates came over to testify before the Armed Services Committee in his first hearing in January of 2007, the first major request, and I was very heartened by this, was a request to increase the end strength of the United States Army by 96,000 soldiers. Now, why that number is important, I have advocated for nearly 5 years for a 100,000 soldier increase to the end strength to deal with and augment the operations tempo that our troops have experienced since the draw-downs in the mid-1990s. The rate and the pace of that transition is very significant upon our soldiers. And as a matter of fiscal responsibility for the investment that we have made in them and the commitment that we have made to them, I think it is important that we see that increase. And I was very heartened to see an acceptance of that need in the civilian appointed leadership of the Defense Department. 
   But here is the fiscal issue. When we talk about $20 billion in nonmilitary spending that were put on that supplemental bill, here is what $1 billion means. Regardless of your views on national security, $1 billion roughly translates into 10,000 fully equipped light infantry soldiers and fully trained and accessed into the military. 
   The reason that that number is important to keep in mind, at the end of the day, as we talk about force structure and staffing, I would ask my friends, would it have not been a more prudent use of our national security dollars and emergency supplemental, rather than going for programs or peanuts and spinach and the milk program, which I think would be more appropriately addressed jurisdictionally in the farm bill, to use that money, if there was a need, to assess it for troop training, to augment the needs for the conflicts that we are going to be facing in the 21st century, which are going to be significant. And I think that those conflicts would have come regardless of our policies there. 
   But nonetheless, this approach, I believe, is a poor use of fiscal stewardship and begs the real question at the end of the day of what we actually have voted for from a policy change, a world view change when we changed Speakers in January. As I have shared with many when we get asked about how is this going to be paid for, every working family in America making between $30- and $50,000 will have a $2,098 tax increase if those tax cuts are not extended and made permanent by 2010. 
   And with that I will yield back to the gentleman, but I just wanted to clarify that point from a national security perspective. Understand that it would be helpful for, I think, the American people to understand there are many nongermane issues and spending lines that have been added on this bill that have nothing to do with our current national security situation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I think, to the gentleman's point, I received some correspondence from a colonel who came back from Iraq recently, and he shared this perspective. He shared that he had worked for General Abizaid, and he just made the comment, General Abizaid, the Central Command Commander, made the comment that dealing with Islamic radicalism is something that you want to do as an away game. And unlike different times in our history that, again, regardless of perceptions of the decisions that were made before you and I came here to be engaged in this conflict, there are second- and third-order effects that will be inherited by a precipitous withdrawal. 
   And when I go back, I listen to so many different voices with so many different perspectives, but the one unity of purpose that they say is that there would be profound consequences. In fact, one of the ones most recently was a friend who was in Task Force Ranger in Mogadishu, which I believe President Clinton reinforced an operation in 1993 to capture a tribal leader, a warlord, Mohammed Farah Aideed. This friend and Task Force Ranger shared that at the end of the Blackhawk Down incident, where America, frankly, lost the information war despite completely removing this militia, he shared with me over coffee recently and said, you know, little did we know that there were al Qaeda technical advisers who had served in Afghanistan fighting the mujahedin and were sent by Osama bin Laden to assist these groups because they were dealing with Americans and the consequences of leaving, when, in fact, he said if we had simply been able to stay, it would have sent a very different message. We could have accomplished the mission of apprehending the foe. 
   And to your point, again, the troops, I think, oftentimes inadvertently are used as human shields in debate, but we don't get down to the issues of what they really see on the ground and the perspective that they bring to this discussion.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I think your point on that too, if I might interject, the Members of the other party, for whom I have great personal respect though I disagree in execution of the policy, are those that have been very staunch and very consistent in their opposition to the use of our troops in offensive operations overseas. 
   And the reason that I bring that up is that some of the statements that have been made, and I am not referring to provocative statements, simply positions that were taken, had been controversial in their own caucus as well as in the Congress in general. But the reason that I bring it up is that those convictions, I think, echo at one point where we have mutual agreement, and on a variety of issues. And the point I called for during the debate a few weeks ago on the resolution regarding whether one accepted the ability of the Commander in Chief to authorize the combatant commander to reinforce troops on the ground was this: that if we are going to have a real vote that affects real people in the field, then we need to use the power of the purse of the United States Congress to vote to cut or sequester funding related to that. 
   And I think that is a noble cause regardless of which side one is on in that from the standpoint of the Republic. I know where I am. I am with my former  comrades who are in a country right now to make sure they have the resources they need. But one of my friends, one of our colleagues, made a comment last Thursday night that there was a bit of a fishing expedition going on for votes, and the irony wasn't lost on me when I actually saw the list of appropriations he was talking about: $120 million for the shrimp and Manhattan fishing industries, that would equip over 1,000 of our light infantry soldiers with what they need to do their job; $5 million for those engaged in the breeding, rearing, or transporting of live fish, think what $5 million can do from an operational standpoint. 
   We start going through this in detail, and we see $16 million for additional office space for the House of Representatives.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, last month more than 1,200 students from across the country visited Washington to participate in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution. 
   This program is the most extensive educational program in the country, developed to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
   It is with great pride that I recognize a class from my own Highlands High School of Fort Thomas, Kentucky, in the Fourth District for their accomplishment in this competition. 
   These outstanding students, using knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the chance to come to our Nation's capital and compete at the national level. At the national level, these dedicated students won the Unit One: Foundations of Democracy Award. 
   I would like to take a moment to recognize the names of these outstanding young people from Highlands High School: Alex Adams, Evan Bush, Kara Dyer, Jessica Earlywine, Jessica Federle, Maria Gurren, John Holloway, Alan Hutchinson, Marjorie Kimball, Connie Kremer, Sam Laskey, Heather Moyer, Emily Nordling, Anna Remley, Lauren Runk, Andrea Spencer, and Corwyn Wyatt. 
   I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, Julie Kuhnhein, who is responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the national finals. Also worthy of special recognition are Rachel Bingham and Robin Winkfield, the State coordinators, and Glenn Manns, the district coordinator, who are among those responsible for implementing the We the People program in my State. 
   I congratulate these students on their exceptional achievement at the We the People national finals. One thing we can all remember is that  there is no substitute for participating in the governmental process, no substitute for the investment of our lives and our time. I commend all of you for your hard work and for the long hours of preparation, and commend you for a victory well earned, well deserved and bringing honor and credit to the Fourth District of Kentucky.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (NATIONAL SECURITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT REFORM AND STRENGTHENED TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, first I would like to commend Chairman FRANK, Ranking Member BACHUS and Congresswoman MALONEY for putting together this important bill that exemplifies the bipartisan work of the Financial Services Committee. H.R. 556 succeeds in striking a balance that ensures neither the national security of the United States nor the investment climate will be compromised. 
   This bill was originally introduced in the 109th Congress in response to the public outcry after the Dubai Ports World case. H.R. 556 formalizes the role of the Director of National Intelligence in the CFIUS process, establishes accountability in CFIUS by ensuring senior officials are involved in clearing transactions and establishes better communication with Congress so that we can perform our oversight function. 
   However, I am a strong believer in simplifying processes to achieve the best possible outcome. I do not think we should make CFIUS an overly complicated and burdensome process for foreign investment. The goal is to maintain the attractiveness of the U.S. markets as a destination for foreign investment, while protecting our national security. 
   While I submitted three amendments to H.R. 556 that I was unable to offer today, they address important issues that deserve consideration as the bill moves through the Senate and into a conference committee. 
   Two of my amendments would eliminate the roll call requirement for both the approval of a deal and as recorded in the annual report. As we have gone through the Committee process in the 109th Congress and in the 110th, I have learned a great deal about how the CFIUS process works. I think it is important that we incorporate this suggestion from the Administration on CFIUS. Currently, the different agencies that make up the CFIUS committee work as a team until they arrive at a consensus view. It is my understanding that the committee does not take roll call votes agency-by-agency on each transaction deal that is examined. The current CFIUS approach is much more holistic and fosters a team effort. 
   I have concerns that requiring a roll call vote on each deal could discourage one agency from raising an issue if all the others are prepared to sign off. I would not want a roll call vote to have any unintended consequences. 
   I do not believe we should override the way CFIUS currently works as a team. It is effective and encourages the agencies to interact and communicate throughout the examination of the deal. 
   The third amendment I submitted would eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy for the transaction deals that are relatively easy to approve by allowing the actual signing off process to be accomplished by a Senate confirmed official. This of course does not mean the Secretary and Deputy Secretary are unaware of the deal or left out of the loop on CFIUS matters. They are briefed on every deal on a regular basis. And they will still be required to sign off on certain cases that are of concern to Congress. However, this amendment would provide for a more expedient CFIUS process for the majority of transactions that pose no threat to national security.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in the House in congratulating the Northern Kentucky University women's basketball team for winning the NCAA Division II National Championship on March 29, 2008. Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed H. Res. 1147, which congratulates the team and the coaches on their impressive victory. 
   During the championship game, the Norse overcame a nine-point deficit with less than 6 minutes left in the game to beat the University of South Dakota, 63-58. Senior Angela Healy had 14 points and 13 rebounds in the game. In recognition of her performance, Ms. Healy was voted the Elite Eight's Most Outstanding Player. 
   This win marked the second time in the last decade that the Norse women have won an NCAA national championship in women's basketball. NKU is now the only collegiate women's program in the Commonwealth of Kentucky to win two national titles in any sport. 
   The Norse team consisted of 11 outstanding women who are not only championship-caliber players, but by all accounts students and leaders who are a credit to their community as well. 
   Coach Nancy Winstel should be applauded for her excellent leadership and dedication to Northern Kentucky University. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the team, the coaching staff, and the entire Northern Kentucky University community for a great season, and to thank my colleagues for their support of this resolution.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievements of Jack Borman. In a few days, Jack will be retiring from the Kenton County Sheriff's Department, and I  think this is the ideal time to honor his dedication and lifetime of service to our Nation. 
   As a young man from Silver Grove, Kentucky, Jack joined the military and was deployed to fight in the Korean War. He bravely fought in missions at Triangle Hill, in Operation Smack and in the now infamous battle at Pork Chop Hill. For his bravery and valor at the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, one of the most deadly battles of the Korean War, he was awarded the Silver Star and a Purple Heart. 
   Several years ago, MGM Studios released a film about this battle, and Jack added movie star to his long list of lifetime accomplishments. From fighting in Korea to serving Kenton County, he has selflessly served and protected us. Jack, we thank you for your service and wish you much success in your retirement. 
   Jack is a busy grandfather to 19 grandchildren. I'm sure his life will continue to be a great adventure. For all that, thank you for your service.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think it's somewhat ironic. Listening to the words of the gentlewoman from Florida reminds me of a comment that Machiavelli made centuries ago. He said: ``For this is the tragedy of man--circumstances change, but he does not.'' 
   It's fascinating that the Democrats ran on a platform of wanting to bring about the most ethical Congress ever, but, frankly, I have to say it's a sham based upon this approach to earmark reform. This is not earmark reform. 
   In fact, the reason we were here last night, contrary to the comments from the other speakers, was to protect the American people and to protect their right to accountability for every dollar that is spent in this Chamber. Let's look for a moment on the structure of accountability before talking about the validity of earmarks. 
   Last night, when we asked about the ability to debate specific spending bills, we were told, oh, this is in the guise of transparency, but, of course, you won't be able to vote on the individual earmarks. You can only vote after those have been dropped in after the conference report. 
   I would have to say this is a most surprising thing. In fact, we were told, with tremendous sincerity on the part of the gentleman from Wisconsin, that, in fact, this would be a wonderful way to protect the people's rights to transparency, and, frankly, wall us completely out of the process. 
   How is that? Well, I would be able to object to egregious spending. We have seen that in a number of areas through the years on both sides of the aisle. But how would we object to that from my office in Kentucky? I would be able to write a letter to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In fact, the staff members would make the decision on whether that was a legitimate earmark or not. 
   I have great respect for the staffs that work at all the committees in our offices and the House. But I would like to remind the gentleman from Wisconsin, the Members from the other side of the aisle, that last November, in  the election that they claim the American people chose to have a new direction, I didn't see the name of any staff member from Capitol Hill on a Federal ballot anywhere in the United States. 
   The people who were elected to uphold and defend the Constitution, who were to make sure that the people's money was spent wisely, were not staff members. The staff members were accountable to elected officials. Ultimately, the elected officials have to make those decisions because we are the ones that were accountable to the people. 
   What will the public know about these earmarks? All they see of them is at the last minute when we get into a position of simply voting up or down on a conference report where we will not have that ability to debate or to discuss those bills. 
   In fact, let me be clear about this. I don't think earmarks in and of themselves can be bad. They can be very good, but they should all be subject to public debate here in this Chamber on this floor or in this committee where they can be voted on up or down by a majority of Members clearly making a decision and being accountable for those decisions. 
   There are many good earmarks: investing in public works, creating jobs that can lay a foundation for future growth. The root of this practice is based on the idea there are many funding priorities very specific and unique to districts or regions of the country that should be decided by our elected officials, not some faceless bureaucrat in Washington, not some person hidden in a cubicle or an office away from the light of scrutiny and accountability. 
   To say this is bringing an ethical posture to Congress, I beg to differ with that. In fact, I believe what it would do is increase the likelihood of malfeasance on the part of taxpayers' dollars by taking away the direct accountability with Members of Congress. 
   In the Fourth District, I don't want a faceless bureaucrat to make those decisions. In fact, I am proud of every earmark that I have secured for the Fourth District of Kentucky. I want the people to know that this is how we believe, working with our local leaders, that taxpayer dollars should be reinvested in our communities, how their dollars should be spent that they can see that firsthand and see that return. 
   However, the process would be significantly improved if every earmark were defined in the bill, their sponsors named and that we have the ability to challenge those and let each Member defend the merits on return and investment to the American taxpayer on each one of them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Before I speak, I would like to just share one thing. The gentleman who was just speaking reminds me again of the comment that Machiavelli made that the tragedy of man is that circumstances change, but he does not. 
   And in all of this rhetoric, I would remind the gentleman we were actually debating a Homeland Security bill, I haven't heard one person answer our reasoned arguments to ask them to defend the appropriations chairmen or the Speaker's approach to earmarks by taking them off the floor and out of committee and removing them from debate and accountability. 
   I happened to be in the meetings last year where the Republican conference was at work to move to improve the accountability. Certainly, I believe in complete transparency of records, and we have heard nobody defend the chairman's position on this. 
   I have heard no Democrat get up and defend the chairman's position on earmarks at all. They want to use ad hominem arguments, talk about yesterday. I think the gentleman is right: what happened yesterday, in fact, is history. 
   So far, to make this the most ethical House in history, I would think that openness and transparency would improve accountability, and not simply contribute to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.     
   We talk a lot about that, but I think that a lot has been created inadvertently from the other side. 
   The issue is not whether earmarks themselves, it's not whether earmarks themselves are good or bad. It's simply having a mechanism for accountability for the American people so that they can see that. 
   One perfect example is a large project of national and regional significance that's in my district that affects 71 congressional districts. We worked together in a bipartisan manner through the 109th Congress to secure all of the funding necessary to the lead-up to the construction of the Brent Spence bridge on I-75 that connects Northern Kentucky and Cincinnati. This was not a Republican or Democrat project, it was an American project where many, many Members, ranging from south Florida, all the way to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, up into the Northeast saw their districts, their industries, their jobs affected by that meaningful investment in infrastructure that would benefit the Nation as a whole. 
   We wanted that accountability. We debated it in public. We talked about it repeatedly. We made the case not only to one another in the House, but to the American people, that there would be a return on investment. 
   And I think, at the end of the day, that's the real key. Projects like that are not bridges to nowhere. Projects like that in the full disclosure of the light of day show a proper stewardship of the tax resources of the American people that are given to us to spend. But to take it away and not answer the fundamental question, to say that these are tactics to stall for pork, I would respectfully disagree with the comments that have been made, because nobody has defended the fundamental question that accountability, in fact, has been taken away and removed. 
   Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, stated on March 17, 2006 that ``before Members vote on the bill, there should be an appropriate time for people to be able to read it, that it be a matter of public record. And if there's an earmark that can stand the scrutiny, then that transparency will give the opportunity for it to be there.'' 
   Unfortunately, moving to a concept of omnibus bills or dropping them in at the conference where there's not that room for debate or discussion, I think it creates opportunities that, I won't go so far as to suggest that there's an issue with integrity, but more importantly, as a businessman, as somebody who was a consultant helping companies to maximize their investments, their productivity, to keep their jobs and to grow, there's a greater risk of redundancy. There's a greater risk of waste. There's a greater risk of less efficient ways to go about solving the problem in a particular region. 
   The benefit of debate and the benefit of dialogue is to give us a synergy that, at the end of the day, will give us results that will benefit the American people. And I think that we've been trusted with the people's money. 
   This legislation, today, the structure and the reason that we have been put into a position where we have to exercise process to force this debate, is no different than what happened a month ago when a germaneness rule, where the minority had the opportunity to offer alternative opinions that had been in place since 1822; folks who stated that they were respecters of the institution moved to strike that rule, and we were simply informed an hour before it was going to go into effect, and we exercised our rights through procedure to remove all unanimous consent and to move to a place where this had to be brought into the light of day because of the opportunities that were given for Members before. 
   At the end of the day, that was wisely repealed that there could be some degree of comity and debate. In this same vein now, I think it's important that, rather than returning to the politics of yesteryear, of a bygone era, I think what we need to do is move forward in a spirit of openness. 
   We live in an information world that's interconnected and open and gives access. Let's give the people access to all the earmarks. Give it to them early. Let Members on both sides of the aisle stand by their projects, justify them to the American people. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman has expired.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, during the 109th Congress, Republicans enacted historic earmarking reforms that allowed Members to challenge and debate wasteful earmarks contained in spending bills on the House floor. This was a good step towards increased accountability and transparency in the earmarking process. 
   Last fall, Democrats campaigned on a pledge to make this the most ethical Congress in history. But, as they headed into their first appropriations season, we're confronted with the reality of their reforms. It seems that instead of increasing sunshine on how Congress is spending the American people's money, they prefer to create massive secret funds for earmarks that will be inserted into the bill after the votes have been taken on legislation. 
   And what is perhaps most egregious is the fact that they won't even let these earmarks, which are paid for with the American people's hard-earned tax dollars, be debated in the people's House. 
   This is not the most ethical Congress in history. This is a sham.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Just as a former small business owner, one of the things that I would like to point out, that 88 percent of new job opportunities are created by small business owners. They are created by land developers, by construction companies, by small machining and tooling companies, small fabrication businesses, distribution businesses, professional services businesses, financial services. The glue that holds the institutions in our communities together, the framework of members of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, of our local Chambers of Commerce that serve that valuable function of communicating an agenda that focuses on growth, that strengthens our Nation for the long run. 
   And I think that one of the things that I would like to highlight tonight, again, is this theme that when people voted in November, much perception nationally was focused on a view that national security situation was driven by emotion. But the reality is that in that election, short of making significant strategic changes in the leadership of this Congress, America voted to increase taxes on every working family in America by at least $2,000 a year. 
   One of the things that I have told folks for many, many years is we don't need to raise taxes. We need to create taxpayers. Government does not create jobs, and government itself does not create wealth or a nest egg for families of America to build for the future. What government can do, however, is set a framework for achievement, a framework where people can pursue opportunity. 
   The Constitution tells that the government is to provide for the common defense and to promote the general welfare. What are some of the ways that we can promote that general welfare? One of the key ways to promote the general welfare is to allow people to keep more of what they earn because they will invest it in a way that focuses on the needs of their family. They will invest it in immediate needs, in consumer goods that have a ripple effect of creating jobs. They will invest in future and retirement plans for themselves and set aside money to grow for college. All of this is fueling the economy, and keeping this in the private sector is very critical. 
   Some of the things that the tax cuts did were allow people to keep more of what they earn. We eliminated the marriage penalty. We increased the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000. That meant, in the case of my family, nearly $3,000 that was left to reinvest in the lives of our children and their education to save for their future. It makes a very, very big difference. When we look at the marriage penalty, it put a significant impact on working families. And, again, I come back to the fact that the average family in America is facing a $2,000 per year income tax increase. 
   But there is another side of this from a small business standpoint of job creation. I would like to highlight one man whose small business benefited in the manufacturing world, creating jobs in his community, impacted the local economy because of pro-growth policies that were continued in the last Congress, allowing not only individuals and families but also small business owners to keep more of what they earn, to be able to invest that, to write down debt and to prepare to compete in the future. 
   We are a global economy. It is critical for us to be able to allow people to invest for the future. Remember, we don't need to raise taxes. We need to create taxpayers. 
   Robert Prybutok of Newark, Delaware, owns a company called Polymer Technologies. Because of the tax cuts that were enacted, he was able to hire 10 new employees in 2003 and 2004. He had approximately 72 employees in January of 2003 and now has about 90 employees. 
   His business continues to grow and with it the need to buy new equipment. By utilizing the expensing provisions of the tax cuts, he was able to purchase two new pieces of equipment, increase his productivity, thus increasing the security of those jobs of his company; and it saved him about $125,000 that would have been lost in cost. This is money that can be invested in the future. 
   Without the ability to expense his equipment, he would have been hard pressed to purchase that equipment in the first place. He needed to grow his business and pay the taxes that he owed. 
   And I think the one thing that I keep in mind from my experience walking the shop floors of many, many businesses during the era of the Clinton administration where these breaks were not in place for America's manufacturing companies. People made decisions based on the structured Tax Code. They withheld making needed investment in competitive productivity improvements, needed investments in the professional education of their employees because they were uncertain of what the future held. Had the tax expensing provisions been in place, they could have made those investments more easily. 
   And I think it is important to keep in mind that it allows a business to invest in the future to create more taxpayers. I think that this ability to expense equipment, this ability to make investments that are going to be job-creating investments, maybe a short-term deferral of tax payments to the Federal Government, actually will increase revenues. 
   How have we seen that? We have seen it over and over again. As taxes are cut, more money goes into the investment economy, more jobs are created, more taxpayers are created, and tax revenues are an all-time high right now in the Federal Government. 
   I think there are countless stories that we can share of successes on a small scale in small business which is really the opportunity to live the American dream. The vast majority of jobs in this country, nearly 90 percent, 88 percent are created by small business owners. They are not created by large corporations. 
   There is so much of a focus on the class warfare rhetoric that goes on in the Chamber that misses the point where the majority of the Americans work. And the majority of Americans work in small business. That is why we need to reduce the burden on those small businesses, create incentives so they can create jobs and create taxpayers to promote the future for their employees. 
   With that, I would like to yield back to the gentleman from Texas to share more of his perspective on this matter.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Will the gentleman yield on that point for a moment? 
   Not only does it affect employees in the Social Security Administration who process checks for our senior citizens, it also affects our ability to fight against Islamic radicalism, fight against terrorist groups. 
   I flew in today with members of the FBI Southern Ohio office out of Cincinnati coming in for some business here in Washington, and they shared their concern over the lack of a continuing resolution. Was the money going to be there to fund their operations? And, right now, one of the things that our national security apparatus, because of this Democratic Congress, is having to cut positions, not just a few positions but nearly 3,000 positions because of the lack of funds to do their job which we had provided for them. 
   When we talk about the issues related to bringing this continuing resolution, there was a clear statement that was made about the desire to work harder. Well, last week, 2 days, we were done by 2 p.m. This week, I am reading the schedule, and it says, tomorrow, Tuesday, we will be out around 2 p.m. Wednesday, no rule yet on the continuing resolution, but likely we will be out at 2 p.m. 
   I don't know how many nights we worked long, long hours in this Chamber, long, long hours in committee to get the people's work done. And now we have Federal law enforcement. 
   I got a call today from an aviation unit in the Army that is now very concerned about its receipt of dollars. And we are inside the 48-hour window, have no language on what this bill is. They are limiting debate to 2 hours, which I think is a very powerful statement of the direction in which they choose to take legislation, that not only did we have a tax increase 11 days ago but spending is going to be without accountability. 
   I intend to vote against this resolution if this resolution will not disclose the information that is necessary for us to do our job. Because, ultimately, they are going to create some real problems leading up to the foundation for this tax increase in 1,433 days.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. One of the things that I would like to share as we come back to this issue of tax policy, again, I come back to my time walking the shop floor, and for me the one thing, you hear a lot of stories and a lot of perspectives, but for me it always came back to show me the numbers. Let's take a look at the truth, what reality is, and be able to make our decisions from there. Here is the truth about the impact on creating jobs for working families, good jobs, jobs where there would be opportunities for health care, to fund their children's education, looking to the future. 
   In less than 3 years, because of this policy of allowing people and allowing and incentivizing small businesses to keep more of what they have earned, the U.S. economy has grown by $2.2 trillion. Let's put that in perspective for a moment. That is larger than the entire Chinese economy. That is the growth of the United States. 
   There is a lot of concern about international trade in this global economy. Just in 3 years, our increase in economic growth is bigger than the size of the entire economy of our largest international competitor. It is much larger than the total economic size of India, Mexico, Ireland, and Belgium. And I think the issue here at the end of the day is being able to allow people to keep more of what they earned, to create taxpayers, not raise taxes, because the proof is in the numbers. The proof is in changing opportunities. Yes, we are going through a time of economic adjustment, but at the same time record job creation as our economy adapts to the 21st century to compete effectively, and that is the future that our kids are going to have.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. When you talk about creating strong families, I comment on our good friends and neighbors back in Kentucky, Mike and Vonna Drake. They typify Americans living that dream of being able to pursue their own opportunity. Mike works as a pilot; Vonna is a nurse. Their children are friends with my family. I have watched their kids grow up through the years. 
   These policies that seem so arcane, reading about them in the news or some of the shrill rhetoric that we hear during political campaigns, have a real impact on their flexibility and ability to invest in their children's future, let alone decisions that they might make regarding their futures and careers. 
   In 1,443 days, my neighbors are going to have a $2,000 tax increase. They have two children. The $500 per child tax credit that was increased to $1,000, recognizing the cost of raising a family, the cost of investment in all of the needs of our children, and not simply food and clothing, but education and activities to grow them and develop character and to strengthen them for the future. That will revert by $500 per child. 
   Now they will have an additional $1,000 just on that alone. Because they are married, they attend church, they are committed to their faith, they are a great example of a family in our neighborhood and community, just based on the fact that they chose the course to get married, their taxes are going to be increased or they are going to have a tax penalty of 12 percent. 
   To your point, we need to encourage policies that will empower and strengthen families and will create taxpayers, and that will pass on that work ethnic to the next generation that made the Drakes a successful, value-adding American family. Not only do they serve their community now in their church, Vonna serves as a nurse, Mike is an aviator in the Army. He went in out of high school, got himself educated and pursued a professional career in aviation. He is a valuable member of our community. 
   And we need thousands and thousands of families across our districts because they are the ones who bear the burden. They are the ones who make the investment, as President Clinton likes to say. And I think of all of the dollars lost by investing in areas where it was going to create no future and create no value. 
   At the end of the day, unless we bring about fundamental changes in accountability, in 1,443 days this economy is going to be hurt. My friends and neighbors are going to be hurt. Small business job creation opportunities are going to be hurt because of keeping people from having that opportunity to invest and to build a future for themselves.

   I rise in opposition. This bill punishes the elderly, working families, our schools and all industry in this country. This bogus measure punishes the heartland of America that grows the food, produces the goods and creates the energy that this Nation runs on. 
   I call on all Kentuckians and all Americans to stand up and call this Democratic-led Congress what it is, useless. Vote ``no'' on their bill. And Mr. Speaker, give us a vote on a bill that matters, that will change the American people and that will help us build a future: The American Energy Act introduced by Republicans in this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to honor the life of Sergeant First Class William ``Bill'' Zapfe. Sergeant Zapfe was serving with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division as a combat engineer when he was tragically killed by an improvised explosive device last month. Sergeant Zapfe was a dedicated soldier on his third tour in Iraq. 
   Bill grew up in Park Hills and Dry Ridge, Kentucky, and joined the military shortly after graduating from high school. He came from a family of dedicated public servants. His late father, Joseph, was a State trooper, and his two brothers, Joseph and Edward, have also both dutifully served our Nation. He is remembered by his family as a loving and devoted husband and father. Bill Zapfe is a true patriot who died fighting for a cause he believed in. Bill leaves behind his mother, Jeanne; his loving wife, Evelyn; and his three children, Anastasia, Cameron, and Spencer. 
   Today, as we honor the life of Sergeant Zapfe, our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time. 
   We thank Sergeant Zapfe for his service and for answering the call to protect our great Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would restrict funds allocated in this bill from being used to pay a bonus or other performance-based cash award to any employee of the Social Security Administration or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services who is a presidential employee or a member of the Senior Executive Service. Neither agency would ever survive as a private business trying to make a profit based upon their constituent service abilities which are often inefficient and inept. 
   The premise is simple. Bonus pay is for exemplary work. It is my opinion that the American people are not getting exemplary work from the SSA and the CMS. Therefore, the management of the agency, as in the private sector, should not be eligible for bonus pay and should be accountable for their performance. 
   In March of 2006, my office received a call from a concerned constituent who was having a problem with the withholding of Medicare part D premiums from his Social Security check. After an intensive investigation by my staff, we discovered that this was a widespread problem that affected hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries who have changed their prescription drug benefit plans. 
   After enrolling in a Medicare prescription drug plan during early enrollment and arranging for his premium to be deducted from his Social Security check, my constituent determined that his initial choice of a plan didn't fit his medical needs. He then decided to change his plan and his payment method, opting this time for direct payment instead of deduction from his Social Security check. 
   However, when he received his check, he realized that his premium for his initial selection was still being withheld. He attempted to address these problems himself with both CMS and SSA. He worked with them for 3 months without success. After contacting my office, my constituent liaison had more than a dozen exchanges with CMS and SSA over the next 6 months. Repeatedly, he was told by one agency that it was the other agency's fault. Several times he was told that the problem had been resolved and it would be reflected in the next Social Security check but never was. By this time our constituent had to live within an enormously reduced Social Security check for 9 months. My office had actively engaged on his behalf for 6 months, and my constituent is frustrated and angry. CMS and SSA say it is not their problem, and my constituent's hard-earned money is unaccounted for. 
   If the Social Security Administration was able to stop paying the plan provider by April of 2006, which is still an outrageously long period of time, then surely they would have been able to stop the withholding of the plan premium for my constituent 10 months after the fact. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is not only unacceptable; it is outrageous. For the millions of seniors in Kentucky and across the country that live on a fixed income or who are struggling to make ends meet, unnecessarily withholding these funds can create serious cash-flow problems. It is inappropriate to reward management of these organizations for taking money away from our seniors. 
   In the roll-out of a program as large as Medicare part D, there are bound to be bumps in the road. That is completely understandable. However, that it should take 11 months to resolve an issue like this is incomprehensible. 
   This story represents only one of the most egregious examples. The problem is not one of individual case managers in the departments but rather a systemic inefficiency and cultural problem, bureaucratic attitudes that involve shifting blame as opposed to working actively to take responsibility for problems in their departments and then solving them. It often requires multiple inquiries and sometimes several months to even get a status update on a case. Getting to the root of the issue and fixing a problem can take upwards of a year. This is simply unacceptable. 
   The amendment I wanted to offer would have conditioned the payment of bonuses based on reports to Congress by both agencies detailing how they are addressing these issues. Unfortunately, the Parliamentarian has informed me that such an amendment would constitute changing existing law in an appropriations bill and be subject to a point of order. 
   Therefore, I am offering only a straight prohibition against the payment of bonuses for the coming fiscal year. I think this is something that both sides of the aisle can agree on. It is my sincere hope that the chairmen and ranking members of the Appropriations, Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce Committees will work with both agencies and with me to improve the service delivered to our constituents. 
   If you are going to receive performance-based bonuses, then I think your performance needs to be exceptional. When we are causing seniors frustration and unnecessary problems with their hard-earned money, I don't view that as a satisfactory performance, let alone performance that should be rewarded with a taxpayer-funded bonus. 
   In conclusion, if you believe that the performance of CMS and SSA exceeds your expectations, then you should oppose this amendment.  
   However, if you believe, as I do, that both agencies are performing well below expectations in meeting the needs of our senior citizens, then I urge you to support my amendment to prohibit bonus pay for those responsible for running these agencies in the coming fiscal year. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I appreciate the distinguished chairman's comments and perspective on this. 
   The one thing that I would share is I think we're dealing with some cultural challenges in the customer service responsiveness of many of the agencies. 
   Oftentimes in this Chamber, we highlight the poor performance of private corporations in their management, but having worked in helping businesses turn around and reform their practices, one of the things that I've noticed, especially in corporations that are successful in transforming their culture, the executives, the management leadership at those corporations, take personal responsibility and have a significant personal stake in the performance of every level of their department. I think this requires across-the-board change. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Thank you, Congressman Hunter, Chairman Skelton. 
   I just want to make a statement that I rise in very strong support of this amendment. It is critical right now that we address the challenges between the agencies and the Federal Government. 
   Over a year ago, Congresswoman SUSAN DAVIS and I formed the bipartisan National Security Reform Caucus to begin to address these issues in a new flavor from what now Chairman Skelton began to address as a young Member of Congress in the 1980s, leading to sweeping reforms in the Defense Department, and leading to the concept of jointness between our services that we have today. 
   We've seen this caucus grow. We've seen terrific hearings that have been done on the Oversight and Investigations Committee pointing to the need for better interoperability between the State Department and the Defense Department. We have many dedicated civil servants and many dedicated military personnel who are actually blocked, in many aspects, from working together because of the silos of the agencies, statutes and regulations in accounting that prevents them from interacting effectively.  
   I think that one of the things that we need to do as a Nation is to have the ability to more flexibly and agilely use our instruments of national power so that putting troops on the ground, using our kinetic power, is the last thing we do; that we can begin on the soft end with humanitarian efforts, peacekeeping, peace enforcement, reaching out with information, and using very powerful and often unheralded assets like the Agency for International Development, more expeditionary Foreign Service, and allow this interaction to take place in an effective manner. I think that by having this standard advisory panel, we can take the politics out of this and continue to work closely. 
   I appreciate the chairman's leadership, leading in a bipartisan manner on such a critical issue, convening many meetings and forums, and also participating over a year ago with us on this Council of Foreign Relations effort that brought together much of the interagency community. 
   Again, I encourage my colleagues to support this. Thank you for your time, and the chairman for his graciousness and procedure.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (TAX INCREASES PROJECTED UNDER DEMOCRATS -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, we both had the opportunities to pursue the American Dream, to start our own businesses and create jobs. I look back on the last time there was a large increase was in the administration that came in in 1993 that passed one of the largest tax increases in American history. What that meant to our business was less jobs, money that could have been reinvested and employed more people. The one thing we need to understand is that people know how to spend their money better than government does, to keep it in their local communities, to stimulate that local economy. And the tremendous increases in taxes just went to further Federal spending. 
   I think the thing that we have seen by policies that allowed people to keep more of their own money is we don't raise taxes, we create more taxpayers. One of the things that is lost in much of the political noise that has gone on over the course of the last year is that revenues from income taxes have been at the highest point in American history because the most jobs have been created by allowing people to keep more of their own money. 
   But in the aftermath of the last election, what most folks don't realize is that the average working-class family making between $30,000 and $50,000 a year has voted themselves a tax increase of over $2,000 that will take place in 1,446 days unless Congress acts as a majority.  
   I invite members of the Blue Dog Coalition, those that are fiscal conservatives, to join together with us to ensure that those tax cuts stay in place. 
   I have my son, Geoffrey, sitting behind me tonight who is 8 years old. I ask myself what kind of a country will he have. Will he have the opportunity to pursue that American Dream, to create jobs, to create a future and pursue his desire? That is what this is all about ultimately, providing personal freedom and discretion with their income to make a difference. 
   We cut taxes in every walk of life. We encouraged families by eliminating the marriage penalty and we doubled the child tax credit so families with a large number of children would not be penalized, but made sure that they could make an investment in their children. We lowered tax rates for all Americans. We removed 10.6 million low-income earners from the tax rolls. To say that these tax cuts were simply for the rich was a myth because the person who benefited was the working family and small business owner who could put their dollars to work in their community to build a nest egg for themselves and ultimately to build a future. 
   And what did it do on average? It returned $1,670 to the average taxpayer who took that money and spent it on personal needs or invested it, building a future for their children and their children's children. 
   One thing that I found interesting when the resolution on tomorrow's energy vote came in, and I think we come from areas that are strong in manufacturing in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, and Illinois. Energy security is one of the most important things that we are facing in the future of this Nation. We talk about it and we talk about initiatives that are going to create jobs coming from folks who have been in business. At the end of the day, what are we seeing, not only a tax increase in 1,446 days, but a tax increase on the American energy consumer that is coming by taxing domestic energy producers and pushing more business to Middle Eastern oil producers. 
   I have some comments on some legislation that we have been working on, but I yield back for your comments on this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Well, I think we need to put in real terms what is going to happen in 1,446 days, and that is a $2,096 tax increase for every working family in America. 
   What does that translate into? For me, that translates into one semester of college tuition for my 21-year-old, who started student teaching this week. She is in her third year at Northern Kentucky University. And what does it hold for my son's future? What kind of opportunity is he going to have by restricting that annuity that could grow and remain strong in the future? 
   If we look at it in the bigger sense and talk about energy security in this tax that is coming, that is going to hit people in their bottom line, in the pocketbook and at the pump, one of the things we got to experience working together on the Armed Services Committee, we see much of the money that America sends to foreign oil producers is sent to unstable parts of the world. It is sent to areas like the Arabian Gulf that are a hotbed of extremism and instability. 
   We see what is happening in Venezuela right now, with a socialist dictator who has risen to power and threatening to nationalize the oil reserves and fundamentally to cut off America's gasoline supply. Fifteen percent of our gasoline comes from that part of the world. 
   The one thing that I want to comment on, from that standpoint, is we need to reduce our dependency on foreign oil, to keep more of our dollars here. And there are tremendous initiatives and opportunities that we have today that we could do to address this issue in many ways. 
   One of the things we have done in the Ohio Valley is to take advantage of the coal-to-liquid technology. It is a proven technology. South Africa produces 25 percent of their transportation fuel from coal. That is why we have introduced the Coal to Liquids Fuel Promotion Act of 2006. It is a bipartisan bill that I introduced with NICK RAHALL. He and I share the largest inland port in the United States, where the majority of America's coal is transited outward. Pennsylvania produces a tremendous amount of coal. 
   Think what we could do by decentralizing energy production, creating jobs here, and literally, as our floor leader, the majority leader in the Kentucky statehouse says, we could have another industrial revolution in the heartland of this country, creating millions of jobs, converting coal to liquids in an environmentally friendly manner, reducing our foreign oil dependency, stimulating jobs here, and giving our youth a future. And replicate that also with biomass, biodiesel, ethanol, and many other types of products. 
   And I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania to follow on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I just think one thing the gentleman from Texas brought up is very important for us to realize, and that is manufacturing jobs are the best benefit providing jobs we have for working families in this Nation. Eighty-four percent of manufacturing jobs provide full benefits, health care, retirement, opportunity for the future, and that sense of security. 
   What this tax increase is going to do by addressing domestic oil producers is not simply a strike at a mythological big oil company. The international oil producers are not going to be affected by this. They simply have to step back and let the law of supply and demand take over. Who is going to be affected? The local oil producers, the wildcatters, those small investors in Kentucky, West Virginia, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and other States throughout the heartland that create jobs. 
   In addition to that, dollars for research and development are going to be disincented. With a tax credit is the opportunity to reinvest that, to find new sources of oil, and more importantly develop new technologies that can bring it forward in a low-cost way and create more jobs. 
   But it is not just the small producers. It will be the distribution chain. Those small refiners, like our Catlettsburg Refinery, which creates hundreds of jobs in northeast Kentucky and affects thousands of jobs in the local economy, will be adversely affected by this. It will impair their ability to grow and it will hurt the future for people there. Down the supply chain, the distributors of gasoline and petroleum products. 
   And, again, it is not Big Oil. It is the local convenience store owner, the person who drives that replenishment truck going to the gas stations. It is the lawn care business that might be in somebody's neighborhood or the individual who is taking parts to the manufacturing company. It is going to be the person who distributes milk and food products. It will put a cost burden on every single consumer in this country. 
   Not only will there be a tax increase, but there will be inflation as a direct result of this. Ultimately, it comes down to our consumers. Because if our farmers and manufacturers are all going to be burdened with this, ultimately it will pass to us. And what sounds good in reality is a big, big mistake, because it is taking money out of the economy, and it will send it elsewhere and will keep it away from incentives that will create jobs. 
   We need to make investments in energy, in natural gas, and in oil. Natural gas is critical for our manufacturing economy. But the Democrats in Congress overwhelmingly voted repeatedly in the 109th Congress. Congressmen Conaway and Shuster and I saw this, where in fact one Member was chased down into our Cloakroom to change his vote after Hurricane Katrina against expansion of refinery capacity. 
   We need to make sure that we have natural gas on the Outer Continental Shelf and we use the resources that we have here, like the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, in an environmental friendly way to make sure that our economy, our future, is put first, so that children like the young man sitting behind me here can have a job and a future when they grow up. 
   But what we see is this tax increase now and the tax increase in 1,446 days, and I yield back.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. If the gentleman would yield. 
   One thing I would like to point out, just having come from an entrepreneurial business background like you. The idea of working 100 hours would normally translate into about 3 days or 4 days worth of work, possibly 5 if you had really to get something done, if the product had to get out the door at the end of the month, if the system had to be implemented, if the equipment had been to be rigged and installed. And I think what we have here was somewhat misleading to the American people who expected 100 hours in the last Congress would have been accomplished in a very short period of time. But I think we are taking a more comfortable pace, doing 100 hours 2 hours at a time. Instead of having votes ending at midnight or 1 in the morning we are getting done at 3 in the afternoon now.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I think you bring up a good point when you talk about the national security implications before we come back to some of the domestic impact of this. Looking at the news today, we see threats. In particular, we are dealing with some very complicated situations in Iran. They are committed to developing nuclear weapons, possibly as a deterrent, possibly for an offensive capability. Sometimes they think about, people want to look with a simplistic view on what Iran might do to the world energy market by closing the Straits of Hormuz. But the Iranians are good businessmen, too. And the one thing they understand is they don't have to have a military solution to impact world oil markets. By reducing their production by 10 percent would cause a devastating disruption in Europe and Western oil commodity prices. It would ripple through all prices in America, and they would still make the same amount of money on the gross margin that they made with a greater amount of production by the impact on the market. 
   This tax is simply irrational that the Democratic majority is bringing forth this week for a vote. It is anti-jobs. It is anti-health care, and it is anti-education. It is anti-jobs because dollars that would be invested in job creating technologies are going to be removed. And who gets affected by this? 
   The view in the TV commercials supporting these types of things is the wealthy super executive on the big corporate jet. But what they forget about is the welder who depends on that, the small welding shop that does fabrication work in Ponka City, Oklahoma. They forget the seismic vibration technology manufacturer that makes the big heavy trucks with the seismic vibrators that go out and read the ground working with seismic engineers to help find where those oil reserves are. 
   And as my colleague from Texas pointed out, there is a tremendous amount of risk. It is not a science. Purely there is an art to this, to find those resources and then once they are found to see how they can be pulled out of the ground economically. 
   In my own district we have Newport Steel, a tube and casing manufacturer that almost exclusively supports domestic oil exploration and production. They are going to be hurt by that. Those are jobs in a troubled industry right now that is fighting to compete internationally.     
   We talk about concerns over foreign competition, concerns over competition with China. Guess what the Chinese are doing? Last week or week before last, the executive vice foreign minister, the incoming foreign minister in China announced, that they are making heavy investments in alternative fuel technology to create transportation fuels, coal-to-liquid technologies, biomass. They are investing in other technologies to offset those demands that they see the rest of the world growing from demands in Middle Eastern oil. 
   In addition to that, let us think about the working families who needs this. There is a reason that the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers supports investing in these alternative technologies, in coal-to-liquids and biomass and ethanol to build these plants, to decentralize our energy supply and localize it so a storm like Katrina will not hurt it. 
   But guess what, if we raise these tax that this bill purports to do this week, the investment capital that would create those jobs, that would take those risks instead of the private citizens spending their money would be gone. Who is going to get hurt by that? The very people they say they are going to help, because not only will it eliminate jobs, those manufacturing jobs, 84 percent of which have health care benefits provided for their employees, they are going to be affected. 
   It is anti-education. How? The one thing that we talk about, and I talk about with teachers and educators throughout my district is the need for money, for investment in learning, to keep up, building schools, providing books, training teachers, continuing professional education for our teachers. 
   I have a daughter who has begun her student teaching now looking at a career in education. Where will the dollars come to pay for her future or my son's future? That comes out of the property tax; it comes out of income taxes. That means that you have to have taxpayers to do that. 
   The government cannot magically wave a wand and create money. It is going to be people investing in labor, adding value and creating a profit. When we see that the last refinery that was built domestically was in 1976, we have a very serious issue, considering our population has increased by over one-third since then. 
   I would be curious of your experience looking at manufacturing in the energy industry in Pennsylvania and your comments from that perspective.

   In the smallest vein, these policies, my son, who was running around here a moment ago, and his brother, Daniel, and sister, Miriam, decided they were going to start a lemonade stand because they wanted to create economic opportunity for themselves.

   But the good news is, I think all young people, when you see kids in this country have that natural desire to create opportunity, and what do we do with Big Government? Big Government stifles that opportunity. 
   We stifle it by creating excessive regulations. We stifle it by tax. What might sound good, again, I come back to the politics of class warfare where they say, oh, we have got to just stop these profits from going to companies. It is not fair for somebody who is working 100 hours a week in reality to be more successful than you. But it is those people who are creating the jobs for others. They are fueling the economy for research. They are fueling the education and research and development programs in our universities. 
   I look at another time in history where there was a government attempt to control energy prices, when OPEC began to assert itself in 1973 and 1974. There was an attempt to control prices. What did we end up with? I remember when I was in high school.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. The next aspect of this was the markets for investment to create jobs in the private sector began to drop. When I graduated from college, I was glad I enlisted in the Army because there were no manufacturing jobs left in western Pennsylvania when I was 17 years old. 
   The next thing that we saw was inflation at the highest rate it had been in anybody's memory. When I graduated from college, I think the prime rate was under 17 or 18 percent. It was impossible for a working family to afford a mortgage or to buy a house. It was driving the very people these Big Government tax solutions were designed to help, actually were hurting more than anything else, which concerns me with this vote 14 days into the new Congress. We are going to raise taxes on the fundamental bedrock economy that drives the entire economy, the energy that fuels it all, literally, and in 1,446 days every working family in this country, unless we stop that, will have a $2,096 tax increase.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to restore funding that directly impacts the emergency response capabilities of rural and small community first responders. 
   The Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program, or CEDAP, is a critical resource for equipping first responders in rural and small communities around the country, especially in America's heartland. For each of the last 3 fiscal years, Congress has wisely provided $50 million for CEDAP. CEDAP is designed to help first responders in small and rural communities to purchase much-needed equipment. 
   This year's bill would cut that funding by 60 percent, but increases other grant programs by over $2.6 billion. It would cut from $50 million in last year's CEDAP funding to only $20 million this year. It's also worth noting that the House-passed bill for fiscal year 2007 would have provided $75 million, a 50 percent increase to assist our small cities and rural communities. 
   My amendment will restore funding for this vital program to $50 million. To offset this funding increase, my amendment would take $5 million from each of six other very large grant programs, totaling a $2.6 billion increase in grant security spending overall, each of which will still receive a massive increase over last year, even if my amendment is adopted. 
   By only approving $20 million in this year's bill, we risk severely impacting the capabilities for emergency response in our small and rural communities. In addition, CEDAP is a program with a proven track record of accountability and success. 
   While the committee responsibly proposed increasing State and local grant programs by hundreds of millions of dollars and anticipates this will benefit some of these same communities, that result is no means a guarantee. CEDAP is designed to guarantee that our small communities receive needed first responder equipment. And I believe it's our mandate from Congress to assure that small communities are protected. 
   The committee report says it expects overall increased funding to benefit the CEDAP communities, but that is not guaranteed in statute. We must not cut this critical funding. 
   If my amendment is adopted, the House will affirm its commitment to safety and prosperity of our rural communities, without severely burdening any other program. Each of the programs selected as a part of this offset would still receive a massive increase over last year's enacted amount if my amendment is adopted. 
   The House should maintain level funding for CEDAP to ensure that communities continue to benefit from this direct assistance program. The proposed cut I believe is a terrible message for the new Congress to send to rural and small communities who benefit directly from this program despite the soundness of the underlying overall bill. 
   With funding at the $50 million level, the Department issued approximately 1,800 CEDAP grants in fiscal year 2006 to small town and rural community police departments, fire departments, EMS units, sheriff departments, cities, towns, counties, universities and others. If this $20 million number stands for fiscal year 2008, this Congress will likely be cutting these rural and small town grants from roughly 1,800 to 720. This is the wrong direction for this Congress and for this important homeland security program, just as the fiscal year 2007 application process is under way. 
   The committee increased funding for urban grants by $50 million for a total of $800 million. Certainly we can maintain CEDAP for rural communities at a level of $50 million, instead of cutting it 60 percent. In this year's bill, funding for a majority of programs is hugely increased, including important urban programs. I mentioned before $2.6 billion of critical grant increases while cutting this one by 60 percent. 
   My amendment would only reduce these programs by $5 million. While the increases are important, the committee has unreasonably targeted the CEDAP account for a 60 percent cut, while finding hundreds of millions of dollars in new spending. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, I respect greatly the work of the chairman and the ranking member to craft I think a very strong bill overall. 
   We face problems in protecting our rural communities. I believe the three of us all have many rural communities that face challenges. Working in another committee, we've faced challenges in protecting rural housing grants for affordable housing programs to make sure they're not subsumed by the large urban areas in the States. 
   And I'd ask the gentleman if he would consider in this conference process finding a way to segment or protect, if not in the form directly of the CEDAP dollars, but to make sure that a mechanism is considered to protect our rural communities and small towns to have access to this needed equipment.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the gentleman from Kentucky, I thank the chairman for their work on this and the commitment to work on this problem. 
   The real issue is not the superficial presenting question itself in the form that it takes, but ensuring that our small towns, our rural communities have access to these funds in some kind of a manner that can be protected. For example, in my district along the Ohio Valley, in fact many districts, small towns sit aside critical infrastructure, locks, dams, chemical plants, other areas that could be vulnerable to threats, and they are the only means of response. And by having this access, it will protect them. 
   With that commitment, I thank both the ranking member and the chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the gentleman's amendment is withdrawn. 
   There was no objection.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (HOMELESS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AND RAPID TRANSITION TO HOUSING ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, we have come a long way since Julia Carson and I introduced the original version of this bill, H.R. 840, nearly 2 years ago. The McKinney-Vento programs haven't been reauthorized in nearly 15 years, and I am glad that the HEARTH Act was able to get this important discussion going again in Congress. 
   The Financial Services Committee held two hearings on this issue last year, and the testimony that we heard, from the providers especially, had a large impact to give us all a reality check on the different types of homelessness we are facing in this Nation. For example, in my part of the Nation, in the heartland in Kentucky, I'd like to call it homelessness in plain sight. We have very few of the classic HUD definition of homeless but, in reality, the vast majority, overwhelmingly so, are single parents with small children; more often than not, a battered woman with small children. 
   It's especially poignant for me to be here today, and I have to thank my friend and former office neighbor, the late Congresswoman Julia Carson. I was honored that she asked me to join originally to work on this bill with her. I give special thanks to my congressional classmate, Congresswoman GWEN MOORE, for helping me to keep this issue at the top of the committee's priorities. 
   I'd also like to recognize the tireless work of all of the homeless advocates on this bill, members of staff here, so many team members, that worked hard in common cause but, in particular, one person that I have to recognize and thank is Linda Young from Welcome House in northern Kentucky. Linda was the one who originally brought this problem of leaving children and families out of the HUD homeless programs to my attention over 2 years ago. She came up to Washington to testify for us about her hands-on experience with this issue, and truly she has been an inspiration, not only here, but to thousands and thousands of the needy in Kentucky. 
   As a fiscally conservative Republican, I fully support the Federal investment in the homeless assistance grant programs. A roof over one's head goes a long way, but it's truly the supportive services, combined with housing, that have the biggest impact on changing a person's path in life. These programs lend a helping hand to people who want to build a future and pursue a dream. This type of Federal assistance has a lasting and positive impact, not only on the recipient, but on our communities and, frankly, on the Federal Treasury. 
   To help children, especially now, in this time, in this formative time, to keep them from becoming part of the system in the long-run, a falling into the despair of a hopeless future, it is critical that we make this investment and we give our care providers on the front lines the opportunity to build relationships that will transform lives. 
   My primary goal in cosponsoring the HEARTH Act was to increase local flexibility. Homelessness in Kentucky's Fourth District is not the same as it is in California, for example. Local continuums and providers should have the flexibility to tailor their programs and grant funding to meet their unique needs, and not have Washington bureaucrats try to give a one-size-fits-all solution for the definition of homelessness. 
   This is all about acknowledging that homelessness looks different in different parts of the country. Homelessness has many faces that for the most part go unseen by the public at large. They walk by us every day in the shopping mall and on the street. We see them passing us in the stores and in the parks and, regrettably, even in our churches. We look the other way because we don't have eyes to see. But if we open our eyes, if we ask for that gift, and we see, then we are called to action to make a difference. 
   I am thrilled to see that we have come to a compromise with the Senate on the definition issue. The compromise includes homeless families and unaccompanied youth identified by other Federal agencies. In HUD's definition, this was a problem. 
   This is a huge step towards ending homelessness. I thank everybody who has worked on this across the country, those here in the Chamber and on the Hill, those in our communities around the Nation, and for me, especially, I'd like to take a moment to share, as I stand in this Chamber, as I walk the halls of Congress tonight, and especially, for me, what I consider one of the most significant legislative pieces to affect a generation that is coming up now.     
   I am humbled to be here. I was one of those children who had to leave in the middle the night. I was one of those children whose mother in desperation married somebody who probably should not have been married; a man who was violent, alcoholic, adulterous, a mean-spirited individual. And I know that feeling to watch as a helpless 6-year-old when your mother is being hit, and to step between those two and to leave the house and to hide in the closet, the secret that the neighborhood knew nothing about. But that reality and that pain for us came to salvation by the grace of God, that there were little islands of opportunity where we could take refuge. 
   The truth though for so many thousands is that is not there. They have to move to other towns, other school districts and other communities. What this does is provide that island, that helping hand. It helps us with our weaker brother. It helps us care for those who are around us in a way that I believe is responsible, both fiscally and obligation morally. 
   I commend all who have worked on this, and I say God bless you for your efforts.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to the Democrats' omnibus spending bill. The text of this legislation that would spend more than $463.5 billion in taxpayer dollars was first distributed to the minority less than 48 hours ago and will be debated for only one hour. In October the Democrats promised the American people increased transparency and accountability, but apparently, these promises are hard to keep in January. 
   While there are billions of dollars being spent without oversight or accountability, the omnibus also includes a provision that will alter the formula for distributing Section 8 housing funds. The current formula bases funding on an average of funding levels for May, June and July of 2004 with adjustments for inflation. 
   The altered formula contained in the omnibus bill will base funding levels on the previous twelve months funding, accounting for inflation. The formula change will cut significant amounts of funding for more than half of our nation's public housing authorities. 
   The formula change would result in a decrease in funding for three of the four major public housing authorities in my District. The Covington Housing Authority would lose $197,321, the Ashland Public Housing Authority would lose $75,578, and the Maysville Housing Authority would see a loss of $71,274, which is 23.4 percent of its operating budget. These housing authorities provide critical services to my constituents and an unexpected funding cut like this will only worsen the already poorly funded public housing system. 
   Changing the formula for Section 8 is a topic that deserves debate, but the formula included in the Democrats' omnibus spending bill has yet to see the light of day in either the House Financial Services Committee or, until now, on the House floor. Changing the formula midway through the year without debate or discussion is an unwise move and would wreak havoc on our public housing system. 
   Contrary to claims made by Democratic leaders, it has been discovered that this bill contains numerous hidden earmarks that Democrats apparently hoped to ram through the House without debate. It is in the interest of the American people that we ask our colleagues across the aisle what else is buried in the 135 pages of this bill that will harm real people in our districts without ever having been debated in this House?

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REGISTERED AGENTS AND BROKERS REFORM ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5611, the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, or NARAB II. 
   First, I would like to commend my friend, DAVID SCOTT. We come from two different parties, but a common background in the business community, in the small business community, understanding the issues that business people deal with on a daily basis, and crossing multiple regulatory frameworks dealing with multiple States. 
   My experience has led to my support and working to develop this bill and to get it passed tonight and hopefully signed into law before the end of year. It was based on my experience as a small business owner, not as an agent, but as a business owner who had employees in several different States, and suddenly found when I reached out to a good friend of mine who was an agent himself that he had to deal with several different agents. It suddenly became very complicated and very costly from a time standpoint. It was inefficient and not cost effective at all for any of us to get these different plans to fit the needs and in compliance with each State. 
   After I came to Congress, with that experience in the back of my mind, I also heard from many, many agents in the insurance industry, and many small business owners who encountered situations like I had sitting astride the nexus of three States. 
   Insurance reform has been the subject of discussion for many years now. There are many different perspectives on it. What DAVID and I have tried to do through this bill, and our staffs, is to simply solve a process problem that allows people to work together more effectively. To me, this is the height of bipartisanism at its best. We are working to common cause, to fix a process that helps our citizens across the country. 
   I am very pleased to see this meaningful and targeted reform measure make it to the floor today after over a year of work. NARAB II goes straight to the heart of the difficulties that insurance agents and brokers, and small business owners who are their customers, face on a daily basis as they try to navigate this web of State licensing requirements. 
   The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act would have created the original NARAB system in the event that the States did not satisfy the producer licensing reform objectives outlined in the underlying bill. Ultimately, the States were perceived to have achieved a specified level of licensing reciprocity, and NARAB was never created. Thus, the problem remained. 
   Nearly 10 years since the passage of Gramm-Leach-Bliley, we are still in need of progress on this issue. H.R. 5611 mandates the creation of NARAB. The board's purposes and function will be generally the same as the provisions of Gramm-Leach-Bliley. In short, agents and brokers licensed in good standing in their home State and meeting NARAB-member criteria will be able to join NARAB. Members will pay the appropriate fees required by each State in which they are licensed, and so this will not eliminate any revenue States currently generate from licensing. NARAB would not have any Federal regulatory authority, an important point that my friend from Georgia highlighted during his remarks as well. This is not an expansion of the Federal bureaucracy, it is a correction to allow the private sector to continue to grow business and create jobs. 
   I would like to think of NARAB as a stamp of approval for an insurance agent acknowledged and accepted nationwide. 
   I appreciate the hard work, expertise and advice from all of the insurance industry groups in helping us to come to compromise on H.R. 5611. In particular, the NAIC has been an invaluable source of knowledge, and I appreciate their substantive suggestions for ways we can improve the bill. 
   We made sure that the State insurance commissioners had a voice in the shaping of this legislation to ensure that State rights were protected, and at the same time we were able to address a direct issue that was affecting these brokers and small business customers. 
   H.R. 5611 takes a significant step toward improving the way our insurance markets operate within the existing State-based system. I would like to thank in particular Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, Chairman Kanjorski, and Ranking Member Pryce for their leadership on the important issue of insurance reform and for their support of this bill that Mr. Scott and I introduced. 
   Lastly, I want to thank my good friend, DAVID SCOTT, for his work and also his staff, Michael Andel and Tammy McAthey, and my legislative director, Lauren O'Brien, who have worked long and hard to bring this to pass. This has been a great piece of legislation. I urge support for the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to one of our Nation's heroes, Staff Sergeant Delmar White. Sergeant White lost his life when serving a convoy mission in Baghdad, Iraq on September 2, 2007. 
   Sergeant White was a dedicated soldier and served in the Marine Corps in the Persian Gulf War. He had been a member of the Kentucky Army National Guard since 1998 and was serving in Iraq with Battery B, 2nd Battalion, 138th Field Artillery based in Carlisle, Kentucky. 
   I recently had the opportunity to visit with Sergeant White's family, and his wife conveyed to me that he died for a cause that he truly believed in. His fellow officers, noncommissioned officers and soldiers told me of a kind and gentle man who was dedicated to the military and to his family. 
   Today, as we honor his memory, our thoughts and prayers turn to his wife, Michelle, their two children, Shelby and Seth, and his family and friends as they struggle with the loss of this great man. 
   Our Nation is deeply indebted to Sergeant Delmar White for his service, dedication to his mission, and for making the ultimate sacrifice.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, some of the Democratic leadership have declared it the job of Congress to micromanage the war in Iraq. Yet we learn today that the Speaker of the House has refused to be seen face-to-face with the very military commanders whose hands will be tied by the Democrat war funding bill. 
   This latest insult to our troops should come as no surprise as others in the Democratic leadership have declared the war lost despite our military commanders' statements to the contrary, and before General Petraeus has gotten the reinforcements he has requested. His reinforcement hasn't even been fully implemented before Congressional leaders have called it a failure. 
   I urge my colleagues to insist on a funding bill that does not give our enemies a date for our surrender. I believe our soldiers when they say the war is not lost, and we must give our military the resources it needs to win. Language of surrender is inappropriate with troops in the field and reinforces the perceptions of our enemies.

Gullett from Greenup, Kentucky, a dedicated soldier who lost his life on May 7, 2008, in the Sabari District of Afghanistan. He was assigned to the 4th Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division based out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky. 
   According to his mother, Cheryl, Jeremy had dreamed of joining the service since he was 6 years old. While attending Greenup County High School, Specialist Gullett was a member of the school's Junior ROTC program. He joined the Army in 2003, shortly after graduating from high school. Jeremy was a model citizen. Not only did he serve our country abroad, he was also a volunteer fireman; a loving father to his two young daughters, Kaye and Katie; and a dedicated husband to his wife, Janeth. 
   Today, as we celebrate the life and accomplishments of this exceptional Kentuckian, my thoughts and prayers are with Jeremy Gullett's family and friends. We are all deeply indebted to Specialist Gullett for his service and sacrifice.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, I have great respect and admiration for my neighbor, the chairman from West Virginia, for work that we've done in our river industries and supporting local industries; but I have to rise in objection to this bill. I think in some ways we might entitle it the Exporting America's Jobs Overseas Act. 
   I grew up around the American mining industry at the working-class end and got to see it from that side, one of the great transformations that took place during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s; and I think there are three core issues. 
   The law needs to be reformed, I agree, to adapt it to a 21st-century economy within which we live. However, the issue of competitiveness, the issue of American jobs and the issue of fundamental social justice all militate against this bill. 
   First of all, for the Democratic Caucus, from my friends on the other side who are committed to protecting jobs, I think it's amazing that we want to raise taxes on a core industry that's important to our supply chain, for our technology industry, to drive jobs overseas. It's going to increase material costs, increase our dependency on foreign hardrock minerals which has doubled over the last 10 years according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 
   Secondly, there is a significant impact on jobs. Mining jobs and the mining support and supply chain jobs and industries that support that cannot be replaced by hospitality jobs. That is a flawed logic, in my mind; and it's very critical that we maintain the robustness of this industry as a strategic asset and a strategic resource. 
   For our future in energy, our future in manufacturing, we have to use the resources that we have in an environmentally friendly way to not only protect our jobs but to grow their jobs. 
   Finally, I think the one thing I found in trade agreements through the years here in the House, there's always the discussion about a social justice component in establishing trade agreements with countries that may have  sweatshops, may abuse men, women and especially children. In this case, I would point out that areas where we get strategic materials now that will increase their industry are abusive of children. Specifically, you can see a picture here of a child who's a Peruvian miner, children who are Colombian miners, and a Ugandan miner, all of whom are young children, all of whom are having their futures closed down because of this. 
   I oppose this bill. I ask that we yield back to the principles expounded by the gentleman from New Mexico and the gentleman from Alaska.

   One of the most solemn duties that we can have in the House of Representatives is to recognize the sacrifice, devotion and service of those who protect this Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of Army Specialist Joey Cantrell, a soldier from Westwood, Kentucky, who recently lost his life fighting in Taji, Iraq, serving with the Army's Second Battalion, Eighth Cavalry Regiment. 
   Specialist Cantrell graduated from Fairview High School in 2002 and was a celebrated athlete both on the football field and around the track. His football coach and mentor, Fairview school superintendent Bill Musick, told a local paper, ``You always noticed Joey Cantrell because of how he presented himself. He was a sharp kid.'' Joey overcame adversity, achieved academic excellence, was a leader and a tough competitor in athletics, and won the friendship of many. When it came to serving, his coach shared with me that Joey felt it was a call to go into the military. 
   Recently, I had the opportunity to visit with his mother Sondra Adkins. His family and friends remembered his warm smile, thoughtful nature and his ability to excel at everything he did. Joey Cantrell will be deeply missed by all who knew him. His mother shared that Joey believed in what he was doing and gave his life doing what he wanted to do. 
   Today, as we honor Joey's memory, our Nation grieves with his mother and his family. We are deeply indebted to Joey and thankful for his service. Soldiers like Joey Cantrell make me proud to be an American.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, we return again for the fifth consecutive leadership hour with the Countdown Crew. 
   I would like to welcome all of you here tonight who are watching from home. We have been surprised at the tremendous amount of response that we have received talking about the reality of tax policy, of small business policy and the impact that it has on the lives of ordinary citizens in this Nation. 
   In fact, the feedback has gotten so great that we have received hundreds and hundreds of calls, e-mails from around the country. 
   What we would like to do is invite you to become part of the Countdown Crew, as we are only 1,416 days from one of the largest tax increases in American history. We have a Web site. We would encourage you to e-mail with questions, with comments, your perspective on ways to make life better for working families to create jobs and to strengthen small business, which creates 88 percent of the jobs in the United States. 
   If you look behind me, our e-mail Ðaddress is here. It is countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. And we would invite your comments and your feedback, and also invite you to share your stories of why the tax cuts of the last several years have made a difference for you, why a more relaxed and more structured regulatory process that focuses on sound science versus on politics allows businesses to work to create jobs, to create opportunity to create a future for our children and our grandchildren. 
   And there is a reason for this. In the election on November 7, so much of the emotion and so much of the focus had to do with issues related to the national security policy in the Middle East. But one thing that was forgotten in that time was something else that was voted for by the American people. 
   All of the tax cuts that have created 7 million jobs, that have created record revenues to the U.S. Treasury actually are on time lines. And they have to be extended by the House, and they sunset at the end of 2010. And without a President to advocate those policies, without a House of Representatives and a Senate that is going to pass those policies, all of the tax cuts that have created millions of jobs, that have created these record revenues in time of war are going to end. And that means that in 1,416 days, the average working family in the United States of America will experience a tax increase of $2,098. And that translates across every sector of America. 
   And the one thing I think that often gets lost, and I will speak as a former small business owner myself, is the fact that small businesses create 88 percent of all new jobs. Those are companies with under 500 employees. These are companies that pay health benefits, that do research and development, that open new doors. 
   The tax revenues that are generated from those businesses and those employees are what fund the infrastructure of our communities. They pay for our teachers; they pay for our public safety. They contribute to our national defense. 
   And one saying, I think, that is important for all of us to remember is, the focus that we need to have is not to raise taxes but it is to create taxpayers. And the way that we can create taxpayers is give those who create the jobs more resources to invest in the economy, allow working families to keep more of what they own so they can save it and build a nest egg for the future that will ultimately lead to the growth that we have experienced. 
   We have got several distinguished gentlemen tonight. Before the gentleman from Oklahoma begins, I would like to recognize the leadership of Congressman Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania who has been the principal architect of the Countdown Crew. 
   Remember, if you would like to Ðcontact us, that is countdowncrew@mail.house.gov if you have a question for any of the Members participating tonight or would like to share your own story of how being allowed to keep more your own money, more of your own resources has helped to create a future for you. 
   But before I share some stories about some friends back in Kentucky who started and created jobs that are affecting not only our region and our economy, but also the defense of this Nation, I would like to recognize Congressman Sullivan, the gentleman from Oklahoma, to share his perspective on this.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Thank you very much, Congressman Sullivan. 
   I think it is so important what he highlighted here when he mentioned four children. My wife Pat and I have six children. For families what this translates into, just the loss of the child tax credit alone for a family of four is $2,000. That could be a semester of college tuition. It could be an investment in savings. There is an opportunity cost that comes with that that has real effects. And when that money is in the economy, it is creating jobs. 
   And I would like to take a moment and share one small business story that is close to home about an environment that creates opportunity. You may have heard me say this before: The role of government is not to create jobs. Government doesn't create jobs by itself. What government does should be to create a framework that empowers people to create jobs, to create opportunity, and to protect that opportunity we pass to future generations. 
   We have seen tremendous change that has taken place in our region, the Fourth District of Kentucky. And specifically in the northern part of that district, right across the river from Cincinnati or, as we like to say, the greater northern Kentucky area, we are seeing economic explosions in great numbers in a variety of industries. In particular, a group of far-seeing businessmen wanted to change the view of our community, joined with community leaders. And they worked with Northern Kentucky University, first with President Jim Votruba, and talked about the need for bringing high-technology jobs and creating a climate for high-technology jobs. Dr. Votruba recruited an information technology professional named Bob Farrel, who is an entrepreneur, a great success in the business world, but also a teacher and a mentor. They collaborated in turn with the chamber of commerce, with local government, with State government, and created a zone in downtown Covington, Kentucky, on Madison Street, called the Madison E Zone. And into that came some friends of mine to build on the foundation that was given to them, those boundaries in which they could create opportunity. 
   Three men, Kevin Moore, Norm Desmairis, and Greg Harmeyer, I know all three of them. I have watched what they have done professionally with their business. I have watched how they have grown from a very small company to create many, many jobs; how they left one facility and had to move down the street to an even larger facility. And they are the true ideal of the American entrepreneur, a small business person who starts with a vision, pursues that vision, and wants to bring about change. And what Kevin and Norm and Greg have all done with their business that is remarkable in information technology is they have provided needed services in the preservation of knowledge and improving the efficiency of systems, helping the employees of other job-creating companies to be more effective and more competitive in this global economy. And where it comes home full circle is the idea of working with the university in conjunction with the Department of Defense and the Department of the Air Force to help preserve knowledge and help strengthen the information technology systems of our Armed Forces, of our national security establishment. 
   What is exciting about this is tier one with Greg and Norm and Kevin represent hundreds of small businesses that are creating thousands and thousands of jobs around the country. And what they shared with me, and Kevin 
   shared with me tonight, is that these tax increases are going to hurt their ability to provide for health care, as Congressman Sullivan pointed out. It is going to hurt their ability to make needed investments in equipment. It is going to hurt their ability to compete effectively. And I believe it is better to let them keep more of what they have earned because that is going to be recycled into the economy to create more jobs. 
   And the model we are following, as Solomon said in the Bible, there is nothing new under the sun, was the same model that birthed Silicon Valley. There were intellectual partnerships and entrepreneurial partnerships with Stanford University that led to the greatest explosion of technology and research in the history of modern man. It changed the life of virtually every citizen in this Nation, provided us with technologies and tools and improved a way of life that had never been known before. And now we stand with an opportunity to build that type of a future right in Kentucky. As my colleague, Congressman HAL ROGERS down in the Fifth District, likes to say, representing eastern Kentucky, we may not have Silicon Valley but if we have the right economic policy and the right focus on research and the right focus on developing our young people and especially the right focus on creating an environment to stimulate small business, we may not have Silicon Valley but we can have Silicon Hollow. We can make a difference that provides not only for the next generation that follows us but to keep this Nation competitive in the long run. 
   And we stand at a crossroads right now. As we mentioned before, in 1,419 days, the average working family in this country is going to see a tax increase of $2,098. Money that has created 7 million jobs will be taken out of the economy. And what we need to do is look at policies that are proactive, that make a difference. 
   One colleague who is here with us tonight who also came out of the small business world, who has been in Congress for a long time, who understands both the political side, but most important to me is that he has created jobs, has made a payroll, and he has helped other people deal with these benefits and understand this importance, and that is my friend Congressman JACK KINGSTON from Savannah, Georgia, and I would like him to share some of his perspective.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I appreciate that, Congressman Kingston. It just highlights all the more what you point out, that in 1,419 days, that every working family in America is going to have a $2,000 tax increase. We think about where that money could go and what it is doing in the economy. 
   Just for those who might be joining us tonight, we are the Countdown Crew. We meet the first night of every vote and talk about issues that make a difference to creating jobs, that make a difference to our pocketbook, for working families, for small business owners that create the preponderance of our jobs. 
   We would like for you to join with us, to communicate your stories, to share your experiences. You can contact us at countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. We are standing by to hear those stories right now. And I just want to thank again BILL SHUSTER's vision to want to execute this program. 
   As we get ever nearer to those tax increases, we have had Members that are coming to the floor that haven't been politicians their whole life, that have had what I would like to say are real jobs, who have been out there, who know what it is like to have to make a profit. 
   I know what it is like to make that decision to go without a paycheck to make sure that employee health benefits are paid. And I am not saying that to impress anybody, simply to point out to you, that is a common decision that many small business owners face, making sure that our employees are taken care of. And when taxes are raised, that takes away even more of that flexibility to meet employee and family needs, but also it takes dollars out of the economy or dollars out of the potential of those businesses to create jobs. 
   One Member who is joining us here tonight who I think has lived a great success story in small business with her husband is Congresswoman THELMA DRAKE from Peninsula, Virginia. She represents the Norfolk area. 
   The thing that is very exciting about her story that is very consistent with other small business owners who have gotten to taste that piece of the American Dream and all the families that have worked with them or have been benefited by them, is her story coming up as a Realtor, seeing many, many facets of the economy and the impact of these income tax policies, of regressive policies against small business, and yet at the same time the positive impact by allowing people to keep more of what they earn. It has created record revenues, as Congressman Kingston mentioned. 
   Among all the doom and gloom stories, one thing that I would share is that many times when we talk about our global economy, there is a great fear of competing on that global stage. If we compete on a level playing field, the American worker, the American entrepreneurial and creative genius is going to win. But when we talk about competing with countries like China, an emerging superpower, one thing that I would point out is that just in less than 3 years, the U.S. has added to its economy, the increase in our economic output has been $2.2 trillion. That is bigger than the entire economy of China. 
   Folks, if we create taxpayers instead of raising taxes, that growth will continue and our children and grandchildren will have the opportunity to compete. 
   I would like to recognize the gentlewoman from Virginia to share her perspective on this.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I thank you, Congresswoman Drake, for being with us this evening. I think one thing I would like to recognize is that THELMA and her husband are real people who started and ran a real business that created real jobs and a real future for many others. 
   If you are just joining us, we are the Countdown Crew. We are counting down 1,419 days to one of the largest tax increases in American history if Congress does not take action to make sure that the tax cuts, the benefits that have made such a difference for so many in this country by allowing people to keep more of what they earn, are extended and hopefully made permanent. 
   I would just like to point out if you would like to communicate with us, we are the countdowncrew@Ðmail.house.gov. If you have questions or would like to share your story of how being able to keep more of your own money, of your hard-earned resources has benefited you, how it has helped you build a future, we would love to hear from you.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I appreciate you pointing that out. That was one of those surprises that I think affected a lot of people or that will affect a lot of people in the months and the years ahead. The reason for that 60 percent or three-fifths majority was to make sure that it was clearly the will of the American people to raise taxes instead of cutting spending, that people would be accountable. 
   In effect, what we were doing was something similar in line to the way  the Senate works, with their rules of cloture to end debate. They have to have a 60-vote supermajority. Certainly, over there that would be absolutely necessary for any type of a measure that would raise taxes or lower them. In the same vein, I think it was right for us to have that in this body, because in 1,419 days we will be raising taxes. 
   The one thing that we all believe in the Countdown Crew is that the goal of the government should not be to create new taxes, but to create taxpayers. We want to cut taxes, allow people to keep more of what they earn. And that is why we have had 7 million new jobs created and record revenues into the Federal Treasury, because the economy is working. Even in a time of war, it continues to grow, and it is incredible that we are able to compete so effectively in a global economy. We need to allow people to keep their resources to build that future for their children and grandchildren. 
   With that, I would like to recognize another real person who helped run a real business creating jobs out in the economy before he came to Congress, and that is our leader of the Countdown Crew, Congressman BILL SHUSTER from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I thank you, Congressman Shuster. For those of you who are watching, if you would like to share your perspective, your view, join us via e-mail at CountdownCrew@mail.house.gov, and remember that in 1,419 days, there is a bill arriving. 
   I would put it to you in a question like this. If you knew or you suddenly went to the mailbox and opened the box up and there was a bill for $2,100 and it was due immediately, that is what is coming if these tax cuts are not extended and made permanent. 
   Despite the fact of the economic improvement in this Nation, the Democratic Congress is committed to raise taxes. The last time they raised taxes was 25 days ago in the energy industry that has an effect on virtually every job in America, and now we are looking at a wide variety of taxes. 
   Facts are stubborn things. The success of Republican tax relief initiatives are undeniable. That is the reason that Congressman Shuster and I and the Countdown Crew like to say we want to create taxpayers, not raise taxes. We want to create taxpayers, not create new taxes because the job creators who are out there are real people, like Jack Kingston who was in the insurance industry; Thelma Drake from Virginia now who was a Realtor; Bill Shuster who worked in the automotive support industry. I worked in the manufacturing industry, and all of us saw firsthand the impact of government policies that were often well meant by folks that passed these laws, but they never worked out in that environment to understand the impact that it had on the pocketbook of working Americans. 
   As we stand here tonight for the seventh week since the Democrats took control of Congress, I am pleased to report one thing, though, is that the Democrats have come to the realization that some facts just cannot be ignored. 
   This week, the House will vote on H.R. 976, and that is the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2007. This bipartisan legislation extends critical tax provisions for small business owners and paves the way for the House and the Senate to come to agreement on raising the minimum wage from $5.15 cents to $7.25. 
   I know you supported this measure, Mr. Shuster, and so did I, but we realize also how important this provision can be for young people just starting out, for working families, and I am glad that the Democrats have realized how important some of the tax incentives are to keeping our businesses growing and creating new jobs, but we cannot stop here. We have got to make this and all the other tax relief provisions permanent that affect individual families, because real people who hold real jobs out in the real world, not here in the halls of Congress, are the ones that pay those taxes, that foot that bill like that $2,098 bill that is going to be arriving in 2 years, in the very near future, if these tax policies are not extended, if they are not continued for the great benefit that they have brought forward. 
   I would like to highlight some tax provisions that need to be made permanent. First of all, the $1,000 child tax credit reverts to $500. For a family of four, that is $2,000. In my case, my wife Pat and I have six children. That is $3,000. It goes on and on, affecting people right in their pocketbook. 
   That $500 difference is not $500 that is going for a corporate jet or some rich and famous lifestyle for people who were seen in the tabloid shows on TV. That $500 tax credit goes to real people who live in the real world. They are spending that on their children and investing that in their children's future. I believe we need to allow them to keep more of what they earned because they are going to spend it in a way that is going to benefit their children and their children's children. 
   Congresswoman Drake mentioned earlier the 10 percent tax bracket. Contrary to some of the spin in the media, the truth of the matter is that the tax burdens have been pushed upward. It is those with more that are paying more now with the structure of these cuts. Millions of people have been taken off the tax rolls, and in fact, the 10 percent bracket was created specifically as a transition for lower-income earners so their tax burden would not be that high, that they would be able to keep more of what they earn to be sure they meet their basic necessities. That 10 percent bracket will disappear when those tax cuts expire in 2010 without action from Congress and from the Senate and from the President of the United States. 
   I would mention in a light moment that Kentucky is the home of Kentucky Fried Chicken. We were meeting with KFC franchisees from all around the country that came into Washington last week to give their small business ownership perspective, what they do in the food service industry, and they talked unceasingly about the benefits of tax policies that help working families, that help them as small business owners that made sure that they could keep the dollars in their community, creating jobs in their community instead of sending it to bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. 
   One thing that they brought up that was very important and really affects any capital-intensive business that they wished for was the continuation of the 15-year accelerated depreciation for improvements on new construction of restaurant buildings. Under old law, we are looking at a 30-year depreciation schedule, and when you think about the food service industry, as competitive as it is with new fads and themes to be able to meet the needs of the consumer, 30 years is quite a long time, and I can think of a difference in my lifetime. 
   These business owners, these men and women who were creating thousands and thousands of jobs around the United States, asked to not have their tax burden eliminated, but simply to have it structured in such a way that they could compete more effectively. 
   They understand the importance of creating taxpayers versus taxes because those dollars, creating jobs, will come back into the economy, and as we have seen with record revenues to the Federal Government, by cutting taxes we have improved revenue. 
   The Republican-led Congress had acted and extended these important tax relief provisions to 2007, but we need to make them permanent. 
   I would like to defer now to my colleague from Pennsylvania to share some more of his perspective on this issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (THE COUNTDOWN CREW -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I thank the gentleman and point out that we in the Countdown Crew can be contacted at countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. The stories that we tell are about real people who are creating real jobs and live in the real world, and they understand the real effects of the policies that are generated here in Washington, that create value, that create a future, and those that create impediment and create barriers to growth. 
   I think of my friend George Hammond who runs Hammond Automotive. He started in Covington, Kentucky, years ago, and he invested in his business the great benefits that have come from the tax cuts that were passed by the Republican Congress, allowing the American people to keep more of what they own, have benefited him and his employees and family. His business has grown. In fact, he opened a new outlet, a new store in Burlington, Kentucky, to reach even more people and to create even more jobs. 
   It is like my friend Don Salyers who runs a river transport operation in Ashland, Kentucky, giving opportunity for creating more jobs and a future for that community that is in economic transition. 
   This week we are going to vote for a tax incentive package that will help to keep the American economy strong by extending tax policies that we passed in prior Congresses. We owe it to our families and this Nation, to our working families, to small business owners, and ultimately to the health of the economy to allow people to keep more of what they earn. We need to do more that creates that future and creates taxpayers, instead of raising taxes. 
   One thing that I would like to comment on here tonight is the extension of the work opportunity tax credit. Small business owners, especially those that have to take somebody and intensively train them to bring them into that workplace, into that small business to make them into a taxpayer need incentives and opportunities. For example, we have many people who have had some challenges in life, that may have lived life on the edge, may be going through a transition in life, and we want to give them that opportunity. But the way to do that is not to mandate that. The way to do that is not simply to set aside the taxpayers' dollars with no stewardship or oversight, but is to allow the market and the economy to work by providing accountability for those small business owners on the frontline, and also the opportunity and the incentive to make an investment. And what the work opportunity tax credit does is it incentivizes small business owners to hire higher-risk employees, and the goal again is creating taxpayers. 
   What are some examples of this? Dealing with high-risk youth. My wife, Pat, and I worked with Youth 
   on the Edge for over 20 years before I came to Congress. And the one thing that I can say is there are many young people that need a vision; they need a new start to overcome mistakes that were made earlier, some wrong assumptions they had about their environment, oftentimes the consequences of poor decisions that they made. 
   On first blush, a business owner could be hard pressed to want to make that investment. But what this tax credit does is gives an offset to that business owner to make that investment, to reduce the risk, to give somebody a chance. That is the kind of framework, the kind of regulation that government should give that allows the market to work, to bring out the best in people, and ultimately strengthen our economy in the long term. 
   You know, as I close tonight before yielding to the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his final words, our mission in the Countdown Crew is to do two things: first, it is to let the American people know that in 1,419 days, a $2,100 bill is going to arrive in the mail to basically every taxpayer in the United States when the tax cuts that have produced so much will be repealed automatically, when they sunset. We need to allow people to keep more of what they earn. We have seen the great benefits that come to the economy from that. 
   The other thing that we do in the Countdown Crew is we want to highlight the positive impact of policies that allow people to control their own lives. The government doesn't create jobs; all it can do is create a framework and environment that either empowers people or restrains them and holds them back. And what we want to do is join with you and the Countdown Crew, and you can contact us at countdowncrew@mail.house.gov to get the American people's story here in the House of Representatives so that the Congress will know, and compel the Congress to act, to allow the small business owners who create the bulk of jobs in this country to keep more of what they earn, to invest it in their employees, to allow working families to keep more of what they earn and invest it in their employees; so that in 1,490 days we can continue creating opportunities rather than stopping something that has been a great benefit. 
   With that, I will yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania to close.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (HONORING FORMER CONGRESSMAN GENE SNYDER -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. The subject of our Special Order tonight is to remember a great man of this Chamber and a great Kentuckian and a great person, a friend to virtually all who knew him. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to pay tribute to my friend and fellow Kentuckian, Congressman Gene Snyder. 
   Born in Louisville, Gene Snyder began his political career in 1954 as a city attorney for Jeffersontown, Kentucky, at the age of 26. In 1962 he ran for Congress and was elected to represent the Third District of Kentucky. After losing his bid for reelection in 1964, he turned right around and ran again in 1966. This time, he was elected to the seat that I now hold from Kentucky's Fourth District. 
   He went on to serve Kentucky and the Nation for another 20 years until his retirement in 1986, bringing a record of credit upon his office and doing great service to the people of Kentucky's Fourth District. Gene had a tireless work ethic, both in Washington and in Kentucky's Fourth District. He was a master political operator and strategist, and his dedication to the conservative cause was without equal in the 1960s and 1970s. 
   He stood by Barry Goldwater for President and was swept out of office in the 1964 Johnson landslide, only to return 2 years later. 
   I can personally relate to that and Gene's character and his persistence, having lost my first election and announcing on election night that I was running again and getting up the next morning and going to work for 2 more years to win and to make a difference. 
   Gene was a great example with his work ethic, with his character, with his devotion and his tenacity. He enjoyed campaigning, and he relayed to me stories of many people who cut their proverbial teeth on his campaigns. I have heard stories literally from hundreds of people across the old Fourth District who remember him, who remember meeting with him. 
   He worked and reaped the benefits for those who followed him in office. He laid a foundation for those of us in the delegation who came after him. Ground work for a strong Republican Party in the Fourth District, campaigning was not something that Gene did every 2 years. It was a life-style for him. 
   He was in a constant state of campaigning, reaching out, building friendships, reaching across the aisle, reaching across the fence on an arm, across the wire at the county fair, meeting people in storefronts. He used to tell me how on Saturdays he would often get in his car when he was back in the district and drive Highway 42 from Pewee Valley where he lived on up towards northern Kentucky, stopping in small coffee shops, in storefronts to visit with ordinary people. 
   He was a man without pretense, one who people simply knew as Gene. Everyone from our region still remembers Gene's famous campaign jingle, and more than one person has nostalgically sung the whole song to me word for word since I got into politics in 2001. We have heard those words: ``Vote for Gene Snyder. He is your working Congressman.'' 
   In fact as recently as the last few years, that jingle, which has not been used in a campaign since 1984, was still considered the best political song in the radio stations in Louisville. Gene thoroughly enjoyed interacting with his constituents, and his enthusiasm for his job showed in his ability to recall the names of thousands with whom he came in contact. 
   Even more telling was the fact that many of his constituents simply knew him as Gene. They never knew the fact that their Gene was considered by columnist Jack Anderson here in Washington as one of the 10 most influential Members of the House of Representatives because of his work ethic, because of his knowledge of the rules, his knowledge of policy and procedure, and the commitment that he made to the citizens of his district and to this country. 
   During his time in the House, Gene was an unyielding force whose visionary efforts laid the groundwork to improve our region and the lives of Kentuckians for generations to come. Though a fiscal conservative through and through, he worked tirelessly to bring Federal funds back to Kentucky and the Fourth District. 
   He did this for one purpose: he understood the value of investment and meaningful infrastructure for economic growth, to lay a foundation for job creation in the future. The key to that is what we see today, areas that were farm fields 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago have born the fruits of his investment, the seeds of his vision that were planted in economic development and economic growth that has made this area the Fourth District from the eastern part of Louisville up through northern Kentucky one of the greatest technology growth corridors in the Commonwealth and also in the Ohio Valley. 
   When my friend Rick Robinson, the new legislative director for Gene's successor, now Senator JIM BUNNING, attended a Congressional Research Service briefing on policy and procedure as a new congressional staffer, he told me recently that many of the examples that were cited by the instructors on parliamentary procedure, on the rules, on the way the House of Representatives works were all centered around Gene Snyder and his efforts, his example of being able to build momentum, his example of being able to force an issue when it was necessary or deter or slow one down and that it was not going to be productive for his party or for the citizens of the Fourth District. 
   It is rumored that when he would walk into the committee with the Jefferson rules, the rules of the House under one arm, the chairman would simply lean over and ask him, Well, Gene, what do you want this time? As a member of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, he helped secure Federal funding for critical transportation infrastructure in Kentucky. 
   Some of Gene's projects included the Big Mac Bridge of I-471 from Newport over to Cincinnati dedicated in 1981, Clay Wade Bailey Bridge from Covington to Cincinnati, which opened in 1971. He also secured Federal dollars to protect Bellevue and Dayton from flood waters of the Ohio River. He was responsible for creative engineering to bring about, from a legislative perspective, the construction of the bridge over the Markland Dam. 
   I would like to highlight his creativity on these for a moment. Gene was a man who built relationships and friendships on both sides of the aisle. He was known for his card games. He was known for a happy hour that he ran out of his office in the days of the old House. 
   In fact, he told me late one night at his house years ago, the story of how the I-471 bridge came about. He said to me, he said, Geoff, how do you think we got that bridge? Answering as somebody from the outside, I said, Well, I figure you had the studies from the Corps of Engineers and the economic impact and the designs and the budget. He laughed and he said, No, it was the happy hour that got Newport, Kentucky, that bridge. 
   He told me how Tip O'Neill, who was a good friend of his, would regularly come by, the Speaker of the House, to his office, sit with him, play cards, have an occasional drink. One night he had come by, had a few drinks and sat back in Gene's chair, and the Speaker put his feet up on the desk and said, Gene, you've got your bridge. He built relationships to get results. He built partnerships for success on both sides of the aisle in the House of Representatives.     
   Markland Lock and Dam is another area that illustrates his creativity in legislation. He made a comment to me on another conversation and he said, you have got to make sure you have  got a legislative director who knows how to read the rules and the laws governing every aspect of projects or investments that you want to make in your district, on guiding legislation that will benefit our citizens. And he cited this as an example. Southern Indiana and the Central Part of the Fourth District near Carrollton and Gallatin County were suffering economically. He was seeking for a way to link that north and south commerce across the river. 
   What was there was the Markland Lock and Dam, a Corps of Engineers structure that had no bridge. He set his legislative director to work, and his legislative counsel researched for several weeks and came about with an arcane statute from the late 1800s that stated that not a bridge, but an access road could be placed across a Corps of Engineers structure. So laughingly, late in the night he said to me, GEOFF, that is not a bridge down there on the Markland Dam that links Indiana and Kentucky. That is an access road. And if you go and look carefully you will see that. 
   Well, I drove down there after that conversation just to see for myself, and I started to laugh as I looked and I saw a freestanding bridge simply bolted to the dam. And I think it was is that type of creativity that made a difference, and that dam still today is creating jobs and creating commerce and linking communities on both sides of the Ohio River to the benefit of generations that have come after him. 
   He secured Federal dollars for a wide variety of projects. Probably the two of his better known legacies are the beltway around Louisville and the Federal courthouse that both bear his name. 
   Gene was an extremely down-to-earth man. He was without pretense. Literally, what you saw was what you got with him. The only thing that he ever wanted to be named for him was the Federal courthouse in Louisville. This was situated directly across the street from the Louisville Courier Journal, his long time media nemesis and frankly, the media nemesis of Republicans for over a generation. Gene told me that he was thrilled that day and when that opportunity came along, that the editors who so longed to opine against him and his fellow Republicans would have to look at the name of Gene Snyder every day as they left the employees entrance of the Louisville Courier Journal to see the Gene Snyder United States Courthouse. 
   Ironically, not long after that conversation, one of those editors who was still working for the Courier Journal told me he figured Gene had the building named after himself just to aggravate that specific editor at the Journal. 
   In 2005, I was proud to carry on the Gene Snyder tradition with a legacy for him to name a new intern fellowship program after him. Working in conjunction with Kentucky University, Northern Kentucky University and Thomas Moore College, my office has had the privilege of bringing talented students interested in politics to work full-time for a semester in Washington, D.C. to see the people's House from the inside, to see that it is not all the writings in a civics book, but it is relationships, it is friendships, it is a process that the Founders gave us to move our government forward and to move the Nation forward. 
   I thought long and hard about approaching him on the name, and I finally called him and I asked him if I could use his name. And I said, Congressman, we would be honored if we could name this program after you, the Gene Snyder Congressional Internship. He stopped for a moment and he said, well that sounds mighty fine. And then he said, you know, no, GEOFF, you need to name that after yourself. And I was taken aback as a freshman congressman when he said that. 
   We talked back and forth for a little bit and I finally shared with him that I felt it would be not only somewhat ostentatious and vain for a first time congressman to name an internship program after himself, I just felt it would be inappropriate because of the legacy that Congressman Snyder had. And he stopped and he said, you know, you are right, GEOFF. Naming it after yourself may cause you some problems. So you go ahead and name it after me. I burst out laughing on the phone and I said Congressman, I said Gene, you are just shameless, to which he responded wryly, he said no, GEOFF, I am just looking out for your best interest for the future. 
   And even today we have Gene Snyder interns working in our office, carrying on the legacy that that man began when he was elected to the Fourth Congressional District of Kentucky in 1966. It is my hope that this program will continue for many years to come and will help foster that spirit of civic service that would make Gene Snyder proud. 
   In October, 2006, I was part of a historic event that took place in Oldham County, Kentucky during the latter part of my campaign. It was a meeting between Senator JIM BUNNING, Gene Snyder and myself, and it was a humble privilege to be part of the final gathering of three Members of Congress who served the Fourth District of Kentucky. Gene Snyder and Senator Bunning have been constant encouragers to me and have helped make the Fourth District what it is today. 
   I am forever in debt to their hard work and service to the commonwealth and to our Nation. To me, the newest person to inherit a piece of this great legacy that Gene gave us, I can share that the highest compliment that I could pay to him is to say that he was real. I became a better campaigner and certainly a better and more effective Member of Congress listening to Gene's advice. In fact, just today we passed our first piece of bipartisan legislation in this new Congress, and I have put the legacy back to the advice that he gave me before I got elected, of building those friendships and those relationships to benefit the people of this country. And I say thank you to Gene Snyder for that legislation that passed today. 
   At one event when we were together I was trying to talk to him at length because it was just so exciting to see him. In his last years, he was not in good health and was in constant pain and I cherished the few moments that we had. But he leaned on me and he grabbed my arm and leaned over and whispered in my ear he said Geoff, you have got my vote. Now go get theirs, and pushed me towards a crowd of new people that I hadn't talked to yet. Always the campaigner, always the consummate politician, always caring for the stewardship of the office. 
   As we look at these times and the legacy that was given, I think there is no better person to share a perspective on Gene Snyder than the dean of our delegation. Hal Rogers was elected to Congress in 1980. He knew Gene Snyder during his time coming up in Kentucky politics. He knew him as a colleague here in the House, and many Members have learned from him. And I would like to yield as much time as the gentleman from Kentucky's Fifth District would consume to just share his perspective.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (HONORING FORMER CONGRESSMAN GENE SNYDER -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Congressman Rogers, I think you captured the emotion and the power of that funeral, the eulogies, the reminiscences that brought so many to laughter. Sitting with Gene and Pat Snyder was always a wonderful journey back to the old House in the days before C-SPAN, before 24-hour news cycles, before multimillion dollar 
   campaigns. 
   The one thing that struck me about him when I first met him was his complete lack of pretense. As a young man, I couldn't believe this was a Congressman, compared to the image that one would have on TV, somebody so approachable, so transparent, and his great gift of humor. He could teach with humor. He could scold with humor and make his point very clearly. He was a man who built friendships that transcended partisan differences. 
   As Congressman Rogers mentioned from Senator McConnell's eulogy, one of his great friends in the House was Congressman Carl Perkins, who represented what is now the western part of the Fourth District, centered in Ashland, Kentucky, in Boyd County. He and Carl Perkins could fight on the floor, fight in the hallways on issues, but at 5 o'clock they were friends, and they were strong friends committed to the Commonwealth, committed to the future of Kentucky. 
   He was a strong leader. And probably the highest compliment that I could pay him is that he was real. And that fact is never lost on those who knew him. Those who were his foes in legislation had tremendous respect for him and invariably they liked him. 
   The real fruit in a person's life comes from the seeds that are sowed in many lives, the fruit that is born from that. I think of several names to mention here that come to mind. Congressman Rogers shared his perspective on Gene's influence in his life. I have shared mine on his influence on me. My wife, Pat, and I used to live in La Grange, Kentucky, down near the Louisville suburbs. My first campaign chairman in Olden County was Harold Smith. Harold Smith, as a young attorney in 1966, managed Gene's first campaign for Congress in the Fourth District, and then he helped manage my first campaign for Congress in 2002 and then again in 2004 and again in 2006. I think about that legacy of friendship and how he reached out and was known by so many in the community. 
   Another was his staff director on the Public Works Committee, Mike Toohey, who also was with us on Saturday. Mike left government at the time that Gene retired and had a long and distinguished career in government relations, helping Ashland Oil, later Ashland Inc., to reach out and communicate its needs and the needs of our citizens in Kentucky legislatively and was a great friend to the Commonwealth and was also one of those products of Gene's influence and his mentorship. 
   Another was Joe Whittle, who met Gene the first time in 1975 when he was running for attorney general in Kentucky at a time that it wasn't cool for Republicans to be running on a statewide ticket. Gene called him up on the phone. Joe was a little taken aback to get a phone call from the famed Congressman Gene Snyder, but he invited him to come up to meet him in Louisville and then drive up to Northern Kentucky to give a talk at the Beverly Hills Supper Club to a large group of Republicans there. When Gene got up to introduce Joe Whittle, he used his humor to make that strong point about how he had sized up Joe's character, and he said, This is Joe Whittle. He is a lawyer but not enough to hurt. And they instantly became friends and were close and intimate friends until a week ago when Gene left this Earth. Later Joe Whittle became the United States Attorney for Western Kentucky. 
   The investment that Gene made in so many lives has transcended their immediate impact and gone to other generations. 
   Anne Gernstein, who is now the chairman of the Olden County Republican Party, was his office manager at his office in Louisville. And before I first met Gene, I met Anne. She was helping with the local campaign, and I walked in the door as a new volunteer, just wanting to get involved in politics, and I would have never thought at that time that I would have the great honor and privilege to follow in the legacy of that great man. 
   Gene, we will miss your humor and that twinkle in your eye right before you are about to spring a joke on someone. 
   To Pat and the children, thank you for sharing this great man with us. Your hospitality and kindness are remembered by so many that you have touched throughout the years. 
   Gene Snyder left an indelible imprint on Kentucky and our country. With his passing, Kentucky has lost, and the Nation has lost, a great leader and a true statesman; but his legacy continues to live on.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY IN FINANCIAL REPORTING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 755, the Promoting Transparency in Financial Reporting Act. And I also would like to thank the gentleman from Georgia for his hard work on this bill. We started nearly 18 months ago, and it is, I think, a true credit to bipartisanship in a way that it is going to help the American people, help small business, and ultimately help to create jobs and give people the opportunity to see clearly into the operation of the financial markets. 
   In the post-Enron financial era, transparent reporting has become an increasingly important component of promoting a healthy corporate environment. Financially stable and accountable corporations are essential for expanding the U.S. business sector, promoting investor confidence, and strengthening the economy. 
   However, it is important to examine ways in which such accountability and reporting standards can become both more efficient and more transparent. A cumbersome, costly system will only reduce our competitiveness in a connected world economy and ultimately cost us jobs. 
   I regularly hear complaints from business owners and executives in Kentucky about the costs and complexities of financial reporting requirements mandated by the Federal Government. As a former small business consultant, I know firsthand the difficulties faced during the time-consuming and costly processes of accounting and financial disclosure. Unfortunately, financial reporting remains an arduous task with too many opportunities for error and for manipulation. Reassessing outdated accounting standards and improving the ability of the average investor to understand and utilize financial documents are essential to the livelihood of American business and the protection of America's investors. 
   Requiring annual congressional testimony by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board stresses that simplification, cost reduction, and transparency in accounting standards and financial reporting are public priorities. H.R. 755 will help hold the SEC, FASB, and PCAOB, as well as Congress, accountable for making progress on these important issues. H.R. 755 will give Congress a way to measure progress on the efforts of these organizations over the next 5 years and ensure they are working to streamline and to modernize the process of financial reporting. 
   As stated in the bill, we would like to direct attention to several areas of interest: first, we would like to reassess outdated and complex accounting standards; improve the understandability, consistency, and overall usability of the existing accounting and auditing literature; develop principles-based accounting standards; and encourage the use and acceptance of interactive data or extensible business reporting language, also known as XBRL; and, finally, to promote disclosures in plain English. I think it would be great ultimately for investors not to need a CPA and a lawyer to understand their own financial statements or the reports that they receive from companies they invest in. 
   H.R. 755 isn't intended to imply that these organizations have yet to move towards these goals. In fact, there are many examples of progress already. Each organization has already taken strides to improve financial reporting and the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and I applaud these efforts. 
   For example, in December, 2006, PCAOB proposed new standards for auditing of internal controls designed to focus auditors on the most important issues. The proposed standards eliminate unnecessary audit requirements and, most importantly, provide guidance on how to adjust the audit for a smaller, less complex company. I appreciate the willingness of the PCAOB to respond to feedback from Congress and the investment community. 
   Another example is the SEC's encouragement of the use of interactive data. Interactive data uses ``tags'' for key facts in financial statements so investors can quickly extract and analyze information in an easily understandable format. The SEC recently announced the expansion of the voluntary test program, which already includes two dozen companies representing more than $1 trillion of market value. Participating companies are rewarded with expedited reviews of SEC filings. In turn, the test group will help the SEC to decide how interactive data can be of most use to investors. These kinds of public and private partnerships will ultimately serve the American people best and keep our markets robust and strong. 
   Many have criticized the burden and cost of Sarbanes-Oxley, and particularly section 404, on small public companies. It is critical that we strike the right balance between requiring financial reporting to bolster investor confidence and keeping our markets open to both domestic and foreign investment. H.R. 755 will help Congress maintain an active and essential role in this balancing act. 
   Modernizing reporting processes, increasing transparency, and reducing the costs of financial reporting will help ease the regulatory burden on businesses and strengthen the ability of individual investors to make educated financial decisions. To quote SEC Chairman Chris Cox, this process is going to be ``a long one, but it is worth it to make sure that the capital markets remain strong and vibrant.'' 
   The Promoting Transparency in Financial Reporting Act will hold the SEC, FASB, and PCAOB, as well as Congress, accountable for making progress on these important issues. 
   Let's pass this bill as a first step towards creating a process for continuous improvement that will simplify our financial reporting regulatory framework. 
   I would like to thank in particular Ranking Member Bachus, Chairman Frank, and Chairman Kanjorski for their support and my friend from Georgia for his hard work on this to bring this to the floor now. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Ms. Kyla Bass of Florence, Kentucky. On February 13, 2008, Kyla distinguished herself when her father, Patrick Bass, a Desert Storm veteran, suffered a seizure. 
   In a display of courage, maturity and composure that far exceeded her 10 years of age, Kyla responded to the emergency quickly and effectively. She administered first aid and then called her mother and grandfather, while simultaneously caring for her younger brother and two cousins who were at home at the time of the emergency. 
   Kyla attributes her quick thinking and first aid proficiency to the skills she learned in American Heritage Girls Troop KY0727. American Heritage Girls is dedicated to developing young women through service to God, family, community and country. 
   In recognition of Kyla's heroism, American Heritage Girls has created the Angel Among Us award, which Kyla will receive during the regional awards ceremony on May 16. Her self-control during this event is impressive. Kyla, we're proud of you. Madam Speaker I ask you to join me in commending Kyla Bass for her outstanding actions and character.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (COUNTDOWN TO TAX INCREASE -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, we would like to take some time this evening to continue the conversation that we began the first full week of Congress, talking about the impact of world view on policies that affect the creation of jobs, that affect families, working families, creating hope and creating opportunity for the future. 
   As we have shared each week, we want to point out that though there were a variety of motivations in the most recent elections, one thing is clear that was not talked about by the American people, I don't think realized the full impact and the emotion of many of the votes that were taken, is that we are now 1,426 days away from one of the largest tax increases in American history. 
   It has only been 18 days since the last time the Democratic Party voted unanimously to raise taxes in this Chamber. The reason that I bring this up is I go back to the last time there was a significant raising of taxes. In 1992, Bill Clinton was elected President of the United States. He promised to cut taxes on working families, and, in fact, came into office and decided that he needed to change his mind based on a different statistic and brought about what was the largest tax increase in American history. 
   Now that was particularly interesting to me. I remember the night of that election, was not in politics, was working in business, and was getting ready at that time, had just started, my wife and I started a manufacturing consulting business to begin working with other companies, helping them with their business systems, helping them to improve productivity to compete in the international arena and helping them to create jobs and keep our jobs in the Midwestern United States in the Ohio Valley. 
   I was informed by the Internal Revenue Service the next year that I was going to be allowed to invest in our government. And what it did was that investment took away money that was hard earned by all of the families that were working together with us. 
   Over time what that would have added up to would not have been a fancy lifestyle, because we were focused very much on serving our community. What it would have added up to quite simply was more jobs. It would have been not only more jobs in our company where we would employ people to empower others to work together, but especially where we saw the impact of these regressive tax policies was in the damaging of the economy during the 1990s. 
   The Clinton administration actually inherited the fruit of Ronald Reagan's vision. Ronald Reagan cut taxes. He sought to streamline regulation. He sought to empower people. It led to the longest period of sustained continuous growth in the history of this country. 
   Mr. Clinton was able to inherit that. But Ronald Reagan was the author of that. The fruit of the policies of the Clinton administration were most felt in the late 1990s. They were felt as the Internet bubble burst, as we began to see increasing pressure from foreign competition, as we began to see jobs leave this country. 
   We saw regulation increase, we saw taxes increase. Ultimately, all of that adds up to money coming from one place, and that is the pocketbook of the American taxpayer. I look back on companies that we went to serve over and over again. We heard about the increased tax burdens that were on the working families, that were on the middle managers, that were on the engineers. 
   Out in the community, that translates into an increased burden on teachers and police officers, on people providing services, small business owners and the local community. It was something that was not often seen in the national press, but was felt very much in the Ohio Valley. It was felt in the Rust Belt; it was felt across the Northern Midwest. 
   We saw that working in manufacturing, in the machine tool industry,  where these taxes and regulations were difficult and created a tremendous burden. They did not create jobs, in fact, created quite the opposite. The cost of health care began going up. 
   There was a cost of compliance with environmental regulations that went up. And all of that was ultimately passed to the American consumer. When George W. Bush was elected President, he wanted to carry on that vision of Ronald Reagan and so did the Republican Congress that had passed tax cuts through the late 1990s that had been vetoed by President Clinton. 
   When President Bush came into office, he inherited a recession that was well under way. Combined with the 9/11 attacks, it was a devastating impact on the American economy. But the tax cuts that were enacted in 2001 and 2003 and that we extended each of the past 2 years had quite the opposite effect in time of war, in a time of national threat: seven million new jobs were created. 
   More importantly than that, I think that the leadership in the Republican Party, the conservative vision, the Ronald Reagan vision for America, understood one thing, that by allowing people to keep more of what they had earned, they will spend it wisely. They will spend it in a way that will bring back more to them and build for their future and invest in their future. 
   That is why we have constantly introduced legislation to allow people to keep more of what they earn. That is why last year we introduced the 401 Kids Bill, to allow parents, at the birth of their child, to set aside money for college that could be accrued year after year just like an IRA. 
   That legislation has no hope in this Congress, because the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee has said that every one of the tax cuts that has created these record revenues will be repealed in 1,426 days. One thing that many of us did not understand before in this country, but I want to share with all of you tonight watching from home, is this: that in order for the Democratic Congress to bring about one of the largest tax increases in history, they simply have to do nothing. 
   The compromise that was negotiated for the original tax cuts was that those taxes had a sunset and that many of the taxes, particularly small business taxes, education tax credits had to be extended from Congress to Congress, from year to year to reauthorize them. 
   It is very clear from the candidates in the Democratic Party for Congress, over and over they are saying that taxes must be raised. The gentleman from North Carolina made a statement over the weekend that not only did taxes need to be raised, but we needed to have universal health care and dramatically encumber the cost of providing for health care for small businesses.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman was talking about the employment impact numbers, particularly when the tax cuts came in. I can remember working on a factory floor in Orleans, Indiana in the weeks immediately after 9/11, and the economic shock that hit the entire home products and office products industry, every segment of our economy, but in this particular town this factory was the largest employer in that area.     
   And there was a great fear about what the economic impact was going to be over time. I was working in business, I was contemplating running for Congress at that time. And the one thing that we began to see as we entered 2002 in that work with that business was that the economy, even then, began creeping back because those tax incentives to working families, to individuals, to reinvest their money, to invest in the economy, to continue to save made a tremendous difference. In fact, that company continued to grow. It came out of that post-9/11 slump and continued to grow in a great way. 
   And when you talk about 4 1/2 percent unemployment, it is remarkable to me. I remember about the time that we graduated from college, right when Ronald Reagan was introducing his proposal that was said to be so radical and they were going to be ineffective, that even though we had unemployment that was approaching 10 percent at that time, they said that the best economy, 6 percent in this economy would be the very best you could do for full employment. And here we are at 4 1/2 percent. But on top of that, we are at record manufacturing productivity levels in this history of this Nation. And I think it just further personifies the point that you are making.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I think it illustrates a universal principle too that if you, kind of like the verse in Ecclesiastes of casting your bread upon the waters and it will come back to you and by allowing a seed to be sown, to grow over time it will make a big difference. And the real difference, I think, that needs to be highlighted is this is a fight, a battle of world views, of seeing, really, the short term versus the long term. A lot of money can be taken into the Federal Government in a short term by raising taxes. But in the long term it could have a devastating effect. 
   I think if the gentleman from North Carolina who is running for President had laid out what he actually did with his tax money or the money that he earned, the American people would probably have a somewhat different view of things. And when I see a super rich Senator, or a very, very wealthy liberal who in many cases inherited their money, making statements about wanting to raise taxes on the rich, what they don't talk about is the tremendous amount of money that they spend to create special investment trusts where they effectively don't pay taxes. 
   And again, to your point, it comes back down onto working families. It comes back down onto teachers, onto police officers, small business owners, people working in retail, people in transportation, pilots, engineers, the folks who keep our economy moving forward. And to our point, leave it in people's own pockets, and they will make a difference. 
   But I think it is especially important that the message gets sent, that our friends and neighbors are going to see that increase.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (COUNTDOWN TO TAX INCREASE -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I think that is a good point. The whole PAYGO budget system really is more smoke and mirrors than it is reality, because I think the thing, again, the American people were not told by the media and certainly weren't told during the run-up to the election that they exempted their existing programs from that. They say there has to be a spending cut or a tax increase to offset any other increases in spending in other programs. But there were loopholes that were left for them to increase spending. 
   But I think the real thing that we have got to look at here is the impact on American families that will come from the tax increases that are coming if Congress does not act. And this is not a Democrat or Republican issue. This is an American issue, this is an economic security issue. 
   And I would just like to recap. Nationwide, a family of four making $65,000, which is the midpoint income for all families in the United States, will see their taxes go up over $2,000 if nothing is done by Congress. Married couples with an average income like this family I just mentioned would experience a 12 percent tax penalty just for being married. For focusing on the values of family, the strength of the family, there is going to be a tax penalty reinstated upon them. I think that is simply unacceptable that that would take place. 
   More importantly, the cost of raising children has gone up. We certainly know that. We have six children. We have one in college, one who is on deck to go to college, another one who is going to be in college shortly behind the first two. These children are working hard. They have jobs. They are contributing now to the economy and the community and they are taxpayers. And they understand firsthand the impact of these policies. But our family, for the cost that we have in raising our children, making sure they are not a burden on society, making sure that we are providing for all of their needs, appreciated the $1,000 tax credit that was provided by the Republican Congress in 2001, and what we are going to see is that is going to be reduced by $500. 
   A family with four children will see a $2,000 increase just on their tax bill because they have children. They will see an additional 12 percent penalty because they are married. This flies in the face of the kind of empowerment and freedom and opportunity that families need. We need to have policies that encourage families, that encourage moms and dads to stay together. I think every child deserves to have a mom and dad. I grew up without a dad. I know what that is like, to be alone, to have my mom working sometimes two jobs to make sure that our needs were met. I remember going to work when I was 16. And the first time I saw, wondering what those taxes were, all that money that had come out of my pay then. 
   One of the things that were done, and I entered that as a minimum wage worker. One of the things that was done, again, by a very progressive focus, conservatives in Congress, was to create a 10 percent tax bracket. We  took millions of people at the lower end of the economy off the tax rolls for a simple reason, to make sure that they could keep more of what they earn. And it is important that we keep in mind the impact on families of every one of these decisions. 
   I wish that everybody in Congress had been in business in some capacity where they created jobs, where they had to make a payroll, where they had to generate opportunity for others, where they had to personally make sure that health benefits were paid. And I think what they would experience is a very different perspective when it is your name that is on the bottom line having to produce that revenue to provide for those benefits. 
   And I remember times that those of us in our little company family would go without a paycheck or take reduced pay simply to make sure that we got those benefits paid. And regressive policies that increase taxes discourage people from doing what I think is the right thing and taking care of their employees. 
   Tax increases and health care are very much this way. We saw in Kentucky, in my State, or in the commonwealth, a very devastating approach to health care that had a huge rise in cost by driving 45 of 47 carriers out. It was a program very similar to what Hillary Clinton wanted to see passed back in 1993. And what was the impact of that? Was there an increase in the quality of health care provided by small business owners? No, it was a significant decrease. It was a significant driving of people out of health care and into other means of provision for that care.     
   Why was that? Because the incentives mostly punished the small businesses. We need to allow small businesses to band together to get the same low rates that big businesses do. But in that vein I want to keep in mind what the impact is. We saw businesses that provided for their employees, that provided for basic benefits either give their employees a cash subsidy because they wanted to get out of the business altogether or they simply had to cut benefits because costs were going up so much. And there are many hidden taxes in this process that have a tremendous impact over the long term. 
   Payroll tax is another issue. There is a lot of talk about Social Security right now. The system needs to be reformed. I think if we sit down and do the numbers and we see that the increase is at three to three and a half times the rate of inflation for Medicare and Social Security that down the road we are going to have a significant problem. 
   But we are not talking in this Congress now about reforms in the system. What is the novel solution that is being provided? Raise taxes. That would be, in fact, the largest single payroll tax increase in history, to take the cap off the Social Security taxes. And who gets hurt? It is not the super-rich. It is not the billionaires who are calling for tax increases because they don't really pay taxes the way you and I do. It is going to be those folks who are in the middle who bear the burden of this economy who are going to bear that burden as well. And I think that the impact of millions of jobs is simply unacceptable. It has a ripple effect throughout the economy and a regressive effect. 
   Just keep in mind, as we talk about competition with China, people see the Chinese economy as this great juggernaut; but one point that I would like to make in particular when we look at the increases, in less than 3 years the U.S. has added economic output by over $3.2 trillion of additional economic output. That number of our increase in economic output is bigger than the entire economy of China. That is a staggering statistic when we think about that, the economic engine that we have. And it would be a grave error to put additional burdens on the families who are the producers, who create the value in that economic engine, that would hurt the generation that comes behind us. 
   Would the gentleman from Pennsylvania have some other perspectives?

Relating to your point, if I may reclaim my time for a moment, the welfare to work tax credits that have been extended progressively every year are a perfect example of that by giving incentive to a small business owner, considering that 88 percent of all new jobs are created by small business owners, but to give them a direct tax incentive to take that risk, to invest in an individual, to teach them and train them to give them a job, it proves your point.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (COUNTDOWN TO TAX INCREASE -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would like to close by a sharing a little bit of a story I think that brings some of this into perspective. 
   You heard us share earlier that 88 percent of all new jobs created in this country are created by small businesses, companies that employ less than 500 employees, and those small businesses are started by men and women who have vision, that want to take risks, that are willing to step out. Congressman Shuster and I know that feeling of taking that step. That is a scary thing when you are going to make it on your own and not try to depend on a large corporation, suddenly realizing that you can create that value, create that future, and that others will follow and join with you and that you can begin to perpetuate it and grow. And the great industries, the great technologies that have come in this country, the great opportunities that have been created have been by those entrepreneurs who have gone out and made that difference. 
   See, our key must be to create taxpayers, not raise taxes. Our goal is very simple in government. We want to provide policies and we must provide policies that empower people, that don't restrain them or constrain them from achieving their fullest potential. And I shared earlier one thing I think that is very, very important. We have a kind of have-it-now view in society of what is in the 24-hour news cycle, what is the impact going to be of this decision in the next 24 hours or in the next three months or one year on Wall Street. But those whom we are competing with internationally right now think in terms of generations. They think in a 20- or 30- or 40-year window, what the impact of their policies will be on their children or their grandchildren. If we step back and we take the vision of our Founders or even the vision of some of our leaders in the community, we will prove the fact that those who are forward thinking, who want to see into the future and invest accordingly and make that difference to create opportunity, they are the ones who will be successful. 
   And one of the stories that comes to mind, I am going to end it with a small business, but it began over 20 years ago in Kenton County, Kentucky, in the city of Covington.     
   Covington basically laid in the shadow of Cincinnati. There was residential development up in the hills, but once the great flood levee, as one of the great entrepreneurs in that region shared with me, when the flood levee went up after World War II, much of the business began to leave, the riverfront literally died and the tremendous amount of river commerce. 
   As the decades went by, small businesses began to leave. There was a movement out to the suburbs. Then Interstate 75 came through. Even more business was diverted from downtown and the economy became weaker and weaker. There were less good jobs there, less jobs for the payroll tax base to support community services. 
   As we entered the 1980s and the Reagan tax cuts were beginning to take hold, some interesting things happened. Some business people, some developers, community leaders, had a vision that they could reform the way the city looked, they could change the image of northern Kentucky. 
   It included many people from all different backgrounds. But they agreed on one thing, that they were going to change the direction of their city. They were not going to depend on outside government to do it. They were going to do it themselves, by investing their time and their talent and their treasure in that vision. 
   What began to change was, first of all, a significant change in image. And then a few years ago, the mayor, my friend Butch Callery, who is a Democrat, and I want to say this for our friends at home, for my conservative Republican friends, Butch is a real Democrat, but he is a Democrat who cares deeply about his city, and we worked together, any way we can help with development and growth. 
   He went from being on the city commission into the position of mayor,  leading with this vision of economic development. And he saw two things to do that were very critical. He has developed and empowered a new arts district, where we have artists and artisans who are coming literally from around the Nation to bring their businesses, their galleries and outlets into Covington, Kentucky. The city fathers, 50 years ago it would not have looked anything like it is starting to look right now in development. It is an awesome thing to see happen. 
   But the second thing, and to me the even more exciting thing, is the broad public-private partnership that he has forged, working with the chamber of commerce, working with the State, working with other elected officials and working with the business community and working with the educational community. 
   Getting the proper incentives and then joining with northern Kentucky University and Gateway Technical Community College, he worked to create a project called the Madison E-Zone, an enterprise zone for high technology businesses where there were going to be special opportunities to work together, to network together. And right there, in the urban heart of Covington, they laid this in. 
   The vision is very simple. We want to get the synergy of high technology education. Northern Kentucky University started a School for Informatics. Instead of simply bringing an academic in, though there are many, many competent academics out there, when we deal with high technology, when we deal with information technology, electrical engineering, it is good to have somebody coming from industry, and they brought a man named Bob Farrell, a tremendously successful information technology entrepreneur, to come in and begin running that School for Informatics. They have a School for Entrepreneurship that is also tied into the same venue. 
   Finally, these incentives, working with the local businesses, have created a new knowledge base. That is how Silicon Valley got started in the community around Stanford University. We may is not have Stanford University here. We are starting in a new way with a new vision. But like my colleague to my south, HAL ROGERS, likes to say, we are going to have ``Silicone Holler'' in Kentucky, because we are going to create those technology jobs, and we are not going to see our young people have to leave the State, because now new businesses are not only coming, but they are small businesses, and what is so exciting is they are new businesses that are starting by Kentuckians who have grown up in Kentucky who are educated here and they are creating a future here. 
   One of those companies is Tier 1 Software. It started out when two of the partners, Kevin Moore and Norm Desmarais, reached out. They took that chance. They took that big step to start their business. They began seeking opportunity to do software development, implement the applications that they developed, begin to build that business, beginning to create additional jobs, working alongside the School for Informatics. They began doing work with the Department of Defense. Again, what they are working on is knowledge preservation. 
   My point in bringing this up, it all started note just 2 years ago or 4 years ago, it began with that long-term vision, with an application of policy from the Federal Government to make a difference in development. Here is the challenge. Even these businessmen are inheritors of Ronald Reagan's legacy. 
   When these tax increase Goss into effect in 1,426 days, businesses like Tier 1, companies with startup potential to create jobs in my State for my citizens and my constituents so they don't have to leave are going to go away because of the burdens that will be restored. A regressive burden will be restored with payroll taxes, with income taxes. And also the inability to depreciate or write off investments for hardware, as Congressman Shuster mentioned earlier, are going to go away, and it is going to put a tremendous burden on the economy and our region. 
   I want to see it flourish. I want to see us continue to grow and change and transform and create more taxpayers in the future. That is why progressive tax policy reduces the rates, allows people to keep more of what they earn, and, in the end of the day, we don't burden them unnecessarily. We empower them and free them to build a future for their children.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the academic achievements of two schools in Kentucky's Fourth District. Boyd County Middle School in Ashland and North Oldham Middle School in Goshen were recently recognized by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform as ``Schools to Watch.'' 
   The National Forum selected 59 schools nationwide to receive this prestigious honor. Schools were chosen based on three criteria: academic excellence, responsiveness to the needs and interests of young adolescents, and commitment to helping all students achieve at a high level. 
   Recently, I had the opportunity to meet with educators from these schools during their visit to Washington, DC. I was impressed by the commitment of these educators. And though they face innumerable challenges in their classrooms, they are dedicated to providing each student with the highest quality education possible. I am proud to know that these exceptional teachers are educating future generations of Kentuckians. I applaud their hard work and thank them for their leadership, enthusiasm, and dedication.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to recognize the achievements of Community Christian Academy in Independence, Kentucky. 
   Founded in 1983 by the Community Pentecostal Church, the academy was born out of a strong desire to provide a first-rate education rooted in the fundamentals of Christianity. What began as a small school has grown into one of the most respected private schools in northern Kentucky. 
   The academy offers curriculum from kindergarten through high school. Recent years have seen the school and its facilities grow by leaps and bounds, becoming a fixture in the community. CCA is accredited through the International Christian Accrediting Association and the Non-Public School Commission of Kentucky. 
   The academy is known for its family-oriented atmosphere that emphasizes the participation of the entire family in the education of their 200 students. 
   Recently, CCA was recognized by Cincinnati Magazine as one of the best private high schools in the greater Cincinnati area. This achievement would not be possible without the support of an outstanding staff and faculty, guided by Principal Tara Bates. 
   I am pleased to recognize the achievements of students, parents and educators at the Community Christian Academy. For over 20 years, CCA has produced highly educated students in God's image. Tonight, I would ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing their commitment to excellence in education, dedication to their students and to thank them for their contributions to our community.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of a brave young man from my district who recently lost his life fighting in Iraq. A resident of Ewing, Kentucky, Sergeant John Cooper lost his life in a roadside bomb attack just outside of Mosul. Sergeant Cooper was serving in Iraq with the Army's 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, and was working on security operations in the area. 
   I recently had the opportunity to meet with John Cooper's mother, friends and family. They relayed to me stories of a brave young man who answered the call to duty by joining the Army in 1995 after graduating from Fleming County High School. He served in Iraq from February of 2003 to February of 2004 before being stationed in Korea. 
   In October 2006, he returned on a second tour. His mother, Janice Botkin, told me that her son was living out his life-long dream of serving in the military. She spoke to me of her son's bravery, his dedication and absolute belief in his mission, and by all accounts, Sergeant Cooper was a well-respected member and leader of his unit and his community. 
   Today, as we celebrate the life and memory of this great soldier, my thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant John Cooper's family and friends. The entire Nation is deeply indebted to Sergeant Cooper. We thank him for his service, and we honor him for his ultimate sacrifice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. One of the things I do want to share is I appreciate his leadership on this critical issue that often gets lost in much of the noise that we hear in politics of the moment. 
   As you and I have shared before, what happened on election day, unbeknownst to the vast majority of Americans, is that with the change in majority, every working family in the United States of America voted themselves, or what was voted for was a tax increase of over $2,000 a year for families making between $30,000 and $50,000 a year. 
   We have been in the business world and worked out there creating jobs, and we understand the issues relating to health care. In fact, when we look at the bigger picture from the standpoint of job creation, I think about my oldest daughter who is in her third year of college and has started her practicum now as an education major. She is working 2 days a week in a local high school in our home county teaching. Where is the revenue going to come from to pay for her health insurance, to provide for her future as she teaches students in the generation coming behind? Ultimately, it is going to be job creation and economic growth that comes from policies that will stimulate that and focus on making our economy more competitive for the long term. 
   One of the things that I think you have emphasized is that the government is the best steward of money. The American people should be able to keep more of their own money, and we have proven time and time again, by allowing people to keep more of their own money and creating taxpayers instead of raising taxes, we actually get more revenue into the Federal Government. 
   One of the things I would like to read into the record tonight which is very important for some of these policy discussions was an editorial in the Wall Street Journal regarding surging revenues, and I think it is important to note when we create taxpayers and don't raise taxes, government will have the revenue that is necessary to function. There is a fundamental world view difference between the parties on the role of government. Liberal Democrats believe the government needs to be paternalistic in telling us how to run our lives to make these decisions. 
   The reality is that by allowing people to keep more of their own money, which is a bedrock Republican principle, we will make sure that people can make the decision on the spot, they understand the impact of that. 
   I look back at the time when I started my business. I look back on the decisions we had to make, and we understood everything in terms of the cost that we had, the obligations that we had to our employees, the commitments that we made to each other to keep that money, moving forward to keep us employed to strengthen the business. At the same time, that was when President Clinton in 1993, our first full year in business, allowed us to make an investment in the government that dramatically increased the taxes not for me and the company, but for every member of our team. I think about all of those literally hundreds of thousands of dollars over the following decade. Had those been allowed to stay there, that would not have been simply revenue that the government lost, it would have been more employees, more people who would have been out there generating revenue and creating jobs and helping to keep our economy strong. 
   This editorial that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on January 17 highlights this and talks about the surging of revenues. What we need to do from the standpoint of Congress is to empower people, not to constrain them. 
   It says, ``The myth persists in some media circles that the Federal budget deficiency is surging or ballooning or something terrible, all of which is served up as ammunition for those in Congress who want a tax increase.'' 
   As an aside, I make a parenthetical statement and say we are now a little over 1,400 days away from a very, very large tax increase that will happen unless Congress takes action. 
   ``At the risk of being drummed out of the guild, we thought you'd rather have the real story. 
   ``The deficit has in fact declined by some $165 billion over the last 2 fiscal years, and according to the most recent data has continued to fall in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The latest Treasury estimates for January show that tax receipts in December were $18 billion higher than a year earlier, helping to boost the budget surplus for the month to $40 billion, up from $11 billion a year ago. December is typically a good month for revenues due to year-end tax payments. 
   ``Meanwhile, for the first 3 months of fiscal 2007 through December, revenues climbed 8.1 percent, building on double-digit revenue increases in the previous 2 years. Corporate income taxes were up a remarkable 22.2 percent in the first fiscal quarter, showing that the government continues to grab a nice chunk of rising business profits that so many of our politicians like to deplore. Individual income taxes rose 8.8 percent, thanks to strong wage and salary growth. Much of this revenue comes from `the rich,' believe it or not. 
   ``In the most surprising budget news, Federal spending was nearly flat in the first fiscal quarter. This was despite a 22.1 percent increase in Medicare spending due largely to the new prescription drug benefit, and a 10.7 percent increase in defense spending. Those increases were offset by lower spending for flood insurance and disaster assistance compared with the peaks of post-Katrina payments a year ago. So the first quarter deficit was $85 billion, down sharply from $119 billion a year earlier. 
   ``All in all, despite huge outlays for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Nation's fiscal picture is brightening. We hate to ruin the press corps's day with such cheerful news, but there it is.'' 
   That article shows clearly this contrast between the perception that is created with the politics of fear, the politics of class warfare, and what I would like to call the politics of reality and truth. The one thing that we need to remember is the ultimate key to the economic success to our children and their children in the future is not going to be big government, it is not going to be large solutions and increases in taxes, taking away that extra benefit that working families have, but it is going to be allowing them to keep more of their own money. 
   I think it is critical that we do this. It is critical to funding many of the programs that we do, be it defense, be it education, ultimately comes from somebody who has a job who is not a government employee, somebody out there in the economy creating a job to make that difference and provide that revenue by adding that value that funds all of the critical infrastructure. 
   Our goal must be to create taxpayers, not raise new taxes. And I think the one thing that we see, and it is one thing that I appreciate my colleague from Pennsylvania taking great leadership on this issue, is to shine a light of truth onto the fact that the Democrats are going to raise taxes. They are committed to that. We are a little over 1,400 days away from that taking place  if Congress does not act, and it is critical that we act to preserve this one thing that has generated so much revenue for the government that allows us to bring the deficit down and control spending and ultimately provide a future for our children.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. And I would add one point on that. We have 10 times that number of folks in my district in Kentucky. I think there is a bit of a double standard on Samoa, too. Though they would be given the vote on the ability to raise taxes, they were denied the fairness on the minimum wage that the Speaker had programmed in for a large company in her district to ensure there would be a double standard. 
   I think one of the things that is important to understand from somebody who worked in manufacturing after my military life is, and I have talked to many workers in the energy industry in my own district, they are dismayed, regardless of their party, be they Republican, Democrat, union, nonunion, to find out that this legislation that the Democrats passed last week, I would say forced through without regular order and debate, without discussing the impact on working families, to find that the energy industry is not manufacturing.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. To the gentleman from Texas' point, my constituents, who are members of the International Boilermakers, from a bipartisan standpoint, we have a positive and proactive relationship with our boilermakers and our professional trades in the Fourth District of Kentucky. But it is my boilermakers, my pipe fitters, my millwrights and steelworkers, ironworkers, my operating engineers, my Teamsters, anybody who is affiliated in the energy industry is no longer considered in manufacturing. 
   What that means for the average working family is a hidden tax increase, because the tax credits that would go for training and professional development, that would relate to a provision of health care, nearly 80 percent of manufacturing employees are covered with full health benefits. In my company we covered every single family with health benefits. The economic incentives are now removed, and it is no different than treating those in our critical bedrock base industry that drives not only manufacturing, drives the automotive industry, drives utilities, drives the transportation infrastructure of this Nation, is now being told they are not manufacturing, they are not value added. Somehow they are a nemesis. 
   Again, I come back to the fact of this issue of class-warfare politics. Who gets affected by the tax increases that are buried in that bill? It is not a simple issue of trying to say these are tax breaks for some nebulous, super-rich oil executives. Here is what happens: The entire supply chain is affected. This does not hurt the large international global energy producers, the international oil companies. Who does it hurt? It hurts our wildcatters for natural gas, our small natural gas producers, our small oil producers, the investors. It hurts the supply chain of manufacturing and fabrication industry that supports the oil industry. 
   Outside of any refinery, one will find a very large base of welding, fabrication, machine tool operations, toolmaking, maintenance. Then we have around that circle there the provision of parts, the supply chain of manufacturers' representatives for components that come into the industry. And then who else is affected by that? It is the small business owner. It is the distributor of gasoline and oil and energy products. It is the parts manufacturer for vehicles. It is the convenience store operator who is affected by that. 
   And ultimately all of these people who I have mentioned so far in the chain are taxpayers. They are contributing to the public welfare and public infrastructure. Who is going to be lost when we lose those taxpayers because we eliminate those jobs by what seems to be a good thing on the surface but is very hurtful? We are eliminating funding, in effect, that provides for law enforcement, provides money for education, and provides money to deal with transportation and infrastructure, that funds the operation of government. And ultimately it is a regressive issue and it comes back it your fundamental point: When we leave money in the hands of taxpayers, they will invest it, they will save it, or they will spend it in such a way that we create taxpayers and we don't need to raise taxes, and I think the numbers bear that out.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. If the gentleman would yield on one point to emphasize this. Again, I come back to the issue of the politics of fear versus the politics of hope and a practical and truthful vision of what the future is. 
   Again, I come back to my real-world experience in manufacturing, which wasn't as a Democrat or a Republican, it was simply as an operations person. The average manufacturing company in this country, gross profit is about 7 percent per year if they are successful. That is an important thing to understand, if they are successful. 
   The oil companies who right now are achieving record profits and are being portrayed as these great robber barons, and I am going to come back to my district here in just a minute, are making slightly over 8 percent gross profit. So they are 1 percent higher than the average manufacturing company in terms of truthful and real numbers versus the hype, versus the rhetoric and the emotion. 
   Who actually gets hurt by this foolish bill that was passed last week on a motion without regular order? Democratic friends of mine shared privately they are extremely upset about the fact of adverse economic impact that it had on their districts. I can tell you the impact on our district. One of our larger employers in the Fourth District of Kentucky, the Marathon refinery, which has many, many first- and second-tier vendors that do work with them, this was a huge tax increase on their ability to refine and produce oil that directly affects our transportation industry. Their largest customer in Kentucky is the worldwide air hub of United Parcel Service, a great job creator in the Louisville area. It is one of the largest employers in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, really in the tristate area. 
   So what was done by this seemingly well-meaning issue to support energy independence has actually hurt a local job-producing entity and affected the entire supply chain. And I think the one thing that to me the reality is not the hype, not the emotion, not the class warfare, but it is the old comment: Do the numbers. What are the real numbers? What is the impact? 
   A job-creating manufacturing entity, a job-creating technology entity will have a 3-1 multiplier for its community on average. That is the convenience stores, the retail outlets, the personal service companies. It is the other types of businesses that supports the public infrastructure, law enforcement, education, transportation and public works.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. The property tax base that pays for the schools. In my home county, which has got a growing and thriving manufacturing industry, that payback is 7-1. One of the reasons we have some of the top schools in the Commonwealth of Kentucky is the fact that we have a tremendously powerful economic engine that ironically is directly affected by energy prices and access. 
   One of the issues in this so-called bill, which was really a tax increase. Calling it energy independence is not only disingenuous, and maybe that points back to the discussion which took place earlier this evening in the House, but it really misrepresents the entire reality of what is happening.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I think one thing to put into perspective is the real question, what I like to do is come back to the facts and the numbers. 
   There is a lot of talk about, again, the politics of fear, the politics of class warfare, who actually will be rewarded or hurt by these tax cuts or tax increases. Here is the reality in a practical sense. 
   The tax cuts that have been put in place have created record revenues for government because of job creation. Millions of people were taken off of the tax rolls all together. The floor for tax payments was pushed upward. The 10 percent tax bracket was created for those who are just starting out, those who are just in transition, so their burden would not be unduly high. All of that goes away. What are some other things that go away? 
   One of the things that I think is kind of interesting, as somebody who is the grandson of a teacher, the husband of a teacher and the father of a soon-to-be-certified teacher, how does it impact education? Well, let us look at this. 
   We passed an extension in the last Congress, carrying on above-the-line deduction for higher education expenses. The provision allows taxpayers to deduct up to $4,000 depending upon their income for higher education expenses to improve their lives in lieu of claiming the hope or lifetime learning tax credits. The deduction can be claimed by all individual taxpayers regardless of whether they itemize and use specific deductions or do not itemize, and it is extended for 2 years through 2007. 
   The incoming chairman of the Ways and Means Committee put this, along with an entire bushel basket of tax incentives for working families, for people to improve their lives, and that goes away. For teachers, we passed an above-the-line deduction that became law for teacher classroom expenses. 
   I remember when I was a young officer in the Army and my wife was teaching school. She paid for a tremendous amount of classroom expenses out of her own pocket because she cared about her students and wanted to invest. 
   What is the response of the Republican Congress to that was to give them the incentive to invest and to know that that will not be a personal penalty for them to make that investment in their children, to make that investment in their future. It is a provision that allows teachers to deduct up to $250 of out-of-pocket costs incurred to purchase books, supplies and other classroom equipment. It is available to all individual taxpayers, regardless of whether they itemize their deductions or not. 
   This provision was extended for 2 years through 2007. That is in that bushel basket of things that go away when we enact these tax policies, these tax cuts that ultimately will be in full force in 1,440 days. 
   As a former small business owner who helped companies to create jobs in the manufacturing industry and operations, we dealt with many entry-level people. People would come in with difficult tasks or in transition. We passed a welfare-to-work tax credit that would incent small business owners and employers to create jobs, to give people a leg up, to give them an opportunity to create value, to become a taxpayer, not a burden on the system, to create a future for their children. 
   Employers can claim that welfare-to-work tax credit if they hire individuals who receive public assistance to help them move from a receiver to a giver. The maximum credit is $3,500 during an employee's first year and $5,000 during the second year. That incentive for small business owners goes away with this. 
   All of these small things, these numbers that are hidden from the American people out of this politics of fear get lost in this whole issue, and ultimately, we need to allow people to keep more of what they earn to create that future. 
   I appreciate your leadership on this issue greatly.

   Both Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania and I were small business owners. We have lived out in the real world. We are not attorneys.

   Bill and I have heard literally hundreds of stories since the first of the year. We would like to hear yours. You can communicate with us directly at Countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. That is Countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. 
   At the end of the day, I believe that the key principle that we have shared over and over and over again is that our focus and the focus of the government is that the government cannot create value or wealth for people. What the government can do, done rightly, is create a playing field and a framework to unleash the creativity in the American people, to give them the opportunity to pursue their dreams, to pursue a future, to build a future for themselves, and ultimately we start that process by making sure that people can keep more of what they earn. 
   When you have control over your money, you are going to invest it in such a way that it makes a difference for you, your family, ultimately for your community and the country. That is why we say we want to create taxpayers, not raise taxes. 
   It has been a few weeks since we were able to get together here on the floor  as we have been counting the days since our first session the second week of January when we began sharing what was ahead. We predicted at that time that there would be tax increases coming. 
   Much of the change in the election was not driven by fiscal policy. It was driven by anger or resentment or emotion related to the national security situation. But as people are waking up, I am traveling in different parts of my district, many folks upset about that said, ``I didn't realize I was voting for a tax increase.'' In fact, what was voted on in the House last month with was the largest tax increase in American history. 
   My friends, that is not a solution to the country's challenges. By raising taxes, we limit opportunity. By raising taxes, money comes out of our communities, it comes out of working families' pockets, it comes to bureaucrats in Washington. 
   When some of my colleagues on the other side made comments about wanting to reduce the deficit and spending, they didn't want to reduce spending. What in fact they wanted to do was reduce defense spending, but not reduce spending on other programs. Indeed, that spending has increased under this budget. What we are looking at over 5 years is an estimated $900 billion tax increase. That is going to be devastating to the economy. 
   In Kentucky alone, I come from a district that is very diverse with agriculture, manufacturing, distribution, logistics. We have river industries. We have the largest inland port in North America with the Port of Ashland-Huntington, where much of our Nation's energy supply transits. Our average working family in Kentucky is going to see a tax increase of $2,563, right off the bottom line. When I think what we could do with that, I have got my second child going into college now, I think of what we could do with $2,500 is immense. 
   We look at the counterpoint, I look to the gentleman's point earlier regarding what happened when taxes were cut by President Kennedy, what happened when taxes were cut by President Reagan, what happened when taxes were cut by President Bush and the Republican Congress at that time, at a very difficult period in this Nation's history as we entered into war, just prior to the 9/11 attacks. There was a recession in 2001 that was inherited from the prior administration. 
   What we have seen is record revenues to the Federal Government by reducing taxes. By raising the ceiling, in fact pushing the burden upward on taxes and reducing the burden on working class families, taking millions of people off the tax rolls, by creating a 10 percent tax bracket, has resulted in the creation of 7.5 million jobs, record revenues to the Federal Government, and that done in a time of war. What that tells me is that these principles work; that Republican, conservative fiscal 
   principles work by allowing people to keep more of their own money. 
   My question in fact to folks is if you had to write that $2,500 check, what do you want to get in return for that? At the end of the day, we want to get something that is going to make a difference for our family, our community and our country, and not fuel empty rhetoric, particularly spending on programs that aren't necessarily going to add any value. 
   180,000 jobs were created in March alone. As we travel throughout our districts, I hear stories in a wide variety of industries, many of them I have shared here on various evenings as we have come back to Washington, D.C., the successes that people have had by being allowed to keep more of their own money and build a future in their hometown, in the heartland, and not send it to bureaucrats far away. 
   I would like to invite my colleagues from Texas, Congressman Conaway and Mr. Shuster, to continue the dialogue with some of these examples. But if you just joined us again, we are the Countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. We would like to hear your stories. We would like to hear your testimonials, how it has made a difference for you in creating jobs and small businesses in our local communities where 88 percent of all new jobs created in this country come from. 
   It is not going to come from giant corporations. It is certainly not going to be created from liberal policies of the folks on the other side of the aisle. It comes by you producing your future, chasing your vision and investing your dollars to build that. 
   With that, I yield back to the gentleman.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (AMERICA FACES LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN HISTORY -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I go back to Yogi Berra's old saying about deja vu all over again. You talk about what the right tax rate is and how do we explain it to the American people. I think it would be helpful if the Democrats would simply tell the truth. 
   The reason I lay this out, as a former small business owner, I remember in 1992 being told stories by then-candidate Bill Clinton how he was not going to raise taxes. President Bush at the time made the statement that Clinton ran saying he wouldn't raise taxes, and then turned around and made a deal that raised taxes, damaged 
   his credibility and hurt the economy at the time. 
   I was getting ready to step out into the entrepreneurial world and leave the software industry to start my own business. I had manufacturing clients that wanted me and eventually some of the folks that I hired to work with me and assist them in improving their competitiveness nationally. We started that business in late spring of 1992, getting it up off the ground. We managed to feed our families that first 6 months and do all right in that time, but our real opportunity was going to come in 1993. 
   All of a sudden after Mr. Clinton became President, he came before the American people and he didn't say I am going to keep my promise and cut those taxes because we know that allowing people to keep more of their own money creates a future for them. He offered me a new alternative as a new small business owner with employees, with health plans to pay for, with taxes to pay for, with regulatory fees to pay for, dealing with workmen's compensation and disability and costs that I had never known in the large corporate world, and he invited me to invest in the United States Government. 
   I looked at this as a small business owner and a former military officer. I thought my investment in the United States Government should be first in providing for the national defense, how was I going to promote the general welfare as the Constitution would ask us to do, I would hope in infrastructure, in projects that were going to be seed money to create more jobs and to stimulate the economy in our area. But what did we get, the largest tax increase in American history at that time, actually a fraction of the one that was passed in this recent liberal Democratic budget. 
   We reduced the size of our military and we weakened national defense by taking several divisions out of the standing Army, reducing the size of the Marine Corps, reducing the size of the Navy, reducing the airlift capability in the Air Force. 
   We increased spending in social programs. We increased the mandatory spending rate in social programs to nearly twice the rate of inflation while shorting our men and women in uniform in the mid-1990s as an administration priority. 
   Then radical Islamic extremism intruded itself upon the United States on 9/11. We had been dealing with it before then, but like the old saying of the Purlator man commercial, ``you pay me now or you pay me later.'' 
   Now we are in a big catch-up situation from a national security standpoint of things that could have been handled 10 years ago. 
   I think back as a small business owner, what were the costs that were taken away when I invested in the government? Well, the additional tax money, we saw no benefit of that. I saw my clients hurt. I saw manufacturing companies hurt, and I saw other machine tool companies hurt by increased environmental compliance and the increased cost of regulation. And the attempts to manage health care from a national perspective actually drove costs up. In Kentucky, by doing a plan that was called Hillary-lite, something that was a lesser plan of the Democrat health care proposals of that same year of 1993, we drove 45 of 47 insurance carriers out of the State, quadrupled the cost of health care for small business owners in a relatively short period of time. To me that was the opposite of the original intent. 
   If I invest in something, I would like to see a return. If we spend money in our community, we would like to see a benefit accrue for our community and it certainly didn't happen there. 
   Just on the taxes that we paid, and we don't know where they went to support all of these programs with this increased investment, we could have hired probably three more consultants or nearly a third larger workforce which would have created more taxpayers and which would have been helping more businesses to compete and would have been putting more dollars into the Federal treasury. 
   But on the other hand, now we found ourselves at the end of the Clinton administration needing to come out of a recession. We have reduced taxes and we have moved to simplify regulation. But because of the actions last November, I believe that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle sincerely but incorrectly have interpreted that election as another opportunity to affirm their desire to have small business owners invest. 
   And the truth of the matter is that if 88 percent of our jobs are created by small businesses owners, the last thing we want to do is tax those who are going to be starting those companies and starting those family enterprises. 
   Again, in 1,335 days from now the average family in my State will have a $2,563 tax increase. You mentioned the 50 percent increase that is coming for those in the 10 percent tax bracket. That benefited 1.2 million people in my State, but let's look at senior citizens. 
   My mom lives on a fixed income right now. She draws Social Security and her retirement. Fortunately, she has a supplemental Medicare insurance plan to help offset some of the additional cost. 
   But if you take an elderly couple with a $40,000 income, their tax bill is going to rise 156 percent in 2011 from $583 to $1,489. So we have helped them reduce the average cost of their prescription medication by $1,200, but we will increase their taxes by $1,400 by what the Democratic Congress intends to do by simply not doing anything. 
   They are going to allow these cuts which have had so much positive impact on the communities and the country expire.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I think the one thing that gets lost in all this, too, I remember when I was young and I did a little work on the side when I was first in the aerospace industry and I thought it was so great to make a little bit of extra money basically to pay for Christmas, and when I went in to do my taxes the following spring, I found out that at the very low-income level I was at, because it was independent contractor work, that heralded the alternative minimum tax and almost made it not worthwhile to have expended the many hours that I did on the project. 
   I think what gets lost, what Mike was reading here, I still am marvelling that our tax dollars paid to create such a behemoth, that we were investing in something like that, which gave me a headache just listening to it. Although I could see the goose bumps there. 
   But other than being a job creation program for accountants, most of whom do not like the complexity of many of these rules because of what it does to their clients, I think we need to look at a more human side of the impact that regressive taxes have. By reducing taxes, by allowing people to keep more of their own money, it created jobs, over 7 million jobs. It has kept our money local. 
   I think that one of the things I would like to point to for folks here who are watching the Countdown Crew, and you can contact us at countdowncrew@mail.house.gov, we want to create taxpayers, not raise taxes. By creating taxpayers, there will be more revenues that go for all of our communities. 
   But at the local level, oftentimes the question comes up and I hear it from children a lot in the schools who go around talking with my own kids, Daddy, where do the police come from, where do the school teachers come from, where does the library come from. Ultimately, that comes from our local communities, from taxes. It is property taxes in the vast majority of our taxes that pay for our schools. 
   My oldest daughter is about to graduate from college soon, and she is going to become a schoolteacher and getting ready to move out into the economy and very excited on the one hand, but also concerned about the tax structure that is going to be facing her and the incentives to advance her education, the burdens that are going to be placed upon her just from what she has seen in the workforce. The quality of our schools is largely funded by local jobs in our communities that pay those property taxes, people who can buy homes, and if you do not have a job, it becomes very difficult to make that investment in a home. 
   If we do not have small business owners creating jobs, we are not going to have those local taxes to be able to make the investments that are necessary in public safety, in public works, that keeps the water running in our house, that keeps the electricity moving, that keeps our roads paved and being able to expand and ultimately to be able to invest in quality of life in our communities.     
   This is one of the reasons we have this 1,335-day countdown to the largest tax increase in history, that the American people need to know that when they can keep more of their own money, there are results. I don't want to see the average Kentucky family have an unnecessary tax increase of $2,563. We will find the benefit, not in complex tax documents like that, but simply by allowing people to keep their money to invest in the future to follow their vision and ultimately to build that nest egg for their children.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (THE COUNTDOWN CREW: COUNTDOWN TO THE TAX INCREASE BY THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Thank you, BILL. I appreciate the leadership you have taken on this issue. The one thing that our group is consistent in is all of us have come from the small business world. All of us have come from that arena that creates the jobs in America, pursuing a vision, pursuing opportunity. 
   For those who have just joined us, you have joined the Countdown Crew. You can join us at countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. We have gotten thousands of e-mails from around the United States based on the first few evenings that we have been talking about the impact of positive, progressive, pro-growth economic policies that allow working families to keep more of what they own and create incentives for small businesses. 
   As we go into the time right now, the reason we are called the Countdown Crew is because of the fact that unless legislation is passed to extend the tax cuts that have been so bountiful and so beneficial to the American people, to the United States economy, in creating millions of jobs, those tax cuts will expire at the end of 2010 and every working family in the United States is going to receive a tax increase. 
   And 1,398 days from now, there will be a tax increase on every working family. A family of four making between $30,000 and $50,000 a year will have a $2,092 tax increase imposed upon them. That doesn't come with additional legislation being passed. In fact, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from New York, has said that he is not going to introduce any tax legislation to extend those tax cuts and they will expire. So for everybody watching tonight, your tax bill is going to go up by a minimum of $2,000. 
   When you think about what that means, let's look at the other side, the positive side of the Republican policy, the conservative policy of allowing people to keep more of what they earn. 
   First, by keeping more of what you earn, it is invested in causes that are important for you, whether it is put into your home, whether it is put into your family, whether it is saved for education, whether it is invested in a new car, in clothing. We can think about any wide variety of issues, but those are the dollars that fuel the economy. 
   I believe very firmly we see it in the numbers, that when people are allowed to keep their own money in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks by extending those cuts in a time of war, that we have seen unprecedented economic growth take place in this country and a recovery that shows right now industrial productivity, our 
   manufacturing productivity in the United States, is at an all-time record high, which is an amazing thing as the United States economy continues to churn along. In fact, the growth that has taken place in the United States economy in the last 3 years is greater than the entire economic output of China, which is the largest potential economic competitor to us in the long run. 
   The reason that I share this is because it has made a difference in the lives of ordinary people. When folks are allowed to keep more of what they earn, they are going to make sure that those dollars are accomplishing things  for their family, especially over the long term. 
   I would like to tell one story as we begin tonight that I think typifies the success that can be seen by allowing people to keep more of their own money. As BILL said, this is not a partisan issue. John Kennedy cut taxes and had economic growth take off and record revenues come into the Treasury. We have allowed people to keep more of what they earned, and what happened this past year, record revenues have come into the United States Treasury. And the real issue is controlling spending, not taking more of people's hard-earned dollars. 
   Well, pursuing that vision was something that BILL SHUSTER has done. It was something that I did back in the early 1990s starting my business, helping our manufacturing companies compete and keep their jobs here in the United States. 
   One person who I would like to highlight tonight, a man who has become my friend, but also somebody who pursued that vision himself, was a man named George Hammond. He runs Hammond's Automotive. He started with its first operation in Covington, Kentucky, over 20 years ago. He took that chance that many Americans take to pursue the American Dream. 
   He started off with a mechanics shop. The reason that his automotive shop grew in customers was not by popular advertising, it wasn't by media, it was by word of mouth, because the character of George and all the folks who worked with him demonstrated a desire to care for their customers and to make a difference, and they got more business and they grew. They opened a body shop. 
   Suddenly, the things that they began to encounter were the regulatory system that was increasing costs upon them as they were repairing cars. But even with that, he continued to grow beyond the impact of the regulatory system, hiring more people. 
   As a result of the tax policy that has taken place over the last 6 years, where people are allowed to keep more of their own money, unlike sending it to bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., where we may not know how it is going to be spent, George took that and he reinvested it. He reinvested it in his people, in training, and most recently opened another business in Burlington, Kentucky, moving out into the suburbs from Covington where he is reaching more and more people, all by word of mouth, and there a following that is going with that. 
   But I don't know what would have happened to George Hammond if he did not have that flexibility, if he had the tax increase that is coming down the road at the end of 2010, in 1,398 days. He probably wouldn't have had that opportunity to grow his business and create that opportunity. 
   But instead of raising taxes, we have created taxpayers with this policy. This is a family-friendly policy. That is a policy that allows people to pay for college tuition. It allows them to invest in their children's future. And for George Hammond, not only did it benefit him, but it benefited all of the employees, now going into a second generation of employees with three different business units that are creating jobs, creating a future for folks right there in Boone County and in Kenton County, Kentucky.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I think the one thing that he has experienced, too, the discussions that we have had when I have taken my F-250 pickup truck in or our Chevy Astro van to get worked on, the one thing we talk about is health insurance. And I remember as a small business owner having to deal with the issues of the high cost of health insurance, dealing with tax policies. He has gone the extra mile to help his people, probably similar to some the experiences that you have had.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I think that is a great point. George is an institution in the community. The one thing is that his attitude toward service has spiraled down to his employees, to their vendors, and that kind of dedication and devotion is I think not necessarily found in the very large corporations that are out there. It is those small businesses, like you say, that are connected. 
   For those folks who are watching, we invited you to join the Countdown Crew. You can contact us at countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. We encourage you to tell us your stories, your thoughts, your desires for policy. 
   In particular, what we are seeing over and over again in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of messages that are shared back to us is the impact of a positive economic policy that allows people to keep more of what they earn. What we have coming, if we don't take action, if the House doesn't pass legislation by the end of 2010, every working family in this country is going to have a $2,092 increase. So many benefits are going away. 
   What we want to do is keep positive policies that empower people, create jobs, and create a future. 
   With that, I yield back to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. One thing I would highlight, a few examples to share just from back in our district, and feel free to jump in with your experiences from Pennsylvania, growing up in the Ohio Valley and seeing our industry having problems competing, I know one of the choices I had when I left high school was to go in the mills or go in the military. I am so glad I went in the military because when I came back years later, those mills were gone. The environment had changed dramatically, and expectations had changed dramatically. 
   The people who are allowed to keep more of what they earn are going to invest it locally and invest it in their family. As our dollars stay in our community, there is going to be increased opportunity. 
   In northern Kentucky where I live, in Kentucky's Fourth District, which runs on the south side of the Ohio River, right across from Cincinnati, we have one of the largest air hubs in North America, the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport. Being in Kentucky, we are very proud of the fact that Cincinnati's airport is located in the great commonwealth of Kentucky, but there is a story which affects the Tristate area in a profound way that has taken place over the past couple of years. 
   Delta Airlines, one of the great flagship carriers of this country, has a major international hub located there. They also have a home grown regional carrier, Comair, which started out as a small commuter airline, which has grown into quite a presence. 
   They have gone through a very, very tough time over 
   the past several years, since 9/11, dealing with the fluctuations in fuel prices and the issues of security costs, the challenges that have been faced in the economy turning around. The tax cuts that have been so beneficial to America's families that have created 7 million new jobs, that have allowed people to keep more of what they earn, on average between $2,000 and $3,000 per family in this country, has had a direct impact on this company. 
   The reason I want to highlight Delta and Comair and all of the businesses in our region, they have gone to great lengths to sacrifice and do something different than other airlines have. Rather than cutting their pensions for the expediency of institutional investors on Wall Street or other creditors, they worked with their creditors and all of their vendors not only to keep the airline going at a world class level, but to make sure that they kept their benefits and pension plans in place for their employees. 
   The commitment of the employees have been so great through all of this. Many of them have made tremendous sacrifices. The one thing I can see is that these employees who are making 40 percent or less than what they were making 1 year ago, 2 years ago, are now suddenly faced with not only having substantial reduction in their income to keep their job moving, but, in 1,398 days, according to this regressive policy, they are going to have an additional $2,092 on average added on top of those families. 
   I think it is entirely unreasonable because the impact can ripple all of the way across the economy, not only in terms of demands on those families, but the consuming families, some of the ways people spend that money, is travel. They travel for business. They buy products from companies that fuel that business travel economy. One of the great gateways to Florida, people traveling to vacation in the south from different parts of the United States, are flying on low-cost fares from Delta through Cincinnati and other gateways in the region. And that $2,000 on average per family will have an impact on that aspect of the economy, too. 
   You might ask, why are you bringing this up? Our economy is so complex, so interconnected, we are so interdependent on one another, by having a significant impact on one side will eventually have an impact on the other side. It is kind of an economic butterfly effect, not in the extreme like the proposition in chaos theory, but it will create a lot of chaos in our economy. 
   Another benefit I will share, I have a very good friend who is head of the Manufacturers Association, a committed, small business community executive, named Rick Jordan, who is chairman of the board of our Gateway Technical Community College which focuses on advanced manufacturing and information technology education to train our next generation workforce. 
   He is also the president of LSI Industries, which does extremely innovative engineering for lighting systems and retail display systems. One of the companies that has been driven by an increase in consumption in a very literal and physical sense is a big client of theirs, is Dairy Queen. Because people have had a little more discretionary income, they are able to meet their needs, and they want to take their family out for that treat, that hamburger, that ice cream. It just doesn't end there. When they hit the drive-through and they get that Blizzard for their kids, then it starts through the supply change and works its way back.  
   LSI, being one of our premier businesses in the Cincinnati-North Kentucky area, has their employees manufacturing all of the signage for all of the Dairy Queens in this competitive environment in the entire country. They won that contract because of the increased growth that has taken place when, over the last 4 years, when the full impact of this positive tax policy has been felt. 
   As we share other stories, I think those are two, one from manufacturing, from the leisure industry, from transportation, from the restaurant industry, which show this connectedness.

   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. I think you have hit the nail right on the head there, and for those who just joined us, you are watching the Countdown Crew. You can contact us at countdowncrew@mail.house.gov. We come to the floor the first night of every vote to talk about the positive impacts of tax policies that let people keep more of what they earn, keep more of what they own by default, and ultimately create the jobs and create a future for folks here. 
   Most folks do not realize that with the vote that took place, changing the House's Congress in 2006, put us on the clock for a tax increase that will come. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the tax-writing committee in the House, has said that there is no tax cut that he sees that is worth keeping. 
   I think that shows a blindness to the dramatic economic impacts that have hit where we are at all-time manufacturing productivity and all-time low unemployment that is remarkable in these times, that we have created 7 million new jobs. What is going to happen in 1,398 days is a tax increase that will hit the average working family in this country with a $2,092 tax increase, and that will happen without any legislation being introduced. 
   The way the prior tax cuts were drawn, we would extend them every 2 years. That extension right now appears to not be happening. On behalf of the Countdown Crew, we would encourage you to write your Member of Congress to encourage your Member for the district that is represented by you watching at home to make sure that those are extended. 
   More than that, we would like to hear your stories, if you would send to us countdowncrew@mail.house.gov and tell us what you have done with that additional money. We have heard stories of folks who have been able to meet personal needs, start businesses and create jobs. The goal of a constructive government policy related to revenue is not to raise taxes, not to create taxes for their own sake, but to create taxpayers to have an empowering policy that lets people work, pursue their vision, and pursue opportunity in the long run. 
   Probably one of the most interesting stories that I can share I think has a little bit of humor in it. If we go to a shopping mall in the United States right now, you can look out and see there is always a group of kids somewhere in the mall, the Goth group, that is dressed in black, black shirts, black shoes, black pants, black hair, black garments that they will have on them. 
   There is a little secret that I will share with America's youth and the Goth movement tonight. The color black, the person who owned the patent on the color black comes from the Fourth District of Kentucky. A brilliant chemical energy engineer named Bill Stoeppel some years ago discovered that there was a real problem in manufacturing waste in paints and in dyes for clothing and paint for the automotive industry. He developed a unique solution dispersion to carry the graphite that would be that color black. He named his little company Solution Dispersions. He took the idea from the experience that he had. He ended up buying a company that at one point he worked for. He started another facility in this business and it grew. He had an exclusivity, made a very, very small profit on processing this graphite for the large coatings and coloring companies that support our manufacturing industry around the United States. 
   Right there, in Cynthiana, Kentucky, is the headquarters of the color black. The reason I bring that up is there is one person, one man, who has created hundreds of jobs in different parts of the country and also is fueling a supply chain at a reduced cost to be able to compete not only domestically but  internationally as well, with strong and high-quality products. 
   He did not just stop there and bury his money in the ground. The profits that he made he reinvested in his community. He was one of the people that you had alluded to earlier when you talked about Harold. Well, Bill was one of those pillars of the community that worked with the hospital and the school system, was somebody that was active in the Rotary Club, made sure that the hospital board had resources and assets, and he also invested back in the land, a personal love of his. He was ranching quality, very high quality grade, again creating more jobs and opportunity and participating in the consumption economy. 
   Many of those opportunities literally have the chance to go away on December 31, 2007. When we talk about tax policy, oftentimes there is a misnomer, this class warfare idea, that it is always the super-rich who get off or the rich who get off and do not pay their burden, that it is always unfairly pushed down on working families and on the poor. 
   The truth of the matter is with these tax cuts the ceiling was actually moved up. The burden was moved up. Millions were taken off the tax rolls. A new tax bracket was created for 10 percent which will disappear, a transitional tax bracket for those who were coming into the workforce, who are moving upward. 
   There is a $1,000 child tax credit that is coming. Just in my family alone, when that went from $500, and that was set a long time ago when $500 had a different value in the economy than it does now, to $1,000 that made a difference. Patty and I have six children. Right there that is a $3,000 tax increase to my family that will take place at the end of 2010. 
   The marriage penalty is going to be restored, and I think practically the one thing that we must do is make sure that we have policy that is friendly to families, that encourages jobs, and encourages and strengthens the family. By putting the marriage penalty back in place, it actually makes it more profitable to be single, and I think that flies in the face of our American values here. 
   You mentioned the estate tax earlier. It is a pernicious tax that confiscates money from families once that money has already been taxed. It is not the super, super-rich of the world, the Bill Gateses of the world, the multibillionaires of the world. They are not the ones that are going to have to worry about paying that. It is the small business owners who have capital-intensive businesses. It is going to be farmers, small manufacturers that have the most dramatic negative effect from that. 
   We had one took place in my county that is a perfect example of this, a farmer. When the patriarch died, they did not understand. They loved farming. They wanted to focus on that business. They did not understand the impact of an estate tax, having a farm in a growing county with appreciating real estate values. Because they had gotten some incomplete legal advice, they came to find out that they literally were going to have to sell half of a farm that had been in the family for five generations because they wanted to keep farming just to pay the tax bill. I think that flies in the face of American values. It flies in the face of creating opportunities.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (THE COUNTDOWN CREW: COUNTDOWN TO THE TAX INCREASE BY THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. One of the things that relates to that, too, is that money just does not end at the personal savings account or even at the grocery store, the auto shop or dealership, or the Dairy Queen for that matter, as we mentioned earlier. 
   There are others who are very, very dependent upon the benefits, the profits of these small businesses, the revenue from salaries, from jobs that are created, and that is all of our public servants. 
   I have a daughter who is now doing her student teaching practicum. She is  getting ready to go out and become a public school teacher in our district. Her salary ultimately is paid by the salaries of those who are employed, who own houses, who have jobs, who can contribute to the payroll tax in the community. Our policemen, our world-class law enforcement that we have, is funded. All the training that they receive is funded by taxpayer dollars that come from folks who are out in the economy, who are in jobs that are creating that value. They are creating that tax revenue that comes into the government, that pays for them. We have to make sure in order to keep them strong and to keep them well-funded we have to have a robust and strong economy.     
   The key to keeping those services world class, whether it is in education, whether it is public safety, whether it is even funding our military at a Federal level; a strong and robust economy is critical to that in the long run, because the entire supply chain, the entire chain of individuals is interconnected. We are in a society, in an economy, where everybody is connected, one to another, in some way. It is not just a circle of folks that we interact with, but it is those that we interact with. That chain moves on and on throughout the entire economy, rippling back and forth in a very positive way, in all, ultimately, being very beneficial. 
   I have two friends who are in the insurance business. Ironically, they are both not only good friends and strong supporters of mine, they are extremely active in the community. I think the only place that they are not working in concert together is with insurance offices. Bob Boswell and Bob Kelly of Florence, Kentucky, are literally across a mall road together. 
   But they get along well together, they work together on projects to benefit the community. They see it firsthand, introducing folks to financial planning. As they are trying to build a future, they are trying to look to the future for retirement savings. My friend, Dale Viniard, who is an insurance agent in Crestwood, Kentucky, was one of the very first people that Pat and I met when we moved to East Crestwood, Kentucky, at the opposite end of the district, experiences of people having a concern over their ability to provide for their family and the future, having that ability to make sure that they can have a job, make an income and ultimately have some type of retirement, build that nest egg. 
   When you touched on the impact of the capital gains tax earlier, I think it's a huge, huge issue, because the majority of Americans now don't have these defined pension plans like somebody might have gotten 50 years ago, working for the large automotive company. Because most people are coming out of the small business world that creates 88 percent of the new jobs in this country. Their retirement plans are going to be in some form of deferred compensation of 401(k). Some type of retirement savings are diversified, spread over different types of investments. In most cases, they will have some degree of control over that. 
   Just the change in these taxes could have a dramatic impact on senior citizens. They could literally see their tax burden double overnight when they seek to access their retirement funds just to live. 
   Again, once that money comes out of the economy, it is not creating jobs. That investment is there; not only is it benefitting them, but it is creating jobs for the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our troops and dedicated civilian professionals, and to my former comrades and friends now serving, and against the Democrat resolution disapproving of reinforcing our troops in combat. 
   This week, Congress has spent its time debating a futile, nonbinding resolution when, in reality, we should be debating policy initiatives that will help our troops in their mission and lead to stability. I believe that in fighting the war in Iraq that there is room for an open and honest debate about the best way to advance the compelling national security interests of this Nation. Honest debate, respectful disagreement, and constructive dialogue are components of our great Republic; and it is important to honor the process that our institution provides. 
   Furthermore, this measure seeks to debate whether we support an operational decision that, in reality, should be made by the commanders on the ground, not by politicians in Congress. What are we going to be debating next week, Mr. Speaker? Which block in Baghdad? Which precinct to target? This nonbinding resolution serves no purpose other than pacifying the Democrats' political base and lowering  morale in our military. At least one Democrat has likened this type of resolution to a child stomping in the corner. 
   The troops will be doing their job by completing the mission that they have been given, and we in Congress need to do ours. Our troops who are fighting abroad do not get to debate the validity of their mission. Their enemies are real, and they are fighting day in and day out to protect our country, the Iraqi people and themselves. 
   This resolution does not help make progress in Iraq. It does not provide a new approach in Iraq and does not make our Nation or our troops more secure. That is what we need to be doing, not wasting our time debating a measure that can dishearten and demoralize our citizens faithfully serving in theater while encouraging and emboldening the adversaries of stability. 
   We have seen the aggression of this faceless and cowardly enemy in the bombing of Pan Am 103 in 1988, in al Qaeda's attack on the USS Cole in 2000, and the tragic events of September 11. This enemy is driven by hate and seeks to do Americans harm. 
   Over the course of time, it has become evident that we are involved in a long-term struggle with Islamic extremism to preserve our freedom and the freedom of the world. Every day, our men and women in uniform and our civilian professionals risk their lives to protect our freedom. From providing security to building an economy, we are strengthening the security of our country and the international community. 
   We have not had a terrorist attack on our soil in over 5 years because of our vigilance in pursuing the security of our Nation at home and abroad. Success in Iraq is our only option for continued national security and the preservation of freedom. 
   I have had the opportunity to speak to hundreds and hundreds of men and women in uniform whose experience spans all ranks, all services, and all units. Consistently, they share an optimistic and sober message about the importance of continuing the struggle to defeat Islamic extremists. A resolution like this blurs the many successes in the war they have had against the extremists. 
   The messages of our troops do not come without an understanding of the reality and the resources that we must commit to this mission. Fighting the terrorists will require a strong commitment, and the road to victory will be long. Our partners in Iraq have stated their commitment to the mission, and we must stand behind them. 
   At the same time, the Iraqis must continue to assume responsibility for their success as a nation and that our commitment is not open-ended. Success in countering an insurgency largely happens outside of the realm of combat. Security is only one aspect. 
   We must work on establishing frameworks within Iraq that can keep the water running and the electricity on, which will in turn allow people to go to work and children to return to school. Returning normal life to Iraqis is important, but it should not be the sole responsibility of our troops who are providing security and stability. We need to strengthen the involvement of the international community in this endeavor as we empower and engage the Iraqis. 
   I strongly believe that if we are to fully support our troops that we must listen to what they are saying. And when the troops are saying that they are committed to their mission then, I believe, we should listen. I remain a committed supporter of our troops, and I thank them for their service. 
   Soon, Congress will vote on the Department of Defense's supplemental budget; and in it, the Pentagon is requesting $5.6 billion for troop reinforcement. This will be the real test of commitment, not this meaningless resolution. A ``yes'' vote on that funding supports the troop reinforcement being debated here today, and a ``no'' vote will delete funding for this important mission. This will not only show people where Congress stands, but give accountability to our actions here in Congress with the force of law behind it. 
   I support our troops and our civilian professionals, and I intend to keep my commitment to my many friends on active duty and to vote to provide them the funding for their mission when the time comes. 
   To my former comrades and friends in the 101st Airborne Division and 82nd Airborne Division, thank you for answering the call again and know that I stand with you.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. (TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT NICHOLAS CARNES -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to pay tribute to Sergeant Nicholas Carnes, a citizen soldier who believed in our Nation and acted on that belief to answer the Nation's call to serve. 
   Nick Carnes was from Dayton, Kentucky. He lost his life on August 26, 2007, in Orgun-e, Afghanistan. Sergeant Carnes served with Alpha Battery, 2nd Battalion, 138th Field Artillery Regiment in the Army National Guard in Carrollton, Kentucky. 
   Nick Carnes was a lifelong Kentuckian who grew up in Dayton and graduated from Dayton High School in 2000. Nick joined the Army National Guard at 17 and began working at BB Riverboats. Shortly before his deployment in October 2006, he became a riverboat captain and married his sweetheart, Terri Bernstein Carnes. Sergeant Carnes was due back in Kentucky this month to celebrate his first anniversary with his wife. 
   I was at the sendoff for Alpha Battery in October of 2006. We saw the families. We saw the motivated soldiers who were ready to go and answer the call of service. I had the great honor and privilege to see Nick, to meet him and talk with him while I was there. And I was impressed with him. The one thing that this old soldier can say is I know a good noncommissioned officer, the backbone of our military, representing the character of our Nation, when I see one, and he clearly showed me that. 
   A man or a woman is the product of many things. First, Nick's mom, Wray Jean, and dad, Gove, you gave the Nation a great young man. You gave our community a great young man. And that was reflected in a letter that he sent to Terri on November 11, 2006, a few weeks after the unit had activated. He wrote this: 
   ``Dear Terri: 
   ``Hello, beautiful. I hope this letter finds you in good spirits. Also, I hope you are coping well with my absence. You mean the world to me, my beautiful wife. I am so sorry that my decisions in life have forced me to be away from you. Unfortunately, I can't change those decisions. Even if I could, I believe that I would sacrifice time with you to be part of helping another country and defending our own. If the other soldiers who came before me did not stand up for freedom, then we would not have freedom. So I feel that I am obligated to stand up for freedom to ensure that everyone else after me has the same freedoms we do today. 
   ``I am not going to Afghanistan to kill Afghans. I am going there to help them stand up to the Taliban and regain control of their country. As people, sometimes we need help. Afghans happen to need help. Yes, helping the Afghans may put me in harm's way, but I have been well trained and will continue to receive training for the rest my military career. 
   ``Everything will be fine. I feel confident and will do everything within my power to bring myself home safely. You need not worry, baby doll. I will go and do the job that is asked of me and return myself to your arms. I love you. Nick.'' 
   The greatest value of our citizens serving is not simply their military proficiency, but the amazing character of a free people, embodied in the life of a young man like Nick Carnes, who understood the call that he was accepting and saw the higher good and the greater purpose. 
   Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we honor Sergeant Carnes and his service to our great Nation. Sergeant Carnes was a brave soldier, dedicated husband, loving son, who was taken from us all too quickly fighting for a cause that he truly believed in. I honor his bravery. I honor his legacy. My thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family during this solemn time. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is fitting to rise and honor this young man who laid down his life for the defense of our Nation on Constitution Day. As I stand here tonight, we talk about the Constitution as one of the great cornerstones of the form of government that we have as a free people. Yet, its preservation will not occur unless there are young men and women like Nick Carnes to come forward in every generation to answer that call, to be willing, as he said, to place himself in harm's way to preserve the ideals that he believed in. 
   As we look tonight, I am reminded of the words of Jesus in John 15:13, who  declared, ``No one has greater love than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.'' 
   To you, Nick, I say thank you. Thank you for the example of your life. To his comrades in Alpha Battery who are here in this country now and also back in the theater, I say thank you for carrying on the mission. Thank you for honoring the flag, the highest ideals of service and what we represent as Americans. 
   Four special people in his life also need to be thanked, because as much of our country does not know, serving in the military is a family business that only 1 percent of our population responds to. 
   To Terri, I bear condolences for you, as I shared with you at the funeral home on behalf of a grateful Nation. Despite political differences that fly in the air, the backbone of our freedom is founded in sacrifices like your family has made, and I thank you for lending us Nick for a time. To Wray Jean and Gove, Nick's mom and dad, I say thank you for your son's service and for the example of his character. To his father-in-law Alan, thank you for your example and work. Raising a young leader who impacted our community, his duty and honor to country represent the best and greatest aspects of our national character. His sacrifice is not in vain

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the legacy of a brave young man who lost his life serving in Iraq. Sergeant Phillip McNeill, who grew up in Owingsville, Kentucky, was killed in Iraq on January 20, 2007. Sergeant McNeill was serving with the 3rd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, based in Fort Richardson, Alaska, when his Humvee was struck by an IED, bringing his bright young life to a tragic end. 
   Sergeant McNeill came from a family steeped in American military tradition. His military service was inspired by the brave men in his family who had served before him. His family described his dedication to his mission, saying that he ``believed in the cause and that he was a soldier who wanted to be over there.'' This was Sergeant McNeill's second tour in Iraq. 
   As we celebrate the spirit of this great soldier, my thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Phillip McNeill's family and friends. We are humbled by Sergeant McNeill's dedication, and we are forever indebted to him for making the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation and for our freedom.
