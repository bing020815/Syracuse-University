<DOCNO>Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. (RECOGNIZING THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1038, which recognizes and honors the employees of the Department of Homeland Security for their contributions in protecting our Nation from terrorist attacks. 
   We commend today the more than 200,000 employees of the Department that have dedicated themselves to the ongoing effort to secure our Nation. 
   In January 2003, the Department of Homeland Security officially was established, and in March 2003, 22 Federal agencies were brought together and the Department became operational. The Department has come a long way these five years. 
   With great interest, our Subcommittee on Management, Investigations, and Oversight has watched and encouraged the Department's progress in managing its components, organizing its people, and executing the critical mission of protecting the Nation. 
   I am especially pleased with the 21 percent staffing increase that Customs and Border Protection achieved in just one year. I have every confidence these agents are working tirelessly to help improve the security of our borders every single day. 
   Similarly, the hard-working people at the Transportation Security Administration have implemented a wide range of improvements at our Nation's airports. T-S-A is now training its own employees to be explosives detection canine handlers, which will allow for a considerable surge in detection in the event of a threat to any transportation system. 
   I am also proud that two key DHS facilities are located in my hometown of Anniston, Alabama. The Center for Domestic Preparedness provides live chemical agent training to first responders, and the Noble Training Center provides training for hospital and healthcare professionals to prepare for and respond to disasters. 
   The people who serve at the CDP and Noble Training Center provide an invaluable service to our Nation and deserve our thanks. 
   Yet as we look back over five years of growth and accomplishment, we must also look forward to next year's transition and beyond. 
   Consolidation of congressional oversight authority is still sorely needed, and remains the sole recommendation of the 9/11 Commission yet to be enacted. The lack of consolidated Congressional oversight jurisdiction over the Department has a direct negative impact on the Department's ability to fulfill its mission of securing the homeland. Congress must address this issue immediately. 
   In addition, the Congress needs to establish an annual DHS authorization bill to provide the steady-handed guidance that 86 different committees and subcommittees cannot. This Committee, followed by the House and our colleagues in the Senate, must produce an authorization bill in advance of any appropriations bill this year. 
   And finally, we must allow the Department's employees to work unimpeded by further organizational shuffling. 
   These and many more challenges lie in front of us. It is our job to ensure that the Department is ready for the future, especially as it prepares to transition to a new administration. 
   We therefore gladly extend our thanks to the many dedicated individuals that make up the backbone of our Nation's current and future security. 
   I urge my colleagues to support passage of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2008. I would like to thank Chairman Price and Ranking Member Rogers for including a solid increase for funding for detection canine teams used by DHS. The bill includes an increase of $17.3 million that will add more canine teams for air cargo inspections. The bill also includes funding for 1,506 canine teams for CBP, which represents an increase of 272 teams over last year's level. 
   These increases reflect a provision I supported in the Rail and Public Transportation Safety Act of 2007 and H.R. 659, the Canine Detection Team Improvement Act, which I introduced earlier this year. 
   However, I am deeply concerned about section 527 that would classify instructors at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center as inherently governmental. This provision would impose a dangerous ban on using non-Federal trainers after a national emergency and the resulting needed times of surge. 
   I also remain concerned about the ability of DHS to recruit and train an additional 3,000 new Border Patrol agents funded by the bill. Given attrition rates, this means that Border Patrol will need to hire and train approximately 4,400 agents a year. While I support putting more boots on the ground as quickly as possible, I am convinced  that the current approach DHS is using cannot meet this goal. 
   I am also concerned that it continues to cost $187,000 to recruit, train and deploy just one Border Patrol agent. The Subcommittee on Management Investigations and Oversight plans to hold another hearing on Border Patrol agent training costs in its capacity next Tuesday. It is my hope that the findings from this hearing will be considered by the House and Senate conferees on this bill to improve the way DHS recruits and trains Border Patrol agents.

   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman from Arizona for bringing attention to this vitally important research being conducted at Auburn University, an outstanding university in my district. 
   As my colleagues from Alabama know, and specifically my friend and colleague, Mr. Davis from the Seventh District, Auburn University is the home to USDA Aquatic Animal Health Research Laboratory. This laboratory conducts important research to help solve challenges in aquaculture that diminish productivity, lower the quality of catfish products, and hurt the long-term health of our domestic producers. 
   As my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee know, catfish is the leading aquaculture industry in the United States. In 2005, according to USDA, domestic producers sold 650 million pounds of catfish valued at $460 million. That total is only expected to grow. Today, catfish production has become one of the most important agricultural activities in States such as Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and, of course, my home State of Alabama. 
   In recent years, the American catfish industry has been faced with intense competition from foreign producers, specifically countries like China and Vietnam. This not only poses serious challenges to our economy but, as we have seen in recent news reports about tainted Chinese food products, also to our health. In 2005, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi banned Vietnamese catfish after U.S. health officials detected a banned antibiotic in Vietnamese imports. That ban remains in effect. In May of this year, Alabama banned Chinese catfish over the same concern. 
   As with many agricultural imports, we have no control over what drugs these foreign countries are giving to their catfish, nor do we know what diseases they are trying to prevent. But one thing we do know is that we do not want these products, these diseases and those threats to our food and our health in our country. 
   That is why the funding included in this bill for the Catfish Pathogen Genomic Project is so important. It helps protect the safety and health of our food supply, it helps protect and strengthen important American products and an industry critical to the economics of several States, and it helps carry on the tradition of university based research supported by the Federal Government that benefits our economy and society. 
   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment and ask the support of my colleagues for this important research program. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I would like to close by saying to my friend from Arizona, I share his concerns over some of our fiscal behavior in this Congress in recent years, but clearly this kind of USDA research university partnership is exactly what we should be fostering, given our concerns in this country about our food supply and its safety. 
   Mr. Jackson did make reference to the fact that, in 2003, half of our catfish production was being affected by two diseases that this partnership has now alleviated. We can continue to ensure that supply is safe with this kind of expenditure.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose this resolution. In doing so, I want to say I understand and share in some of the frustrations of those who are disappointed in the course of this conflict. 
   Over the past few days we have heard passionate debate on both sides of the issue from Democrats and Republicans alike. But I would say to my colleagues, passing this resolution is not the answer to their frustration. Not only is it purely symbolic and offers no productive solution for helping our military succeed, it sends the wrong message to our troops. 
   Instead of debating a resolution that says what we should not do in Iraq, it seems to me a more reasonable question should be, how should we go forward from here? 
   In January, the President put forth a plan to send reinforcements to help secure key areas in and around Baghdad and Anbar province in order to achieve a level of security to allow the Iraqi Government and security forces to assume control. As we all know, it may work and it may not. 
   But if the President, as Commander in Chief, and General Pace truly believe this plan will succeed, then I believe it should be given a chance to work. 
   Having listened to proponents and critics of the plan, it seems to me its success or failure is dependent on some key factors, including, first, whether our soldiers will be given the latitude to fully perform their duties without political interference; secondly, whether the Iraqi Government will be held accountable to live up to its commitments; and, third, whether the Iraqis will finally take responsibility for their own affairs. 
   Madam Speaker, the stakes in this debate are high. Iraq, indeed, is now the primary battlefront in the global war on terror, and there are no easy answers. 
   The House may pass this resolution this week, but in doing so, we will have missed an opportunity for a better and more balanced debate, including the chance to vote on a substitute bill. 
   Given the sacrifices our Nation has made, I agree the time to see real progress in Iraq is now. We all want our troops to come home safely and as soon as possible. But we also need for them to be successful in order for our Nation to remain secure. 
   Though our patience is being tested, our men and women in uniform deserve better from us than this purely symbolic resolution. They need our complete and unqualified support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 295, which expresses the deepest appreciation of Congress to the families of members of the United States Armed Forces. I would like to thank Mr. Bilirakis of Florida for introducing this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute today to the force behind the force: the military family. It has long been known that the military services recruit individuals but we retain families. This has never been more true or more critical than it is today. 
   The support our troops receive from their loving families--mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, spouses, and children--is intangible but it is nothing less than a powerful force multiplier. 
   Today millions of Americans have one or more family members serving in the Armed Forces. These incredible families attempt to lead normal lives while their loved ones stand in harm's way, fulfilling our Nation's oath to serve and protect. The strength of the military family is astounding. Military parents give their sons and daughters to our Nation and pray relentlessly for their safe return. They look forward to every letter and phone call, while fearing the ringing of the phone and the doorbell at the same time. 
   As we celebrate military families, let us not forget the sacrifices of the children. Military children are special in their strength and their maturity. They do not always have ``hometowns,'' but they have a heightened sense of family both in the traditional sense and in the special characteristics of the military community. 
   Military families have an uncanny resilience. They are some of the strongest citizens in this country, and I am privileged to recognize them not only today but every day. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this very important resolution. Without the support of our military families, the Armed Forces would not be the incredible power they are today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTEGRATION OF THE ARMED FORCES -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of this resolution commemorating the 60th anniversary of the beginning of integration in the United States Armed Forces.     
   Throughout the course of our Nation's history, the men and women of the armed services have defended our liberties with bravery, honor and sacrifice. But because our Nation racially segregated its military prior to 1948, generations of African Americans selflessly served our Nation with the knowledge that they were fighting abroad for many of the freedoms that they were frequently denied here at home. Despite this injustice, not only did African Americans serve honorably to fight for all our freedoms, they did so with dignity and bravery that earned many of them our Nation's top military honors. 
   One of the most important events in our Nation's history that helped move our country toward a more integrated America occurred on July 26, 1948, when President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981. This important order, which we acknowledge with this resolution today, ordered that there be equality of treatment with all persons in the armed services regardless of race, color, religion or national origin. 
   Even though it took years to accomplish the complete integration of the armed services, it was Executive Order 9981 that began the process. 
   Of the many units that served with distinction, I particularly would like to recognize the contributions of the Tuskegee Airmen, who trained at historic Moton Field in my congressional district in Alabama. 
   As most of us know, over the course of World War II, the Tuskegee Airmen became one of the most highly decorated units in the Armed Forces. These brave pilots destroyed more than 1,000 German aircraft while accumulating an unprecedented record of flying more than 200 bomber escort missions over central and southern Europe. 
   These brave Americans served without the loss of a single bomber to enemy aircraft and returned home with some of our Nation's highest military honors. But they also returned home to a racially segregated America. It's that injustice, and the steps our Nation has taken to help right that wrong, that we are helping recognize today. I'm also delighted that this body will help further recognize the occasion with a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda later this month. 
   I would like to thank Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, and Chairman Skelton for allowing this resolution today. I'd also like to thank my good friend and colleague from Florida, Mr. Kendrick Meek, for his strong support of this resolution. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1067, recognizing the 50th anniversary of the crossing of the North Pole by the USS Nautilus and its significance in the history of both our Nation and the world. 
   I want to commend my colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, Representative JOE COURTNEY of Connecticut, for sponsoring this important resolution, as well as the 20 other cosponsors, including Representative ROSCOE BARTLETT, the ranking member of the Seapower and Expeditionary Forces Subcommittee. 
   Submarines have been a central component of our Nation's naval forces for over a century. Congress authorized the construction of the Nautilus in July 1951. After merely 26 months of construction, unheard of by today's standards, the first nuclear-powered submarine--indeed, the first nuclear-powered vessel in the world--was commissioned into the United States Navy. Shortly thereafter, on the morning of January 17, 1955, Nautilus' first Commanding Officer, Commander Eugene P. Wilkinson, ordered the boat away from the pier and signaled the historic message, ``Underway on Nuclear Power.'' From that day forward, Nautilus continued to break all submerged speed and distance records. This included the historic mission to the North Pole on August 3, 1958. 
   In honoring the USS Nautilus, I note that now, just as 50 years ago, both quality and quantity matter with respect to our naval fleet. Although our current military conflicts have caused us to rightly focus on the health of our ground forces, it is again time for the Nation to have a strategic outlook on the future role of our naval forces. We should do our level best to maintain our maritime dominance and forward presence around the globe. 
   I will conclude by noting that the USS Nautilus' journey from the North Pole is historically significant and a magnificent scientific and military achievement. I am proud that the United States Navy has set an international standard of excellence. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I call upon all Americans to pause and honor the service and sacrifice of not only those brave Americans who crossed the North Pole 50 years ago, but all those who have served and continue to serve in the defense of our Nation and its values. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this most worthy resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution honoring the extraordinary service and exceptional sacrifice of all those who have served and are serving in the 101st Airborne Division known as the Screaming Eagles. 
   For more than 65 years, since its formation in 1942, the division has established a record of bravery, commitment, military prowess and excellence that marks it as one of the great military units in American history. 
   When activated, the division's first commander told his men that, while the division had no history, it had a ``rendezvous with destiny.'' And through five wars, the soldiers of that division have never failed that vision. 
   In World War II, from Normandy to Holland to Bastogne, and Hitler's Eagle's Nest, the division fought with great distinction. More than 2,000 of its members died defending freedom. Deployed to Vietnam for 7 years, the division never failed to accomplish any mission. 
   Though few of its battles became household names, the division's 4,000 deaths and 17 Medals of Honor are evidence of the unhesitating courage and sacrifice the division has made in Southeast Asia. 
   Today, tens of thousands of the 101st soldiers have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, helping to secure liberty for those nations, denying a safe haven to terrorists, and helping to protect America's interests. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it is entirely fitting that we honor the 101st Airborne Division as one of the great American military units. More importantly, we must recognize and honor the tremendous debt that we owe to all who have served so well in this storied and historic division. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Whitfield, for introducing this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. One of the main reasons is we don't have the capacity domestically to breed these dogs. Of the dogs that we use in TSA now, about 420, only about 15 percent, are bred in the domestic program here. We have to go overseas to European sources for these dogs because you can't just use any kind of dogs. They have to have particular breeds that have skill sets and the ability to sniff a variety of not only drugs but explosives, and we can't get them domestically. 
   And I find it odd that I am on the other side of this issue because I am the one that is usually criticized for  advocating more contracting out. But the fact is domestically we just do not have the capacity to provide these dogs that we need in TSA or in other areas, CBP, Secret Service or in DOD. DOD is obtaining the majority of its dogs from European sources as well. I think that is unacceptable as Americans.

   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. The interesting thing about TSA, I have been over to, the last couple of years, most of the breeding and training programs for canines in this country. And the interesting thing about TSA is they have the most stellar breeding program because they are genetically breeding a dog that is particularly useful in transportation settings at detecting explosives and being on its feet for long periods of time. 
   The contractors you are talking about, you can buy dogs in this country. Not the breeds that we need. That is the problem. If we could, I would be on your side of this amendment. We can't. That is why currently we are obtaining over 80 percent of our dogs from European sources. And they are private sources, by the way.

   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I do want to go back to one question the gentleman from Arizona had, and that was the cost. Roughly, we are spending about $500,000 on this TSA breeding and training program. It trains about 50 dogs a year now. It can double that capacity with this. 
   This breeding is very important, particularly at this facility because it is on the cutting edge. I would urge this Congress to recognize how significant it is that we are able to produce this kind of dog here, and I would tell you that I have also been a big advocate on the DOD side as well of our trying to create more breeding programs domestically. I would like to see them be private, frankly, but we don't have that capacity right now that can put the standard of quality of dogs out that we need so that we don't have to rely on foreign sources for these dogs. Because I can assure you we are not getting the first quality and the quantity that we need. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. It is truly a matter of national security both in TSA and I think in DOD.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to associate myself with the remarks of the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Mr. Rogers. 
   As the gentleman stated, homeland security is too important an issue not to have any oversight. And the 279-page bill we consider today is too encompassing not to have any jurisdiction consideration by the committees of jurisdiction. 
   On such an important issue as protecting our country from terrorist attacks, we should have the opportunity to offer and debate amendments on the specific provisions of this bill. For example, the bill contains provisions authorizing billions of dollars in spending for new programs that have not been approved by the Committee on Homeland Security. The bill misses the opportunity to continue our consolidation of committee jurisdiction started in the 109th Congress over DHS and called for by the 9/11 Commission. 
   The bill also contains revisions to many initiatives developed under the  Republican leadership. For example, Section 812 of the bill expands the authorities of the Privacy Officer of the Department of Homeland Security. This vital position was established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, a Republican bill, signed by President Bush into law. This was the first statutory mandate for a Privacy Officer in the executive branch. 
   Another Republican bill which the President signed into law, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, elevated the position of the Privacy Officer authorizing its direct reporting to the Secretary. 
   Concerns have been raised that the pending bill would turn the Privacy Officer into an investigating officer. In fact, this proposal was specifically rejected last year during a markup in the Subcommittee on Management, Integration and Oversight, which I chaired. The DHS Inspector General stated that this provision would interfere with his role and would ``create duplicative investigations and overlapping demands for documents involved in investigations of privacy violations.'' 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I will include this letter in the RECORD.

Each of us in this Chamber knows that gas is over $5 a gallon in this country and rising. We all know that high gas prices are making everything more expensive, from groceries to clothing. 
   The question is what is this House going to do about it? For one, we should vote this week to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for energy exploration. We should also open the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   Combined, these two locations have the potential of providing our country almost 100 billion barrels of oil. In addition, Congress must get serious about funding alternative energy research. A great example is the work being done at Auburn University in my home State of Alabama. I would like to invite my colleagues to visit the Auburn mobile bioenergy unit here in D.C. this week. 
   Efforts like these are critical or a critical part of the solution to high gas prices, but so is using the resources we have here at home in an environmentally sensitive way. This is just common sense, and there is nothing that should stop Congress from following this course.

   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to drive home the fact that the U.S. needs an energy policy now. 
   In my home State of Alabama, gas prices have risen over 10 cents a gallon in the last 2 weeks. This just can't continue. Not only does this affect how much folks can afford to drive, but it also raises the prices on everyday necessities like food and clothing. Congress needs to act now. 
   Increased domestic energy exploration is part of the solution, but Congress also must invest heavily in home-grown biofuels and bioenergy. 
   Imagine pulling up to the service stations of the future, and you can see all sorts of fuels--hydrogen, natural gas, ethanol, and biodiesel. But we won't get there without strong support from Congress now. The same holds true for initiatives like solar and wind power. No one fuel will power our future, but we all know that Congress must do whatever it takes to help get us there now. 
   So let's act now to make our country energy independent. Let's pass a bill to open ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf, and let's invest heavily in alternative fuels and new technology to increase efficiency and conservation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. (STREAMLINING OF SAFETY ACT AND ANTI-TERRORISM TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT PROCESSES -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The bill we consider today will streamline the procurement process of the Department of Homeland Security by implementing the SAFETY Act. The SAFETY Act was enacted in November 2002 as a part of the Homeland Security Act. At that time it was the intent of Congress to spur the development and deployment of innovative antiterrorism technologies. The act does this, in part, by limiting the liability exposure of companies that provide those technologies in the event of a terrorist attack. 
   Since the law was enacted, however, the number of applications to DHS for SAFETY Act protections has fallen well below expectations. Critics charged that this result is due to a number of factors, including the Department's slow evaluation and approval process, the understaffing in key DHS offices, and the lack of full coordination between the SAFETY Act office and the procurement office in the process at DHS. 
   To address those concerns, the Committee on Homeland Security included bipartisan provisions in the DHS authorization bill for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, but time ran out, and neither bill came to law. 
   Last summer DHS issued its final rule to implement the SAFETY Act. The Department revised the application kit to make it easier for companies to apply for SAFETY Act protection. 
   To review those materials and hear from the private sector, I cochaired a hearing in the Management, Integration and Oversight Subcommittee with the former Chairman Reichert and his subcommittee on September 13, 2006. We heard from the Under Secretary for Science and Technology and the chief procurement officer at DHS. 
   We also heard from leading industry representatives, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Homeland Security and Defense Business Council, and the Professional Services Council. The feedback we received from industry about the revisions DHS made to the process was mostly positive. Progress has been made. 
   DHS reports a 100 percent increase in applications, from 14 to 28, over 1 year since the fourth quarter of 2005, but more can be done to further streamline and improve the SAFETY Act procurement process. 
   The bill we consider today continues our work from the 109th Congress and makes those improvements. First, the bill would ensure DHS has a sufficient number of properly trained analysts to review and prioritize antiterrorism technologies that could qualify for SAFETY Act designation. 
   Second, the bill would establish a formal coordination process within DHS and involve the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, the Under Secretary for Policy, the chief procurement officer and the general counsel. 
   And third, the bill would require that SAFETY Act issues are fully considered in advance of procurement by DHS of an antiterrorism technology. 
   This bill would improve implementation of the SAFETY Act so the private sector can do more to protect our Nation from terrorist attacks. I urge my colleagues to support its passage. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, as ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Management, Investigations and Oversight, I have worked with my committee colleagues on this legislation for some time. I was also an original cosponsor of the bill, primarily because of its provisions to improve oversight, management and procurement at the Department of Homeland Security. 
   On March 28, our committee produced a sound bipartisan bill that the committee passed by a vote of 26-0. Unfortunately, as the bill headed to the House floor, jurisdictional turf battles took over. At least 16 important security provisions were dropped, and many more were altered without input from our side of the aisle. 
   Unfortunately, at least one of the dropped provisions addressed a key 9/11 Commission recommendation. This feature would centralize jurisdiction and oversight for homeland security in one committee, in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
   Last Congress, the Republican leadership in the House heeded this recommendation by creating a new standing Committee on Homeland Security. This new standing committee was wisely vested with substantial jurisdiction over DHS. 
   While we recognize that last Congress was an ambitious first step, experience has shown that jurisdiction over this department still needs further consolidation, not erosion. Far too many committees and subcommittees in Congress still exercise control and oversight authority over DHS. 88 to be exact. Already this year, DHS officials have testified at over 100 congressional hearings. 
   It's my hope that leaders on both sides of the aisle can come to an understanding to help consolidate authorization jurisdiction under this one committee. Had this been the case this year, the bipartisan, well-reasoned bill that was originally presented to the House would not have been carved up by jurisdictional turf battles. 
   Until this issue is resolved, the House will not be able to exercise the needed oversight over DHS, just as it does with the other Departments in the Federal Government. Consequently, I must oppose this bare boned bill, and hope that we will address this critical issue of jurisdiction in the near future.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. (RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE BUD CRAMER AND THE HONORABLE TERRY EVERETT ON THEIR RETIREMENT FROM CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I respectfully request the attention of the House to pay recognition to a dear friend across the aisle. My collegue, Representative BUD CRAMER will retire after eighteen years of service to the people of Alabama's 5th District when this session adjourns. 
   Congressman CRAMER has been a pleasure to work with during my time in the House, and has contributed a great deal to the Alabama Congressional Delegation. His willingness to discuss issues across party lines speaks to his genuine concern for the well-being of his constituents. Congressman CRAMER has been a strong, advocate for sensible legislation and has used his positions on the House Appropriations and Permanent Select Intelligence Committees to champion fiscally responsible programs. 
   I would like to thank Congressman CRAMER once more for his dedicated service. I have been honored to work with him over the past 6 years. 
   Madam Speaker, I respectfully request the attention of the House to pay recognition to a dear friend and exemplary member of this body. My colleague, Representative TERRY EVERETT will retire after 16 years of service to the people of Alabama's 2nd District when this session adjourns. 
   Congressman Everett has been an invaluable resource for the Alabama Congressional Delegation. His experience and insight were a great help to me when I first came to Washington in 2002. As a member of the Agriculture, Armed Services, and Permanent Select Intelligence Committees, he has furthered the interests of the people of Alabama and the security of the United States. 
   I would like to thank Congressman Everett once more for his dedicated service. He is a gentleman with the highest regard for duty and principle, and he will be dearly missed.
