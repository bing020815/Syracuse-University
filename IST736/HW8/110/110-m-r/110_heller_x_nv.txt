<DOCNO>Mr. HELLER of Nevada. (COMMENDING THE MEMBERS OF THE NEVADA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD AND AIR NATIONAL GUARD -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. I want to express my appreciation to the gentlewoman from Virginia for yielding time and thank her for her kind remarks and also to my colleagues from Indiana and, of course, from southern Nevada (Ms. Berkley) for the remarks that she made. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to honor and thank the members of the Nevada Army National Guard, Air National Guard and the members of the Nevada Reserve for their service to the State of Nevada and the United States. Members of the Nevada National Guard and Reserve serve our State and country with honor and distinction. Whether they are saving lives during natural disasters or protecting our country abroad, Nevadans and our Nation owe our Guardsmen and Reservists a debt of gratitude for their service. America must remain committed to our men and women overseas, and I pray for the safe return of every servicemember of the United States. 
   Today I consider it a privilege to offer this resolution along with the Nevada House Delegation, Ms. Berkley and Mr. Porter, in order to honor some of Nevada's finest citizens. 
   As we all know, the people who make the greatest sacrifices for our country are the brave men and women of our Armed Forces. Very often this means servicemembers are deployed for extended periods of time away from family, children, and friends, sometimes in hostile conditions. In addition, when members of the National Guard deploy, their families are not the only ones that are affected. Since our servicemembers live and work in their hometowns throughout Nevada, employers and communities are also affected by these deployments. I would like to recognize and thank those employers who have displayed patriotism by saving positions for returning servicemembers and supporting the servicemembers' families during this time. 
   The Nevada National Guard is regarded as a technically and tactically proficient fighting force fully capable of seamlessly serving alongside active duty personnel. Nevada's Guardsmen and Reservists have bravely served both domestically and abroad in support of the global war on terrorism. 
   The Nevada National Guard has experienced both triumphant and disappointing moments during the past few years. Most of the Nevada National Guard's wartime deployments have been in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. The Nevada National Guard has had the pleasure of welcoming hundreds of our airmen and soldiers home from worldwide deployments but also has had the sorrowful task of mourning the loss of three Army Guard combat casualties, the first casualties for the Nevada National Guard since World War II. 
   At this time, I want to extend my deepest condolences to family members of Chief Warrant Officer John Flynn, Sergeant Patrick Stewart, and Specialist Anthony Cometa who lost their lives in defense of our country. Generations of Nevadans will enjoy greater peace and security because of the sacrifices of John, Patrick, and Anthony. 
   Despite trying times, I am proud of the accomplishments of the Nevada Guard during the past 5 years. The Nevada National Guard pledges to fulfill its commitment to the citizens of the Silver State and the Nation in the same conscientious and professional manner they have maintained for nearly 150 years. 
   I support all our men and women in uniform. From the Middle East to Fallon Naval Air Force Station and Nellis Air Force Base, our troops are doing an excellent job of protecting Americans from new threats. Recognizing the sacrifices our troops have made in the past and continue to make today is critical for every citizen.     
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 358 and honor the bravery of America's best servicemembers.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Thank you very much. I appreciate the comments, and I appreciate you putting this together. I am proud to be part of the quarterly report that we have going on here today, spend some time with the folks back home and let them know what is going on here in Washington, D.C. and what we are trying to do to help them. And I want to thank you again for putting us together. 
   And you know what is great is to be able to listen to the gentleman from Michigan talk about the experiences that he has within his district. And I think we can do that with Louisiana, with Ohio, Tennessee, California, but I want to give a couple of examples of what I am seeing in Nevada. 
   I have got a pretty large district. I joke with my colleagues sometimes about the distance that I have to drive, 15 hours to get from one end of my district to the other. I go home most weekends and probably drive 500 miles. In fact, this weekend I am driving out to Elko, which is going to be another 500-mile drive. But that is okay. That is okay. 
   You know, the difficult part about this is that I try to meet my constituents in my district. Every year I try to travel as far as I can, and the exorbitant cost now that it is, just to visit with my constituents, is becoming incredible. I drove about 50,000 miles this year. And had I done that 2 years ago, in trying to visit with my constituents it would have cost me actually $90,000 less, $90,000 extra dollars to drive because of the non-actions of this particular Congress. 
   But I want to put a face, just like the gentleman from Michigan did, on what is going on here in the State of Nevada. As I drive across the State, I can give examples. 
   I have a daughter, and many of you have children that are in sports. And it is a shame that playing in some of these competitive teams, once you get to a competitive level you find yourself traveling great distances. She happens to be playing out of Reno, and she has to go down to Las Vegas or maybe to Sacramento, maybe up to Oregon, across the State to Elko or somewhere of that nature. So it is getting pretty expensive for parents, and I am having parents starting to complain that they can't go to the away games. It is difficult for them to get to the away games because of the cost of travel because of the high fuel costs. 
   Another example of that, I was in a small town called Lovelock, and they have a restaurant over there called Sturgeons, and I was talking to the general manager. And they were talking about the price of eggs. The price of an egg, since the beginning of the year has gone from 7 cents to 13 cents. 
   Now, Lovelock is not that far out of the way. From Reno it is probably an hour and a half or so. So you wouldn't think that travel costs would be that expensive. But it is the cost of everything, because of the inaction of this particular Congress, that is causing these problems. It isn't just the price of fuel. Of course it is the price of poultry. 
   When we start taking all of this corn and the grains and the byproducts and start turning them into ethanol and using what could be used for feed for cattle, for poultry, for hogs and everything else, everything is going up and getting very expensive very, very quickly. 
   I think ethanol is a mistake right now. I think we need to take a look at other ways, other ways of providing energy, and that is why we went on this trip to ANWR. 
   But I want to give one more example, and that is a particular family that came to visit me last week. The Anderson family came in, one of my constituents, family from Nevada, and they came out here. They have a couple of children and they want to show their children Washington, D.C. And I was fortunate enough to have them come by my office. And I believe he is a dental technician and she is a nurse, and they have a young daughter that  plays volleyball, very good at volleyball. Their son is a very good baseball player. And they are talking about how difficult it is for them to provide, and the problems that they are facing now with these high fuel prices. 
   They are very good athletes, and so they want to make all of their events, and it gets more and more difficult. 
   To tell you how difficult it is getting, in my home State of Nevada, according to the USA Today, because of fuel prices for airlines, they are cutting 10 percent of their flights. Well, we are one of five States they are going to cut more than 10 percent of their flights into Nevada. 
   Now, for a State like ours that relies heavily on 
   tourism and traffic, you can imagine the impact that that is having. But it is not just coming into the State, the lack of 10 percent flights. It is the lack of 10 percent flights now that are going out. And they talked about how difficult it is to get a flight now and the exorbitant cost it is. 
   I think an airline industry today just announced that the extra bag is not going to be $25, it is going to be an additional $25 on top of that, for a total of $50 so that they can compensate for these huge costs. 
   I want to banter back and forth more. I want to talk about our trip to ANWR. I want to talk about our experiences in Golden, Colorado. I think they were great. I want to give others a chance to introduce themselves. And thank you again for the opportunity to be here. And I will yield back to you.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Thank you. 
   You make a very good point on this. 
   You have heard me say this before, but this energy policy is a three-legged stool. We have to conserve; we have to look at renewable sources; we also need to drill for more oil. You can't do one without the other. You'll have an energy policy that fails. You can't do two without the third or that energy policy will fail.  
   I'll tell you what I got out of this trip to ANWR, which I thought overall really put this in perspective for me. And that is, as was mentioned, we use 20 million barrels of oil a day here in this country. If we do everything we can to conserve--and the American people are moving in that direction, and I applaud that--if we do everything we possibly can for renewable energy, and that is meet our goals--we have a goal here in these Chambers of 15 percent by the year 2020. If we meet those goals, if we conserve, we're still going to need an additional 10 million barrels of oil a day by 2030.     
   So where are we going to get the additional 10 million barrels of oil that the American people are going to need if we continue to stop this possibility of going to ANWR, going offshore, looking at shale, looking at all these other prospects, and building additional refineries: Where are we going to get that additional 3 million barrels that we are going to need, even though we're on top of the renewable process and we have conserved, as the American people are doing today? That's the question that needs to be answered.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. In my local newspaper just today, there was an article written by some of the people that you're talking about, some of the more extreme environmentalists saying that this country would be better off today if we had the same gas prices as they have in Holland, $10 a gallon: $10 a gallon, if we had that, America would be better off. I have a hard time believing that we are better off if we to try to Europeanize ourselves and increase the price per gallon. 
   I've had town hall meetings. I've had over a hundred thousand people polled of what they thought of a 50 cent per gallon increase. Eighty-two percent are against it. We have people now calling for doubling the gasoline prices we have today.

<DOCNO>Mr. HELLER of Nevada. (MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON S. 294, PASSENGER RAIL INVESTMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer a motion to instruct conferees on H.R. 6003, the Passenger Rail Investment Improvement Act of 2008. This simple motion directs the House-Senate conferees to insist upon section 221 of the House bill, which states that ``Amtrak shall be subject to the Buy American Act, the regulations thereunder, for purchases of $100,000 or more.'' 
   Especially during these trying economic times, it is important that Amtrak, a taxpayer-subsidized agency that has never turned a profit, support American businesses and jobs. In fact, one of the most important ways Amtrak could help the American economy is by buying American, especially by buying American oil. 
   Amtrak runs on diesel fuel, and diesel prices in our Nation are at an all-time high. For the past several months, when I was at home in Nevada, the number one issue on the minds of my constituents was the high price of fuel. I am sure there is no difference than any other district, since fuel costs have reached record highs across this Nation. 
   In fact, this week some of my constituents were in town and came by the office. In talking with them, I was vividly reminded just how the high cost of fuel, spurred by congressional inaction, is hurting families in my district. 
   The Anderson family lives in Carson City with their two kids, Steve and Sarah. They are a model American middle class family. The father is a dental lab technician, the mother is a nurse. Their kids are good students and play basketball and volleyball. But gasoline expenses are hurting their budget. Disposable income for them, just like all Americans, is disappearing as they drop their kids off to play sports or attend their kids' games. 
   Record high fuel prices are not only crippling family budgets, but also public safety efforts, educational institutions, small businesses, and causing inflation in all manner of products and commodities. 
   Despite several promises from the majority party, however, we have seen nothing that would truly help consumers with the high cost of fuel today. Yet, April 18, 2006, more than 2 years ago, then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated, ``Democrats have a plan to lower gas prices.'' Again, April 24, 2006, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi released a statement saying, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' 
   The parade of bold statements promising help for the American consumers continues. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, October 2005 said, ``Democrats believe we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices.'' 
   Not to be outdone, Democrat Whip Jim Clyburn said, ``House Democrats have a plan to help curb rising gas prices'' in July of 2006. 
   And Madam Speaker, we haven't seen the results of these plans. The American people would like to see the plan. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Madam Speaker, the House has addressed some minor aspects of energy policy. And I have supported several of the measures that the House has debated and voted on, including legislation to address price gouging, halt delivery to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and to address the international energy cartels. But only one of these measures is now law. 
   I just returned, as my colleague from Minnesota mentioned, with a group from the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve and other areas of Alaska which are rich in potential oil and energy resources. Exploration and development of these resources could easily happen in an environmentally sound fashion, quickly brought online, and is something that Alaskans support. 
   Our group on this same recent trip toured the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado as well. As Nevada is a leader in renewable energy development, I also strongly support renewable energy as a long-term solution to our energy needs. I voted for a renewable portfolio standard and on the House floor have cosponsored legislation to expand renewable energy by extending tax incentives. However, these bills scratch the surface of our fuel crisis, nor are they a substitution for a realistic and truly comprehensive energy policy. 
   Congress needs to act now on measures that will lower the price of fuel immediately and in the short term. Conservation is one such area, exploration and drilling are another. Long-term solutions--alternative fuels, renewable fuels, and even the expansion of mass transit--are simply not going to help our constituents this month, this summer, or probably even this year. They are very likely several years off. So this Congress must act to address the short-term needs of drivers today. Currently, the current approach by Congress to date has done little or nothing to address the crisis on fuel prices now gripping my district and the Nation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Madam Speaker, Americans are now paying on average $1.67 more per gallon than they were when the 110th Congress began. In Nevada, since the 110th Congress began, gasoline has increased about $1.50 per gallon. So far this year, crude prices have increased 40 percent. 
   Since passage of H.R. 6, a so-called comprehensive energy bill, in December of 2007 gas prices have risen nearly 10 percent, diesel prices have risen more than 16 percent, oil has reached all-time highs. Clearly this bill was not the answer to our fuel problems. Clearly whatever the House majority is doing, badgering corporate executives, berating the President, holding hearings after hearings wasting time, is not working. It's not the commonsense plan we were promised. Tax increases on fuels are not part of the commonsense solution and are not a substitute for a real energy policy. 
   I have spoken to more than 100,000 households in Nevada during the course of some telephone/town hall meetings and have asked, Do you support the proposed 50 cent per gallon gas tax?  Eighty-two percent oppose this tax increase sending a clear message that the people of Nevada oppose these outrageous plans. 
   Additionally, tax increases that affect oil companies also hurt retirees, seniors, and pension funds. In 2004, more than 2,600 pension funds run by Federal, State, and local governments held almost $64 billion in shares of U.S. oil and natural gas companies. These funds represent the major retirement security for the Nation's current and retired soldiers, teachers, and police and fire personnel at every level of government. Fourteen percent of shares are held in IRAs and other personal retirement accounts. Forty-five million U.S. households have IRAs and other personal retirement accounts. 
   The effects of a punitive windfall profits tax on the energy industry would likely be the same as when it was tried last in the 1980s reducing investment in domestic oil production. The windfall profits tax during the Carter administration drained billions of dollars from the industry which was money not spent on U.S. exploration and production. Furthermore, the windfall profits tax failed to raise a fraction of the projected revenue. 
   Consequently, like most of the House and Senate Republicans, I have voted against billions in tax increases on energy companies which have only been passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. With billions in tax increases being put forth in the House, not one of them has passed the Senate. Clearly this approach is not consensus and is not part of a commonsense plan to address high fuel prices. 
   While speculation may have a significant effect on oil prices, this process can work in reverse as well. Merely the announcement that Congress is willing to allow full debate on the issues or that certain moratoria will be lifted will cause energy prices to react accordingly. In fact, I have requested a hearing on this issue at the Financial Services Committee on which the committee has some jurisdiction. 
   A real energy policy will address a variety of measures, including the very basic cause of high prices, supply, and demand. Congress desperately needs to address refinery expansion, coal-to-liquid technologies, lifting offshore moratoria, oil shale, and other areas that will address skyrocketing gasoline and diesel prices. 
   Our Nation hasn't built a new refinery in more than 30 years, yet demand for refined petroleum has continued to increase. Estimates show the world's energy needs will be 50 percent higher in 2030 with 55 to 65 percent of demand from conventional oil and gas. 
   The last time Congress opened access of a large oil field to develop was in 1973. The Congressional Research Service notes that 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are classified as undiscovered resources right here in this country and are offshore. Yet Congress has imposed moratoria on much of the Outer Continental Shelf since 1982. This oil represents about 33 percent of Saudi Arabia's proven reserves. 
   ANWR holds billions of barrels of oil that we intentionally refuse to develop. The U.S. is the only Nation that closes off its own reserves, its own natural resources and willfully subjects its economic future to the whims of oil dictatorships like Venezuela. 
   Russia and the volatile Middle East can hold sway over the American economy not because they can but because we allow them to. China, a Communist country, is exploring for oil with the consent of Cuba, another Communist country right off our shores. In what economic world does that make commonsense? 
   Simply put, we cannot conserve, tax, or regulate our way out of this problem. Nor should we cajole our way out by begging foreign nations for help. Renewable and alternative sources of energy, which enjoy bipartisan support, are simply not a realistic, cost-effective option today. 
   The reality today is that our Nation, now and into the foreseeable immediate future, runs on gasoline, diesel fuel, and other petroleum products. Recognizing this reality and doing something about it is critical to our economy, public safety, education, tourism, and other areas. 
   The House should encourage buying American oil just as we encourage buying American products. In the meantime, this House should have a real broad, open, and forthright energy debate, not a series of small-bore suspension calendar bills that merely tinker around the edges. Congress must address all of the energy and fuel issues gripping this Nation the way the American people understand. 
   Let the will of the House work in a fashion that our constituents can follow and appreciate. The American people, like the Andersons and so many others in my district and nationwide, are demanding answers and demanding action. We should respond accordingly. 
   Support this motion to instruct and support buying American, including American energy. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Madam Speaker, I have some final thoughts I'd like to share with this body, and I want to thank the chairman for his patience on this particular issue. 
   It was well-addressed by the gentlewoman from Minnesota, the amount of time and the time and the energy we spent up in ANWR, but I want to talk a little bit about the energy renewable laboratory in Golden, Colorado, where we also spent some time. 
   I found the statistics and the issues there very, very interesting. I'm one who thinks that we have a three-pronged chair here that's very important in our energy future. We want, of course, to be in conservation, which I believe the American people understand that conservation is a critical part. Renewable energy is also the third leg of that chair which is very critical. And also finding additional sources of energy through our natural resources is very critical. 
   I want to talk about the National Renewable Energy Lab that we spent some time with out there. We saw and drove in electric cars. We saw and drove in hydrogen cars, and obviously, we saw the hybrid cars, also. 
   I just want to mention briefly that renewable energy is the future, but I believe it's a long-term future. Let me give you an example. 
   Five or 6 years ago, I drove in a hydrogen car down in Las Vegas. I got a phone call from the other end of the State, come on down, drive this hydrogen car. I thought it was a great idea, went down there, drove in a hydrogen car, went around the block, got out of the car, and I asked the gentleman: So what does it cost? How much does it cost for a consumer to buy this hydrogen car? He told me it was $1 million, $1 million for this hydrogen car. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, I drove a hydrogen car last week, drove it around the block, got done, opened the door, asked the gentleman: So how much does this car cost? And the car still cost $1 million dollars, $1 million for a hydrogen car. I don't have very many constituents that are willing to go out today and buy a $1 million car. 
   So we drove the electric car, drove it around the block, ran fine, asked the question: How far does the car go? He said, well, about 70 miles on a charge. How long does it take to charge? About 6 minutes. How much does this car cost? Very expensive, over $100,000. I said, well, what would it take, what would it take to get an electric car that goes 300 miles at 60 miles an hour that charges in 10 to 15 minutes and costs less than $30,000 but it will go 60 miles an hour? That's what the consumers want here in this country, and they say we're not even close. We're not even close to that.     
   Renewables are incredibly important; the technology isn't there today. So that is the purpose that we continue to go up to ANWR, take a look at ANWR, talk about additional oils. 
   I will tell you, what struck me on my trip up to ANWR was this; that if we conserve--and the American people are conserving and they'll do more to conserve--if we build renewable energy, look for cars, look for opportunities, the technology for renewable energies, and meet our goals--our goal here in this Congress I believe is 15 percent by the year 2020--if we meet those goals, we are still going to need an additional 10 million barrels a day of oil by the year 2025. Even if we conserve, even if we do all the renewable efforts--and the American people are doing that--we're still going to go from 15 million barrels of oil a day to 25 million barrels a day by the year 2025. That's why it's critical. That's why we went up to ANWR. That's why we want to take a look at the opportunity to open up the Outer Continental Shelf, to look at the northern shore of Alaska. I think these principles are critical, that's why we did that. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. It takes me 15 hours to get from one end of my district to the other. 
   So what I'm looking for, as I mentioned earlier--and I appreciate your commitment to electric cars because we're all there. The fact is I want a car that goes 300 miles and recharges in 5 to 10 minutes because if you live in Elko, Nevada and you have an electric car, it takes you 300 miles roundtrip to get anywhere. And if it takes you 6 hours to plug it in, it's certainly going to cost you more to reserve time in a hotel in order to get back. But again, I want to thank the chairman.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this important bipartisan amendment. 
   The PILT program compensates counties for the loss of income resulting from Federal lands. 
   This is something my constituents know a lot about because nearly 85 percent of Nevada's land mass is owned by the Federal Government. 
   PILT funds are used for critical services on public lands counties such as search and rescue on public lands, infrastructure, education, and many other important functions. 
   For many years the PILT program has been woefully underfunded. 
   Again this year, the administration requested a paltry $198 million for this program, which is more than $150 million less than the authorized level. 
   While the $20 million we are seeking to raise PILT funding by will not entirely make up for the funding shortfall, every penny counts to the counties and families that live in public lands States. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, prioritize the PILT program, and take a step towards adequately compensating the communities that host public lands.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the concerns American workers and small businesses have with fuel prices. The majority party in Congress has offered the American people no real solutions to lower fuel costs.

   Gas prices have risen 50 percent since Democrats took control. Was it the comprehensive energy bill passed last December?

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Gas prices have risen 50 percent since Democrats took control. Was it the comprehensive energy bill passed last December? Gas prices have risen 7.6 percent and diesel has risen 16 percent since December's highly touted energy bill passed. 
   Earlier today, I heard on this floor one member of the majority blame others for the increases of the last 16 months. We would hate to take responsibility around here, wouldn't we? To make matters worse, Democrats are actually rallying behind a plan to increase the gas tax by 50 cents per gallon. 
   Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Nevada, gasoline is already on average $3.60 a gallon. This is well over $1 per gallon over what it was when the current majority party took control of Congress. 
   In the course of holding a number of town hall meetings over the last 16 months, I have spoken to small business owners and more than 100,000 households across my district. During these town hall meetings, I have asked the question, do you support the proposed 50 cent per gallon gasoline tax? Roughly 82 percent of Nevadans asked about this proposal oppose this tax increase. If passed, this gas tax would be devastating for each of the 204,000 small businesses in my home State. 
   High gasoline and diesel prices are affecting everything and have contributed in part to the rising costs of food and commodities. Increased food prices this year have resulted in a financial burden for many, including small businesses, seniors on Social Security or fixed incomes, and other low-income families. Prices for beef, bakery products and eggs are up sharply. 
   Several factors have affected food prices, Mr. Speaker, but the most damaging are the gasoline and diesel prices for the operation of equipment and transportation of food to the market. 
   Our solution to this problem is economics, supply and demand. We need to increase supply, and to that end exploration and production must be increased, including domestically. Refineries need to be built and energy sources expanded, including alternative fuel technology. 
   Mr. Speaker, in this light I offer my motion to recommit, which will help research ways to lower the price of fuel for Americans and small businesses. This motion simply states that the energy-related research topics in this bill should also include projects that have potential to lower gas and diesel costs. 
   It is critical that Congress act on this issue of high fuel prices now, not only to help American workers have a better way of life, but to help our struggling small businesses. 
   Mr. Speaker, on that note, I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Porter-Heller-Berkley amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008. This amendment would strike the funding for the proposed Yucca Mountain site, and help end this enormous financial disaster for the taxpayers and for Nevada. 
   Colleagues, Yucca Mountain is in my district, Nevada's Second District. 
   Our State has been dealing with this issue for literally decades, the Federal Government has spent billions of dollars, and we are frankly almost no closer today to opening this site than we were years ago. 
   As has been stated by my Nevada colleagues, over the past 20 years the proposed site has suffered from gross mismanagement, faulty science and research, and contract mismanagement. 
   But we aren't just opposed to this site in an arbitrary manner. In fact, a number of solutions exist that are acceptable and safer, like dry-cask storage for example. 
   If you're opposed to nuclear waste traveling through your communities, creating safety and security hazards in your neighborhoods, then you should support this amendment. 
   If you're concerned about the taxpayers, wasting their funds, and the wise stewardship of Federal tax dollars, then support this amendment. 
   Both Senators, the Governor and the House delegation are united in opposition to Yucca Mountain. That should send a very clear message to us here in the House about the opposition in Nevada. 
   Support the Porter-Heller-Berkley amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. HELLER of Nevada. (CARL SANDBURG HOME NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE BOUNDARY REVISION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Mr. Chairman, in the spirit of my colleague from Utah, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 1100 that will allow for the expansion of the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site, provided that it is acquired from willing sellers by donation, purchased with donated funds, or exchange. 
   As those of us from public land States know all too well, public funding for lands management is insufficient to adequately manage the current Federal estate. Nearly 85 percent of my home State of Nevada is controlled by the Federal Government. In Nevada, we have vast management needs. We need funding for important priorities like the management of wild horses and burros, wildfire mitigation and management, endangered species, and rangeland and habitat restoration, to just name a few. And I know this is the case across much of the West. 
   We need to be cognizant of the fact that every time we add to the Federal estate, it spreads our already limited resources even thinner. As a result, Mr. Chairman, any additions to the Federal estate must be carefully debated and have demonstrable necessities of Federal protection. 
   This bill was reported out of committee, Mr. Chairman, with an estimated price tag of $2.25 million. Since that time, as mentioned by my colleague from Utah, the Congressional Budget Office has scored this legislation and determined that the actual price tag is $7 million. 
   That is no small chunk of change; $7 million can provide energy assistance to over 44,000 North Carolina households living below poverty. 
   Mr. Chairman, $7 million can go a long way to protect veterans in the Asheville veterans hospital, which has been plagued by shortages of nurses and doctors. 
   Mr. Chairman, $7 million would buy flu shots for all of the children living below the poverty level in North Carolina's 11th District for 11 years. 
   And in the context of this debate, that $7 million is desperately needed to manage and maintain the land currently owned by the Federal Government. In fact, some of that money is needed to address the $600,000 in deferred maintenance currently existing at the very site that is proposed for expansion. 
   Additionally, it is unclear to me why this particular piece of property is vital to the Carl Sandburg story for which the park was created and in dire need of Federal protection. 
   Mr. Chairman, during subcommittee proceedings we learned that this expansion enjoys support from the community and local governments. I understand the importance of communities and Federal land management agencies working together, and it is in that spirit that I am offering this amendment. 
   This amendment strikes a balance that will allow for the expansion of the park, but will not take away from the already overburdened budget for public lands management. 
   Henderson County, which is the home of the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site, has determined that they would like to protect the viewshed area. If this is the priority for them, this compromise amendment will give the community the opportunity to show their support by making a financial commitment to purchase this property, with the Federal Government ultimately responsible for management. I believe that local support can  make this compromise I am proposing a reality. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment allows for my colleague's constituents to achieve their goal while protecting the budgets of our Federal land management agencies, who have a difficult time managing the lands they already own. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and its wise use of Federal resources. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HELLER of Nevada. (CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, it's a great honor to rise today to support passage of legislation honoring the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the minting of a commemorative $1 coin. 
   It is a particular honor to be working on a bill sponsored by one of the heroes of the civil rights movement, Congressman JOHN LEWIS and my colleague DEBORAH PRYCE. 
   Madam Speaker, the Civil Rights Act is widely recognized as one of the most effective, influential pieces of legislation passed by the United States Congress in the last century. The statute helped dismantle the insidious system of legalized discrimination in voting and public accommodations in America and served as a model for subsequent civil rights laws. Equally important, the Civil Rights Act helped America belatedly reach the promise put forth by our Founding Fathers, that all men are indeed created equal. 
   The Act is the bedrock for the America we know today, a Nation that recognizes the equal rights of the disabled, women, the elderly, minority citizens, and other groups as invaluable contributors to our society, and all inherently equally deserving of the protections afforded by our Constitution. 
   The bill before us today provides for the minting of a Civil Rights Commemorative Coin, with the proceeds expected to raise up to $2.5 million for the United Negro College Fund, providing scholarships and internships for minority students and assisting our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. As the bill honors our Nation's past, it helps to fund our Nation's future. 
   Madam Speaker, it is a great honor for me to be joined in this legislative effort by Congressman JOHN LEWIS. Mr. Lewis, the principal sponsor, is a man whose courage, thoughtful advocacy, and leadership in the struggle for civil rights speaks for itself. His brave leadership in the first Selma to Montgomery march, and his support for nonviolent revolution in the face of the brutal attacks of that fateful Sunday are the very acts of courage the coin seeks to honor for future generations. 
   It is especially auspicious that we are taking up the bill this week, because Friday marks the tragic 40th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, we can help honor his legacy and his indelible and inalterable imprint on America by authorizing a tribute to his historic works in the form of a commemorative coin. While it is but a small tribute to a man who gave his life for our betterment, it is a permanent statement of gratitude from a Nation forever thankful for his vision, compassion, and determination. 
   Madam Speaker, pick up any newspaper in the country and you will see that the topic of race relations continues to be an important part of our American dialogue. But we should not be a Nation that hides from its past. We cannot sweep our past mistakes under the rug and refrain from debate on topics that we might find uncomfortable. Rather, we must know that the fight for equality for all is never ending and that recognizing and understanding our Nation's past is critical if we are to ensure a just America for all in the future. 
   The fight for civil rights continues, and the Civil Rights Commemorative Coin honors both our Nation's historic struggles and the promise for justice and equality for all the generations that will follow us. 
   I urge immediate passage of this bill, Madam Speaker. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this legislation. The matter is a question of basic fairness, but also serious constitutional concern. 
   As a former Secretary of State for the State of Nevada, I have spent years trying to figure out ways to promote voting, and I support the voting rights of all Americans. I additionally understand the concerns of Utah for its population that lives abroad outside its borders and their desire for an extra seat. 
   But I will tell you until this year, Nevada has had a 20-year grip as the fastest-growing State in the Nation, and Nevada's population is about even to Utah's, but Nevada is growing significantly faster than our neighbor. 
   I understand the concerns of my Utah colleagues following the 2000 census; but to give Utah an extra seat at the expense of Nevada would, arguably, slight Nevada. 
   I know the intent is good, but the means by which we achieve them are just as important, and I urge a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. HELLER of Nevada. (DEBBIE SMITH REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote for the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act (H.R. 5057), a bill that I cosponsored and strongly support. I appreciate the efforts of my colleague from New York, Mrs. Maloney, in bringing this legislation and previous bills regarding DNA evidence to the House floor. 
   A tragic death that took place in my District early this year highlights the need for Congress to support the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program at the U.S. Department of Justice, DOJ. As many of my colleagues know from national news reports, nineteen-year-old Brianna Denison was abducted, strangled to death, and left in a vacant field in southeast Reno. Based on DNA evidence, law enforcement determined that Brianna's murder was the work of a serial offender linked to several other attacks in the Reno area. 
   Like a majority of states, Nevada has experienced a significant backlog in DNA processing. At the time of Brianna's murder, more  than 3,000 samples were waiting to be processed in Nevada alone. Local law enforcement petitioned the Reno community for donations that would enable them to expedite processing of samples collected as part of Brianna's case and tackle the statewide backlog. Nevadans contributed nearly $300,000 to eliminate the backlog of DNA samples in our State. 
   This significant outpouring of support demonstrates the American people's commitment to fighting crime through DNA technology. Congress should take this opportunity to mirror the priorities of those we represent. In an age where DNA technology has the potential to solve previously unsolvable crimes and quickly put violent offenders behind bars, there is no excuse for failing to equip law enforcement agencies with the tools and personnel they need to quickly process DNA. 
   The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act provides a vital means of reducing the DNA evidence backlog in labs across the country. I joined 26 of my colleagues, including the author of this legislation, in sending a letter to appropriators earlier this year urging appropriators to provide full funding for the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program. Few investments could be more important to effective law enforcement in the 21st century. The national DNA database has made matches or otherwise aided in more than 51,000 cases since its inception. While the DNA of Brianna's killer was unfortunately not detected as Nevada's samples were processed in recent months, it is quite possible that the DNA of Brianna's killer is backlogged in another state. Also worth noting is the fact that Nevada law enforcement was able to link 30 unsolved cases to known offenders as a result of eliminating our state's DNA backlog. Assuming a similar success rate nationwide, hundreds--if not thousands--of criminals could be put behind bars if law enforcement could process all DNA samples on hand. Thousands of victims and families whose cases are currently unsolved could find closure. 
   Ensuring that all crime-related DNA samples are entered in the nationwide database makes every community in every district safer. Supporting the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program tells law enforcement that Congress supports their crimefighting efforts with the best technology available, and shows the American people our commitment to taking violent criminals off our streets. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act as well as efforts to provide full funding for this vital program.

<DOCNO>Mr. HELLER of Nevada. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2262, HARDROCK MINING AND RECLAMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule for H.R. 2262. 
   The State of Nevada is the fourth largest gold producer in the world, ranking behind South Africa, Australia and China. 
   But this bill is bad for Nevada, bad for this important industry, and bad for the families that I represent. Who here doesn't think that China wouldn't love to immediately see these jobs moved overseas? Who doesn't think that South Africa would like to see these foreign investments moved to their country, and who here in these Chambers doesn't think that Australia would love to see mineral exploration move from the United States to their country? 
   This legislation hurts, perhaps even kills, the domestic mining industry and, with it, the towns and communities in northern Nevada and western rural America. 
   The proposed royalty structure, this new tax, would levy a new 8 percent gross royalty payment to this industry, all this despite the fact that not one witness testified before the House Natural Resources Committee in favor of it. Let me repeat that. Not one witness came before the committee to testify in favor of it. 
   This untried, untested, new tax would hardly bring funds to the Federal Treasury, because when mining communities are decimated, there will be no royalties to collect. Everybody knows that 8 percent of nothing is still nothing. 
   I offered an amendment at the Rules Committee that was ruled out of order because of fuzzy math that my colleagues used to enforce PAYGO. That amendment replaced the 8 percent gross royalty tax with a more modest 5 percent net proceeds of royalty. This amendment is good for three reasons. 
   First, the net proceeds system is modeled after Nevada's proven and successful program. Why reinvent the wheel and ignore a model that encourages production rather than jeopardizes it? 
   Second, a net proceeds system provides flexibility for the mining operation when commodity prices are down. This protects the good jobs in rural communities like Elko, Eureka, Lander, Humboldt, White Pine and other counties in Nevada. 
   Third, my amendment would help prevent significant revenue and job losses for States. Their proposed 8 percent gross royalty, this new tax, will cripple States like California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, in addition to exporting our jobs overseas. 
   But somehow, CBO scoring my amendment at zero somehow runs afoul of PAYGO rules. The majority party seems to want to waive this in every other circumstance. 
   This bill, this rule, is simply bad policy, unless you want the mining industry to suffer. If passed into law, the effect will be to hurt the mining industry in the same way we have hurt the automobile industry, the same way we have hurt the steel industry, the same way we have hurt the seafood industry in coastal regions or, perhaps, the textile operations in the Southeast. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose destroying State budgets, oppose job loss in rural communities, and oppose the decimation of our domestic mining industries. 
   Oppose the rule on H.R. 2262.

   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. I want to thank the ranking member for his hard work the last 10 months. 
   I also want to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Rahall, for his efforts on the bill. He was very patient, very respectful. I appreciate his time and energy. We may disagree, but I certainly do appreciate him listening to my concerns and oppositions to this particular bill, so thank you so much. 
   Also, I thank the subcommittee chairman for a field hearing in Elko, Nevada. I certainly do appreciate that also, giving them a chance to be heard. I know that was appreciated. 
   Mr. Chairman, mining is the second largest industry in the State of Nevada, which employs approximately 32,000 Nevadans, supporting, obviously, countless numbers of families. These high-paying jobs and their related services are the backbone of the rural community in our State and other rural economies. 
   I would take, for example, a couple, Larry and Vickie Childs of Spring Creek, Nevada. Larry retired from the mining industry approximately 25 years ago and subsequently went to work for a company in Elko, Nevada, providing miners the tools and equipment that they need. Vickie works at a health clinic for miners and their families provided by the two largest mining companies in the area. 
   Vickie's clinic employs two pharmacists, four doctors, physician's assistants, nurses, lab technicians, maintenance and clerical people. Larry and Vickie raised four children in Elko, Nevada, one of whom currently today works in the mining industry. 
   When this bill closes down the local mining operations, the equipment suppliers and the health care clinics will have layoffs, and, obviously, close their doors. The Childs family will begin to lose their homes. The mining industry will join other domestic industry crushed by foreign competition and overregulation. 
   Despite opposition to this bill in Elko, one of the most affected communities by this bill, the new excessive taxes and burdensome regulations of this bill will kill this industry, and with that industry will go the towns and families that depend upon it. 
   Clearly, this was not the result of the field hearing that the community had hoped for. All of these measures, many of the supporters will say, are in the name of fairness. 
   The question is, fairness to whom? Fairness to Nevada? Fairness to New Mexico? Arizona? I know that China thinks it's fair. I would guess that South Africa thinks that this is a fair bill. I would probably even guess that Australia thinks it is a fair bill. 
   But do you think it's a fair bill to the Childs family in Spring Creek and the many thousands like them? I don't think so. 
   But just like this bill ignores the futures of the families in Nevada, H.R. 2262 also fails to embrace the realities of the future of our Nation. India and China, with their State-funded purchases of global mineral commodities, should make us consider the long-term ramifications of the health of the domestic mining industry. Also, the technological advances we all want in our future, such as alternative energy, rely heavily on minerals and metals. A hybrid car, for example, requires twice as much copper as a traditional SUV today. 
   Our national defense will rely on foreign sources of minerals to build our military equipment. Frankly, I don't want to rely on China when we are in a war-time situation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support rural communities, urge them to support our domestic mining industry for the sake of our families, our economy, and our national security by voting against H.R. 2262.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Mr. Chairman, more hardrock mining occurs in my district than in any other State; therefore, the remediation of abandoned mine lands is very important to my constituents. 
   As many of us are aware, abandoned mine lands are the unfortunate legacy of the irresponsible mining practices of the past. Fortunately, mining operations today are held accountable for their practices. So with bad practices of the past ended, we have an opportunity to focus on cleaning up the abandoned mine lands. And the amendment I am offering will do just that. 
   My amendment will direct half of the revenues deposited in the hardrock reclamation fund to States for the purposes of abandoned mine land remediation, while preserving the Federal Government's ability to fund the national priorities in the bill. My amendment allows the Federal Government to distribute half of the funds as it sees fit. The other half of the funds would go proportionately to States where production is occurring to fund in-place, successful AML programs. 
   In multiple committee hearings, we heard that States currently do a great job of remediating abandoned mine land sites. They often are only limited by their available resources to conduct remediation projects. To give some of you perspective of how effective State programs are, Nevada has identified more than 20,000 AML sites in need of remediation and is still in the process, of course, of identifying more. The good news is that to date we have secured more than 9,000 of those sites. 
   Likewise, in Colorado it is estimated that there are about 23,000 abandoned mines. More than 6,000 have been made safe by the State Division of Reclamation Mining and Safety. 
   So in an effort to get money on the ground to remediate abandoned land mine sites quickly and efficiently, a portion of these funds needs to be dedicated to States where production is occurring. Given that many States have already prioritized their AML needs, we should get funding to them as directly as possible, as quickly as possible. This amendment will expedite the cleanup process that we all want. 
   My amendment bolsters the ability of States to continue their good work on the ground while providing a way to remediate historic hardrock sites in States where mineral production will not generate sufficient funds to deal with current abandoned mine land issues. 
   I would urge support of the Heller amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2246, which will resolve outdated Federal reversionary interests in land important to the City of Reno, Nevada, which I represent. 
   The reversionary interest concerns a rail line that goes through downtown Reno. The City of Reno and the Union Pacific/Southern Pacific join together to submerge a portion of the track below street level as a result of merger between the two railroads. 
   As part of the project, known as RETRAC, the railroad agreed to grant the City of Reno title to the land immediately surrounding the right-of-way for the project within the city. This bill assists in the revitalization and economic development in this community. 
   Title for these lands was originally granted to the railroad in 1866 to facilitate construction of a transcontinental rail system. However, when the United States granted the right-of-way to the railroad, it retained a reversionary interest in the land to ensure that it was, in fact, used to facilitate the building of the railroad. This purpose obviously was satisfied many years ago. 
   This reversionary interest is an obsolete restriction on the title of the land granted to the City of Reno, and H.R. 2246 instructs the Secretary of the Interior to release the reversionary interest originally created in 1866. 
   I appreciate the chairman of the committee, and also Chairman Grijalva and his staff, for the work they have done on this legislation. I also want to thank Reno Mayor Cashell, who came out to Washington to testify on this piece of legislation, and the City of Reno for their continued support and the efforts by their citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. I want to thank you for the time and the opportunity to serve with you here in this Congress. I certainly appreciate our freshman class, the work they are putting in it, the voices they have and the changes they are bringing into this Congress. It really is an honor to be part of this freshman class serving on my side of the aisle. 
   I would like to change direction. You talked a little bit about Nevada and the State of Nevada. My district is more than 1,000 square miles. To give you an idea of every time I go home, I travel about 1,000 miles just in visiting neighborhoods, going to Elko or going to White Pine County and visiting Ely or Tonopah. It is a lot of travel; but it is very critical, as we take these messages back and talk to the people here, what's going on in Washington, D.C., as reflects what is going on in our districts. 
   I tell you, it is a pleasure and an honor to serve here in this Congress. It is maybe 20 after 10:00 here in Washington D.C., but it is prime time in Nevada right now. My friend from California, it is prime time in your district too, so it is a pleasure to be speaking to your constituents and mine as well. 
   I tell you, I want to go in a little bit different direction here. It is an issue that is very, very pertinent, very important for the State of Nevada. This is an issue that was discussed this morning in an Appropriations subcommittee on the Department of the Interior, and that is the issue of wildfires. Living and serving in a district as rural as my particular district, which I think is the largest non-at-large district in the Congress, wildfires are a critical issue. 
   But before I get there, I want to give a little bit of background. First I want to begin with an explanation to those who are viewing this that 85 percent of Nevada is controlled by the Federal Government. A lot of people don't quite understand that, but 85 percent of the land in Nevada is owned by the Federal Government. 
   As some of you may know, this does present many unique challenges to the communities that I represent. Opportunities, for example, economic growth, development, are stifled by the lack of private lands. 
   Additionally, local governments are prevented from collecting taxes on the Federal lands in their communities, thereby inhibiting their a ability to provide funds for important services, such as education, emergency care, fire and rescue, transportation, obviously including roads, streets and roads. 
   I would challenge any State to take 85 percent of their private lands and make it public lands. Take 85 percent of your private lands and put it in the hands of the Federal Government and take the revenues with it. Imagine your inability to have the money necessary for your educational system, the money that is necessary for your infrastructure for roads, money necessary for emergency care, and fire and rescue. That is what we are dealing with in the State of Nevada. 
   For generations, my constituents have relied upon the land for their livelihood. For the most part, they have been very good stewards. In areas where good stewardship was not exercised, Nevada has done the very best it can to restore those lands back to health. 
   Nevadans have an acute awareness of the importance of our Nation's Federal lands. For generations, my constituents have been the stewards that have kept important areas in Nevada accessible to the rest of the Nation. 
   I am greatly concerned by several aspects of the administration's proposed funding levels for fiscal year 2008. Not only did the administration request a substantial decrease in PILT funding, which is Payment in Lieu of Taxes, but funding for other functions is unfortunately low, including zeroing out the Range Improvement fund, which is an important program. It gets dollars to the ground to improve range land health. 
   One area where I wish to draw particular attention, and I mentioned earlier, is the funding relating to wildfires, particularly in range land areas. 
   Last year, in Nevada, Nevada alone, over 1.2 million acres, or over 1,500 square miles, were destroyed, causing devastating impacts on the wildlife, livestock and Nevada families. Let me put that in perspective for a minute, 1,500 square miles, clearly much bigger than the District, almost the size of Delaware. In fact, I think it is larger than the size of Delaware, burned in the State of Nevada; the size of Rhode Island, burned in the State of Nevada. You take those States, that is how much land is burning in Nevada each year. 
   Most of the damage to private individuals is caused by fires that spread from Federal lands onto private property. In a State where a mere 15 percent of the land is available for private ownership, we simply cannot afford this kind of loss. Additionally, it is unconscionable that unlike other disasters, those who are 
   victims of Federally fueled devastation received little or no assistance from the Federal Government. 
   This is a glaring problem, and I certainly do hope to work with my colleagues, especially the freshman class here, in the future to right this particular wrong. In order to mitigate the disastrous wildfires we have seen in the past, we need to have a healthy range land, which means dedicating funds to range land restoration and management.  
   A healthy range land will support wildlife, wild horses, livestock, recreation and a variety of other multi-uses. We do not have to choose between those functions if we work to restore our range lands. 
   To achieve a healthy range, we need to advance commonsense solutions that will protect communities, people in our natural resources. This includes the responsible management of wild horses and burro populations. 
   It is vital that we use active management to remove excess hazardous fuels, such as pinon juniper, cheatgrass and other invasive species. They fuel wildfires like we saw in Elko County and other parts of Nevada last year. 
   Since coming to Congress, I have had the opportunity to meet several times with my constituents who have traveled from rural Nevada to Washington D.C., to discuss the devastating impacts of wildfires and what we can do to mitigate and prevent them. To a person, they all expressed the dire need to restore range land health. 
   As I finish, I want you to know that I agree with my constituents. It is my hope that my colleagues will recognize the importance of adequately funding management of our public lands for the purpose of environmental health and multiple use. 
   I appreciate the time you have given me to discuss this issue that is critically important for the State of Nevada. I am certain for the President of our freshman class coming from Idaho, it is a pertinent issue for his district also.

<DOCNO>Mr. HELLER of Nevada. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 99, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Thank you, to my colleague from Texas, I appreciate the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule on the budget. It is unfair, and it unnecessarily limits debate on middle-class tax cuts. 
   Together with a colleague from Pennsylvania, we offer an amendment to ensure that the child tax credit is included in the budget. But the majority won't allow us to offer that amendment today or even have a debate about it. It is a shame that this amendment in defense of the middle-class families was not allowed. The new majority must still be convinced it is their money and not the taxpayers'. 
   Thirty-one million taxpayers will see their taxes increase in 2011 when the per-child tax credit is cut in half, and that is just the start. The average tax hike on 975,000 middle-class families and taxpayers in Nevada will be almost $3,000. We will likely be told that the budget assumes the cost of this tax provision will be addressed, along with seven others, through some vague ``smoke and mirrors'' policy. My western values told me what happens when you assume. Instead, the Murphy-Heller amendment guaranteed that funds would be there for families instead of wishful thinking. 
   Madam Speaker, to my colleagues, do the middle-class families make too much money? Is a child born after 2011 somehow less expensive than a child born in 2010? Is the child tax credit a partisan issue? Have those colleagues of mine in the majority like the Blue Dogs lost their way, or have they just been muzzled? 
   We are going to hear a lot from the majority today about the children, but apparently that is only when it comes to government spending, not middle-class tax cuts. Their rhetoric on tax rings hollow when Congress is muzzled on such a critical debate. Don't assume. Vote this rule down and for middle-class tax cuts for families.

<DOCNO>Mr. HELLER of Nevada. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HELLER of Nevada. Thank you for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the issue before us, the war in Iraq. 
   In this past year, the American people clearly demanded change. I am new to this body, but I know Nevadans wanted me to help institute changes in the direction of this country. 
   As we debate this resolution, I really have to wonder if we have heard the American people. This resolution brought forth by the majority says two conflicting things: we are opposed to the war in Iraq, but we are for staying the course. These two positions are irreconcilable. 
   As I watch this debate, I have not seen any proposals for change. What we are debating today is the same as what has been debated in the past. We stand here in this body controlled by a new majority who campaigned on instituting change, claimed to be the party of change, and has control of the gavel in both Houses of Congress. Instead of offering a path to victory, they are playing politics. 
   My question is, what does this vote actually accomplish? Does it implement new ideas to win the war in Iraq? Will our country be safer because of this resolution? Does it enable our troops to fight more effectively by giving them the supplies that they need? The answer to these questions is a simple ``no.'' 
   As a newly elected Member, I came here to find solutions to our country's problems. To that end, I am supporting legislation to institute benchmarks. I am supporting legislation that will make our troops and their needs fully funded. I support diplomacy and making the Iraqi Government more accountable. 
   The message that I want to send on our troop is, I am with you, and you can count on me.     
   Because, really, we are counting on them. 
   Mr. Speaker, why can't we be for something today, an actual alternative, instead of debating a nonbinding resolution that tells our soldiers we don't support your mission? Our enemies believe America is weak and their propaganda says the United States is losing the war against terrorism. 
   Osama bin Laden's deputy and terrorist network have stated that Iraq is the central front in their fight against American and Western ideals. Iraq is the central front to push their radical ideology of hate and intolerance. These are the real bad guys. These are the people we should be focusing our attention on, not tearing down our leaders, commanders and brave soldiers in the field. The reality is the terrorists are determined to kill Americans, wherever we may be. Therefore, we must take the fight to them. 
   The fact is, this resolution only strengthens our enemies and does nothing to solve or address any of the national security issues facing our country. The stakes are high in Iraq. Nothing less than our very safety and survival is at issue. Nothing less than the lives of the courageous members of our armed services are on the line. It is critical that we have a real debate on the issues and address these points. 
   Let's, instead, together look for a new way forward, for a path to victory and for the best way to support our brave men and women overseas who are fighting to keep us safe. Let's instead focus on what we need to win this vital conflict, not a meaningless resolution, which is what we are offered here today. 
   To paraphrase the late Charlie Norwood, a decorated war veteran, ``The choice before us today is clear: either America or al Qaeda.''
