<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, Exelon, an energy company which provides electricity to my district in Pennsylvania, recently announced a voluntary goal of reducing, offsetting, or displacing more than 15 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year by 2020. This is more than the company's current annual carbon emission total and is equivalent to taking nearly 3 million cars off American roads and highways. 
   The campaign, called Exelon 2020, will pursue three broad strategies: first, reduce or offset Exelon's carbon emissions by reducing energy consumption and operating to the highest environmental standards; secondly, help customers and the communities in which they serve to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency programs and a diverse portfolio of green products and services; and third, offer more low-carbon electricity in the marketplace. 
   The voluntary, market-driven strategies such as Exelon 2020 will help to strengthen our clean energy infrastructure, and they should be commended.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, in August of last year, Congress passed the Protect America Act to close a dangerous loophole in our ability to collect intelligence information on foreign targets in foreign countries.  
   When this legislation expires on Thursday of this week, our intelligence community, responsible to collect intelligence on terrorist enemies, will lose their eyes and ears. Congress has stalled for 6 months to review the policy and come up with a solution to bring FISA up to date with our 21st century technologies and give our intelligence community the tools they need to fight terrorism. 
   Now the House wants to pass a 30-day extension. The Senate can't even agree to that. Democrats in Congress want to empower judges and lawyers in their discovery proceedings and frivolous lawsuits over intelligence needs. 
   The laws governing our intelligence collection should not be dealt with in the same way one pays rent for an apartment, month to month. We need to pass legislation to permanently create a solution that gives our intelligence community the tools they need to fight terrorism that threatens the security of every American.

   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, the peaceful protestors in Burma deserve our support, and the brutal generals in charge of the SPDC must be held accountable. 
   Reports on the number of deaths ordered by the dictatorship range from hundreds to thousands. It's difficult to get specific numbers, particularly as other reports detail the regime burning dead bodies so that no one can get an accurate count of the dead and disappeared. 
   One new image shows the badly bruised and semi-dressed body of a Buddhist monk floating face down in the Rangoon River. 
   The regime has also no respect for journalists. A Japanese journalist was shot point blank by the dictator's troops, and the regime detained other journalists. 
   One senior Burmese intelligence official is claiming that thousands of protesters are dead, and the bodies of hundreds of executed monks have been dumped in the jungle. 
   We must do everything possible to press the regime to stop the killing and detentions. This includes sanctions against the regime, specifically freezing bank accounts of members of the dictatorship.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Today my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are bringing up legislation promoting drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve, a large desolate tract of land to the west of ANWR in Alaska. It is nice that they finally acknowledge we need to access more of our own energy resources right here at home. But I do find it strange that they are willing to advocate drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve, which was originally set aside for the use of our military in an emergency, yet they continue to oppose oil exploration in ANWR. 
   The National Reserve contains about 440 barrels of oil per acre, compared to ANWR's 5,475 barrels per acre. The National Reserve's oil and gas fields are more than 250 miles from existing pipeline infrastructure, compared to ANWR's 75-mile distance. The National Reserve's oil and gas fields are spread out over 23 million acres, compared to 1.9 million acres in ANWR. 
   It is strange that my colleagues, who are supposed to be more environmentally conscious, would wish to drill for oil that is more spread out and will require a much larger footprint to access instead of using the more concentrated oil and natural gas resources in ANWR.

   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, the Secretary of State made news this week. During testimony before Congress she announced that the U.S. will join high level talks with Iran and Syria to work towards stability of the Middle East. Madam Speaker, this is a welcomed step in the right direction. 
   Diplomacy must not be the only option available to us, but it should certainly be one of them. President Reagan understood this principle. In dealing with the Soviets, he never shied away from publicly denouncing their acts of aggression and their disregard for human rights. Even so, he maintained open lines of communication with his Soviet counterparts throughout his Presidency. Reagan did so because he understood a very important principle, when done in the right way, tackling with your enemies is a sign of strengthen, not a sign of weakness. You don't have to give anyone away in order to dialogue. 
   The same can be true today. Talking with Iran and Syria and continuing to promote stability in the region can go hand in hand if done in the right way. This is the right move, and I applaud the administration for making it.

   Thousands, for instance, of Iraqis have been forced to flee their homeland and face a daily existence that denies them even the most basic protections. The military dictatorship in Burma has inflicted such horrific violence on the Burmese people that hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee just to save their own lives. These are just two examples. The list goes on. 
   There are over 8 million refugees, nearly 24 million IDPs, internally displaced people, worldwide. Combined, that's nearly equal to the population of California. 
   On this World Refugee Day, let us remember the plight of these people. Try to find ways that we can help and support them.

The military junta has warned that it may take action against the protestors, action that has been terribly violent in the past.

   ``It is a problem driven by domestic supply restrictions imposed by the Democratic Congress in the face of growing worldwide demand. The Democrats preach energy independence while they do everything in their power to prevent it.'' The problem they are speaking of is $4 a gallon gasoline. 
   The American people are fed up with a Congress that can't seem to respond to one of their most basic concerns. People are tired of Democrat leaders blocking action to bring down skyrocketing gas prices. So we have introduced a discharge petition to force a vote on the No More Excuses Energy Act. We need to increase domestic production of energy in order to bring down the price of gas at the pump.

This extension was the Democrat alternative to a permanent bill to provide our intelligence community with the tools they need to fight the war on terror, and yet we still have not voted on the bipartisan Senate bill, or any alternative bill for that matter. We've done nothing. 
   I believe this exposes the House leadership's plan for what it is, an abdication of their duty to provide our intelligence community with the tools needed to protect the United States. 
   It has been 17 days since the Protect America Act expired. In the words of the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, our intelligence gathering capabilities have already been ``degraded.'' 
   Contrary to what some say, there is urgency in this matter. We are losing out on obtaining new and evolving intelligence to enable our fight against terror. There are enough votes in the House to pass the bipartisan Senate bill. It's time for the Speaker to bring the legislation up for a vote.

   Mr. PITTS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, another day, another vote on legislation that has no chance of becoming law. Everyone on this floor understands that this bill is destined to be vetoed, and we will sustain that veto if and when the time comes. 
   But, if nothing else, today's debate is at least an opportunity to educate people on the truth about stem cell research. Supporters of embryo-destroying stem cell research would have you believe that embryonic stem cell research is the only way to go. That just is not true. Not only are there ethical alternatives using adult stem cells but these ethical alternatives are proving to be more effective than the embryo-destroying methods promoted by the bill. 
   Adult stem cells can be derived from numerous places, including nasal tissue, bone marrow, fatty tissue, umbilical cord blood, even amniotic fluid. These adult stem cells have already produced dozens of laboratory successes and even a handful of FDA-approved therapies for humans. Meanwhile, embryonic stem cell research has yet to produce a single treatment or cure in humans. 
   You will hear a lot of talk on the other side about how we oppose stem cell research. That's simply not true. I am a supporter of stem cell research. I support the research that actually works, the kind that treats human embryos properly, not like laboratory rats. I support the kind of respect for human life at all stages of development. The kind of stem cell research that I support is adult stem cell research. 
   There is another thing worth clarifying in the debate. The bill under consideration today is not about legalizing embryonic stem cell research. It's already legal. It can be performed in America by anyone who wants to. 
   The bill we vote on today is about who is going to pay for it. This bill would have millions of Americans pay for a destructive research that they have fundamental moral objections to. 
   This bill is flawed. It was flawed the last time we voted on it. It's still flawed today. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to oppose it.

Mr. Khouzam currently  works in my district and by all accounts is an upstanding, contributing member of the community. 
   In 2004, our courts gave him protection because they believed, ``it is more likely than not'' that he would be tortured should he return to Egypt. Even our State Department reports outline extensive torture in Egypt. Having personally heard stories of individuals who have suffered torture by Egyptian authorities, I firmly believe that the court has been right to prevent his deportation. 
   U.S. officials are now prepared to ignore the court's decision and deport Khouzam based on nothing more than ``assurances'' of no torture from known torturers. 
   Mr. Speaker, a former CIA officer stated this week on an Australian news program that sending someone like Khouzam back to Egypt is ``tantamount to condemning them to death.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in opposition to H.R. 2560. This bill is being marketed as a ban on human cloning. However, H.R. 2560 does nothing to prevent human cloning. In fact, the bill allows for unlimited cloning of human embryos but prevents women and doctors from trying to implant one of these embryos to initiate a pregnancy. In practice, this means that embryos will be cloned, used for experimentation, harvesting, research, then assigned a death sentence. So cloned embryos would be required by law to die. Not only does this bill allow the practice of cloning to move forward, it also mandates the killing of those human embryos. 
   The bill before us today is a ruse. It is not a ban on cloning. It is a permission to clone, and I hope no one here today will be confused about what we are being asked to do. The bill's supporters state that this would ban reproductive cloning, but this claim is highly misleading because the language does not restrict the actual act of human cloning by allowing for somatic cell nuclear transfer, a confusing and technical way of defining research cloning. 
   The bill before us is called the Human Cloning Prohibition Ban, and you might think that it does what it says instead of the opposite of what it says. If it did what it said, I would vote for it. Part of the problem we are having is the consequence of having had no committee process to determine what the bill actually does. We have had no hearings. We have had no markups. In fact, the bill was not even introduced until last night. And now the bill that nobody has seen is on the suspension calendar. Intentional or otherwise, this is another duplicity. The suspension calendar is for noncontroversial measures, like naming post offices, not for highly controversial legislation that is a wolf in Dolly the sheep's clothing. 
   This bill is bad policy, and so was the process by which it got here. How many times will we have this discussion? The week before Memorial Day we discussed a bill on Medicare payments that came to the House floor the same way. Yesterday, a resolution on how Congress will handle future ethics  matters was introduced on the same day that it was inserted in the suspension calendar with no committee hearings.     
   The Senate could be forgiven for concluding that the new majority promises for open government are still not being realized after 5 months. 
   The bill is opposed by the White House. In their statement of administration policy which came out, they said that this would ``prohibit human cloning for reproductive purposes but permit the creation of cloned embryos or development of human embryo farms for research which would require destruction of nascent human life.'' 
   That is exactly what H.R. 2560 does. It crosses a new moral line by making it a criminal act to let the cloned embryos survive. To put it directly, this bill would create a class of living human beings that must be killed under the law. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is not progress. It is a disturbing step in the wrong direction. It should be rejected on this floor, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

There were 276 before her who were defective and deformed and died. In fact, the history of cloning is replete with defects, deformity and death; and as they seek to create little human embryos for the purposes of research and experimentation and harvesting and death, we should remember this fact. 
   The researcher in South Korea that failed to identify what he was doing, Dr. Hwang, and his team obtained 2,000 eggs from over 100 women that they paid for their cloning attempts. 
   Human cloning exploits women. It ushers in an era of eugenics. It embraces a utilitarian view of humans. It involves the creation of little human embryos for research experiments. And for these reasons and all the reasons that are stated, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for yielding and for her principled leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for his leadership on this and the preceding resolution, and for his leadership on the issue of human rights in general around the world. 
   Madam Speaker, with this resolution, we rightly honor one of humanity's great heroes. William Wilberforce was a man of integrity, a man of courage, a man of faith, and a man of principle. And he used these qualities, Madam Speaker, to forever change the world for the better. He is someone that each of us in this Chamber can relate to and draw inspiration from. 
   In a legislative body of 435 Members, it can be difficult to make progress on the issues we care about. Indeed, the odds sometimes appear insurmountable. 
   But the life and accomplishments of William Wilberforce are proof that individuals of character truly can change the world. Wilberforce was himself a member of an elected legislative body. He was first elected to the British Parliament more than 220 years ago. 
   In his day, the human slave trade dominated England's economy. As a result, the interests of the slave traders were firmly entrenched in the halls of Parliament. Arguments used to justify the sale and trade of human beings and the horrific injustices that occurred in that trade were commonplace in that day. 
   But William Wilberforce refused to accept these arguments. He knew that slavery was an unspeakable injustice, and he made it his object to end it. This conviction would lead him on a decades-long effort to end slavery in England. It was a journey full of setbacks and disappointments. Again and again, he introduced his bill in parliament to end the British slave trade. Again and again it was soundly defeated, and again and again he was ostracized by his peers. For years this went on, and the discouragement grew. 
   But all the while, Wilberforce's call to conscience was slowly winning over hearts and minds. His willingness to stand for what was right and fight what was wrong was being noticed by his colleagues. And after 20 years of perseverance, 20 years of unbending principle, 20 years of standing for justice in the face of daunting odds, Wilberforce at last tasted success. 
   On February 23, 1807, Parliament voted, and on March 25, the King signed the bill that outlawed the British slave trade, a move that was once thought impossible. 
   And 26 years later, Wilberforce was informed a few days before his death that the House of Commons had finally voted to abolish slavery altogether in the British Empire. 
   Madam Speaker, throughout this year, we celebrate the 200th anniversary of this tremendous accomplishment. And as part of this celebration, a number of efforts are underway to inform people of this often-forgotten hero of humanity and his colleagues who worked to end in slavery. 
   We could mention others, like John Newton, who has already been mentioned. John Newton was a former slave trader who wrote the hymn ``Amazing Grace,'' whose testimony before Parliament was so influential. 
   We could mention John Wesley, who a week before he died in 1791, wrote William Wilberforce about American slavery which he called ``the vilest form of slavery known to mankind.'' 
   We could mention Wilberforce's direct influence on John Quincy Adams, and John Quincy Adams' direct influence on Abraham Lincoln. There are many people who could be mentioned, but this resolution before us today is part of the celebration of the life and accomplishments of William Wilberforce, and are certainly worthy of recognition. 
   Madam Speaker, I would submit this is not merely an effort to look back and give credit where credit is due, it is also a call to fight modern-day injustice. 
   Sadly, every generation must confront evil in its own time, and ours is no different. Around the world, thousands of people are deprived of their basic human rights every single day. Good men and women of this world have a moral duty to fight these modern-day injustices.

What happened next is a travesty and a failure of our public policy in support of the troops in the field. A search to rescue the men began immediately but was brought to a halt because of our FISA law, by the need for military lawyers to jump through legal hoops in order to gain approval to conduct surveillance of terrorist communications. Ten hours passed before they were granted such permission. The search for a kidnapped U.S. soldier was halted so that lawyers could find grounds to have the Attorney General grant special permission to listen in on the communications between the individuals in Iraq.

But the same people today who are calling for Libby's head were insisting back then  that Bill Clinton's offense was no big deal. And the hypocrisy doesn't end there. Where was the liberal outrage when Sandy Berger was caught destroying classified documents and received a slap on the wrist? What about sweetheart land deals or refrigerated cash?

   Mr. Speaker, it doesn't have to be this way. In 1995, the process under the new Republican majority was far more open. Just look at the numbers. The Contract with America was comprised of 24 bills. Only three of those bills were considered under a closed rule. Democrats were allowed to offer 154 amendments to the Contract with America legislation and 48 of those amendments passed. 
   Mr. Speaker, the people's House should be a place where all the people have a voice, opportunity to offer amendments, alternatives, and let the best idea win. Under Democratic rule, that is not the case.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, the Middle East Research Institute, which monitors extremist media, recently reported on a disturbing children's production that aired on Hamas TV. The program, aimed at a child audience, depicted a little boy who accuses President Bush, along with Israel, of killing his family. In the show, the boy proceeds to take out a sword and stabs the President to death. This is a children's program. 
   There is little chance for peace in the Middle East if the young minds of the region are polluted with this type of hatred and violence. Many young people in the region are being exposed to similar messages in their school textbooks. 
   I commend the Council of Religious Leaders in the Holy Land, religious leaders from the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faith who are working together to counter this type of hate speech and violent message, and they do it with moral authority. We need more brave leaders like those on the Council if we are going to create a condition for peacemaking in the Middle East.

   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, common sense says the closer you are to the problem, the better you are able to address it. Unfortunately, No Child Left Behind seems to say the opposite. It says that if you are a bureaucrat in Washington, you understand the needs of public education across America better than anyone else does. Educators, however, know that that is not the case. 
   After meeting with dozens of teachers, principals and administrators in my district, I am convinced that it is time to give our States a choice. That is why I am supporting the A-PLUS Act introduced last week. The bill would allow States to opt out of the burdensome regulations attached to No Child Left Behind; it would let local leaders decide how best to spend their Federal education dollars; and it would allow the challenges we face in public education to be addressed by those who understand them best, local educators. I urge support for the A-PLUS Act

   Mr. Speaker, the latest video released by al Qaeda's number two operative clears that up. In this latest rant calling for our destruction, Ayman al Zawahiri calls the violence in Iraq a jihad. He optimistically states that the situation in Iraq ``is moving from the stage of defeat of the crusader invaders to the stage of consolidating a Mujahid Islamic Emirate.'' 
   He goes on to proclaim that this victory for the terrorists will ``raise the banner of Jihad.''

This is our problem, Mr. Speaker, because the huge profits from growing opium in Afghanistan are being used against our troops. 
   Though illegal, opium production has skyrocketed in Afghanistan in recent years, and the results are deadly. Enormous profits often end up in the hands of the Taliban and local warlords who use it to buy weapons, pay fighters and bribe officials. 
   We must adjust our policies if we are to see sustained stability in Afghanistan. Eradicating opium must become a priority. We must crack down on the drug lords, train local law enforcement, and help build the Afghan economy to provide opportunities for making an honest living. And we must ask our friends in Afghanistan's government to help us in this effort. The safety of our troops depends on it.

   Having said that, the bill we voted on this week took a very short-sighted approach. By cutting the successful and innovative Medicare Advantage program in order to pay for the doctors' payment fix, there will be cuts to Medicare Advantage plans that will reduce access, benefits, and choices for millions of our senior citizens, especially low income seniors and those in rural areas. 
   We can take care of our doctors without cutting benefits for our seniors, our Nation's senior citizens. The cuts to Medicare Advantage were $47.5 billion. This would do great damage to an effective aspect of Medicare that serves our senior citizens. We can do better than that.

<DOCNO>Mr. PITTS. (ABORTION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Thank you. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the practices of an industry that are characterized by death, deception and depression--the abortion industry--and that's just what it is, an industry. 
   Since 1973 and the infamous Roe v. Wade decision, 50 million unborn babies have been lost. Abortion has burgeoned into a thriving industry. At the average cost of hundreds of dollars per abortion, the abortion business is a billion-dollar-a-year industry in the United States. It's even bigger than that internationally, and the American taxpayer subsidizes it. Abortion providers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer funds every year. The U.S. Government subsidizes this industry every year in every budget. 
   Planned Parenthood has emerged at the front of this big business as one of the top abortion providers in the country. Two years ago, this not-for-profit organization posted record-breaking profits. Last year, it reported even higher profits, but at whose expense does this profit come? It's at the expense of helpless unborn children, young girls and women. 
   While the government continues to provide a slush fund for abortion providers, a mother mourns the loss of her child; siblings grieve their unborn brother or sister, and grandparents lament the grandchild who was taken from them. My own words could never fully capture the pain that has been meted out by the hand of the abortion industry. So, instead of sharing my own thoughts, I'll give voice to the stories of so many who have been silenced by the powerful abortion lobby. 
   One woman tells the story of how she was routinely raped by her father. When she was 16, he forced her to have an abortion at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Cincinnati where she reported the abuse to the staff. However, the staff chose not to report her case to law enforcement. It was not until the girl told a school counselor that the authorities were notified so that they could intervene and rescue her. 
   The bottom line is that abortion clinics are habitually covering up abuse by failing to report statutory rape, and we are funding those clinics with title X money. We must stop funding clinics that facilitate abuse and that cover up crimes against children. 
   Another woman from Nebraska recently filed a lawsuit against Planned Parenthood after undergoing an abortion that resulted in the perforation of her uterus and in a severe loss of blood. According to reports, the abortion practitioner began the procedure with a shot in the woman's uterus, and she immediately complained of severe pain. She told the practitioner to stop, but he allegedly replied ``We can't stop.'' The woman was then restrained by three Planned Parenthood employees while the practitioner completed the abortion. She experienced severe pain, bleeding and three seizures by the time she arrived at the hospital. A hospital report stated that her uterus was perforated during the abortion and that doctors had to perform an emergency hysterectomy because of the severe damage to her body. The doctors later said that the botched abortion could have killed her. 
   The abortion industry makes false claims that abortion is harmless and that it is a simple procedure. They often use safety as a talking point for legalization. However, the truth is that abortion, legal or not, is a risky procedure that carries potentially serious side effects for the health of the woman. Unfortunately, the deceit does not end there. The abortion lobby denies the reality that abortion has a very powerful and lasting emotional impact on most women, but real human stories decry this lie. Again, I'll share not my words but the stories of those who've experienced the pain themselves. 
   A 14-year-old girl writes ``This was something I really never thought I'd go through, something I don't want anyone else to have to go through. I did not feel a thing physically, but emotionally, I'm scarred for life. The day it came, I was so upset: the last time I could sing or talk to my baby again. Not even a day after, I'm already regretting it, just sitting here, wondering what he or she would have become.'' 
   While we continue down the path of deception, women continue to suffer. I hope, during this hour, we might remember the lives of those who could have been. We might remember the lives of unborn children who are lost. We might remember the lives of women and families who carry hurt and pain from an experience that they were told would be harmless. 
   Organizations like Planned Parenthood claim to work to reduce abortions, but ironically, they remain the top abortion provider in the country. Every Federal dollar to support abortion providers is a dollar to help the abortion industry flourish at the expense of women, of young girls and of unborn children. 
   As the chairperson of the Feminists for Life, Frederica Mathewes-Green once said, ``An abortion wounds a mother's heart. They will never recover from the grief of an abortion. There are always two victims within an abortion--the baby and the mother--one wounded, one dead.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the taxpayers deserve to know that their hard-earned dollars supposedly destined for family planning services are being used to subsidize the abortion industry. I urge my colleagues to oppose Federal funding for abortion providers and to support the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act. 
   I thank the great leader in the pro-life movement here in the House, Chris Smith, for leading this hour. Like my hero, William Wilberforce, the British parliamentarian who led the abolition movement in Britain because he was against slavery, Chris Smith and other pro-life leaders here tonight are leading the pro-life movement because we're against abortion. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, the House is scheduled to take up an emergency supplemental spending bill to fund our troops in Iraq. But the other side has worked themselves into a dilemma over this bill to pander to their left-wing base. The Democrats have included language in the bill that sets an arbitrary date for withdrawing our troops, whether we have achieved victory or not. While that pleases the far left, the more moderate Democrats are rightfully concerned about congressional micromanagement of the war. So what is the solution? Load the bill up with pork to pressure Members to vote for it. 
   At last count, the supposed emergency supplemental now contains more than $20 billion in unrelated spending. I think most Americans agree that the money they want to spend on spinach subsidies and peanut storage would be better spent on body armor and Humvees for our troops. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill fails both our troops in combat and the taxpayer here at home. Let's stop playing politics with emergency war funding, Madam Speaker. Let's have a clean supplemental.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to this ENDA bill. This bill, if signed into law, will have serious long-term implications on one of our most basic and treasured institutions, marriage. A Federal ENDA will provide activist judges with the legal ammunition to move toward the legalization of same-sex marriage. In fact, State ENDA laws are already being used by activist judges to impose gay marriage and civil unions on States. 
   One example is the landmark decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Court which determined that there was ``no rational basis for the denial of marriage to same-sex couples.'' And this decision used the State ENDA laws in their argument. Another example took place in Vermont where the court ordered the State legislature to pass either a same-sex marriage or civil union law. Again, this case referenced existing State ENDA legislation. Another example is the New Jersey Supreme Court, which gave the State legislature 6 months to either pass a same-sex marriage law or civil union law, and the court cited New Jersey ENDA laws in defense of this ruling. 
   Although ENDA is bad legislation on its face, more importantly, it is just one component of a larger strategy. An editorial in an activist publication recently compared this approach to building a house. It explains that hate crimes legislation is the foundation, ENDA is one of the walls, civil unions is the roof structure, and marriage is the shingles. 
   The author states, ``When all the various above issues have been resolved, think of all the money that would be freed up to focus on marriage. We can lobby the President and Congress on repealing DOMA, while targeting the weakest States to repeal their one man-one woman amendments.'' 
   The strategy as laid out above is clear. ENDA is merely a building block for efforts to overturn traditional marriage laws and to impose same-sex marriage on States. I urge you to protect traditional marriage and oppose H.R. 3685.

But don't be surprised if the new Democratic majority is trying to do so anyway. When they do, I am sure they will have countless reasons for why they should weaken protections for the unborn. 
   But as this debate goes forward, it's important to keep in mind how much Uncle Sam already gives to abortion providers. Planned Parenthood reported record profits in 2005-2006 fiscal year. Guess who helped them achieve these profits? That's right, the American taxpayer. 
   In 2005-2006, Planned Parenthood received over $305 million in taxpayer funding, the most ever in a year. They also performed nearly 265,000 abortions, another record. Keep this in mind as we hear the other side's arguments for giving even more money to abortion providers. The fact is, these groups are milking the American taxpayers.

   Mr. Speaker, while some Democrats on Capitol Hill may not understand the impact this tax hike would have, my constituents most certainly do. Several have written in to let me know how it would affect their families. 
   One woman said it would mean less money for vital health care costs. Another parent said it would hurt her ability to pay for after-school activities for her kids. Someone else said more money for Washington would mean less money for charitable causes. And one single parent told me it would mean, ``less food on our table.''

   I think this is a good moment to take a step back and look at the philosophical difference between Republicans and Democrats. On this side of the aisle, we simply believe people know how to spend their money better than the government. But just look at the legislation passed in the House so far this year: $431 billion in tax increases have been included in bills that have already passed the House this year.

   This budget funds a wish list of spending with so-called reserve funds. On paper, these reserve funds appear to designate funding for billions of dollars in Federal spending. But the fact is they are empty, little more than a clever gimmick to help balance the books, a shell game. 
   In order to fund them, offsets would have to be found elsewhere or taxes would have to be raised. Since their plan doesn't include offsets, that leaves only one option, tax hikes. 
   In other words, the Democrats are asking Americans to tighten their belts so that Uncle Sam can loosen his. Congress has serious fiscal challenges to solve, but tax hikes and budget gimmicks are not the right answer.

   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue, and I would like to thank the gentlelady for yielding time and thank her for her leadership in bringing this issue to the attention of the House. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 426, which recognizes 2007 as the Year of the Rights of Internally Displaced Persons in Colombia, and offer support for efforts to ensure that the internally displaced people of Colombia receive the assistance and protection they need to rebuild their lives successfully. 
   I have worked with internally displaced persons around the world. These people are not refugees. They do not flee or leave their country; they are within their country displaced internally. And their stories are similar. People love their countries. They do not want to flee. But, because of circumstances, they are forced to leave their homes or their towns. 
   According to the United Nations, at the beginning of the year 2006, there were estimated to be 23.7 million IDPs, internally displaced people, around the world. That is a little over the size of the population of the entire State of Texas. 
   IDPs in Colombia frequently get caught in the conflict between the guerillas, the paramilitaries, and government troops. It is important that this body support and encourage IDPs around the world and today, in particular, in Colombia. IDPs deserve recognition. They deserve the assistance and resources as they seek to rebuild their lives. 
   If you travel to these countries and meet with IDPs, many times you will find them despondent, despairing, saying, ``Why don't we get the assistance that the U.N. and the U.S. give to refugees''? We need to recognize their plights, and I commend my colleagues, Mr. Lantos and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their leadership on bringing this issue to the attention of the House.

As we've heard, we currently have a Human Rights Caucus here in the House which does great work on behalf of many of those around the world that simply lack a voice. This resolution would create a Commission that would ensure the activities of the Caucus would be more stable and permanent by creating a budget and a permanent staff devoted to working on these issues. 
   I want to thank all of the various parties that have worked on getting this legislation to the floor so quickly, including the leadership on each side of the aisle. 
   This resolution is aptly named after our friend and colleague, Tom Lantos, who passed away earlier this year. Tom was a survivor of one of the most heinous crimes against humanity, the Holocaust, and he dedicated his public service to ensuring that good people  would not stand silently by while people were deprived of their most basic, God-given rights. 
   The resolution would establish the permanent Commission in order to promote and advocate in a nonpartisan manner, both inside and outside Congress, internationally recognized human rights norms. 
   Our Founding Fathers believed that we are born with certain unalienable rights, namely, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and they established in our Constitution, in the very first amendment, the rights of freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, redress of grievances. 
   And yet we live in a world where people are deprived each day of even these most basic rights. We have a duty, as fellow human beings, to speak out against these most depraved violations of human rights. 
   The creation of this Commission will dedicate the necessary resources to ensure that the Members of this great body are informed on this issue, and have an opportunity to affect real change in the lives of people who need it most around the world. 
   I urge support for this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. PITTS. (TRANSIT FLEXIBILITY -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight an issue of importance to many of our Nation's small- and medium-sized public transportation systems. Outdated population limits established in law in the seventies have caused many of these transit agencies to lose flexibility in the way they spend Federal funds. As a result, many of these systems, approximately 110 to be exact, will be forced to dramatically scale back their operations, and that means not having a ride to work for thousands of riders. 
   In the coming days, I plan to reintroduce the Transit System Flexibility Act. This bill will allow local officials flexibility in the way they spend their Federal funds and save them from having to shut down important bus routes. And it will not cost any additional taxpayer money. 
   Madam Speaker, local officials know their own needs best. This is a sensible solution to an urgent problem, and I hope my colleagues who represent one of these 110 small transit systems will cosponsor the bill.

   This bill ought to focus on our troops. Congress is telling the President you cannot fund body armor for our troops in combat until you give us more money for our pet projects and pork barrel. Those tactics are fiscally irresponsible and wrong. Let's pass a clean emergency spending bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, America has some of the most beautiful farmland in the world. But rapidly expanding urban sprawl is threatening this cherished natural resource every day. In fact, since 1960, approximately 1.5 million acres of American farmland have been converted to nonagricultural uses each year. 
   This week, I will introduce legislation aimed at slowing this trend that threatens family farms and our cherished open spaces. The Family Farm Preservation Act would encourage farmers to continue farming their land by exempting them from capital gains taxes when they sell their land development rights to qualified groups committed to conservation. Without protection from this significant tax burden, too many farmers are being forced to sell their land to developers, and that means fewer family farms and ever-shrinking open spaces. 
   By giving farmers an incentive to continue farming their land, this bill helps preserve the cherished way of life while protecting beautiful American landscapes at the same time. I hope all my colleagues will support the Family Farm Preservation Act.

   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   First of all, I am grateful to the Rules Committee for making this amendment in order. It is a very narrowly crafted amendment. Section 9003 of H.R. 3221 requires residential boilers to meet a series of energy efficient requirements. 
   As you know, the Amish, which I have the privilege to represent, do not use electricity; it's against their religious beliefs. If the bill, as presently written, were to become law, the Amish would be forced to try to maintain their present boilers in perpetuity, creating an obvious and an avoidable safety hazard. 
   Now, I know there are not a lot of Amish; they are comparatively few in number in this country. We only have something like 25 States that have Amish living in them, but I think we have a duty to be sensitive to their way of life, consider their needs when making law. I have a very simple amendment. It will provide an exception for boilers that operate without the need for electricity supply. 
   Simply stated, boilers that are manufactured without any need for electricity, without any electrical connection, any electrical gauges, electric pumps, electric wires, electric devices of any sort would not be required to meet the requirements of this section. 
   I urge passage of my amendment to protect the Amish and their way of life.

<DOCNO>Mr. PITTS. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3, which has been steamrolled to the House floor without any committee consideration, without even the chance to amend a bill that puts theoretical research, and I have heard the words ``a promise'' and ``hope'' and ``we hope,'' ``potential,'' over real cures for real patients. 
   Supporters of H.R. 3 have offered no solutions to two problems that have plagued embryonic stem cells. Even with 25 years of research with embryonic stem cells in mice and almost a decade in humans, researchers still find that the cells tend to form cancerous tumors and can be subject to immune rejection, with not one successful treatment or therapy for human application using embryonic stem cells. 
   In fact, Ronald McKay, an NIH researcher who is supportive of embryonic stem cell research, says, ``To start with, people need a fairy tale. Maybe that is unfair, but they need a story line that is relatively simple to understand.'' That was in The Washington Post. 
   In other words, embryonic stem cell research is a false hope in addition to being destructive and unethical. Patients, many think, will be the last to benefit from H.R. 3. But biotech firms and research universities will reap millions of taxpayer dollars for research that may never help a single patient. 
   However, Wake Forest University and Harvard Medical Center recently released a study that shows that stem cells taken from amniotic fluid are pleuripotent, adding these cells to the growing list of ethical stem cell treatments that are available to researchers. 
   Embryonic stem cells have not treated a single human patient and have not been proven effective in good animal models. Conversely, ethical and successful adult and cord blood stem cell therapies are lab tested and are treating dozens of human patients today. In fact, there are several FDA protocols using adult stem cells for treating patients. 
   The score is zero, not one successful treatment for embryonic stem cell research, to 72 and counting, successful  treatments for human patients using adult stem cells. H.R. 3 is an empty promise that uses old science when there are real cures for real people with ethical research today. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 3 and support the motion to recommit.

And while today's debate is sure to be full of rhetoric about the promise of future cures, let's be clear from the outset about what is working and what is not. Embryonic stem cell research, that is, research that requires the destruction of a living human embryo, is yet to produce a single cure or treatment in humans. Not one. What many say is a false hope. 
   The good news is that there is an alternative that is not only successfully treating human patients but doesn't require killing little human embryos. In fact, what many consider ethical, adult stem cell research has now provided dozens of laboratory successes, successful treatments of human patients and even a handful of FDA-approved therapies. 
   Mr. Speaker, tax dollars are not unlimited. They should be directed towards methods that are proven to work and ethical research. H.R. 3 fails to do this.

   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, recently there have been a number of stories in the Western media bashing Afghanistan President Karzai. One in the Washington Post even raised doubts about his anti-Taliban activities before he became President. This is deeply disturbing. 
   President Karzai has a proven track record of being a very strong ally of the United States and a courageous and visionary leader for his own country. His record of activities against the Taliban are well-known and well-documented. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the year 2000. And in a policymakers' forum, right here in this Capitol buildin g in 1999, he warned us of the dangers of neglecting Afghanistan and the threat the cruel and brutal Taliban posed to the stability and security of Afghanistan and the region and, indeed, the world. 
   This rash of articles is perplexing. Karzai is a leader who clearly holds the best chance of leading his country towards lasting peace, unity and democracy. The international community and the United States must continue to support President Karzai.

   So how has it been going? They started their new openness campaign by not allowing a single amendment to be offered on legislation for nearly a month. That's right. That's right. No amendments from Republicans. 
   Not long after that, they had threatened to clamp down on a basic right of the minority, the motion to recommit that hasn't been changed since 1822. 
   And now that appropriations season is officially under way, more progress. The Democrats decided to take the earmark process behind closed doors and away from the public eye. 
   Closed rules, threatening basic minority rights, secret slush funds for earmark spending. Mr. Speaker, these tactics seem rather closed and deceptive to be taking place in the most ``open and honest'' House in history.

   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, the vast majority of the American people believe that marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman. This most basic social institution has been recognized by every culture and every serious religion in the history of mankind. 
   The Goode amendment protects and strengthens this important union between a man and a woman, and I rise in strong support of it. 
   The underlying bill before us today strips a 15-year Federal policy ensuring that American taxpayer dollars are not used to fund domestic partnership benefits. In defense of this longstanding policy, the President's senior advisors have made clear that they will recommend a veto if the bill reaches the President's desk in its current form, with this item in it. 
   Mr. Chairman, Federal funds have never been used for domestic partnership benefits in the District of Columbia. If this bill is not amended, the Federal Government will be forced, for the first time ever, to offer many of the same benefits for domestic partnership as it offers for marriage. 
   I oppose using government funds to promote nonmarital partnerships because I have tremendous respect for the traditional family. I believe that traditional marriage is the foundation of the family, and families are the foundation of healthy society. The Goode amendment protects these vital foundations which we, as the representatives of the people, should support. I strongly urge my colleagues to support it. It clearly defines the difference in the two parties here in the Congress. Please vote ``yes'' on the Goode amendment.

   Since January, we had only one hearing on the SCHIP program. We did not have a legislative hearing on H.R. 3162, which is supposed to be the Democrats' signature piece of health care legislation this Congress, no markup in subcommittee, and it was written in secret with no input from our side of the aisle. In fact, the text of the bill was not even provided to members of the committee until 11:33 the night before the full committee markup was supposed to take place.

   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to focus on one important failure of this legislation that I think the pro-lifers on the other side of the aisle would be interested in. 
   Since 2002, the present administration has granted the States the option of providing SCHIP coverage to the child before birth, the unborn child, prenatal care and other health services for the unborn child and the pregnant mother. Unfortunately, the bill offered today would override current regulation and extend coverage in the name of the pregnant woman only. My amendment to codify the words ``unborn child'' was disallowed, not made in order last night. 
   Protecting only the pregnant woman could lead to a greater number of abortions. It would make the woman eligible for all publicly-funded services, including State-funded elective abortions. In States with Medicaid expansion programs, this could increase the number of women eligible for free abortions, thus promoting more abortions of unborn children in the name of children's health. This bill's language essentially classifies the pregnant woman herself. It does not make sense.

   In all the media coverage of the war supplemental debate, a shameful anniversary in our history slipped by, mostly unnoticed. 
   Last week marked the anniversary of Congress's decision to cut off military funding for our involvement in Southeast Asia. The result, as predicted, was genocide; 3 million innocent people slaughtered in Cambodia's killing fields. 
   Mr. Speaker, similar warnings exist today in Iraq. Observers from across the political spectrum say a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq could very likely result in a region-wide bloodbath. No one wants to see this, yet withdrawal is what many in this body are pushing for. 
   Mr. Speaker, before we act, let's remember the lesson of history. And we all want our troops to come home safely, but we need to win first and then come home. Defeat, surrender and genocide are not acceptable alternatives. 
   And Mr. Speaker, as a personal note, I'd like to say before I end, welcome to the world to little Joseph Thomas Offutt, a new grandson, namesake born earlier this week, 9 pounds, 14 ounces. You've brought great joy and happiness to our family. May you enjoy a long, good life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, as a Vietnam veteran who served three tours during Vietnam and flew 116 combat missions over there in B-52s, I rise to oppose this resolution. 
   I am sure I don't speak for every Vietnam veteran, but I am sure I speak for a lot of them when I say that when we served in combat we detested the politicians in Washington who undermined our efforts to win, politicians who criticized the war effort, politicians who sought to micro-manage the war, politicians who set the rules of engagement from thousands of miles away. 
   These politicians were anything but helpful. They undermined our efforts and our morale. They made us fight with one hand tied behind our backs. They demoralized our forces and our allies and our families. And, their words and political efforts grated on our families back home. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was wrong then and it is wrong now. Our troops need and deserve our full support. 
   I don't question the proponents of this resolution's patriotism. I question their judgment. What we are debating this week is called a nonbinding resolution. What that really means is that this is nothing more than a political statement. It is designed to send a message to the voters and to the media to score political points, I guess. But this resolution is not about President Bush or failures of his administration, this is about America, it is about our future, it is about our kids and our grandkids. And, unfortunately for them, this resolution offers no plan to win the war, no plan for the future. 
   For months we have heard the other side criticize the President for offering a stay-the-course strategy in Iraq. Now that the President has offered a new strategy, the other side wants the status quo, to stay the course. The American people want a new direction in Iraq, but not a retreat or a defeat. 
   This is a stay-the-course resolution. It opposes sending in reinforcements to help achieve victory, as the Iraq Study Group suggested that we do on page 73 of their report. 
   Now, I am not suggesting that the military is the only solution to winning the Iraq war. It is only one leg in a three-legged stool, which also should include diplomatic, political, economic efforts as well. But it is absolutely an indispensable part of the solution. To undermine the military effort is wrong and will guarantee defeat. 
   The left wants us to fight a politically correct war. They believe that if we stop fighting the war will end. They are wrong. 
   Some of us met with ambassadors from the Middle East yesterday. The ambassadors voiced strong opposition to withdrawing troops from Iraq. They said to do so before the Iraqi Government is able to sustain itself would lead to catastrophe, catastrophe in Iraq and catastrophe in the region. They are right. If we stop fighting, the consequence will be disastrous. Our terrorist enemies will be greatly emboldened and empowered. Countless Iraqis will be slaughtered. Genocide will occur. The terrorists will become even a bigger threat to the region, destabilizing and possibly igniting a regional war, and they will surely follow us home to fight here. And our allies will never trust our resolve again. 
   If we don't defeat the Islamic terrorists in Iraq, then let me ask you, where will we do so? 
   Mr. Speaker, the world is watching the Pelosi Congress. Will we show them that our determination to succeed is stronger than the terrorists? If this war is lost, it won't be lost by our magnificent troops in the field, it will be lost in the Halls of this Congress by politicians who want to micromanage our military. And that is why I ask my colleagues to consider the consequences of this vote and this war. 
   The long-term consequences are momentous. What will it mean for your kids and grandkids? What kind of world will they inherit? What will it mean for the Middle East? What will it mean for our allies in the Middle East? What will it mean for the future of our great country? 
   Make no mistake about this. This resolution will harm our troops who are sacrificing for the cause of freedom. It opposes sending in reinforcements to troops in battle. Our troops deserve and need our support. The arm chair generals in Congress who have never served in combat say, We will not abandon you, while they undermine our troops and their mission, while they deny them reinforcements. 
   This vote is a vote for failure in Iraq and chaos. We should insist on victory in Iraq. This resolution does not support victory, it supports failure. We must defeat the terrorists, we must protect America from Islamic terrorists. Defeat this resolution.

Even as our troops have made major security gains in Iraq, the Democrat majority wishes to pull the plug by cutting the funding to support their mission.

   One of the reasons for the uncertainty in the market is because people know these tax increases are coming. All marginal income tax rates will increase, capital gains rates will increase, the marriage tax penalty will come back, the child tax credit will decrease, the death tax will jump back up to 55 percent. This will hurt the economy. 
   The Democratic leaders have blocked free trade with Colombia, they have blocked efforts to produce more oil and natural gas resources, they have blocked lower taxes. All this will hurt the economy.

And today we are importing processed refined gasoline, last week, 1.2 million barrels of refined gasoline.

Oil refining capacity is just one of the many aspects of our energy policy that we need to reconsider as gas prices continue their steep climb. 
   My bill, H.R. 2279, the subject of this week's discharge resolution, would address one of the largest hurdles to building a new refinery; finding land. By using a few closed military bases, we can jump-start the process and help address our refining needs.

Fortunately for our Nation and our Constitution this mostly Democrat-appointed court isn't the last defense against judicial activism. The U.S. Supreme Court regularly reviews the Ninth Circuit's rulings, and not surprisingly, the high court often overturns them. In fact, in this term the Supreme Court has overturned every Ninth Circuit ruling it has taken up. If you break it out by the votes of the individual Justices, the score is 67 votes to overturn and just five votes to uphold. These are definitely second-string back benchers.

Mr. Speaker, those aren't my words, that is a direct quote from a 1993 USA Today editorial. That was the last time House Democrats moved to give congressional voting privileges to the Delegates of the U.S. territories, and today they will attempt the same thing. 
   While the other side will cloak this move in the language of inclusion and fairness, make no mistake, this is a power grab. Democrats are simply looking for more votes on this floor. They will say this is fair and just, but keep in mind that four of the five U.S. territories are exempt from U.S. Federal income tax laws. 
   What is fair or just about letting untaxed Delegates vote on tax policy for the rest of Americans who do pay taxes? The American public should not be fooled by my friends on the other side of the aisle today. This is nothing more than a thinly veiled power grab, and it comes at the expense of the U.S. Constitution.

   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, over the break I had the opportunity to travel to Iraq to meet with our troops and military commanders on the ground there. 
   Two observations: the morale of our troops is high, and the surge is working. General Petraeus has crafted a highly sophisticated counterinsurgency strategy that has put the terrorists on  the defensive and brought some level of security to many Iraqi communities where there had been none before. 
   Now I know it's hard to admit when you are wrong, but there are many in this Chamber who came to this floor and opposed the surge saying it would be a failure. Well, it hasn't been. It has been a success. In fact, even the United Nations is recognizing the success of the Petraeus strategy. The U.N.'s top envoy in Iraq acknowledged the improvements in security and even tentative steps towards national reconciliation this week. 
   Even for the war's opponents, it is now time to admit the success of the surge strategy in Iraq. But, instead of honoring the great work of our troops, all I hear is silence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, several States held elections this week, and now the 2008 Presidential elections are just 1 year away. This is a good time to reflect on the importance of voting and the integrity of our election process. 
   The right to vote is one of the most important freedoms granted to citizens in the United States. It's a right and a privilege that should not be taken lightly. 
   Our voter registration process needs to be reformed in order to ensure that only American citizens are eligible to vote. It is alarming that eight of the 9/11 hijackers were registered to vote. 
   The sanctity of the ballot box must be paramount. If we can't ensure the integrity of our elections, our representative form of government breaks down. 
   When a person gets a driver's license, they can check a box to register to vote, and there's no guarantee that the person's eligibility to vote will be verified. There are House seats that have been decided by just a few votes per precinct. The American people deserve to know that elections will be won and lost by legal, rightfully registered voters.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, yesterday I visited a waste-to-energy facility in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and concluded, once again, Lancaster County gets it right. 
   This facility is a great example of the kind of ingenuity that we need to put America on a path toward energy independence, and it is disposing of waste at the same time. The plant burns solid waste at very hot temperatures, using the heat to turn water into steam which is used to turn a turbine and create electricity. 
   Ninety percent of that electricity is sold to the local electric utility. Metals, glass and plastics are recycled out in the process. 
   This process is saving pollution from ending up in the Chesapeake Bay. It's saving land by reducing the need for landfills, and it's creating clean energy in the process. 
   One ton of solid waste has the energy equivalent of 1 barrel of oil. Last year, over 342,000 tons of waste were processed at the facility, and I'm told that something like 30,000 tons of trash a day is trucked out of New York City to landfills. 
   Maybe our State and community leaders should take a cue from the people of Lancaster County as we search for more energy to meet our needs.

The House has just passed an excellent bill imposing further sanctions on Burma, the JADE Act. 
   Amazingly, in the Senate, leading Democrats don't want the House version of the bill. Instead, they want to allow for cash money to go to the ruling regime for humanitarian purposes. Hello? Aid that goes through the regime does not get to the people of Burma. The rulers simply enrich themselves with any moneys coming into the country. 
   In addition, certain Senators wish to give the Treasury Department an opening one could drive a Mack truck through so that Treasury could make any regulation it likes regarding U.S. money going into Burma. I hope those Senators will read the reports and look at the photos from Burma.

Some States have more adults on SCHIP than children. Poor children, not families making $83,000 a year, to get free health insurance. Poor children without insurance. 
   Under the Democrat bill, one in three children who already have private insurance would drop their private coverage to get free government coverage. 
   Let's ensure poor children have health coverage and do it in a bipartisan way, not shutting out Republicans the way they did in this last bill.

   First they clamped down on the House rules to expedite their so-called 6 for '06 agenda. Almost none of that became law. Then they delayed an emergency troop funding bill for more than 100 days while our troops in harm's way waited for the resources they needed to do their job. Now they seem intent on playing another round of chicken with the President over this year's appropriations bills. 
   When you throw in hidden earmarks, slush funds, budget gimmicks and the largest tax increase in American history, it's no wonder the Democrat Congress is currently enjoying its lowest approval ratings ever. Do-nothing Congress? Perhaps now we should say do-less-than-nothing Congress.

Instead of flying all the way to the Middle East, perhaps he should have made the short trip down Pennsylvania Avenue for a visit with Congress to ask the lawmakers here to increase the supply of oil right here at home. 
   According to the Department of Interior, 86 billion barrels of oil are available in the Outer Continental Shelf, added to the 53 billion barrels available in land. According to the Bureau of Land Management, we have 139 billion barrels of oil right here at home. That's more than the oil-rich countries like Kuwait, Venezuela and Russia have. Last year we imported over 6 billion gallons of refined gasoline into the United States. 
   One might ask, considering these numbers, why aren't we attempting to access more of our fuel right here at home? The Democrat leaders have a roadblock to every bill to drill for oil, natural gas, shale oil, right here in the U.S.

   Many people have taken to calling this $1.38 increase the ``Pelosi premium.'' This Congress has yet to do anything substantive to help American families who are paying nearly $4 a gallon at the pump. 
   The Democrats in Congress have been voting against increasing domestic oil and natural gas production as well as domestic refining capacity for years. This is a matter of supply and demand. We have billions of barrels of oil in Alaska and in the deep waters off the Outer Continental Shelf right here in the United States. Yet, due mostly to the Democratic opposition, we have been unable to access these vast resources. We should take steps now to increase production.

   On June 13, 1942, four armed German spies came ashore on the beaches of Long Island, New York. Four days later, four more spies came ashore at Jacksonville, Florida. All were sent to sabotage American defense sites. All eight were quickly captured, tried by military tribunal, not civilian courts. Less than a month later, their cases began, and by August 4, all were convicted. 
   Sixty-six years later, almost to the day, the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision declared that foreign terrorists captured on foreign soil possess more rights under our Constitution than those Nazi spies sent here to ambush our domestic defenses. 
   I believe history will no doubt judge that this flawed Supreme Court decision has left the United States less safe as a result.

   Planned Parenthood claims to work to reduce abortions, but happens to be the number one abortion provider in this country. This raises an obvious question: Why are taxpayer dollars being used to subsidize the largest abortion supplier in the United States? 
   Planned Parenthood clinics receive funding in the name of their family planning services; however, there are many clinics in which family planning and abortion services are co-located in the same building, share a common set of basic resources, out one door and into the other. 
   Abortion services generate more net revenue when clinics can rely on Federal dollars to pay for lighting, heating, building maintenance, and even rent. Planned Parenthood receives a recordbreaking $305 million in taxpayer funding, and they made record profits last year. And what did they do with those record profits last year? Planned Parenthood performed 265,000 abortions, the most ever in a year. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this Federal backdoor subsidy of Planned Parenthood, the world's largest abortion provider, and support the Pence amendment.

   Mr. Speaker, in case anyone is having trouble following this, let's summarize: by rejecting this amendment, Democrats saw fit to provide greater protections to birds than to minor girls and their parents and unborn children.

Opinion polls have long shown overwhelming opposition to this gruesome and horrific procedure, and in response, Congress acted to ban partial birth abortion, passing the ban two times during the Clinton administration only to have it vetoed by President Clinton both times. In 2003, Congress passed the ban again with bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate, and this time it was signed into law by President Bush. 
   Unable to win through the democratic process, proponents of abortion-on-demand took to the courts, and for years their efforts delayed a final decision, leaving unborn children without protection from this gruesome procedure. 
   Thankfully, yesterday's decision ends the uncertainty, and this ruling protects America's unborn children from a barbaric, grisly procedure that has no place in a civilized society.

But we do know that not only does the SPDC regime refuse to allow democracy and engages in ethnic cleansing, it also deliberately, as policy, targets children for military recruitment, training, and battle. 
   Children are targeted simply walking down the street or waiting for a train. If they don't have their ID cards, so-called ``recruiters'' tell the children they will be sent to prison or they can join the army. If the children try to run away, they are severely punished. 
   Children are also forced by the SPDC to participate in human rights violations such as burning down villages or shooting villagers on sight, women and children included.

Taking enemy combatants from before military tribunals and putting them before civilian judges is a mistake. 
   Justice Scalia, who wrote a dissenting opinion to the 5-4 decision, said, ``America is at war with radical Islamists. The game of bait-and-switch that today's opinion plays upon the Nation's commander-in-chief will make the war harder on us. It will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.'' 
   Chief Justice Roberts said, ``Today the Court strikes down as inadequate the most generous set of procedure protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I believe history will judge the five Justices who supported this policy to be mistaken.

This stockpile of concentrated natural uranium, which is a seed material for higher-grade uranium enrichment, was shipped out of Iraq aboard U.S. cargo planes, then shipped across two oceans, finally arriving in Canada where it will be used by a Canadian firm for nuclear power. 
   The operation was an important step in ridding Iraq of the last vestiges of Saddam Hussein's one-time nuclear program, and it removed the uranium from the possibility of falling into the hands of insurgents or smugglers crossing into Iran to sell it for use in producing nuclear weapons. This issue certainly has not received much attention in the mainstream press, but it is important news the American people should know.

   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, United Nations program on HIV/AIDS report estimates that there are 40 million people infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide, and like everyone else, I am deeply saddened by this reality. 
   However, I am also filled with hope because recent eviden ce indicates that the current prevention strategy is helping to produce behavioral change that has significantly decreased people's risk of contracting this deadly disease. 
   The current HIV/AIDS prevention strategy was carefully crafted in the PEPFAR authorization bill to reflect a balanced approach, and the good news is that this balanced approach is working. 
   The PEPFAR authorization bill, which became law in 2003, included a provision that required one-third of the 20 percent for prevention funding , that is approximately 7 percent of the total PEPFAR funds, to be spent on abstinence and fidelity programs. 
   Prior to the implementation of this spending directive, the U.S. promoted an unbalanced condoms-only approach. The U.S. remains the largest distributor of condoms in the world. But for the first time the behavior factor is getting real attention under the current program rules. And the result: falling HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in 7 of the 15 focus countries. 
   The current prevention strategy i s based on the comprehensive ABC model, first established in Uganda, developed by Uganda. The ABC model stands for A, abstinence; B, be faithful; C, condoms. A comprehensive, balanced approach. 
   After implementation of this model in Uganda, the number of young males age 15 to 24 reporting premarital sex decreased from 60 percent in 1989 to 23 percent in 1995. For females, the decline was 53 percent to 16 percent. The program actually helped change the behavior in women and men, a fact I hope my colleague s take seriously. 
   Opponents of this approach claim that behavioral change is unrealistic. Dr. Edward Green, a researcher at Harvard University, was an opponent of the ABC model and in particular of abstinence until he saw what happened in Uganda. He testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee saying: ``Many of us in the AIDS and public health communities did not believe that abstinence or delay and faithfulness were realistic goals. It now seems we were wrong.'' 
   Not only has Uganda seen a soc iety transformed by behavioral change, we can now add Kenya, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Namibia, Tanzania, and Zambia to the list of countries that are experiencing a decrease in HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. 
   Experts continue to testify to the fact that behavioral change continues to be the key indicator of HIV/AIDS prevention. Yet for some reason, some of my colleagues have decided to make a crucial provision of this successful strategy optional. This crucial provision ensures that the ``abstinence'' and ``be fa ithful'' components are incorporated into the approach. Never mind the fact that PEPFAR is expected to be reauthorized later this year, and never mind the fact that the reauthorization might be the more appropriate forum to debate this critical component that was agreed to. 
   Some of my colleagues argue that we need a comprehensive approach, but I remind them that abstinence and fidelity education are fundamental to the comprehensive ABC approach. 
   Some of my colleagues argue that we need an approach t hat saves lives. I remind them that the ABC model, with the A and the B spending requirement intact, is continuing to save more and more lives. In countries that have relied predominantly on condom distribution, HIV/AIDS prevalence rates have not improved. Meanwhile, countries that promote behavioral change have seen significant improvement. 
   Mr. Chairman, a balanced, evidence-based approach is essential if we are going to effectively fight HIV/AIDS in Africa. The current policy is the balanced approach. It is the evidence-based approach. It is the approach that is working. Why change what works? 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment and keep abstinence and fidelity in the AIDS program, and in doing so, to vote for an approach that is saving lives. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Well, the buck stops here in Congress, and we told them in 2003 to do what works, and it's working. Without this amendment, this bill will allow them to go back to the failed policies of the passed. So many on the other side are saying we need to listen to the other experts on the ground; we need to follow their advice. 
   That's true. They even raise this point with the Centers for Disease Control in a letter signed by several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, including the distinguished subcommittee chairwoman, Mrs. Lowey. That letter highlighted the report that was written by the world's leading HIV/AIDS experts, was endorsed by more than 100 leaders from 36 countries, people like the President of Uganda, people like Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the HIV/AIDS director of the World Health Organization, researchers from Johns Hopkins and other leading medical institutions. 
   Allow me to quote from what these people, the experts, are saying about what's working to reduce AIDS prevalence: ``When targeting young people for those who have not started sexual activity, the first priority should be to encourage abstinence or delay of sexual onset, hence emphasizing risk avoidance as the best way to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, as well as unwanted pregnancies.'' Abstinence, behavior change, that is what the experts are stressing. I agree, the experts know best.

   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the Lowey amendment because it does not address the underlying problem. Whether we support pro-abortion organizations through cash donations or items of cash value, the result is the same. The amendment before us today attempts to undermine the Mexico City policy. The Mexico City policy exists to draw a bright line between U.S. family planning policy and abortion. However, it appears that there are some out there who wish to blur this line. Mr. Chairman, a blurred line is what leads to coercive ab ortions and forced sterilizations. 
   The Mexico City policy is critical for several reasons. First, money is fungible. Every U.S. tax dollar or commodity that goes to an abortion provider frees up funds to pay for more abortions and more pro-abortion lobbying. Secondly, our population grantees are seen as representatives of the United States in the countries in which we operate. When organizations prominently associated with United States family planning programs perform and promote abortions, people in t hese countries logically associate these activities with the United States. 
   It is important to note that this policy does not in any way reduce funds for family planning. As this chart shows, before Smith-Stupak, there are $441 million for international family planning, including contraceptive commodities. After Smith-Stupak, there will still be $441 million for international family planning, including contraceptive commodities. It simply requires that any foreign nongovernmental organizations that rece ive taxpayer dollars agree not to perform or actively promote abortions.     
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the Lowey amendment, support the Smith-Stupak amendment to restore the Mexico City policy and to protect the taxpayers' rights to neither directly nor indirectly fund abortion.

<DOCNO>Mr. PITTS. (ABSTINENCE/FIDELITY FUND ING PROTECTIONS IN PEPFAR -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, called PEPFAR, has instituted a carefully crafted comprehensive approach to fighting the spread of AIDS. 
   This approach is based on the ABC prevention model that has proven highly successful in Uganda. This model was developed there by Africans in Africa. A stands for abstinence until marriage; B for be faithful, or monogamy; and C for condoms. 
   This approach is working to reduce AIDS prevalence. But the Foreign Ops appropriations bill that we vote on today seeks to gut this comprehensive approach. Specifically, the bill does away with funding protections for the abstinence and fidelity parts of the model. It would remove the mandate for the A and B portions in the model. 
   These are very important components, and these are the most effective in reducing AIDS occ urrence. Just look at this chart illustrating the experience in Kenya, proof that abstinence and fidelity work. 
   I have an amendment to restore funding for these protections in a results-based comprehensive ABC approach. I urge support.
