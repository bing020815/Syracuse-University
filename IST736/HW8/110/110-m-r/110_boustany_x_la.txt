<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE RULES -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague from Texas for yielding time to me. 
   You know, the collective wisdom of the American people is a force to be reckoned with. And the American people are speaking very, very loudly today about what we need. They are speaking about the need for a comprehensive energy policy; an energy policy that looks at all the possibilities that we have. And that is just, in fact, what House Republicans are offering, and I would venture to say a fair number of Democrats on the other side of the aisle want this. But this approach is being blocked by the Democratic leadership, unfortunately. 
   Madam Speaker, I would urge that the Democratic leadership listen to the collective wisdom of the American public. 
   Now this idea about drawing down out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is incredibly irresponsible. We are on the verge of a new hurricane season where we may need that oil. We have geopolitical unrest around the world where we may need that oil. The current volume held in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is just over 700 million barrels, and at current usage of 20 million barrels a day in this country, that is 35 days. 35 days. That reserve, that Strategic Reserve was put in place for real, dire emergencies. 
   Now, some would argue, yes, the price at the pump is really hurting American families, and I fully agree. I have spoken to many of my constituents who are feeling the pain at the pump today. But that is no excuse, that is no excuse for this Congress to shirk its responsibility to come forward with a comprehensive energy policy that focuses on production in an environmentally responsible way by opening the Outer Continental Shelf in Alaska, by investing in alternative and renewables, by looking into clean coal technology, shale oil, building out refining capacity to meet our needs, investing in nuclear energy. All of these things, all of the above is what this country demands and is what is necessary. 
   So I would suggest it is time to quit this irresponsible posturing in this body, and let's move forward with a comprehensive energy policy. 
   This is a national security issue. It is clearly a national security issue. Speak to any of our generals and our troops who are fighting in the Middle East. This is a national security issue. And I urge my colleagues to get serious about this issue. The American people have gotten serious about it. So why are we delaying? What is the reason for procrastination?     
   We can come to a reasonable compromise in this body to deal with all of it. And I would point out that exploration and production today can be done in a very environmentally sound way. My district in southwest Louisiana has been doing this. If you look at the oil and gas industry, in the aftermath of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina when 80 percent of it was out, we didn't have spillages in the Gulf of Mexico. Everything was done in a very sound and responsible way. The evacuation was carried out well, and this oil and gas production came back on line very quickly in the interest of the American people. 
   And finally, I would add that by increasing responsible, environmentally sound American exploration and production, we're creating good, high-paying American jobs, also a very important stimulus to this economy. 
   Clearly, what we need today is a comprehensive energy policy coupled with strengthening of the dollar, and I think we will work our way out of this economic crisis.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker as a former cardiovascular surgeon, I rise to celebrate the contributions of Dr. Michael DeBakey to not only the medical community but to humanity. Honoring him with the Congressional Gold Medal is a fitting tribute for a modern leader and one of medicine's great pioneers. 
   The son of Lebanese immigrants, Dr. DeBakey grew up in my district, in Lake Charles, Louisiana. He attended medical school at Tulane University and served our country during World War II where he developed the concept of Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals. These M.A.S.H. units became famous during the Korean War, but today, modern M.A.S.H. units with the latest equipment and some of the best trained medical personnel in the world assist our service men and women in some of the most dangerous places in the world. 
   Following his military service, Dr. DeBakey began his work at Baylor University in 1948. There, he forged new surgical techniques, assisted with the first artificial heart, and operated on more than 60,000 patients. His success and contributions extend in each and every patient and the lives they lead after encountering Dr. DeBakey. 
   His model of determination, innovation, and perseverance serve as inspiration to our Nation's best and brightest who enter the medical profession to improve the condition of life for their fellow citizens. Dr. DeBakey has impacted our world for the better, and he is highly deserving of the Congressional Gold Medal. Lake Charles is both fortunate and proud to call him a native son. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   It has been almost a year now, and we have had a lot of discussion throughout committees and so forth on a number of areas that would promote green technology, and I want to say that I share your commitment. I think it is critical that we move in that direction. CAFE standards are good. Improving better gas mileage for our vehicles is a good thing. Unleashing American ingenuity is a good thing to solve our energy problems. But we should not be picking favorites. This Congress should not pick favorites at the outset with the new development of all these technologies. We need to be technology neutral in this approach, and this bill does not do that. It seeks to pick favorites, and it also does a number of things that would be devastating to our oil and gas industry as it exists today. 
   Let's be truthful with the American public. We are not going to see energy independence in the short term. We have to manage strategically our energy dependence. The provisions, such as getting rid of the 6 percent domestic manufacturing deduction for our oil and gas companies and our refineries would be devastating to our industry. Getting rid of the foreign tax credit provision as applied only to oil companies is going to be devastating. This will deny the ability of our oil companies to deduct their foreign taxes, in effect creating double taxation on our companies. 
   What does this mean? The big companies are the ones that have the technology to drill in deep water, to improve our supply; the smaller companies partner with them. If the big companies can't do it, smaller companies  won't be able to do it. And what are we going to do in the short term? The green technology that we all want is not there yet. So we have to strategically manage our dependence, and this bill will actually increase our dependence on foreign oil based on a number of these provisions. There is nearly $13 billion in new taxes on our oil and gas companies. This is critical. This is going to hurt our energy security. 
   So for these reasons, I oppose the rule and I oppose the underlying bill. Let's work in a bipartisan way to get a good piece of energy legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, this week the President took a small but important step to lowering the price at the pump for American families. Lifting his ban on Outer Continental Shelf energy exploration was the right thing to do, and I applaud him for it. Now, Congress must act. 
   We can help increase American supply, lower the price at the pump, and create good American jobs. The ball's in our court. Will Congress listen to our constituents who are struggling with tough decisions about where and when they can drive? Or will congressional leadership remain beholden to environmental extremists? 
   In Louisiana, energy production is done in a responsible way. After two devastating hurricanes, employees of our energy industry worked hard to get rigs back up and running knowing they were a very important part of our recovery efforts. OCS does not represent a magic bullet. However, it's one piece of a responsible comprehensive energy plan to lower the price at the pump. Innovative technology, better conservation, and new fuels are critical, too. So let's start all of them. What is holding us up? By harnessing all of America's vast resources and genius, we can give Americans, in the short term and long term, a good energy policy. 
   Let's do the responsible thing. Let's have a comprehensive energy policy.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. I would like to ask the gentleman: How can we accurately know what those reserves are if we can't even have seismic, modern seismic activity done? So, that's the reason to open the Outer Continental Shelf, to at least get the process started. If the seismic shows nothing, these companies lose the lease. That's current law. So I don't understand the majority's opposition to opening the Outer Continental Shelf.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the majority leader. 
   The point is, if we have tight supply and demand, then we should be opening up all these areas for seismic analysis to get accurate information about these reserves, and if the seismic shows nothing, there's no activity; you lose the lease. The companies lose the money. That is the current law, and I think the American people want an explanation as to why we're not doing that. We should be looking at all of our potential resources. 
   We, in Louisiana, have known for a long time how this works. In fact, Louisiana delegations for 35 years have fought to open up additional Outer Continental Shelf and let the States share in the revenue.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the ranking member. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. Frankly, I am disappointed that many of the amendments my Republican colleagues and I hoped to offer today were not made in order by the Rules Committee last night. 
   My amendment would have provided workers the right to have their card returned if they had a change of heart. They don't have that buyer's remorse protection under current law. 
   There are examples in Louisiana where employees tried to get their cards back, but were informed by a regional NLRB office that they had no authority to require the return of a signed card. 
   Now, a cooling off period is standard in many areas of business. We allow it for purchases of homes and cars, but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't think we should allow it for employees deciding whether or not they want the union as their exclusive bargaining representative in the workplace. 
   A few years back, a company in South Louisiana, Trico Marine, became the unwilling target of a campaign to organize the vessel personnel who service our offshore oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico. Louisiana is a proud right-to-work state and many hard-working mariners quickly came forward to protest the tactics used by the union. After eight visits, one vessel officers had to have an arrest warrant issued against a union organizer. 
   But even more troubling, mariners were misled and told that they should sign the cards, and if they had a change of heart, they could vote their conscience in a secret ballot election. But the union's intent from the beginning was to bypass the secret ballot, gain the 50 plus one signed cards, and then publicly pressure the company to recognize them. That attempt failed and the union office has since disbanded. But that is what this legislation allows. It allows a union to gather a majority of signed cards, often under questionable circumstances, and bypass a secret ballot election where workers are free to vote their conscience in private without coercion or outside influence. This example provides some balance to the arguments made by my friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   And let's be straight, there are bad actors on both sides. But our number one priority here should be protecting the right of all hard-working Americans. If the system is broke, let's work together to fry to fix it. But denying workers the fundamental right to a secret ballot election isn't the answer. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1168, congratulating charter schools and their students, parents, teachers and administrators across the United States for their ongoing contributions to education. 
   This week has been designated as the ninth annual National Charter Schools Week, and it is entirely appropriate that we take a few minutes to recognize the contributions that charter schools make every day in the lives of millions of children. Charter schools are innovative public schools with a simple interest in providing a quality education to children in their community. They explore new educational approaches, such as longer school days or an extended school year, and are free from most rules and regulations governing conventional public schools. Every day, however, charter schools face unarguable facts of free-market pressures.     
   Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools must demonstrate the success of their students' academic achievements to parents, policymakers, and their communities or they face closure. From the time the first charter school opened its doors, they have risen to the challenge. 
   For example, charter schools made an important contribution to rebuild and strengthen Louisiana after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, particularly in New Orleans. 
   More often than not, charter schools meet the student achievement and accountability requirements under No Child Left Behind in the same manner as traditional public schools, but often set higher individual goals to ensure that they are of high quality and truly accountable to the public. Yet despite these innovative approaches and promising reports of parental satisfaction, charter schools across the country have struggled through a myriad of obstacles to create successful schools. 
   We should support the $272.6 million included in the President's fiscal year 2009 budget request for the public charter school programs authorized under No Child Left Behind. These programs provide key points in the development of charter schools, helping cover the extraordinary costs of launching successful charters, disseminating their successful innovations to other public schools, and providing financial incentives to State governments and private lenders that help enable schools to build and renovate facilities. These programs have been a tremendous success helping to create public charter schools all across the country that work to improve academic achievement for low-income students. 
   It is my hope that the charter community will continue to build on its 15-year history of providing a high-quality option in public education that is based on innovation, freedom from red tape, and partnership between parents and educators, an option that is giving new hope to disadvantaged and minority families across the country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1155 which honors the recipients of the El Dorado Promise scholarship. 
   On April 30, 2008, El Dorado High School students who received the El Dorado Promise scholarship signed their academic letters of intent for the colleges and universities they will be attending upon graduation. 
   Thanks to funding provided by the Murphy Oil Corporation, the Promise scholarship gives El Dorado students an additional opportunity to pursue higher education. The scholarship provides up to 5 years of tuition and mandatory fees for undergraduate post-secondary education for students entering college immediately following high school. 
   To be eligible for the program, students must have attended local schools for at least 4 years. The annual scholarship is limited to the highest yearly rate charged by an Arkansas public university, currently $6,010, but the oil company has factored inflation into the program, and plans to be in place for 20 years. 
   In this era of global competitiveness, it is increasingly important for students to obtain a college education in order to keep up with the demands of the modern workforce. We know how important higher education is both to individuals and to our Nation. A college degree can be a ticket to the middle class. It helps individuals prepare for good jobs, and it allows them to pursue new skills in a changing economy. Higher education also has important societal benefits. College-educated citizens are healthier, more civically involved, have lower unemployment rates, and use fewer government benefits. 
   The El Dorado scholarship program has increased the number of high school students who choose to attend college after graduation by 20 percent, so it is my pleasure to acknowledge the El Dorado Promise scholarship program for its important role in the revitalization of southern Arkansas; and to recognize Murphy Oil Corporation for its efforts to ensure that children from southern Arkansas who might otherwise struggle in financing a college education are able to attend college. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2929, a 1-month extension of the Higher Education Act. 
   Over the past several months, a tremendous amount of progress has been made toward reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. The Education and Labor Committee worked in a bipartisan fashion to produce a bill that received strong support here on the House floor. 
   Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon have been leading our efforts to negotiate a final compromise with the other chamber, and I am pleased to report that our work is nearly done. While I support today's temporary extension of programs under the Higher Education Act, I know members of the committee, along with members of the higher education community, will be pleased to hear our assurances that this will be the final extension we have to pass. We expect conference meetings to wrap up in the next several weeks with a conference report to be brought back in the month of May. 
   As we move toward finalizing this broad overhaul of Federal higher education programs, our top priority must remain college access and affordability. Bolstering our higher education and student aid programs has long been a priority for Congress. 
   One of the issues that has received a great deal of attention throughout the reauthorization process has been the rising cost of higher education and the high levels of debt that accompany that education for many students. 
   As a physician, I am keenly aware of the unique challenges faced by new graduates in the medical field, who often carry hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, yet make an initial wage that is no more than many individuals with a bachelor's degree. I am particularly concerned that high debt levels among medical graduates may be limiting career choices, and that's why I was pleased to partner with another doctor on the committee, the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Price, to call for a study of indebtedness of medical school graduates. It's important that we closely monitor the impact of student loan debt on all the young people pursuing higher education so that we can ensure the value of that investment is not outweighed by the burdens. 
   I urge my colleagues to retain the House-passed provisions of the reauthorization bill that will help to address our Nation's looming nursing shortage, which makes health care more expensive for all Americans while delaying access to lifesaving treatment. HHS warns that the Nation's nursing shortage could exceed 1 million nursing vacancies by the year 2020. Congress has a duty to address this problem. 
   I want to thank my colleagues, Congresswoman McCarthy and Congressman Melancon, for working across the aisle with me on this issue. This authorization is a long time coming, and I am pleased to be here supporting what we expect to be the final extension before this law is finally renewed. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this extension. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Lebanon is a key ally of the United States and deserves our unwavering support as they continue to recover from last year's war. 
   Lebanon is a diverse country with over 17 religious groups, nevertheless, there is a strong sense of national unity within this country and its citizens often identify themselves as Lebanese before identifying with their own religious factions. 
   Lebanon is the example of what a democracy can and should be in the Middle East and I encourage all party leaders in the parliament to remain committed to finding a compromise presidential candidate. It is important that the process is followed and that a unified government remains in place. 
   Political assassinations over the past several years have continued to plague Lebanon and have derailed the country's efforts to enact real reform measures. The individuals responsible for these murders must be brought to justice. 
   Lebanon is at a crossroad and the United States must remain committed to helping this nascent democracy.

   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 505 recognizes and commends the recreational boating community and the boating industry for their contributions to the economy of the United States, the well-being of the United States citizens, and responsible environmental stewardship of the marine resources of the United States. 
   There are more than 73 million individuals that make up the recreational boating community in the United States. This important industry generates more than $39 billion annually in the United States economy, and provides jobs for 380,000 citizens of the United States. 
   While the industry and the community are important parts of our national economy, these individuals also play an important role in conserving our natural resources for future generations' enjoyment. Recreational boaters act as stewards of the marine environment of the United States and take lead and hands-on roles in educating future generations of the value of these resources. 
   The legislation also encourages the President to mark the importance of the recreational boating community and industries by establishing July 1 as National Boating Day. It is fitting that we consider this resolution so closely to the Fourth of July, when tens of thousands will be enjoying our Nation's inland and coastal waters aboard recreational vessels. 
   I commend the resolution's sponsor, Mr. Klein of Florida, and all the measure's cosponsors for introducing the legislation, and I join them in urging all Members to support the resolution.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, across the country, American families are dealing with high energy prices. Families, especially those at risk due to home foreclosure, illness, and job insecurity face high anxiety about just how high these prices will go. Oil and gas prices soared last year, but this Congress did nothing to address the underlying problem. Some suggest an increase in the gasoline tax, a 40-cent per gallon increase. Now that is a lot of money in southwest Louisiana. 
   Washington must rein in waste and promote energy solutions to meet our energy needs. This Congress should promote sensible policies that unleash American ingenuity to come up with the next generation of alternative fuels. Washington also needs to work to fix our aging roadways and bridges. But we have a responsibility to cut wasteful spending instead of hiking taxes. 
   Let's do something positive for the people. We can promote energy solutions and fund necessary repairs for our infrastructure. Increasing taxes is not a solution. Let's make the hard decisions, because that is what the American people put us here to do.

This was an amendment to the bill that we had in the 109th Congress, and it is my understanding that it will be included in the base bill, and I am very pleased. 
   I hope, also, that Congress will add a provision that I introduced with Congresswoman McCarthy to meet the future need of qualified nurses, which is an area where we have critical shortages throughout the country. And so it is my hope that as we go forward with this bill on the House side we can introduce this language into the bill or perhaps amend the bill, if necessary. 
   Once again, I think it is critical that we get the job done on this. We did our work in the 109th Congress. The other body needs to move forward. We need to complete our work here so we can get a good, solid reauthorization bill that will do justice to our higher education system.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, during my career as a heart surgeon, I saw too many patients who were trapped in a paper-based system that leads to duplicative tests and avoidable medical errors. 
   Despite the advancement of innovative health information technology, America's health care system remains trapped in the 20th century. The need for health IT became even more apparent during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, when I saw displaced patients present themselves in makeshift clinics with little or no medical history to guide their health providers. 
   To date, only 24 percent of Louisiana physicians have converted their offices to electronic health records because many are unwilling or unable to handle the cost. 
   I will soon introduce a bill to create a demonstration project through the Department of Health and Human Services to provide financial incentives to providers and health information exchange networks to encourage the adoption and use of interactive personal health records. 
   Health IT will greatly improve the quality of information and care that patients receive, but Congress should do more to encourage physicians to transfer to a paperless system.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for yielding time to me. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 344, congratulating charter schools and their students, parents, teachers, and administrars across the United States for their ongoing contributions to educational excellence. 
   Charter schools are public schools that are created by teachers, parents, and other members of the community as innovative means to educate students and to stimulate reform in the public school system. As public schools, they must serve students from all backgrounds and educational abilities. 
   In exchange for greater accountability for student achievements, these schools are exempt from many local and State regulations. Grassroots support for charter schools continues to grow, from one school in the 1992-1993 school year, to over 4,000 schools serving over 1 million students in the 2006-2007 school year.     
   The demand is simply remarkable. The charter model itself is playing a critical role in these schools' success. Its flexibility and accountability are allowing individuals with nontraditional backgrounds and relentless attitudes to create high achievement cultures. These charter schools are setting new standards about what's possible and about what we should expect from all our public schools. Indeed, charter schools are shattering low expectations and breaking through long standing barriers that have prevented large numbers of at-risk students from achieving educational success. 
   Charter schools are usually among the top performers in big city school districts and often rival the highest performing schools in surrounding suburban districts. These high performers are setting important examples about what public schools can achieve with disadvantaged students. 
   More and more data indicates that charter schools deliver promising results for student achievement. In an analysis of almost three dozen charter school studies, a vast majority found that overall gains in charter schools were larger than in other public schools, sometimes in certain significant categories of schools such as elementary schools, high schools or schools serving at risk students. 
   Yet, even with these outstanding results, of the 40 States that have passed charter school laws, 25 States and the District of Columbia have some type of legislative cap on charter school growth. These caps serve as blunt instruments that do not lead to high quality schools. Instead of stifling growth, States should focus on providing the resources, oversight and accountability that helps charter schools thrive. 
   We know what produces high quality charter schools--dedicated students, parents, teachers and principals, rigorous approval processes, conscientious oversight and sufficient resources, including facilities funding. We should work to replicate these models of best practices and apply them to local school districts throughout the country. 
   It is my hope that the charter community will continue to build on its 15-year history of providing a high quality option in public education that is based on innovation, freedom from red tape, and partnership between parents and educators, an option that is giving new hope to disadvantaged and minority families across the country. 
   I also appreciate the contribution charter schools have made in ongoing efforts to rebuild and strengthen my home State of Louisiana after Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, particularly in New Orleans. 
   For these reasons, it is my honor to congratulate charter schools and their students, parents, teachers and administrars across the United States for their ongoing contributions to education, as well as recognizing this week as National Charter School Week. I commend President Bush for his recent  proclamation, ``recognizing the important contributions of charter schools,'' as well as my good friends and colleagues, Mr. Platts and Mrs. McCarthy for bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, SCHIP continues to be used as a political game by Washington liberals. Sensible, effective compromise does exist to bring meaningful bipartisan support for this necessary program. 
   The Kids First bill, of which I am a cosponsor, adds 1.3 million new children to the SCHIP program by 2012. It encourages the States to move children to private coverage. Kids First provides $14 billion in new SCHIP allotments, and it includes $400 million in grants for outreach and enrollment. This is a sensible approach. 
   I support SCHIP, and I am committed to ensuring that it is a successful program that helps children who need it and the children for whom it was really intended, those who are in poverty. It makes SCHIP a program for those whom it was intended for. 
   I thank my colleagues, Representatives Camp and Hulshof, for their work on this bill. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in this compromise approach to help put our poor children first.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. He has been very eloquent on this subject. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have to say that I rise in opposition to this rule. I am deeply disappointed in the Rules Committee and its actions yesterday by limiting the number of amendments that we could have taken to the floor. 
   We all recognize that there is a gap, or a shortfall, in the funding that exists to help deal with our water infrastructure, and this is most pointedly affecting our small rural and disadvantaged communities; but I have to say the actions of the Rules Committee and the majority on the Rules Committee really disappoint me, because what we have seen now is politics trumping practical policy. 
   Sure, we don't agree on Davis-Bacon, and having an up-and-down vote is fine, but that is a political vote. We are all frozen in our positions. But we could have taken a chance to protect our small and disadvantaged communities by creating some exemptions. 
   I had hoped to offer two amendments to this bill yesterday, and they were not ruled in order for the bill. One would have exempted small, disadvantaged communities as defined by law from Davis-Bacon big labor provisions in the bill. This would have given our small communities a chance to access these funds. What good are the funds if the communities can't get to them? 
   The gentlelady across the aisle here says, talk to local leaders. I can tell you, I have spoken to local leaders, Democrat and Republican alike, those who favor labor and those who don't, in my communities across my district, which is largely rural; and they have uniformly told me that these Davis-Bacon provisions and this State revolving loan fund will really put a burden on our small communities. It will inflate the costs by 20 to 25 percent. 
   So on the one hand we are saying, yes, let's create the revolving loan fund; let's fund it. On the other hand, we are telling our small communities, no, you can't have the money, because you can't afford it. You can't afford the match. You can't afford to access this money. 
   Our small and rural communities are the ones that are most often in need of adequate waste water infrastructure. I have visited every community in my district. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a huge need, and I want to support this underlying bill; but we could have acted responsibly. We could have created exemptions that help our small and rural and disadvantaged communities. But, no, we have chosen to play politics instead of dealing with good, practical policy. 
   My amendments would have put the power back in the hands of local leaders. But, no, the Federal Government, the Federal Government is the one that has to dictate and mandate all. Once again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to empower Big Labor at the expense of small disadvantaged communities and local leaders. 
   I have to say I am deeply disappointed. There is plenty of evidence. The CBO, as my colleague mentioned earlier, has noted that repealing Davis-Bacon, raising the threshold for projects it covers, would allow appropriators to reduce Federal funds and therefore we could get more bang for the buck. The Department of Labor, after nearly 50 years, has not developed an effective program to issue and maintain current and accurate wage determinations. It may be impractical to ever do so. There are many problems with this. We could have acted responsibly, but, no, we have chosen to play politics. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule. We could have done better by the American public in putting together a bill that would create the State revolving loan funds and allow our communities to access them. But, no, we have chosen to play politics. 
   I urge defeat of this rule and defeat of the underlying bill.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, my colleague, for yielding. 
   Let me just say, we all recognize that there is a funding gap here, and there are many, many needs throughout our Nation with regard to repairing our water infrastructure. But on the other hand, I think it is wrong to play politics with this. 
   When I heard we were going to bring forward a bill to deal with our State Revolving Loan Funds, I was very happy about it. I said, yes, this is something that is very much needed in Louisiana and certainly needed for small rural, disadvantaged communities throughout our Nation. 
   Yet, what we have got now is a situation with the Davis-Bacon provisions inserted into this bill which is going to create significant problems. 
   I know we are all frozen politically on this issue, Davis-Bacon or no Davis-Bacon, depending upon which philosophical stripe you wear. But let me just say, we could have done something better coming out of committee with this bill if we would have created exemptions for poor, disadvantaged, small communities throughout the rural United States. 
   My fear is, with the bill as it stands, it is going to put our communities at a point where they can't access these funds. 
   Now our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about protecting the American worker and making sure that we are taking care of this big funding gap we have with regard to our aging water infrastructure. But on the one hand, if we create the State Revolving Loan Fund, and on the other hand, we make it unaffordable for our small and disadvantaged communities to access these funds, what good have we done? 
   I think we need to put aside politics and let's talk about practical policy here. Earlier this week I met with the president of our Police Jury Association, which is the equivalent of county commissioners. He told me that he was excited that we were looking at these funds for water. But when I mentioned the fact that we have Davis-Bacon provisions in the bill, he was very despondent. And he said to me, basically, that this is going to stifle our ability to repair our water infrastructure. 
   He estimated that it is going to add a 20-25 percent additional cost for sewer treatment facilities in his parish, Evangeline Parish, in rural Louisiana. 
   The bottom line is, we shouldn't be talking about inside-the-Beltway rhetoric. We need to listen to what real leaders in the real world are telling us. I would say, if Members on the other side, if you talk to those rural community leaders and find out what they need and how we can bridge this gap, you will find out that it is not by putting in Davis-Bacon provisions that will weight this bill down. 
   I believe Congress has a responsibility to address this growing need, but at the same time, we need to do it in a responsible way that is going to work and not something that is going to be just more political tit for tat, back and forth. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill because of the underlying provisions, the Davis-Bacon provisions, which are going to hurt small, disadvantaged communities. And ultimately, it is going to hurt the American worker.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, this ill-conceived legislation will halt recent efforts to increase domestic oil and gas production and will further boost our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. 
   The price we pay for turning a blind eye towards our Nation's energy security is absolutely staggering. Most Americans don't realize the hidden cost of our reliance on foreign oil. 
   According to the National Defense Council Foundation, the cost to defend America's access to foreign oil supplies rose to nearly $137 billion in 2006. 
   The majority is pushing through this job-killing legislation that threatens thousands of jobs in my gulf coast district. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can tell you firsthand, we are not talking about minimum wage jobs. Many times over minimum wage. 
   Furthermore, the creation of an energy slush fund with no specific wording in this legislation about how it is going to be used is fiscally irresponsible. America deserves a comprehensive bill to address our Nation's energy security. H.R. 6 is not close, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (OUR ONGOING MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor tonight to talk about the ongoing military and diplomatic mission in Iraq and to discuss the recent testimonies given to Congress by General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker. Make no mistake, the situation in Iraq is the most significant issue that we, in Congress, face today. Our troops on the frontlines of the battlefield, our constituents back home, and the world look upon the actions and the debates in this body to determine our resolve. 
   First, let me thank the men and women serving in our Armed Forces, the diplomatic corps who are serving in that country, and our Foreign Service officers on the ground who all serve so nobly under difficult circumstances. They make our Nation great. And we owe them a debt of gratitude that can never be adequately repaid. 
   There are three observations that I have that drive my views and understanding of the current efforts being made in Iraq. First, the plan that was implemented about a year ago is working. General Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker are leading an effort to bring stability into Baghdad and areas throughout Iraq because they have the flexibility and the necessary resources to respond to changes on the ground. This plan is more than just simply 30,000 troops in country. The troops are placed strategically. 
   And we also have civilian personnel and diplomats on the ground working to help build up the political institutions from the ground up as we work with the central government so that hopefully as the two meet, we will end up with a stable Iraq that has sovereignty that can protect its borders and that can build institutions on its own and that can protect minority rights. Second, America can complete this mission successfully. Given the appropriate support and guidance, our troops and diplomats will succeed. And third, clearly, challenges remain. Both General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker outlined these challenges. 
   The positive trends as a result of this plan continue from last summer, and we will highlight those. 
   But we understand many challenges remain before us, and clearly these challenges were outlined by these two gentlemen before Congress. I want to mention that failure in Iraq would have serious repercussions and dire consequences for U.S. foreign policy as well as for global security. 
   Most importantly, our efforts to stop terrorist organizations would be hindered. Secondly, the ability for us and others to deal with the Israeli-Palestinian peace process will become much more difficult. Thirdly, efforts to minimize Iran's dangerous mischief in this region will be diminished. And finally, stabilizing the broader Middle East will be exceedingly difficult if we fail in Iraq. Clearly, the cost and the consequences of failure are far too high. 
   As Members of Congress, we must listen to the professional judgments of the American leadership we have currently serving in Iraq and work with them to create and support policies that will successfully complete our mission. 
   Congress has a serious responsibility here. These two gentlemen and the work that they have done in Iraq has been outstanding and should be applauded. And we need to support them. And we need to have a serious debate here in Congress on what steps we need to take to continue to support this effort so that we are successful in Iraq. 
   Tonight, my colleagues and I will offer our thoughts on the situation there in Iraq, our reflections from recent trips and how we have moved forward. I want to encourage everyone who is listening to seek out and read the testimony of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. Read it carefully because it is very thoughtfully put together. They have provided an unvarnished account of what is happening on the ground, and it is the most accurate assessment of the situation. And that is what policy should be based upon. This House now has the responsibility to the American people to truthfully assess their testimonies. 
   At this point, I would like to pause and introduce my good friend from Texas (Mr. Conaway). He is a member of the Armed Services Committee. He heard the testimony this afternoon, and he'll make some comments.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Would the gentleman yield? I want to amplify on that. That delay really caused a lot of problems, particularly as the State Department tried to mobilize its part of the surge. It really froze their efforts for a while, and so there was a delay in getting those personnel on the ground to amplify what was being done from a security standpoint. 
   And I was meeting yesterday with SSG Paul Gwimes in my office. He served with the 256th in Iraq. He told me, and I have seen this when I have gone over there on two previous occasions, our men and women watch these news programs, and they watch C-SPAN, and they hear what we say. And it has an impact. We need to do everything we can to support them. I yield back to my friend.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my friend. That is very compelling. 
   I had a similar situation back in August when we went to Fallujah, and I want to pay tribute to General Walter Gaskin, because he was on the ground, a Marine general, implementing this plan through Fallujah. They used their resources strategically to reach out to these sheiks and local leaders and tribal leaders, and it made all the difference in the world. 
   I remember loading up in an MRAP with him in a convey. We drove into Fallujah, and it was the most remarkable thing I have done since I have been a Congressman, because just weeks before, General Gaskin told us you couldn't go down this road without hitting an IED or getting shot at. 
   So we drove around some of the streets of Fallujah and then we got out and walked. And we walked four or five blocks to a joint security station with our marines and with the Iraqi police. And the first marine I came up to at the security station happened to be from my 
   district in Abbeville, and we traded stories and talked about good Cajun food and all that. But I sure was proud of him. I called his parents when I got back and we talked. 
   You know, it just makes you feel good knowing these young men and women are just dedicated and they are doing what they have to do, and they are the best that humanity has to offer. I agree with you, Judge. 
   Then we met with the precinct police colonel who was so proud of the efforts, and he showed us how much success they had had because they were implementing Iraqi solutions to the security in Fallujah. And now Fallujah is growing. The population is coming back. Businesses are opening. 
   I walked into a small shop and met a shopkeeper with his young son and talked with them through a translator. We handed out candy to children in the streets. We encountered a group of young children playing soccer in the streets, another group of adolescents and young men playing volleyball, and it was quite a remarkable scene to experience. So I had a similar situation, and it is really a tribute to our men and women who are down there on the ground doing this job.

And we have seen dramatic results, yet those results are still fragile and still tenuous, as both Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus have stated.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. That is absolutely true and important. Not only that, Prime Minister al-Maliki made the decision to employ those troops in Basra, to take it into his own hands, and that was a huge move, because before he was afraid to confront the Jaish al-Mahdi and those insurgents. Not only that, Muqtada al-Sadr was partly responsible for helping position Maliki in as prime minister, and before he refused to take action against them when they are were doing unlawful activities. 
   For him to take that step was large. It was huge. And even though operationally it didn't go as smoothly as we hoped, it was a big step for them to go forward to do this, and that is a sign that things have changed. And we are seeing a change at the central level as well as what has been accomplished at the local level. As those two efforts merge, we will see a stable Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. That's a perfect lead-in, because I want to talk a little bit about these two gentlemen who are leading this effort on the ground because I don't know if a lot of Americans really know about their background. 
   General Petraeus was a former commander of the 101st Airborne Division, and as many history buffs will remember, they were very famous for the first deployments behind German lines on D-Day. So that group, that division has a very illustrious history. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell was also a former commander of the 101st Airborne. 
   Not many people know this, but General Petraeus has a Ph.D. from Princeton University in international relations, and he is also an assistant professor of international relations at West Point. 
   He is a coauthor of the counter-insurgency manual that our military uses, and that's what they have actually implemented on the ground, and that's why we are seeing this great success. 
   Ambassador Crocker, there is a quote from his swearing in when he was sworn in as ambassador to Iraq, and I am going to quote Ambassador Crocker. He says, ``We have a historic challenge ahead of us. Terrorists, insurgents, militias continue to threaten security in Baghdad and around the country. Security is, without question, the central issue.'' 
   In a very real sense it has been for at least the last four decades. I was here in the 1970s. There was no security. Iraqis everywhere lived in terror of the midnight knock on the door. Neighbors were afraid to talk to neighbors. It truly was the republic of fear. 
   Then came the savage Iran-Iraq war, Saddam Hussein's brutality to his own people, Desert Storm, and finally his overthrow in 2003. Those are all the things that the Iraqi people have had to endure in recent history. 
   This gentleman has a tremendous background as well. In January 2002 he was sent to Afghanistan to reopen the American embassy in Kabul. He received the Robert C. Frasure Memorial Award for ``exceptional courage and  leadership'' in Afghanistan. He was ambassador to Pakistan in 2004-2007, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs 2001-2003, and he has served as ambassador to Syria, Kuwait and Lebanon. In fact, he was at post in Lebanon in Beirut when our embassy was bombed there in 1983. 
   This gentleman has had tremendous experience in the Arab world, as has General Petraeus, and it's one measure of their integrity that they have provided this accurate testimony first back in September and now, to give us an accurate appraisal of what's happening in Iraq.     
   Now, let's talk a little bit about what is going on and look at a few trends. 
   I have a chart here that shows by different metrics, two different metrics, the Iraqi and coalition in purple, and in the blue it is coalition data. This shows the trend line. You can see how the number of civilian deaths by both tracks had gone up, particularly in the 2006 and 2007 time frame, and now as we get down to the end of these curves, you get all of the way to March of this year, and you can see the significant improvement in the security situation with regard to civilians throughout Iraq. 
   How many Iraqi troops do we have there out front now. Currently there are 36 battalions of national police, up from 27 a year ago; and 171 battalions of Iraqi Army up from 115 a year ago. And of those 171 battalions, 112 are taking the lead in the fight against insurgents. 
   When I was in Baghdad in August, I was able to witness the result of training of the elite Iraqi force that they are sending out front to deal with hostage situations and terrorists and insurgents. It is a remarkable display to watch these gentlemen in action. 
   Afterwards I talked to some of our Special Forces guys doing the training, and they said they are getting close. They said they will never match up to American Special Forces and Delta Team, but they are pretty good. I got to witness this. It was a sign that this training process that we struggled with on the ground is finally coming to fruition and showing real results. 
   Next is the chart showing Iraqi security spending. This chart shows in the blue American or U.S. spending in dollars, billions of dollars, on Iraqi security forces. You can see the trend is dropping. We had an upsurge in 2006 and 2007, which was necessary, and now it is trending downward. 
   In green, look at the Iraqi expenditures going up. That is a significant sign that the Iraqis were committed to this process of taking care of their own security. I think it is critically important to recognize that trend. 
   Now I want to address the political, economic and social situation for a moment. It is important to recognize that prior to the brutal reign of Saddam Hussein, Iraq was basically a mosaic of tribes and subtribes, and governance was largely at the local level, dictated by tribal elders, and that is what it reverted to following the takedown of Saddam Hussein. We saw sectarian violence and all the jockeying for position. But at this point as a result of the plan that was implemented a little over a year ago, significant improvements in security have resulted, enabling Iraqis to make progress with their economy. Since the so-called surge began, business registrations have increased by 9 percent. And I know from my experience when I walked through the streets of Fallujah, there were a number of shops open and families were buying goods and food products. We are seeing microlending occurring to get new businesses started. 
   Iraqis still have a lot of work to do with their economy, and reforms are clearly needed to transition from what was a command-and-control economy to a modern market-based economy because clearly this is a major departure from what they had before. 
   Centralized electricity generation is now above prewar levels, still not sufficient to meet the needs of Iraq's growing demand, but markedly improved. Other key infrastructure needs are being upgraded, especially energy pipelines and storage facilities. Unemployment is still too high, and corruption still remains a challenge, but things are improving in those areas as well. 
   Early in the war, the U.S. funded most of the large scale reconstruction projects in Iraq. But now, the U.S. is focusing on encouraging entrepreneurship. This is clearly having positive results. The Iraqi government is now stepping up on reconstruction projects, and they have outspent the U.S. in a recent budget 11:1. That is 11 Iraqi dollar equivalents to $1 U.S. And soon, they are expected to cover 100 percent of these expenses. This is significant progress. Ambassador Crocker pointed this out in his testimony, and it is very important for Americans out there to understand that there is a transition being made where the Iraqis are going to pay this. 
   The National Government has now committed $196 million to fund jobs programs so brave Iraqis who have stood up to extremists and murderers and criminals can learn skills that they need to help build a free and prosperous nation. 
   In July, the Asian Cup Soccer Tournament was held. This was a very important demonstration of Iraqi nationalism as the Iraqi team, known as the Lions of Two Rivers, beat the three-time champions Saudi Arabia 1-0 in their first appearance in the Asian Cup final. And there was an outpouring of nationalism and public sentiment as a result of that. 
   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) pointed out a number of major political accomplishments: The de-Ba'athification laws that have been passed that are allowing mid-level and low-level bureaucrats to return to service; the Iraqi leaders have agreed on a budget; and revenue sharing is well underway to get funds down to the provincial local level while the permanent revenue-sharing agreement is still being worked out. 
   Leaders have reached agreement on provincial powers law which will allow them to hold their provincial and local elections in October. This is a very important development because as I mentioned before, to have the local development and institutions come up while central government develops, as those two efforts meet, that is where we will see stability. 
   When I was in Baghdad, I met with the deputy prime minister, a Sunni member of the Council of Representatives, and he told me that he felt that Americans were paying too much attention to elections at the central level. He said elections are nice, but elections are like the fruit on the tree. You have to plant the tree, let it establish its roots, and grow. He was talking about institutions that need to develop from the ground up to have long-term stability. I will never forget that metaphor because it really demonstrates what is going on and the power of this plan that is in place that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have implemented. 
   Ambassador Crocker said today, in commenting on the events in Basra, ``When viewed with a broader lens, the Iraqi decision to combat these groups in Basra has major significance. First, a Shia majority government has demonstrated its commitment to take on criminals and extremists regardless of sectarian identity.'' 
   That is a significant development that would not have happened even a year ago. 
   My friend from Texas, I yield to him.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the gentleman. We all owe a great debt of gratitude to every family who has sacrificed. This is hard, and every American should care about this and be engaged in this process. 
   I continue to say that the men and women who put on the American uniform are the finest that humanity has to offer because of those sacrifices and what they do. Oftentimes, whether it is Iraq or Afghanistan or some other tough spot, the only American that people in these countries actually get to see are our American men and women in uniform, and they are oftentimes our finest ambassadors. And so we owe them a whole lot, a great debt of gratitude for what they have done, and we should never forget and always stand up. 
   I would urge folks, whenever they see someone in uniform, shake their hand and thank them for the service they have provided, and thank their families for the difficulties they have had to go through. 
   You know, Ambassador Crocker said today, I am going to quote one more time here, ``Last September, I said that the cumulative trajectory of political, economic and diplomatic developments in Iraq was upwards, although the slope of that line was not steep. Developments over there, the last 7 months, have strengthened my sense of a positive trend. Immense challenges remain and progress is uneven and often frustratingly slow, but there is progress. Sustaining that progress will require continuing U.S. resolve and commitment. What has been achieved is substantial, and it is also reversible.'' 
   That really summarizes where we are today and how important it is that we have the resolve to see this through because the consequences of failure are immense. I mentioned that earlier. 
   Osama bin Laden himself has made statements about the importance of Iraq to these terrorist activities. I have a quote here. This is Osama bin Laden: ``A war is underway. The epicenter of these wars is Baghdad, the seat of the caliphate.'' The caliphate is what they hope to achieve, an empire, an Islamist, radical empire. ``Success in Baghdad will be success for the U.S.'' 
   They don't want us to succeed in Baghdad. They want to drive us out. 
   Let me pull up the next chart. 
   I want to read this last one. This is in a letter from Ayman al-Zawahiri, the number two of al Qaeda, to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who headed up the al Qaeda effort in Iraq before we were able to eliminate him: ``Al Qaeda's stated Iraq strategy consists of three steps: Expel the Americans from Iraq; establish an Islamic authority; and extend the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq.''     
   That's important because the countries neighboring Iraq or Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Kuwait, and their goal is to overthrow these countries. That's their stated goal over and over in their communications, and that's why it's critical that we have success in Iraq because, again, we won't have peace throughout the Middle East. It'll have dire repercussions with regard to Lebanon. 
   I didn't mention Iran, which also borders Iraq, and it's a fluid border. And the Iranians are definitely causing mischief, dangerous mischief in Iraq and around the region. That's what's at stake here, and that's why we must be successful in Iraq. 
   With that, I want to conclude. I want to thank my colleagues for participating in this. I can't help but think of a Gold Star mother back home, Yvette Burridge, who's a friend of mine who's son went to high school with my son in Lafayette, Louisiana, Marine, Private First Class, David Paul Burridge who was killed in action on September 6, 2004 at 19 years of age. And every time I see Yvette Burridge, she has pride in her eyes. She's proud of what her son did. She's proud that he gave his life for his country. 
   And we all have stories like that that we should commemorate, those who have given their lives and who have been wounded in this effort. But we should never forget this effort. It's critically important to success in American foreign policy and American national security.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (NATIONAL AMERICORPS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 385, which recognizes National AmeriCorps Week. This first ever National AmeriCorps Week gives us an opportunity to acknowledge the impact of AmeriCorps members, alumni and community partners around the country. 
   As we recognize National AmeriCorps Week, we are reminded of the spirit of service that is such an integral part of our national character. Throughout our country, countless individuals of all backgrounds and ages engage in community service every day to address the common concerns of our neighborhoods, communities, Nation and the world. 
   Our community has seen the inspiring example of citizens' willingness to serve others in the wake of tragedies large and small that touch our lives  every day. But community service is also about lifting a hand to help a neighbor, teaching a child to read, restoring a neglected park and other numerous acts of goodwill that reaffirm our common humanity. 
   Last month, we celebrated National Volunteer Week and learned that more than a quarter of this country's population volunteered in some capacity from September 2005 to September 2006, at an estimated value of $280 billion. These numbers are a clear indication of our commitment to service. 
   AmeriCorps is part of that commitment. As this resolution says, AmeriCorps provides 75,000 citizens of this country opportunities to engage in work to improve our communities each year. In total, 500,000 individuals have become AmeriCorps members since the program began and have engaged in 630 million hours of work to help improve the lives of their fellow citizens. 
   AmeriCorps works closely with a number of community partners across the country, and I also want to express my thanks to those organizations and their leaders. These organizations capture the spirt of service and bring that spirit to bear in a concentrated way to relieve suffering, provide opportunities to the needy, clean up our communities and bring hope to millions. These organizations and the public and private partners that support them provide the needed infrastructure to support the energy of our community service providers. 
   As this resolution states, National AmeriCorps Week will continue our efforts to raise awareness of the importance of service in local, national and international communities, and the commitment of our community service providers to improving lives, strengthening communities and fostering civic engagement. 
   I thank my colleague from Kentucky for introducing this resolution, and I urge its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (COMMENDING THE JUNIATA COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE NCAA DIVISION III WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 216, commending Juniata College for winning the NCAA Division III Women's Volleyball Championship. 
   On November 18, 2006, the Juniata College women's volleyball team defeated their longtime rival, Washington University of St. Louis, in a thrilling five-game championship match that might possibly be described as the best championship match in the history of Division III volleyball. 
   The Juniata College women's volleyball team is one of the great little-known dynasties in college sports today. The program has a remarkable record of 1,100 wins to only 172 losses over 30 seasons. 
   In fact, during the 2006 season, Juniata College did not lose a single match to any of their Division III opponents all season and the team's only 2006 loss was to Division I's Princeton University. The 41 win-1 loss record tied the program record for the fewest losses in a season and was the team's first 40-win season since 1997. 
   During the season, senior Stephanie Kines was named the Division III women's volleyball player of the year, making her only the second Juniata player in the college's history to earn that honor. 
   Sophomore Amber Thomas also played a vital role in Juniata's second Division III national championship. Thomas was chosen as the tournament's most outstanding player as she piled up 54 kills in the final three tournament matches, 25 of which came in the championship victory. 
   I would also like to recognize head coach Larry Bock who is one of the most recognizable names in collegiate volleyball. His list of accomplishments and awards places him among the most successful volleyball coaches in the country at any level. 
   I extend my congratulations to head coach Larry Bock, all of the hardworking players, the fans and to Juniata College. I am happy to join my good friend and colleague, Representative Yarmuth, in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in vigorous opposition to this resolution. With all due respect to my colleagues across the aisle, this resolution does not outline a new strategy for how we move forward in Iraq and it will have absolutely no impact on the current strategy. Furthermore, it is the wrong signal to send to our allies in the region and the wrong signal to send to our troops, those brave, courageous men and women in uniform who have performed magnificently and done everything that we have asked them to do. 
   This nonbinding resolution addresses a tactic, not an overall strategy; a tactic that the President of the United States as Commander in Chief has full constitutional authority to move with. 
   Now, I respect my colleagues across the aisle, and I know we all want to see a disengagement of our troops from harm's way in Iraq. But I would submit that disengagement must be done under favorable circumstances in the interests of our national security. There is no other alternative. 
   Let's look at what would happen with a failed policy in Iraq. Iraq is on the verge of anarchic fragmentation. There are 27 ethnic groups in Iraq. It is not as simple as a Sunni versus Shiia conflict. There are other splinter groups using violence for their own designs. 
   Precipitous withdrawal from Iraq will lead to unprecedented violence, spilling over into neighboring countries such as Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and we will see Shiia uprisings in Lebanon and Bahrain, which have significant Shiia populations. Jordan is already facing massive numbers of refugees coming across the border, putting strain. And Iranian influence is growing. The regime is intent on gaining hegemony in the region, exerting its influence widely throughout the Middle East and controlling oil and gas reserves to use the money to further fuel terrorism. Al Qaeda will consolidate a base to work from in western Iraq to perpetrate further transnational terrorism, and Turkey will be compelled to cross borders to deal with separatist groups. 
   America, dear America, will lose support of its vital allies in the region and our reputation will suffer immensely for a very long period of time, much longer than what we saw after the Vietnam conflict. 
   It is clear to me that security and political reconciliation in Iraq run parallel, and without halting the spiral of violence, reconciliation within Iraq will not occur. Without halting the spiral of violence, our allies in the Persian Gulf and the broader Middle East will be forced to deal with their own political disruption, rather than starting multilateral dialogue that is so essential for a longer standing peace throughout this entire region, whether we are talking about the Palestinian issues, Lebanon, Iraq or Iran. Our allies in the region, particularly, need political cover. I have heard this from numerous Arab Ambassadors whom I have had many conversations with. 
   The ground must be laid for multilateral diplomacy. It will not occur during a spiral of violence. Our allies in the region have given commitment that they will help with Iraqi military training, police training, as well as rebuilding of Iraq and further resources, once the stage is set with security and a move toward reconciliation. 
   So, if we are going to be responsible in this body, there are questions we really need to ask if we are going to formulate a strategy and work with this administration for a winning strategy in Iraq. The questions that need to be asked are these: What are the benchmarks for its Iraqi military? What are the benchmarks for the Iraqi Government, for reconciliation and for internal reform in Iraq? What are the rules of engagement for our troops who will be going over there to assist in this Baghdad security operation? What resources are available? What manpower and personnel are available to our State Department and USAID to help and assist in the reform and reconciliation process so that we can create the groundwork for diplomatic resolution? And as we look at a clear holding bill, who is going to do the holding? Who is going to do the building? These are questions that a responsible Congress should be asking, not whether or not to support this surge. 
   The American people voted for change. This resolution offers nothing to shape a new strategy on how to move forward successfully in Iraq. The American people deserve more from Congress, and, by God, our troops deserve more from this Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (HONORING THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII FOR ITS 100 YEARS OF COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 264, honoring the University of Hawai`i for its 100 years of commitment to public higher education. 
   In 1907, the Hawaii Territorial Legislature established the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in Honolulu under terms of the U.S. land grant legislation. Ten students began classes with 13 faculty members in September of the following year, and the first graduates received degrees in 1912. The university has been growing ever since. 
   In 1912, the founding campus was renamed the College of Hawai`i, and it moved to its present location in the Manoa Valley. Pig farms and kiwi groves were cleared for construction of the first permanent building, Hawaii Hall. Six years later, William Kwai Fong Yap petitioned the legislature for university status and the campus became the University of Hawai`i in 1920. 
   After the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, classes were suspended for 2 months, and University of Hawai`i students of Japanese ancestry formed the Varsity Victory Volunteers to assist with civil defense, many of whom later became a part of the famous 100th Infantry Battalion. 
   In 1964, the University of Hawai`i Community Colleges System was established with four additional campuses. Two years later, the founding campus, now called UH Manoa, established a School of Travel Industry Management and the forerunner programs of the School of Hawaiian, Asian and Pacific studies. The John A. Burns School of Medicine opened in 1967, and construction began on the first telescope atop Mauna Kea volcano in 1968. 
   In 2000, Hawaii voters overwhelmingly supported constitutional autonomy for the University of Hawai`i, ensuring the institution more control in the management of its resources. 
   Honolulu Community College was selected to be one of only six Cisco Training Academies in the country to offer certified network professional training, and Maui Community College continued a tradition of statewide outreach by opening the Moloka'i Education Center. 
   Additional highlights include winning the contract to manage the Maui Supercomputing Center for the Air Force Research Laboratory, and in 2003, walls were raised for a new medical school and biomedical research facility. 
   Today, the University of Hawai`i system includes 10 campuses and dozens of educational, training, and research centers across the Hawaiian Islands. As the public system of higher education in Hawaii, UH offers opportunities as unique and diverse as the islands themselves. 
   UH is the State's leading engine for economic growth and diversification, stimulating the local economy with jobs, research, and skilled workers. 
   I am happy to join my good friend and colleague, Representative Hirono, in honoring this exceptional university for all of its accomplishments and wish the faculty, staff, and students continued success. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 768, honoring the life of Thomas ``Tommy'' Makem. Makem was an internationally celebrated Irish folk musician, artist, poet and storyteller, best known as a member of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. He played the long-necked five string banjo, guitar, tin whistle, border pipes, and sang in a very distinctive baritone. He was sometimes known as the Godfather of Irish music. 
   The son of a successful Irish folk singer, Sarah Makem, Tommy Makem mesmerized audiences for more than four decades. He expanded and reshaped the boundaries of Irish culture and infused a pride and a quest for knowledge of Irish culture in countless others. 
   In 1955, Makem's ambition to become an actor took him to New York where, after a brief but rewarding career in live television and off-Broadway plays, he teamed up with the Clancy Brothers. They appeared on the ``Ed Sullivan Show,'' the ``Tonight Show'' and every major television network show in the United States. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem played to audiences from New York's Carnegie Hall and London's Royal Albert Hall to every major concert venue in the English-speaking world. 
   In 1969, Tommy left the Clancy Brothers to pursue a solo career and immediately sold out Madison Square Garden in New York. His popularity soared, and he went on to three sold out concert tours in Australia, including Sydney's opera house. 
   By 1975, Makem had rejoined Liam Clancy of the Clancy Brothers. The duo worked together until 1988. Their collaboration garnered the pair an Emmy nomination, as well as several platinum and gold records. 
   Tommy Makem's music will live on forever. ``The Rambles of Spring,'' Farewell to Carlingford,'' ``Gentle Annie,'' ``The Winds Are Singing Freedom'' and, of course, ``Four Green Fields'' are all standards in the repertoire of folk singers around the world in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. 
   I am very happy to join my good friend and colleague, Representative Shea-Porter, in honoring the life of Thomas ``Tommy'' Makem, and I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my friend and colleague from Georgia. A little bit about my district. My district is the 7th Congressional District of Louisiana. It is southwest Louisiana. So I am on the border with Texas. I am on the gulf coast, and we have been a long time leader in the oil and gas industry. 
   We have about 3,800 drilling platforms out in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of those are located off the coast of my district. I have one of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves in my district, and it accounts for one-fourth of the oil that we hold. I also have a confluence of pipelines called the Henry Hub which is the pricing point for natural gas for the entire country. 
   We have a number of refineries along the Calcashoe ship channel located throughout southwest Louisiana, so we have a significant amount of the refining capacity that supplies refined products to this country. 
   The oil and gas industry is about jobs. Every time I fly back and forth to my home in Lafayette, Louisiana, I run into four or five gentlemen typically who work in the oil and gas industry, and when I ask them where they are working, they are telling me that they are coming from or going to countries all over the globe, Angola in Africa, Equatorial Guinea, Thailand, Vietnam, and countries throughout the Middle East. 
   I ask them why is that? Why are you out there? 
   They tell me I used to work in the oil and gas industry off the gulf coast, and after the imposition of the windfall profits tax in the 1980s which devastated the oil and gas industry, they lost their jobs in the gulf coast area and they ended up going off and working all over the globe. 
   We have expertise all over the world in the oil and gas industry, and every one of these gentlemen when I talk to them wishes they could come back home and work in the United States, to be close to their families, to work in an area that they are comfortable with rather than being off in foreign countries and having to do all of that travel that oftentimes takes 2 or 3 days of their time, often at their own expense. 
   So getting a comprehensive energy policy is about good, high-paying American jobs. It is about keeping jobs in the United States. It is about growing new jobs. It is not just about the oil and gas industry. 
   What we have been advocating is a comprehensive, all-of-the-above energy approach, an energy approach that looks at oil and gas because we are dependent on oil and gas for most of our transportation needs, much of our electricity, and really for a good part of all of our energy needs. Oil and gas are a critical part, but at the same time we also have to look at good, tried and true methods of conservation. And we have to look at alternative fuels and renewable energy and nuclear power and clean coal technology. All of the ideas that are out there, we should be unleashing individual American genius because that is what has made this country great and has helped to solve problems of the past, and is what will help us pull out of this energy crisis that we are seeing. Families and seniors and small businesses and our schools, our local governments are struggling with the high cost of energy. 
   I talked to a senior not long ago who told me it was getting difficult for her to afford gas and make the usual runs to the grocery store. And she was paying high food prices on top of that, so she teamed up with folks in her neighborhood and they are still struggling with the cost of gas. This is just unacceptable. In a country that has the brilliance that the American people have and the entrepreneurship, we shouldn't be struggling with this. The sad thing is that the only thing blocking it is good policy, and this Congress has it within itself to move forward on a good, comprehensive energy policy. It distresses me it has been blocked. We have not had an opportunity to bring a comprehensive energy bill to the floor of the House. 
   This country has had one energy shock after another. There have been about six of them since the end of the Second World War. A number have caused significant price spikes, when you talk about 1973 with the Arab oil embargo, 1979 when the Iranian problem came up, the 1990 gulf crisis, the windfall profits tax thrown on top of the oil industry in the 1980s, and of course recently what we have seen with real high price spikes.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. I am glad you brought that up. Clearly, having a whole lot of refineries concentrated on the gulf coast, in Texas or on the coast of Louisiana, we have a very soft underbelly. We have a true vulnerability with key energy infrastructure. Many refineries, while they were not damaged, they had to be shut down for a period of time. We don't have large inventories of gasoline in this country. We don't have it. So when you shut refineries down, particularly a large number of them, you end up with shortages of gasoline and this country has had to start importing gasoline to a much greater extent than we used to.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Diesel as well, and other refined products. So this a significant problem. If we had true destruction of those refineries, which could have easily happened, we are talking about a real vulnerability, real price shocks at the pump, and a long time before we can get this infrastructure back up and running. 
   The point is with a comprehensive energy policy, we are going to diversify our sources of energy. We need to expand refining capacity and build out in other areas of the country. We need to invest in the alternative fuels that will give us alternatives to gasoline, but it takes time for those investments. Clearly, it is important that we start the process. 
   In my district, a large oil company has just recently put a significant investment into an alternative fuel company that is going to be making cellulosic ethanol. It is the first cellulosic ethanol facility in the entire country. They are ramping up and there is a lot of excitement about it, and it offers great possibilities, but we have to develop this and we have to develop the infrastructure. That is going to take time. So what we have to do is strategically manage our dependence on fossil fuels right now as we transition to the next energy economy which will involve alternatives and renewables.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. First of all, as we try to transition, we still need oil and gas, and we should be investing in this country and in the United States, looking at our own natural resources. A large part of the oil and gas that is  available is off our Outer Continental Shelf, in the gulf coast area, as we have seen off the coast of Louisiana and Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, but also east coast and west coast. We ought to be taking advantage and using those resources as we transition. 
   One of the key features that we fought for, I say ``we,'' the Louisiana delegation, for 50 years we fought to get revenue sharing whereby the tax revenue that comes to the Federal Government, some of it is shared with the States. 
   For instance, in Louisiana now with new production, we have the opportunity to share in 37.5 percent of revenue that will go to the State to help the State do environmental repair along the gulf coast. It will help us invest in infrastructure, and it also provides an opportunity to invest in alternatives fuels. That provision was enacted in the Energy Security Act of 2006, something we fought very hard for and it is a very good bill. 
   It is critically important that States along the coast have that revenue-sharing option available to them. That is the incentive for them to allow drilling off their coast.     
   And that helps them build their infrastructure. The Democrat bill earlier this week didn't allow that. And that's one of the reasons why I think this was a sham approach. It was saying, we'll give a little lip service to drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf, but we're going to restrict certain areas of the Outer Continental Shelf, and we're not going to allow revenue sharing, which is something the States all want. And that's the essence of federalism. That's a great way to do it.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. And I would say for folks back home in Louisiana who may be listening to this, our 37.5 percent revenue sharing was also jeopardized by this Democratic bill. So after 50 years of fighting to get revenue sharing for Louisiana in the 8.3 million acres that were opened up in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, we could suddenly lose that if that bill were to go all the way through the Senate and the President signed it. Fortunately, the President says he's going to veto it, but our own Democratic Senator, Mary Landrieu, has said this bill is dead on arrival.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. There is no assurance that that revenue would be retained. And that's a very important incentive to get the States to play ball with this. And let's take advantage and use those natural resources that we're so fortunate to have. We're at a time right now where oil reserves are being depleted around the world, and oil infrastructure is really in a state of decay in many of these countries. It's the free market companies, the big companies that are around the world that have the kinds of technology that we need to get in there and do this. But with everything else in decline, we need to be taking advantage of using our own resources while we transition, and increase investment in alternative forms of energy, alternative fuels, whether it's biofuels, because there's a whole host of new generation biofuels that we're on the cusp of working with. We need to invest in that, but it's not going to happen overnight. So that's why it's critically important right now to make strategically good decisions about how we use our resources. 
   We owe that to the American people. This Congress will be irresponsible. Our Democratic friends will be irresponsible if they don't allow a comprehensive energy reform package to come to the floor of the House.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. I fully agree with you. And we in Louisiana know that good energy policy can march hand in hand with environmental policy that's sensible, and it's also good for the economy and it grows jobs. We have seen that. We've seen what happens when bad policy affects an industry like the oil and gas industry and you lose jobs. We've seen that kind of cycle. And there's no reason for that. Those are policy decisions made by those who are truly uninformed. 
   What the American public has already very clearly stated is that they want a comprehensive energy policy. And we have it within ourselves to do that. This is not rocket science.

And folks are suffering back home on top of the suffering that they've had as a result of high prices at the pump. And I have to say, it frustrates the heck out of me to come up here to try to get something done to help folks back home and around the country suffering with these high gas prices, and we can't get it done. We're playing political games up here because of the leadership on the other side. It's very frustrating because folks in Texas, my friend's State, my home State of Louisiana, are really suffering doubly because we have born the burden of providing energy for this country in Louisiana and in Texas. And yet, folks back home are saying, what's wrong with the rest of the country? What's wrong with the Democratic leadership? Why won't they give us an energy policy. 
   Give us a vote. We've got the bills. We've got the answers. Give us a vote. That's all we're asking. And I yield back to my friend from Texas.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, many Americans lack protection from catastrophic long-term care expenses related to chronic illnesses and disabilities. Worse yet, many of these families assume Medicare will pay for long-term care services, while it generally does not. 
   Despite funding from Congress for long-term care education activities, the Department of Health and Human Services has done little to inform families and caregivers of this confusion. 
   HHS has neglected to clarify these Medicare misperceptions with at least 90 percent of households contacted through its long-term care awareness direct mail campaign. HHS has a duty to use other communication methods to inform families. 
   I recently introduced a bipartisan resolution with Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin to encourage Secretary Leavitt to be more proactive on this issue, so Americans can have greater independence, choice and control over the services they need in the setting they prefer.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Yesterday, the Democratic leadership unveiled a half-trillion-dollar spending bill because they were unable to fulfill their constitutional duties. 
   This spending bill is 3,500 pages long, and the majority gave Members of Congress less than 24 hours to look at it. And that's simply ridiculous. We had less than 24 hours to review a bill funding our national priorities, but chock full with earmarks and frivolous spending, and it failed to go through the proper committee checks. But the liberal leadership of this House added mounds of earmarks for their friends and liberal policies that most Americans do not support. 
   In all of this spending, however, the glaring neglect by the Democratic leadership is our troops. Those fighting around the world, making us safer from al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, will not receive the necessary resources to continue their mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, ensuring our Armed Forces have the tools at their disposal to defeat the terrorist threat is one of our responsibilities in Congress. And I urge all of my colleagues to remember that.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (INCREASING AMERICAN JOBS AND ENERGY PRODUCTION RESPONSIBLY -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. My constituents in southwest Louisiana want solutions to the energy crisis. 
   On Monday, the Lake Charles American Press summed up what is needed in their editorial, something I have advocated for a long time. 
   They said, ``The energy campaign should include more exploration, more refining capacity, more alternative energy sources, more renewable energy, retirement of society's dependency on the internal combustion engine, and an increase in conservation. 
   ``It should not be demagogued, for this is not a Republican or Democrat issue. It is a national issue that will require solutions, not insults hurled across the aisles of Congress and back and forth from Capitol Hill to the White House. 
   Those that feel the pain of higher energy prices and accompanying higher prices throughout the marketplace--the poor, those on fixed income, even the middle class--are being squeezed.'' 
   Increasing responsible energy production is one part of the solution. We must accompany that with conservation, with greater refining capacity and, most importantly, with unleashing individual American genius. 
   A magic bullet will not lower the price at the pump for American families, but increasing American energy production responsibly will help, and it will create jobs here at home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my colleague for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, but I want to restate that it's a redundancy. It's a restatement of CFTC's authority, and it does urge them to  move forward with haste, which I believe that they are doing. We heard testimony just yesterday, and the chairman of the CFTC pointed out a couple things: One, they're taking the lead in creating this interagency process working with all of the other agencies, the Department of Treasury, the SEC and others to really take a hard look at this issue of speculation. 
   Secondly, they've moved forward with haste to come up with a mutual recognition agreement with London and other jurisdictions to broaden their reach so that they can find out and get more transparency and more information as to what is really happening in these markets. The energy markets are a very complicated issue. And the danger is that Congress will take steps before we have adequate information that could truly be detrimental. 
   I fear that this debate today is taking valuable floor time away from bills that would really make a difference in working on our energy issues. We need a long-term strategy, a mid-term, and a short-term strategy clearly. And dealing with the issue of speculation is part of a short-term strategy. 
   But we cannot get away from the fact that we have very tight supply and demand. It is about evenly matched. And when you have a million barrels a day offline because of terrorist activity in Nigeria, when you have Venezuela's production declining because of aged technology and mismanagement, when you have Mexican production declining because of mismanagement and contract problems, these are all issues that are further putting stress on supply. 
   Finally, I would point out on the supply side that we have a shortage of rig materials around the world, actually. China is dealing with pulling in all kinds of commodities and it is adding costs to this. We have a workforce shortage in this oil and gas industry. There are major factors all coming into the supply side of this that are a problem.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. I think it's important to recognize these factors. What is driving uncertainty is clearly the lack of a confidence of energy policy, and this House can take action. There are bills ready. This House could clearly take action. We've got a number of bills, as my colleague, the ranking member of this committee, outlined earlier. 
   Furthermore, the London loophole, CFTC has taken steps with their mutual recognition agreement. The farm bill provisions take substantive steps to close the Enron loophole. 
   And finally, if we move prematurely to impose artificial standards and limits to trading, we could definitely hurt our transportation companies, our truckers, our farmers who hedge on these high energy prices. 
   Furthermore, we may drive transactions into less transparent markets such as Dubai and other markets. This also denies a threat that the low value of the dollar, and there is a threat globally that we could be seeing a move in energy transaction, too. A different currency, the euro. And this is a further issue. 
   So we need to move forward and not delay any further.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my friend, the ranking member, and I thank the committee. 
   I think this is a good bill. I rise in support of it, but I want to emphasize that this is really just a short-term relief in what we need to do. We have to do a whole lot more, and we could do a whole lot more. 
   This will provide short-term relief in public transit for those who use it, but short of a comprehensive policy that involves short-term solutions, mid-term and long-term, this isn't going to get us anywhere near to what we need to do to solve our energy problems. 
   I want to focus on one issue. I mean, clearly, we have to increase supply, and it can be done in an environmentally responsible way. We've shown that in my State of Louisiana. 
   We should lift this moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf, and that's one way that we can really move things forward quickly. 
   I would emphasize that, in the cumulative debate that's gone on today, there's been some misinformation because Louisiana delegations, in a bipartisan way over the years, over the last decade-and-a-half, have fought to open the Outer Continental Shelf and provide Outer Continental Shelf revenue-sharing so that the States could also get some of this revenue to rebuild their infrastructure. This is a sensible way. We have fought for this, and we've been blocked by the other side consistently in this. 
   I also want to point out with regard to the use-it-or-lose-it issue, it's very expensive, and companies cannot even get the permitting to assess with seismic what we know to be these reserves or what we think are reserves. We don't have definite information. A lot of that information is 10, 20, 30 years old, if we even have information. 
   I would say that it costs somewhere between $1 and $5 million just to get the permit to do seismic. Then you have to get the lease. That's another anywhere from $11 to over $200 million to secure these leases. Then you go into seismic, and that can be very expensive. And those cumulative costs continue to add. By the time you actually get to a point where you can drill  a well where you have known reserves, you're talking years down the line, and typically, it is not unusual for the costs to be up in billions, $1.5 billion. 
   That's why it's important to lift this moratorium. Let's move forward. Let's have a comprehensive energy policy that's not only focused on supply and increasing exploration and production in an environmentally sensitive way, but also focuses on renewables and alternatives, nuclear and the others.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, for more than 2 weeks, our national intelligence community has lacked the capability to track terrorists quickly.  Despite the known threats against this Nation, the House Democratic leadership has said there's no urgency on updating our Nation's intelligence laws. The FISA law dates back to the Carter administration, and that was almost 30 years ago, and they argue we should not update the law now? 
   It's no coincidence that the United States has been free from attack at home since September 11, 2001. Violent extremist terrorists are a threat, and that threat must be stopped. Congress must give our intelligence officers the tools and techniques they need to meet the long-term challenges. 
   Two weeks have passed since our national security community lost the ability to track intelligence without going through slow and burdensome bureaucratic hurdles. That's more than 2 weeks of terrorist communications that will never be recovered. 
   I am committed to providing responsible and appropriate tools to our intelligence community to protect and defend Americans at home and abroad. I urge my colleagues to do the same and pass the bipartisan FISA bill today.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, for 501 days liberal Democrats have controlled Congress. And these liberal Democrats, including the Speaker, continue to talk about their secret solution for skyrocketing gas prices. But they have failed to produce any answers. 
   Empty rhetoric and broken promises will not lower the price at the pump for American families. The people in my district in Southwest Louisiana understand that and they want real solutions. They want a comprehensive energy policy that allows us to strategically manage our fossil fuel dependence while we then transition and invest in alternative fuels. They don't want an energy policy that's held hostage to radical environmentalism. They want an energy policy that will increase responsible American energy production and refining capacity. They want to unleash American ingenuity and entrepreneurship. They don't want delays. They want a comprehensive energy policy because it's in the interest of our national security. 
   Families in Southwest Louisiana and across the country are looking for solutions to the price at the pump, they're looking for solutions for health care costs, and they're looking for solutions to the housing slowdown. Republicans have viable answers. 
   The American people are asking the Democratic leadership in Washington if they have solutions, we haven't seen any. Bring them forward. Let's work together to ease the price at the pump and to decrease America's dependence on foreign sources of oil.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Let's make no mistake about this. The last-minute changes don't improve this legislation. The revisions are simply fig-leaf changes to provide cover for oil patch Democratic Members who are being strong-armed into voting for this bill. 
   No matter how much you dress this up, this bill is still about price controls. We tried price controls in the 1970s, and they didn't work. It resulted in mass rationing, long lines at the pump, and consumer outrage. History is quite clear on this. 
   George Mason University economist Walter Williams has said: ``Politicians of both parties have rushed in to exploit public ignorance and emotion. But there's an important downside to these political attacks on producers. 
   ``What about the next disaster? How much sense does it make for producers to make the extra effort to provide goods and services if they know they risk prosecution for charging what might be seen as `unconscionable prices'?'' 
   Mr. Williams is right. 
   The American public deserves better. Congress has the responsibility to pass a balanced, comprehensive energy program that uses innovative technology to explore and expand our domestic energy supply, to move us towards energy independence. The last thing we need to do is to turn back the clock to the failed energy policies of the 1970s. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.

This bill basically doesn't seem to understand that prices are set on world markets. Clearly what we need to do is understand that aspect of this to craft a meaningful energy policy. 
   That is why investment in technology to come up with a broad range of alternative energy sources is the appropriate way to approach this. We don't want to go back to the price controls of the 1970s.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, as I look at the flag behind the Speaker's chair, I am reminded about how great our country truly is. If our country is going to remain great, we have to face the threats that are out there, and there are many, many threats. 
   Clearly, the Homeland Security appropriations bill is an important piece of work to deal with those threats. But there is a threat that's not quite so insidious, and it's the threat of spending, runaway spending in the face of the second largest tax increase in American history. 
   We need to get serious about this threat, this threat to future generations. We owe it to the American family to be responsible stewards of their hard-earned tax dollars. 
   I am gravely concerned about the disconnect between a lot of the high rhetoric I hear coming from the other side and the harsh reality that we seem to face here. The rhetoric we hear from the Democratic leadership is about fiscal responsibility and oversight and transparency and full disclosure. But the harsh reality is about none of those things. 
   I don't see full disclosure here. I don't see transparency. I am deeply concerned about this threat of runaway spending. 
   Now, I have to say, I fully appreciate the hard work done by the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee and the full committee. The chairman of the committee, the full committee, and the subcommittee, as well as the respective ranking members, have done a lot of hard work. 
   But their work is incomplete. Their work is definitely incomplete. It's the responsibility of every Member of this body to provide oversight, not just the committee's responsibilities. That is our responsibility, and we have to live up to it. 
   It is clearly a major responsibility as we look at these possible earmarks that are going to be airdropped into this at a later date. The process is clearly flawed, and the American people clearly deserve better. 
   I reflect upon a statement by a very famous British statesman, when the British Empire was at its height in the 18th century, and it goes like this: ``Magnanimity is seldom not the wisest course for a statesman, for empire and small minds go ill together.'' 
   I would submit to you that magnanimity is a very important American virtue, and magnanimity is also the responsibility of the majority, whoever happens to be in the majority. 
   I ask the majority to live up to its responsibilities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, health savings accounts are one of the best ways to put families back in control of their health care destiny. HSAs have expanded coverage, but Congress needs to make them more practical for working families and patients in poor health, and also remove rules that discriminate against veterans and seniors in Medicare. 
   This week, I introduced H.R. 2639 to permit larger contributions, allow coverage below the deductible for prescription drugs, and provide tax relief for premiums. The bill removes barriers that make it illegal for families to deposit their own money in an HSA after they receive care through Medicare or the VA. It also helps working families to build intergenerational ``wealth for health'' by allowing adult children to inherit a Medicare HSA in the same way that a spouse may now do. 
   It makes sense to help Americans save for future medical costs, especially when we consider our Nation's negative savings rate and Medicare's looming financial problems. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, to expand consumer choice and control it.

Furthermore, it's going to be at the expense of seniors.

   Looking at what we're going to go forward with as we look at health care, how are we going to pay for health care if we're putting all this money into overspending in these other bills? We have to get our priorities straight. 
   If we're going to raise cigarette taxes, a diminishing source of revenue, to pay for a program that's expanding, and then we're also going to take one-time money from Medicare Advantage to pay for an expanded program, how is it that we're going to deal with our entire Federal budget? Again, this bill before us today is a big part of the problem.

We're talking about money that is going to be spent in this that will not be available to spend on health care issues, particularly on a number of issues affecting rural seniors. 
   Now, I have a rural district, it depends on agriculture, and as we go forward, we're going to hurt these seniors in these rural communities. If we cut over $200 billion in Medicare spending, I have 3,246 seniors in the Seventh Congressional District who are currently enrolled in the Medicare Advantage who are going to suffer. So I think we have to get our priorities straight as we go forward. 
   Furthermore, as we look at payments for hospitals are being cut $2.7 billion; in-patient rehabilitative services, $6.6 billion in cuts; payments for skilled nursing facilities, $6.5 billion in cuts; payments for certain drugs, $1.9 billion; in-State renal disease, $3.6 billion. These are seniors who are poor in my Seventh Congressional District, and because of the spending in this Agriculture bill, they can't take care of these problems.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, according to Medicare trustees, that program requires an immediate 51 percent cut, a payroll tax increase of 122 percent, or a blend of both to keep the program running during the next 75 years. 
   Worse yet, the trustees assume that a separate 41 percent cut in payments for Medicare physician services will happen during the next 9 years. The American Academy of Actuaries reports, without congressional action, Medicare and Social Security will consume up to 80 percent of the Federal budget by 2040. 
   How, then, does a key member of Ways and Means Committee contend that Medicare is already ``solvent and sustainable''? 
   Washington needs to pull its head out of the sand. Ignoring Medicare's financial problems will only make the solutions more painful for generations of taxpayers and retirees. 
   And now, the Democrats want to expand SCHIP with questionable means to pay for it. Short of comprehensive reform, Congress should at least make it easier for our shrinking workforce to save for future health care needs, including the rising cost of Medicare premiums. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Promoting Health for Future Generations Act of 2007, H.R. 2639. Doing so will help the middle class to build a nest egg, while protecting access to affordable health care.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 70. This resolution recognizes the outstanding 2006 record of the University of California at Santa Barbara men's soccer team as well as their triumph in winning the university's first-ever national title in soccer and only the second in any other sport. 
   With a 2-1 victory over the University of California at Los Angeles at the 2006 NCAA men's College Cup, the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos ended the season with a 17-7-1 record. 
   The two rivals, whose schools are separated by less than 100 miles, played hard despite game time temperatures of 24 degrees and a windchill of 11. Still, in a testament to their strength and senior leadership, the Gauchos overcame the weather, as well as a 7-6 mid-season record, to become only the second unseeded team since 2000 to win the national title. 
   Shortly after the season ended and for the second time in 3 years, UC Santa Barbara head coach Tim Vom Steeg earned the most prestigious honor a Division I coach can receive when he was named national Coach of the Year by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. According to College Sports Television, ``in his eight seasons at the helm of UCSB, Vom Steeg has transformed a program that went 2-17-2 overall in the year prior to his arrival to a Division I power and reigning national champions.'' 
   In the first 33 years of the program's existence, Santa Barbara had never reached the NCAA tournament but has now made five straight post-season appearances under Vom Steeg's guidance, including two trips to the College Cup. 
   I extend my congratulations to head coach Tim Vom Steeg and all the hardworking players, the fans, and to the University of California at Santa Barbara. I am happy to join my good friends and colleagues, Representatives Capps and Gallegly, in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 938, commending the West Virginia University Mountaineer football team for exemplifying the pride, determination, and spirit of the Mountain State and overcoming adversity with skill, commitment, and teamwork to win the 2008 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. 
   Throughout the years, the Mountaineer football team has been a source of great pride for West Virginians, and this past year proved no different. On January 2, 2008, the West Virginia University Mountaineer football team won the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, defeating the University of Oklahoma Sooners by a score of 48-28 in Glendale, Arizona. 
   After what could have been a team demoralizing loss of head coach Rich Rodriguez, then assistant coach Bill Stewart stepped up to demonstrate true leadership and coaching skill by instilling confidence in his team and leading them to victory, earning the admiration and gratitude of his fellow West Virginians. 
   Mountaineer quarterback Pat White gave a dazzling running and passing performance that inspired his teammates, delighted WVU fans, frustrated his opponents, and earned him offensive MVP honors. Defensive honors went to Mountaineer linebacker and native West Virginian Reed Williams, who led his team in an outstanding defensive performance. 
   With the conclusion of an impressive 11-2 season, the Mountaineers finished among the top 10 in college football rankings for a third consecutive year, and with their new head coach Bill Stewart, brought great honor to themselves, their university, and the State of West Virginia. 
   High marks should also be given to athletic director Ed Pastilong, who, over his 19-year career, has instilled the athletic department of West Virginia University with the highest standards of ethics and performance. We should also recognize WVU president Mike Garrison for his leadership. WVU is committed to changing lives and providing opportunities to all through education, building knowledge through research, and serving the people of West Virginia through economic development and health care. 
   I extend my congratulations to head coach Bill Stewart and all the hardworking players, the fans, and to West Virginia University. I'm happy to join my good friend and colleague Representative Mollohan in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. And I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (COMMENDING LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY TIGERS FOOTBALL TEAM FOR WINNING 2007 BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- (House of Representatives - January 28, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 933, commending the Louisiana State University Fighting Tigers football team for winning the Bowl Champion Series national title game. 
   I would like to first thank my good friend, the dean of our Louisiana delegation, RICHARD BAKER, for sponsoring the resolution, as well as Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon of the Education and Labor Committee for bringing it to the floor. 
   On January 7, the LSU Tigers overcame an early first-half deficit of 10-0 to defeat the Ohio State University Buckeyes by a score of 38-24 in New Orleans. This was the second time the Tigers have won a BCS title in the Louisiana Superdome. The Tigers were led by the game's offensive MVP, senior quarterback Matt Flynn, who threw four touchdown passes, and defensive MVP, sophomore defensive end Ricky Jean-Francois, who blocked a field goal and had six total tackles and a half sack. This is the second year in a row that a Southeastern Conference team, arguably the most dominant conference in college football today, has beaten Ohio State to win the BCS national title. 
   Since the birth of the Bowl Championship Series in 1998, LSU is the first team to win two BCS national championship titles.     
   Led by seniors Matt Flynn, Jacob Hester, Ali Highsmith, Chevis Jackson, Jonathan Zenon, Craig Steltz, and Glenn Dorsey, the Tigers won 12 games  during the 2007 season. Seven games were won against nationally ranked opponents, as well as seven games against conference opponents, including the University of Tennessee Volunteers in the Southeastern Conference championship game by a score of 21-14. 
   Since his first season as LSU head coach in 2005, Les Miles has fearlessly led the Tiger football program to 34 overall wins, 20 SEC victories, and 14 wins over nationally ranked opponents. He has brought the Tigers to two SEC championship games, three consecutive bowl wins, two of which were BCS games, and one BCS national championship. Coach Miles has also had three consecutive double-digit win seasons, a school record. And he's clearly well known for the fourth and short conversions. He's fearless as a leader. 
   We must not also forget that, foremost, these student athletes perform just as hard in the classroom as they do on the football field. Coach Miles insists that his first goal for his team is a 100 percent graduation rate. And I'm proud to say that 14 members of this national championship football team were placed on the 2007 SEC Fall Academic Honor Roll. 
   The 2007 Tigers fought through great adversity, thanks to a grueling schedule, injuries, and conference losses, to secure their place in the national championship game against Ohio State. This championship is very special to the LSU system and to my great State of Louisiana. And it's my honor to recognize Coach Les Miles and the 2007 LSU Tiger football team for all its great accomplishments this season and for bringing home the BCS crystal ball. 
   Geaux Tigers. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member for giving me time to speak on this. 
   I rise in support of the McKeon substitute amendment, and I'm opposed to the underlying bill as it's written. Historically, our Federal Government has limited entitlement spending to programs like Medicare and Social Security, and we're still trying to work out or trying to figure out how to make those programs solvent and sustainable. 
   The underlying bill creates nine new entitlement programs. And knowing that entitlement programs never die, we need to admit to the taxpayers that if this passes they will be expected to kick in another 15 to $30 billion to cover the cost of these new entitlement programs starting in 2013. 
   It also starts the precedent of creating entitlement programs for institutions and organizations. This act does little to reduce college costs and shortchanges those students who need help the most to pay for college. The bill spends less than one-third of the total savings on investing in low income students struggling to achieve their dreams of a college education. 
   Rather than addressing the needs of our Nation's low income students, this bill spends billions of dollars on providing additional subsidies to institutions of higher education. 
   I urge my colleagues to instead support the McKeon amendment, which would increase Pell Grants for our neediest students. 
   The amendment, in addition, makes two significant improvements to the Pell Grant program. It provides funds for year-round Pell Grants to help those students who wish to pursue their education, not only in the fall and spring, but in summer as well. 
   For too long, the student aid programs have only addressed the needs of traditional dependent students who attend fall and spring semester and then go home for summer. It's time that we do more to meet the needs of working adults and nontraditional students who need greater flexibility in pursuing their educational goals. 
   The amendment reduces interest rates for parents and graduate students in the Pell program who now pay 8.5 percent instead of 7.9 percent, which is paid by their peers in the direct loan program. There's simply no reason at all to charge parents and students different interest rates, and this problem needs to be addressed as soon as possible. I'm disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle did not see the need to help these parents and students who are being unfairly penalized under current law. 
   Furthermore, this amendment also helps our military, as was mentioned earlier, by providing extended deferment options for our returning soldiers who may need extra time to get settled before repaying any outstanding student loans. This provision was included in the committee mark, and for that I'm grateful, and I think it's certainly a provision I support. 
   And finally, the McKeon amendment addresses a concern that Mr. McKeon has been voicing for the last three or four years, and that concern has to do with rising costs of college. I'm happy to see that this amendment includes the text of Mr. McKeon's bill, H.R. 472, which brings much needed transparency to the college cost issue. 
   As we all know, rising college costs are a major concern of parents across the country who find it more and more difficult to pay their tuition bills; yet no one can or will explain why costs continue to increase at rates far exceeding the rate of inflation. It's time to arm parents and students with information that can be used to make these wise choices in selecting an institution of higher learning. 
   And for these reasons, I wholeheartedly support the McKeon amendment as a substitute to this bill, and urge passage of this very important amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (OPPOSING EFFORTS BY NATURAL GAS EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH A CARTEL -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, for yielding time. 
   Madam Speaker, energy security is a critical issue with far-ranging implications for the United States and our allies. The United States is dependent on foreign oil and currently self-sufficient with regard to natural gas. However, in coming years, the U.S. will become increasingly an importer of natural gas as demand continues to increase to fuel our power plants, to provide feedstock to manufacturing processes and to heat our homes. 
   Over the course of the past decade, we have seen the evolution of the natural gas markets from a very localized market to a regional market and now international markets with international pipelines and the advent of liquefied natural gas imports. 
   Natural-gas-producing countries now, many who are not friendly to the U.S., are proposing the formation of a gas cartel. Another OPEC-style cartel that artificially manipulates supply and prices will clearly pose harm to the U.S. economy as well as to that of our allies. 
   My district, the Seventh Congressional District of Louisiana, is a major  producer of oil and gas. In fact, over the next few years, about 25 percent of all natural gas being consumed in this country will come from my district, either through pipelines, production or through liquefied natural gas imports. 
   I currently have one facility, a liquefied natural gas facility, that is undergoing expansion, and three others that are undergoing construction as we speak. I will say that if we see a reduction or problem with price fixing and limitations in this global market for liquefied natural gas, clearly it could have an impact not only with regard to jobs in Louisiana, but it will affect the gas distribution to the Midwest of this country, as well as to the Northeast, because I have a confluence of pipelines where the pricing mechanism for natural gas is set in my district as well as a major distribution hub. 
   This resolution recognizes the looming problem, and I support passage of this resolution to express the sense of Congress, but also support a joint and coordinated strategy with our allies to stabilize global markets for natural gas and to consider how we move forward on new energy exploration, alternative modes of transportation, and also to develop new technologies for new alternative energy sources. 
   The responsibility for energy security in this country doesn't lie solely with the Energy Department. It is also a component of our vigorous diplomatic efforts at the State Department to ensure that we have open markets and our intelligence services to assess threats. Furthermore, it needs to be part of research funding, and Congress must consider legislative changes to promote private investment and to encourage private research and development. 
   Our energy supply should not be influenced by the whims of our enemies. Energy independence is a matter of economic and national security. Over the next 20 to 25 years, we need to manage our dependence on fossil fuels in a strategic way while we develop alternative measures that are sustainable, diverse and friendly to our environment. 
   I wholeheartedly support this resolution and will closely monitor the formation of any potential cartel for natural gas, and will continue to press my colleagues for progress and sincere work on energy security measures, so that we can all work towards less dependency on foreign sources.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.

   But I cannot in good conscience vote for a bill that is going to do unspeakable harm to our troops in the field and to our national security. I want to point out the fiscal fantasy also in this bill. I want to point out one item. There is $15 million in this bill for rice farmers in my district for salt water mitigation. That is twice the number of dollars that we needed months ago for this. So if we have that kind of bloating in the bill on one small item, I can't imagine what this $28 billion extra in the bill is all about. 
   This bill is fiscal fantasy, and it does unspeakable harm to our national security. For those reasons, I oppose it vehemently.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to argue against this proposed Democratic budget that would raise taxes on Louisiana taxpayers by an average of $2,642 and contains egregious wasteful spending. 
   Extra money for tax hikes might be in the family budget for people in San Francisco, but families in southwest Louisiana do not have extra room in their budgets. Wasteful spending and tax hikes are irresponsible. The Democratic House leadership must understand that American families are facing higher costs at the pump, higher costs for healthcare and education, and more money to pay Federal taxes simply isn't there. 
   The Democratic budget proposal includes a massive $683 billion tax increase spread over five years in order to finance wasteful Washington spending according to the Congressional Budget Office. Taxpayers in Louisiana face average tax increases of $2,642. While failing to address growing entitlement programs, House Democrats are proposing tens of billions more in new Federal spending facilitated by the tax increase. 
   In addition, the Democratic budget contains the following: Cuts to the child tax credit, from $1,000 to $500 per child; Decreases to the adoption tax credit; Decreases in tax-free 401(k) and IRA contributions; Tax increases for small businesses averaging more than $4,000 per business. 
   Mr. Chairman, I cannot in good conscience support a budget that is as irresponsible as this one. It is a hamper to American entrepreneurs, small businesses and economic growth. Additionally, it hurts American families who struggle to pay higher energy prices, healthcare costs, housing costs and education costs. 
   Our budget is a statement of priorities. Lowering taxes, growing our economy and providing for families are my priorities. This Democratic budget falls well short.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill with its tax provisions. I think it's time that we level with the American public about this and be truthful about what we are trying to accomplish here. This bill has some good things in it, but it's not really addressing what we really need to be focused on right now. That is, the strategic management of our dependence over fossil fuels for the next 10 to 15 years as we transition. 
   We need to manage our strategic dependence on fossil fuels, a strategic dependence that we are going to have for the next 10, 15, maybe 20 years as these new technologies develop. Now, what does this bill do? It taxes U.S. companies working on production of oil, and making these companies less productive and less competitive, therefore, shifting more oil and gas activity into the hands of national oil companies that are not our friends. This will not bring down the price of oil and gas and not alleviate our energy concerns. 
   Secondly, it abrogates leases, very important leases in the Gulf of Mexico, with the stroke of a pen. Now, that's not the American way. That's not something that we would be proud of in this country, not something the American people would be proud of. It's certainly something that Hugo Chavez would be proud of. 
   Finally, I will say this bill is not technology neutral. It seeks to pick winners and losers and eliminates some very promising technology for alternatives fuels. 
   For that reason and many other reasons, I oppose this bill. I oppose the underlying bill with its tax provisions and urge all Members to think twice about this. We have to level with the American people about the energy situation and manage our strategic dependence and not deal with fantasy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this Water Resources Development Act and urge all Members of this Chamber to vote to override the Presidential veto. 
   When Benjamin Franklin stated ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,'' he very well could have been speaking about the Louisiana coastline. For years, years, we have been losing acres of coastline. 
   Now, why is this important? The Louisiana coastline is critical for our energy infrastructure in this country. It's critical to support the maritime industry that supports this energy infrastructure. And without a Water Resources Development Act, which is 7 years overdue, we are seeing our coastline disappear. 
   This bill is a start. It's a start to help us to ensure that we can protect our coastline from future storm surges, to protect this coastline and energy infrastructure that is so necessary for this country.  
   Some have said that the bill is too expensive. Well, it is a 7-year bill and it's an authorization. It helps Congress set priorities, working with our States, working with local officials and the scientific community particularly in my State of Louisiana who set these priorities so as to preserve our coastline and valuable water infrastructure throughout the country. 
   I am very much pleased as well to see that the bill has peer review measures in it to make sure that we have independent peer review of major Corps projects. The threshold, I think, was set at $45 million. But it also allows the chief to have certain flexibilities so as to not create unnecessary delays to these very valuable projects. 
   This is a critically important bill. I urge all colleagues to support this bill, support an override of the Presidential veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for organizing this hour and for all the work he has done on this issue. 
   Let me start by saying that, as a heart and lung surgeon, I have often seen patients whose illness did not respond to a particular drug, and I have seen the frustration and the anxiety among family members and among patients when a government bureaucrat or an HMO tried to save money by denying access to a more effective medication. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I once operated on a Vietnam veteran; I performed heart surgery on this gentleman, and afterwards he needed several very important medications to maintain his condition, but the VA program was going to make him wait between 2 and 3 weeks before he could get his medication. That is just simply unacceptable. This poor man had no choice but to pay out of pocket hundreds of dollars to get medication. This is something that we don't want to do for our seniors. 
   Now, Secretary Leavitt has warned that H.R. 4 will result clearly in fewer choices and less consumer satisfaction. And we all know that we have had a tremendous success with this program in just 1 year, 80 percent satisfaction, premium prices dropping from $37 down to $22. Let's face it, government rationing harms patients, and calling it negotiation won't make it any less dangerous. 
   The American people did not give Congress a mandate to force HHS to make unspecified cuts to Medicare. 
   I also know that the idea of government negotiation is a joke. In fact, according to a Democratic polling group, 8 in 10 voters agree that government negotiation would limit access to prescription drugs and to life-saving medications. 
   Let's face it, aggressive negotiation through the marketplace is already working, and it is driving down the prices of premiums as I mentioned earlier. 
   Let me just say this. If the market is good enough for Members of Congress, why would we take that away from our seniors? I find it to be a profound irony that supporters of this bill, the Democratic leadership in the House, they are pushing for this government negotiation, this so-called government negotiation, but they won't allow that for their own medicine cabinets. There is a profound irony in this. 
   Why doesn't a proposal that would limit the medical care of tens of millions of seniors deserve a fair hearing? I say it is reckless on the part of the Democratic leadership of the House to force the Federal Government to cut Medicare without specifying, where are we going to achieve those additional  savings? How is this so-called negotiation going to take place? And before rushing into this bill, I think Speaker Pelosi has an ethical obligation to detail how the Federal Government would achieve additional savings without limiting seniors' access to medicines, hurting community pharmacies and increasing prices for our veterans. 
   We know what the outcome of a recent CBO study showed, that the Secretary will be unable to negotiate prices that are more favorable than those under the current law. In fact, a Senate hearing was held on this. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing, and the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is questioning whether there are savings to be achieved by direct negotiation. 
   Furthermore, I have letters that I have received from community pharmacists throughout my district. I want to read from one of these. It is addressed to me and says, ``There will be a vote in Congress on Friday, January 12, which could dismantle the very important Medicare part D program. I am joining former U.S. Senator John Breaux,'' a Democrat, a former prominent Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and a member of the Senate who worked on this Medicare part D program when it was put into law. He says, ``I am joining former Senator John Breaux and the Louisiana Medicare Prescription Access Network and more than 700 supporting member organizations in our State in asking you to vote against H.R. 4 on Friday, January 12.'' 
   Price controls are not in the interest of our seniors. This is not something that we want to do. If we are going to reform our entitlement programs where costs are burgeoning, we need to introduce market forces; and lo and behold, in one year of operation we have a program where we introduced market forces to drive down premiums for our seniors, and it is working. 
   It is too premature to change this. It is wrong to change this, and I urge all of my colleagues to listen to this and do what is right for seniors. And I will end by just asking one question: Why would the Democratic leadership in the House want to hurt our seniors? I think the American public and our seniors deserve an answer to that question.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 3. As a heart and lung surgeon, I've seen the power of hope and the harms caused by those who give misinformation and false hope to patients and families. 
   Too often, proponents of embryonic stem cell research promise an immediate cure to dying patients and their families. 
   From a medical standpoint, embryonic stem cells have yet to produce a single human treatment. Embryonic cells also produce tumors and cause transplant rejection. 
   Such techniques also raise grave ethical problems. The claim that most human embryos in fertility clinics ``will be discarded anyway'' is disingenuous. Research shows that ``the vast majority of stored embryos (88.2 percent) are being held for family building.'' 
   Fortunately, science continues to discover more promising lines of stem cell research. 
   Adult stem cells have already been used to treat a growing number of human diseases. 
   Scientists at Harvard and Wake Forest University recently reported their success using stem cells in amniotic fluid and the placenta. 
   They explained that these stem cells ``remain stable for years without forming tumors.'' 
   All Americans depend on medical breakthroughs. Federal funding for all types of stem cell research rose above $609 million last year. 
   It's disappointing that the Speaker would not permit a vote today to increase funding for the most productive stem cell research. 
   Last year, the Bartlett bill passed the Senate unanimously. It would have increased funding for embryonic stem cell research that doesn't destroy an embryo, including embryo biopsy. The current House leadership defeated it to score political points against the President. 
   It's irresponsible for Congress to spend scarce federal tax dollars on lines of scientific research that have proven least effective. 
   Evidence proves it's possible to advance stem cell research without paying biomedical firms to destroy human embryos. 
   Conclusion: For these reasons, I oppose H.R. 3 and urge my colleagues to oppose this bill as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (EXPRESSING THE SUPPORT OF CONGRESS FOR THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL HURRICANE MUSEUM AND SCIENCE CENTER IN SOUTHWEST LOUISIANA -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my colleague from Utah and the gentlelady from the Virgin Islands for their comments on this, and I appreciate the committee in allowing this to come to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution. Hurricanes Rita and Katrina forever changed the lives of gulf coast residents. It was not until the 2005 storms that most Americans really began to fully comprehend the potential size, strength and impact of these devastating natural disasters. 
   We are nowhere near where we need to be as far as educating the public and raising awareness about hurricane preparedness. 
   Last week marked the beginning of the 2007 hurricane season. Yet despite intense media coverage surrounding Katrina and Rita, a recent poll of coastal residents conducted by the Associated Press revealed that an astounding 88 percent had not taken any steps to protect their homes against future storms. Sixty-one percent had no hurricane survival kits on hand. 
   We need to do more to remind the public about the devastation caused by major storms on the level of Katrina, Rita, Andrew and Ivan, as well as teach them about the science behind these phenomena and what we can do to better protect lives and property leading up to a potential storm. 
   This resolution expresses the support of Congress for the creation of a National Hurricane Museum and Science Center in southwest Louisiana. The goal of this comprehensive center is to interpret the effects of hurricanes on our land, people, culture and government to preserve artifacts and personal histories of those who have suffered and died because of these events, to conduct research and showcase improvements in meteorology, technology, communications and building systems, and also to offer a creative learning experience in the disciplines of math, science, history, geography and social sciences as they relate to catastrophic natural disasters. 
   The Center will partner with the National Weather Service, the media and other public and private organizations to provide timely and reliable information as it relates to severe weather events and their aftermath. 
   The Creole Nature Trail All-American Road began working on this project before the 2005 storms. In September, the project was awarded a $1.3 million Department of Transportation Scenic Byways grant, the largest ever awarded under the Louisiana Scenic Byways program. 
   Just last week, the board conducted two public meetings in southwest Louisiana to seek community input on the top four sites being considered for the museum and science center. A final site selection is expected to be announced later this month, honoring the 50th anniversary of Hurricane Audrey, a storm that was devastating in my congressional district and took many lives years ago. 
   The National Hurricane Museum and Science Center will not only serve as a historical center to study the effects that hurricanes have on our coast, it will be a living memorial to attract scholars, students and tourists to the region, a region that's still struggling to recover after the 2005 storms. 
   Southwest Louisiana is constantly learning how to protect itself from future disasters, and this project will help assist our efforts and our neighbors along the gulf coast and throughout the country in that important effort. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (REAL HEALTH CARE SOLUTIONS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES -- (House of Representatives - April 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans remain frustrated with the cost of health care. As costs rise, fears grow that they'll lose coverage and even fall into bankruptcy. Americans face this anxiety every day. But it doesn't need to be that way. We can give all American families confidence in a health care system. 
   Americans deserve more affordable and more widely available health care. Americans deserve real access to health care, not just health care coverage that doesn't lead to access but real access to health care. That's why we must modernize our health care system and learn from other sectors of the economy where competition has driven down costs, particularly in the insurance arena, so that we can drive down those premium costs and make it more affordable for all American families. 
   When addressing health care, Washington fails to put the needs of the patient first. I know this as a physician. I was in private practice for 14 years and saw how policies really drove a wedge between the patient and their doctor. 
   Patients want personal, quality, high-value health care. That's what we all want. That's going to be the way that we get true quality in health care. We must focus on what patients most want and need: prevention, early detection, early diagnosis, control of chronic illnesses, enhancing the quality of life, and wellness programs. 
   I know as a physician that trying to get a patient to quit smoking takes a  lot of work. Simple television commercials and public service announcements, while they help, won't do the job. But if you have a doctor-patient relationship where the doctor knows the patient and that trust develops and a doctor supports the patient in their effort to quit smoking, it's much more likely to be successful. 
   The same thing with dietary measures. These are the kinds of things that we need to do that will help reduce the cost of health care and will help make Americans more healthy. These are the kinds of solutions that will help Americans stay out of hospitals and avoid other expensive institutional forms of treatment. 
   Just yesterday, my colleagues and I across the aisle debated these very issues at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital. It was a great debate. But let me say that Republicans focused on strengthening the doctor-patient relationship that is fundamental to good quality health care. As I said before, we can't expect good quality health care to come about without this fundamental relationship between a doctor and a patient. 
   We think back to the old days, of Marcus Welby and how a physician portrayed as Marcus Welby on television had that relationship with the patient and their family. We think back to Norman Rockwell paintings that depict this type of relationship that patients had with the doctor, of mutual trust that focused not just on sickness but on health, not just on the disease process but how the disease affected the entire patient's well-being and their family circumstances. 
   These are the things that we as Republicans want to focus on as we try to introduce information technology into health care, a wide range of choices for families to pick a good health care policy that meets their specific needs, not somebody else picking what they need, let families pick what they need and put families back in control of their health care destiny. 
   Our opponents on the other side of the aisle have suggested a one-size-fits-all program, something like you see in Canada or in England where there are waiting lists for care. I know as a physician that when I was in Rochester, New York, we had patients who were being told they couldn't have heart surgery for 18 months and they were coming across the border into the U.S. to have their heart surgery done. A friend of mine who is a heart surgeon in England was told 6 months into the year that he couldn't do any more heart surgery and when he attempted to do so, his superiors threatened to fire him. Think of the patients that suffered because of this type of rationing of care. That's not what Americans want. Americans want a health care system that provides access and that's affordable and available. 
   I know, I think everyone knows, that Americans deserve better than what we're getting, and I know and I'm very confident that we can make it better if we adhere to those principles I outlined earlier, of information and choice and patient and family control. We can create a health care system that meets patients' needs and allays Americans' anxieties, a health care system that gives all of us confidence that our health care needs will be taken care of. And we can do this by putting in place new policies that respond to consumer needs, individual needs, and the demands for more available and affordable health insurance and for more control over our health care decisions. That's what we all want. We want a health care system that provides real access to care, not just coverage on paper. There are far too many examples of where folks have coverage but not real access. We want access.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from California in support of House Resolution 1464, recognizing and honoring the 50th anniversary of the founding of the AARP. While I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, I must also remind all of my colleagues that we, in Congress, must do our part to serve our constituents over the age of 50 by approving an all-of-the-above comprehensive energy package that will put our Nation on the path to energy independence, a real energy policy, and not one that just pays lip service to parts and parcel of energy policy, one that really looks at solving our energy problems going forward. 
   With that, I would say that I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I urge my Democratic colleagues to work with us across the aisle and to serve those constituents that the AARP serves in approving essential energy policy as well. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION HURRICANE RECOVERY RELIEF -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 6890 which would extend the authority of the Secretary of Education to waive certain requirements for those States impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The legislation would also ensure that those school districts that experienced widespread damage by the severe storms, tornadoes, or flooding in the Midwest or hurricanes in the gulf coast receive the same amount of funding under the title I program as they did last year. 
   I want to thank my fellow members of the Louisiana delegation for working with me in introducing this bill and their ongoing work alongside with me to assist those impacted by the devastating natural disasters that have hit the gulf coast as well as the Midwest. 
   Mr. Speaker, the events over the past month when Hurricane Ike hit the Texas and Louisiana coast and Hurricane Gustav hit the Louisiana coast remind us of the damaging impact that natural disasters have on our Nation's residents and their local communities. As thousands of residents return to their homes and towns, they'll need help in rebuilding their houses and their livelihoods. Local elementary and secondary schools--both public and private--will need help in replacing textbooks and other instructional materials so that students can get back to learning and a little bit of normalcy. 
   Just over 3 years ago, our Nation experienced one of the worst disasters in our history when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated Louisiana and the Mississippi gulf coast. More than 1,100 public and private schools were forced to close, and approximately 158,000 students were displaced as a direct result of the hurricanes. The loss of business and government infrastructure, jobs, and housing deprived school districts of local property taxes that normally fund school operations. 
   In the Midwest, we know that the massive flooding experienced over the summer in Iowa and recently in Illinois has devastated local communities and schools. Louisiana and Texas are still assessing the damage done as a result of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, but the initial assessments paint a grim picture. 
   In the aftermath of these natural disasters, Congress should assist those public and private elementary, middle, and high schools that are struggling to re-open and re-enroll students for families returning to these devastated areas. 
   In 2006, we provided funds to States and public and private schools in the gulf region impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to replace instructional materials, recover student and personnel data systems, and other important services to get schools back up and running. We also guaranteed that those school districts in the gulf coast receive the same amount of funding under the title I program for fiscal year 2006 as they received for fiscal year 2005. 
   We provided the Secretary of Education with limited authority to waive certain financial requirements to ensure that those states that were heavily impacted by the destruction could use several funds to meet their financial commitments. These waivers have proven critical to the recovery of schools in several impacted areas and enabled them to access much-needed reconstruction funds. 
   The bill we have before us today, H.R. 6890, would extend this temporary authority for another fiscal year through September 30, 2009. 
   As we continue to assess the damage in the Midwest and along the gulf coast, similar to the assistance provided back in 2006, H.R. 6890 also guarantees that those school districts in the Midwest impacted by flooding and the gulf coast impacted by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike receive the same amount of funding under the title I program for this upcoming school year as they received for the last school year. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6890. I'm thankful to the committee and to the gentlelady from California for bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (HONORABLE STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES COLLEGE FIRE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 642, the Honorable Stephanie Tubbs Jones College Fire Prevention Act, and I join my colleagues in honoring our colleague. 
   So often in this Chamber, we consider legislation to expand access to college and strengthen our Federal higher education programs. Today, we have an opportunity to discuss the need to bolster safety on college campuses, specifically fire safety. 
   The timing and the name of this bill are appropriate because this month is often designated as Campus Fire Safety Month, and there was no Member more concerned about protecting our college students from the dangers of fire than the late Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones. This bill would honor Representative Tubbs Jones by naming a demonstration program in her honor. 
   Our Nation's college students should be able to live on campus with the confidence that they will be safe in their dorms, apartments, or other housing. This measure will take a step toward ensuring that colleges have the ability to ensure their buildings are properly equipped with the latest fire safety measures. 
   This measure, combined with the provisions enacted by Congress in the Higher Education Opportunity Act, will increase campus fire safety on colleges and universities. The provisions included in the Higher Education Opportunity Act required colleges to provide a fire safety report to the Secretary of Education. The report must include statistics showing the number of fires and injuries resulting from fires on campus over the past year. It will also require colleges to report on the type of fire prevention technologies they are utilizing and any plans the colleges may have to improve their fire prevention and detection technologies. The bill before us today will help colleges think creatively about fire safety and ensure that they have the funds to move forward with their plans. 
   Today, we have the opportunity to honor Representative Tubbs Jones' commitment to the safety of college students and pass a measure that will help colleges keep our young people safe from devastating fires. 
   While I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, our efforts to help college students will be incomplete until we also approve a true and honest all-of-the-above energy reform package that puts our Nation on the path to energy independence. Our higher education system is being squeezed by high energy costs just as the rest of society is. Schools are being forced to limit their operations and reduce the number of school days just to save on utility costs and save their students the price of a day's commute. 
   The majority met behind closed doors to craft a bill that offers more in the way of political cover than actual energy reform. This is not the change Americans need, and it's not the change they deserve. We need a real energy policy, not one that looks good on paper but keeps vital American resources under lock and key. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS OF THE NATIONAL LEARN AND SERVE CHALLENGE -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1463 which recognizes the benefits of service learning as a teaching strategy to effectively engage youth in the community and classroom, and it supports the goals of the National Learn and Serve Challenge. 
   Young Americans, from kindergartners to college students, have the desire, power, and ability to make a real difference in their communities. Service learning offers a unique opportunity for them to get involved in a concrete way by integrating community service projects with classroom learning. It enriches the learning experience, teaches civic responsibility, and strengthens communities. 
   Research has shown that service-learning programs can have positive  impacts on youth in three general areas: academic engagement and achievement; civic attitudes and behaviors; and social and personal skills. The studies also demonstrate that students gain the maximum benefit when their service-learning experience includes a direct tie to the curriculum, planning, and design of service projects by students, structured reflection on the service experience in the classroom, and continuity of service for at least one semester. 
   Service-learning programs work. They meet the Nation's needs by putting the talents and energies of America's youth to work solving real issues in their communities such as homelessness, elderly care, and illiteracy. In addition, students' lives are enriched through service learning as they become engaged in their own educational process. We see the results and benefits of the work they do, and they become civic-minded Americans who make a contribution to the communities in which they live. 
   Learn and Service America is the only Federally funded program dedicated to service learning and enables over 1.5 million students to make meaningful contributions to their community while building academic and civic skills. Through its annual week-long National Learn and Serve Challenge, the program spotlights the value of service learning to youth, schools, and communities and instills an ethic of lifelong community service. 
   In light of the recent natural disasters that have stricken our Nation, it is important that young people are encouraged to incorporate service into their lives and make a difference in their community and country. The intangible benefits alone--such as pride, satisfaction, and accomplishment--are worthwhile reasons to serve. 
   Today I applaud the efforts of Learn and Serve America and the millions of dedicated youth volunteers for their service, and I would like to encourage all Americans to work together so we can more effectively meet the pressing needs facing our Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.     
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (MISSISQUOI AND TROUT RIVERS WILD AND SCENIC RIVER STUDY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Utah for yielding, and I stand with him on these issues. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a matter of setting priorities. I just got back Monday evening for votes. I left my home State of Louisiana, my district of southwest Louisiana, that was just hit by Hurricane Gustav. Folks are suffering. Seniors are suffering back home. Seniors are suffering all over the country. Seniors in Vermont are suffering and they're going to suffer with high prices of heating oil this coming winter. Farmers, I have got farmers that lost their crops just last week, and they're faced with high diesel costs and high gasoline costs and high fertilizer costs because this country doesn't have an energy policy. What are our priorities? This is the most important bill we have done so far this week, and it's a study and it's a study based on what the subcommittee found there to be no risk involved. So I have to question what are the priorities of this Democratically led Congress. 
   We in Louisiana have been bearing the burden of providing energy in this country for quite a long time, and we have seen our coasts, our precious wetlands devastated, and now we are trying to rebuild those wetlands. Is that a priority? It's certainly a priority to me. But clearly getting an energy policy has to be one of the top priorities for this country. We should all recognize that. And I think my colleagues across the aisle, after spending August back home hearing from folks in their districts, would understand that. 
   We in Louisiana know that energy policy and environmental policy and economic policy all march together. That's good policy. We're also talking about jobs. Mr. Chairman, every time I fly home on the little stretch between Houston and Lafayette, Louisiana, I run into folks from Louisiana who are coming back or going to countries all over the globe, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Thailand, Vietnam, countries throughout the Middle East, Louisianians with oil and gas expertise who wish they could be back in this country closer to their families. No, they're having to travel all over the globe and be away from their families for months on end to make a living in the energy industry. These are jobs that were lost to this country. These were manufacturing jobs that were lost to this country in the 1980s when a Democratically controlled Congress imposed a windfall profits tax on the oil and gas industry. And what's their answer today? Well, let's get rid of the manufacturing tax credit on oil and gas companies. Let's single out the oil and gas companies. Well, on one hand you say you want good jobs and good manufacturing jobs, but then you propose policies that drive these jobs out of this country. I don't get it. I just don't get it, and the folks back home in Louisiana don't get it. 
   I talked about the environment. Down in my district we've got a beautiful stretch of wetlands and marsh. It's a bird habitat for ducks, a breeding ground for ducks. White Lake, a beautiful lake, a pristine lake, is down there in Vermilion Parish. That land is managed by BP Amoco, and they have done an outstanding job with the environment. Just yet another example of good environmental policy working hand in hand with energy policy because what does it mean? Jobs, good American jobs. 
   Explain that to the folks in Michigan. Explain that to the folks in Ohio who are struggling right now. If you want good American jobs, you get a good energy policy, an all-of-the-above energy policy. An energy policy that looks at oil exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf and Alaska, shale oil, nuclear energy, looks at building refining capacity, and also invests in renewables and alternatives. That's what we're advocating over here. We want to work in a bipartisan fashion. 
   But, no, the other side, our friends across the aisle are finding ways to avoid the issue. That's not what the American public wants today. Everybody knows what the polls are showing. Seven out of ten Americans want a comprehensive energy policy. How can you go home and explain to the seniors, an elderly woman back in your district who can't afford gasoline for her car to go to the grocery store to pick up a few essential items, so then she has to carpool with three others and now they can't afford it? 
   I'm all for conservation. I believe conservation is a critical part of our energy policy, but yet conservation is not enough. We need a real energy policy, an all-of-the-above approach. 
   Our friends across the aisle are proposing all kinds of things that we're hearing about. They're proposing a policy that permanently locks up 80 percent, 80 percent of American energy on the Outer Continental Shelf. Our friends are proposing permanently locking up 1 trillion barrels of oil from oil shale in the inner-mountain west. How can you explain that to the American public? What's your explanation? How can you say we want to permanently lock up more than 10 billion barrels of oil on Alaska's remote North Slope? And how do you explain no to nuclear power when countries like France rely on nuclear power for 80 percent of their electricity? People around this country are struggling with high utility bills. 
   We ought to be looking at ways to diversify our sources of energy and putting this country on a sound footing, putting America first. How can our friends across the aisle do nothing about constructing clean coal and looking at that type of new technology? This is critical. And yet again they propose additional tax increases on the energy companies that are trying to provide energy for this country. I just don't get it. I don't get it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think everybody in this Chamber ought to look at that plaque up there. Look at that plaque. It quotes from Daniel Webster, who says, ``Let us develop the resources of our land.'' The resources of our land. We shouldn't be holding back. This is  the only country holding back on this. Let us develop the resources of our land. Let us call forth its power and build its institutions. That's what this Congress should be doing. Not wasting time. I have got to go back home and explain why I spent a week up here while folks back in Louisiana are struggling after another hurricane and I have got to explain to those folks that I came up here and we didn't do anything substantively in this Congress and we didn't do anything that they care most about: getting an energy policy. 
   Read that plaque again: ``Let us develop the resources of our land.''

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3162. Last night, I offered an amendment in the Rules Committee that would require states to report their plan to target the lowest income families for enrollment first and to report their plan to avoid displacing private insurance coverage that families already enjoy. Unfortunately, the Majority does not want to encourage states to work to cover the neediest children first. 
   Many low income families in hurricane damaged areas of my own district remain eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP. According to the State of Louisiana, more than 68,000 children in families that make less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level remained eligible but unenrolled in SCHIP as of May 2007. 
   Instead of targeting sufficient outreach to low income families, the bill wastes scarce outreach dollars by encouraging states like New York to enroll families making more than $82,000 who already have insurance. Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that half of the children in families making 300 percent above the federal poverty level who currently have private insurance could be pushed out of that coverage and onto new government programs. 
   The bill also harms rural seniors who will be harmed by cuts to Medicare Advantage. Don't forget that more than 2,000 seniors in Calcasieu Parish lost coverage after Washington's last cuts to that program, and now Washington is poised to do it again. 
   Scarce federal tax dollars should be used to target the neediest children first. I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As a physician who's treated many uninsured patients, I have to say that there's a profound difference between coverage and access to care. Yes, you need coverage, but it doesn't necessarily equate to access. 
   Clearly, we've got a number of uninsured children in Louisiana. We have 107,000 on SCHIP but 91,000 who currently qualify who are not on SCHIP. 
   I asked the question why. I offered an amendment in this process to try to get the States to certify, to give reasons and to take steps to clear up this problem, to get those who currently qualify onto the rolls, to let this program work for those it's intended to; yet this amendment wasn't even allowed through the rules process. So this has not been an open and thorough debate on this problem. 
   We need to get away from our dug-in positions on different sides of this and really work hard on this health care access issue to solve it. It's got to be bipartisan. That's the only way it's going to work.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, a new cellulosic ethanol plant recently began production in my district, which will use high-energy sugar cane to yield ethanol. It is yet another reminder of the importance of domestic energy production not only for southwest Louisiana but for our entire Nation. 
   But we must recognize that we have a strategic dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil. The farm bill currently working its way through Congress should not pick winners or losers but encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. It is a critical piece to our national energy plan with renewable agri-based energy solutions. 
   Home-grown energy as a part of our national energy strategy reduces our dependence on foreign energy supplies, helps the environment, and will promote our rural communities and keep them strong. 
   This Democratic Congress has failed to produce a viable energy policy. I challenge the Democratic leadership to work with us in Congress to produce such a viable energy policy.

   Families across America are paying higher energy costs, they're bearing the burden of higher costs of living, and they are paying more for their health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, and while I do not by any means think it is a perfect bill, I do believe it contains a number of important improvements over prior versions of the legislation. More importantly, it marks a commitment by this Congress to ensure that the law of the United States protects American workers and health care consumers from discrimination on the basis of their genetic makeup. Because that goal is so critical, I will vote for this bill today, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
   I would like to commend my colleagues, and fellow member on the Committee on Education and Labor, Representative JUDY BIGGERT, and Congresswoman LOUISE SLAUGHTER for their tremendous work and years of dedication on this important issue. Both of you have been persistent and effective on so many issues that have come before this committee and this Congress. Both should be commended for adding this important bill to your list of legislative accomplishments. 
   As was noted during our committee's consideration of this bill, I believe that the title of the legislation before us, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, embodies a proposition that all members of our committee and, indeed, all Members of this Congress should endorse. Simply put, no employee should face discrimination on the basis of genetic makeup or on any characteristic other than the ability to do the job. Similarly, no employee should risk his or her health insurance status simply because of the possibility that they may someday develop an illness. 
   This bill was drafted with those fundamental principles in mind, and I believe that through the legislative process we have taken steps toward ensuring that the bill we pass fulfills those principles, while minimizing the potential for unintended consequences. 
   I would like to point out a number of improvements in the bill that I think merit attention. 
   I am pleased that the bill before us today embodies the same logic as a past executive order issued by President Clinton to ensure that this legislation would not inadvertently serve as a broad, new Federal mandate requiring all insurance plans and employers to cover all treatments related to genetic-related conditions. That is exactly the type of unintended consequence we were seeking to avoid, and I am pleased that we were able to work this out. 
   Second, I would like to highlight a provision in the legislation that ensures that employers, who are currently subject to a number of confidentiality and recordkeeping requirements under law, are not burdened by yet another redundant set of paperwork requirements. The bill before us today provides that with respect to genetic information, if an employer maintains employee records and treats them as it does confidential medical records under the Americans with Disabilities Act, it is in compliance with this new genetics law. 
   Third, I applaud a significant improvement in the bill, and namely, its extension of genetic nondiscrimination protection to all Americans. One of the issues raised during our committee's consideration of the bill was concern that the bill's protections did not adequately extend to cover children in utero or at early stages of development or in connection with in vitro fertilization and other technologies. I am very pleased that the final bill before us addresses these issues to the satisfaction of all Members on both sides of the aisle who have worked in good faith to ensure the broadest protection possible. 
   The bill contains a number of other improvements over prior versions, representing issues we were able to work through over the past couple of months and which demonstrate how the committee process is truly meant to work. We were presented with well-intentioned legislation, heard meaningful testimony on it and its potential impact on employers and employees  alike, raised and debated legitimate concerns, and worked together to bridge the gap between where we began and where we stand today. I thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for making this a reality. 
   I would be remiss if I did not point out concerns I have with the bill and express my hope that as the legislative process continues, and if and when the provisions of this bill are administered, we give due weight to these concerns. 
   I remain concerned that the bill's penalty provisions are overbroad and will potentially subject employers to punitive damages for simple paperwork violations. I am equally concerned that the bill we pass today will not set a single national standard, but still leave employers subject to a patchwork of varying requirements on a State-by-State basis. And finally, I think the bill would be significantly improved if we made clear that employers would not be held liable for the acquisition and use of genetic information where such use was required or justified by business necessity. 
   As we send this bill to the United States Senate for consideration, I would urge my colleagues in that body to take up and address these issues. Beyond that, as courts and administrative agencies interpret and enforce these laws, I would urge them to heed the intent of Congress; namely, that this bill's most egregious penalties must be reserved for the most egregious violations of the law, and that our intent is not to ensnare employers acting in good faith in a legal web of penalties and damages. 
   As I noted at the outset of my remarks, our actions today will ensure that the law of the United States protects American workers and health care consumers from discrimination on the basis of their genetic makeup, a goal I think that is shared by every Member of this House. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the ranking member. 
   Mr. Chairman, the purpose of the amendment that we have is plain and simple. It's to protect the privacy of America's fallen heroes and their families. 
   Along with my colleague and friend from Oklahoma, Congressman Boren, I introduced this measure at the request of mothers of Marine Private David Burridge and Army Corporal Joseph Thibodeaux, both of Lafayette, Louisiana, who lost their lives in Iraq in September of 2004. While still recovering from the shock and the loss of their children, these mothers were appalled to discover the names of their sons had been printed on the back of T-shirts and sold for profit. 
   This amendment before us today requires that our military men and women, or their surviving relatives, be the sole decisionmaker in consenting to use their name or image for commercial purposes. While there is no way to ever express in words the significance of their sacrifice, we have a duty to honor and protect their memories and, most importantly, their rights. 
   No one can dispute that Americans, and particularly Members of this body, have fundamental differences over the war in Iraq. All Americans certainly have a right to express these views in public, but Americans, and particularly our fallen heroes and their families, also have a right to protect their names and images from commercial exploitation. This amendment accomplishes just that. 
   I want to thank Chairman Skelton, our Ranking Member Hunter, as well as the Rules Committee for allowing this amendment to come to the floor. 
   I urge our colleagues to support this nonpartisan legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my friend from New York for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 133 because many Americans lack protection from catastrophic long-term care expenses related to chronic illnesses and disability. And worse yet, most families assume that Medicare will actually pay for these long-term care services, while it generally does not; and oftentimes they find out in the midst of a family crisis when a loved one is ill, placing intensive emotional burdens as well as financial burdens on families. 
   I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Herseth Sandlin, for working with me on this and really for being a champion on this issue. She and I have worked together, and we have had some success in persuading HHS and Social Security to clarify these widespread perceptions. 
   I am hopeful that the passage of this resolution will encourage Secretary Leavitt, President Bush and the future administration to discuss this critical retirement security issue with the American people. A recent poll found that the majority of voters want to hear more about plans on how we will deal with this problem, and they desire more information on this. And that perception out there that exists that Medicare covers this is a real problem. The more we can get this information out to the American people, the greater the service we will be doing to help them deal and to cope with these problems. 
   We clearly must do more to expand coverage for long-term care, to assist family caregivers, particularly those coping with the onset of chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. So I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 133.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I am pleased that a report by AARP acknowledged consumer-directed health plans often provide more freedom of choice, lower premiums while giving consumers more control over their health care. This year I introduced H.R. 2639 to expand and improve coverage under these patient-centered plans. Public and private sector leaders must do more to empower patients with convenient, reliable information on cost and quality so consumers can purchase better care at a lower cost. 
   Recent reports contend that health care plans haven't done enough in this area. These criticisms underscore the need to quickly build on gains we have made in health care transparency. Secretary Leavitt has laid important ground work in this area. 
   H.R. 2639, coupled with better information for patients, will improve access, lower costs and improve quality of health care. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Last week, Speaker Pelosi embraced the Democrats' $1.3 billion tax scheme. The ink is barely dry, but she is already distancing herself from the mother of all tax hikes. 
   As reported in today's Hill newspaper, the Speaker's office has changed the transcript of her press comments to reflect that she supports Chairman Rangel's ``plan to begin tax reform,'' not his actual ``tax plan.'' 
   Maybe the Speaker has caught on to what many Americans have discovered in the fine print. Maybe she figured out that the bill raises taxes on every U.S. taxpayer. Or it could be the part about resurrecting the death tax and penalizing small businesses and family farms that is causing her concern. Then again, it might be that she simply agrees that our Tax Code shouldn't punish a man and woman for getting married. 
   Madam Speaker, you can change the transcript, but you can't change the facts. The Pelosi-Rangel mother of all tax hikes is bad for the U.S. economy and worse for the American taxpayer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, for more than 3 years I have worked with Southwest Louisiana farmers to deliver a sound and responsible farm bill, and I am glad to report that our hard work has finally paid off with a bipartisan bill. 
   This important piece of legislation is a victory for farmers in rural communities throughout Louisiana and around the country, but the President failed to see it this way. And I understand his arguments. This is not a perfect bill, but it does make important reforms with a hard cap on farm and nutrition programs. 
   The hard work of farmers and ranchers across our region maintains America's food security. Ensuring that we have access to safe quality food is critical, and American farmers lead the way. This farm bill supports American farmers going through tough times, while not burdening them during good times. This farm bill supports the agriculture community and ensures its competitiveness in the years to come. 
   This has been a long process, but in the end we were able to come together and support a bipartisan, responsible farm bill. I am proud of the work we accomplished on this farm bill, and I am grateful to all of those in Southwest Louisiana who helped me with it. 
   I urge my colleagues to override the veto and vote for American farmers.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. I want to thank my colleague. I also want to thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for bringing this bill to the floor. 
   And while I am pleased that this bill is being brought to the floor this evening, its title is actually a misnomer. The Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act also covers many areas hit by my district in southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas, those areas hit by Hurricane Rita. 
   My district in southwest Louisiana received about $10 billion in damage from Hurricane Rita, and this was to small rural communities that don't have the ability to bounce back. As we recover in southwest Louisiana, we have learned all too well that government cannot micromanage the full recovery process, and this GO-Zone legislation has played a very important role in providing a foundation for businesses and families to get back on their feet. So I am pleased that today's legislation extends many of these successful provisions and programs for southwest Louisiana communities. 
   Two of the most important include an extension of the placed-in-service deadline and a waiver of the 10 percent rule for GO-Zone credits. These provisions will help those who are on the front lines of our housing recovery, rather than revert funding back to the State. 
   Additionally, the bill allows GO-Zone low-income housing projects to receive additional federally subsidized loans without facing a reduction in tax credits. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I take issue with the bill's title, I fully support its provisions. It is a good bill. Again, I thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for their support and urge support of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (TRAUMA CARE SYSTEMS PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding time to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, prior to coming to Congress, I was a practicing cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon with extensive experience in open heart surgery, as well as trauma surgery. But I want to speak about the importance of this bill not as a physician but as a parent of a son who was in a severe car accident. 
   About 6 years ago, I will never forget this, this was a Wednesday night, about 11:30 in the evening, and I received a phone call from the hospital from a friend of mine who is an emergency room physician who told me, was your son driving a black Alero? I said, what do you mean, ``was''? He went on to say, ``Well, I think he's going to be okay.'' He started to read off the litany of injuries that my son had. 
   So I immediately rushed over to the hospital, and I didn't think about it, but I happened to be on call for chest trauma that night, so I was worried that I might have to operate on my own son. I get to the hospital and found out that he was in the emergency room, sitting there for about 3 to 4 hours. He was in shock. There was no organization with regard to prioritization of his injuries. 
   I immediately jumped in and started kind of prioritizing things, and we managed to get him stabilized. He went through some extensive surgery that night. He subsequently had to be transferred to another hospital 180 miles away for further treatment of his extensive orthopedic injuries. 
   Because of lack of trauma coordination at that hospital, he developed severe malnutrition, lost about 50 pounds, had a lack of coordination with his antibiotics, developed infections, and spent nearly 6 or 7 weeks in the hospital, followed by about 3 to 4 to 5 months of further care to get him back to where he could walk with crutches. Thankfully now, today, he is doing well. 
   But if it wouldn't have been for my personal experience as a physician, overseeing the care of my son, he would not have gotten the appropriate care, and that is because we didn't have a coordinated trauma center. 
   Trauma cannot be fragmented. It requires a coordinated effort by a team of experts. 
   As was mentioned, the mortality rate from trauma is significantly higher in rural areas than it is in urban areas. There are nearly 20- to 25,000 trauma deaths each year that are preventable if we had the proper coordination. 
   We have learned much from the military. Much of trauma surgery has evolved from military activity and stream of the wounded afterwards. There have been tremendous advances, but this does not translate to civilian area, where we do not have trauma centers. 
   Clearly, this is a bill that is important, and I appreciate the committee for bringing this forward and the hard work that has been done. 
   This bill will ensure that severely injured patients get coordinated care, get care by experts, by a team of experts, not just in the emergency room and the operating room but in the aftermath, where it's so critical to full recovery and full rehabilitation. 
   This bill will award grants to the States for planning, implementing and developing trauma care systems. The Institute of Medicine has said the availability of Federal funds through the Trauma Care Systems and Planning Development Act appears to have helped increase the number of trauma centers and urged, in 1999, the reauthorization of the Trauma Care Act. 
   This bill is absolutely necessary. It's critical, and it also will serve to build a trauma registry, which is so important, so that we can catalog these injuries and learn from these things so that we can actually improve trauma care further in the civilian arena. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It's a superb bill. It's an excellent bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOUSTANY. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I want to thank my colleague for yielding time and for his work with me on an amendment to this bill that I think will improve the bill. 
   I also want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the committee and the ranking member of the full committee for their work in bringing together a good bill. 
   I rise in support of the bill, but I want to emphasize that our Nation has a growing demand for natural gas, and this amendment that I'm going to offer with my colleague and friend, Mr. LaTourette, will help to ensure that we don't halt future domestic liquefied natural gas expansion.  
   Some localities have turned their backs on this promising energy solution. And if we're going to solve our energy problems in this country, we have to make sure that we diversify our sources to the fullest extent. In Louisiana, we have prided ourselves upon producing and delivering energy that all Americans rely upon, and liquefied natural gas is certainly no exception. 
   This past Monday, I was down in Cameron Parish on the coast of Louisiana in my district with Secretary Bodman for the opening of the first liquefied natural gas facility to be constructed in this country in over the past 25 years. And this facility, once fully operational, will be the largest liquefied natural gas facility in the world. It's going to supply approximately 5 percent of all U.S. natural gas needs when fully operational. It has two 42-inch pipelines that will connect to provide natural gas for 75 percent of all the markets in the United States. And within the next decade, 25 percent of all natural gas will run through my district. 
   So clearly, as we look at this bill, we should not have provisions that could potentially kill future liquefied natural gas expansion by arbitrarily legislating that no new facility can be certified unless the Coast Guard has the assets on hand to carry out the security measures. The Coast Guard does not need to do all of this. They have limited assets. And down in my district they have worked very well with local authorities, sheriff's department, other local authorities, to bring all assets to bear to provide the necessary security. The Coast Guard must be allowed to continue to have this ability to partner with local agencies and waterway users, state government, local law enforcement, to manage and protect our waterways. 
   The first delivery of natural gas into the newly constructed Sabine Pass facility that I just mentioned illustrates this point. The Sabine-Neches Navigation District manages the overall river maintenance. They help fund local law enforcement efforts. And the Jefferson County, Texas sheriff's department provides helicopter overflight security. Cameron Parish, just across the river in my district, provides the marine patrol supplement. And all of this is done under the approval and guidance of the Coast Guard. So we're not undermining what the Coast Guard does, we're merely enhancing what the Coast Guard is able to do to provide security.     
   A cooperative approach is working on the gulf coast. It allows the Coast Guard to work with Southwest Louisiana authorities and Texas authorities in this situation. We shouldn't handcuff these communities in this effort. 
   So I urge the adoption of the amendment as we go forward with this bill.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from South Carolina for giving me time. 
   I also want to pay tribute and thank my colleague, friend and student of history, the distinguished Armed Services Committee chairman, Mr. Skelton, for bringing this very important resolution to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a native of Lafayette, Louisiana, to pay tribute to the Marquis de Lafayette and the French culture that continues to leave an indelible mark on south Louisiana. It is not by coincidence that my hometown is named after this French hero of America's Revolutionary War. 
   During the Acadian deportation of 1755, thousands of men, women and children were expelled from Nova Scotia. Some returned to France, but many sailed through to the French colony of Louisiana, where, over the centuries, they have established their own unique French-Acadian or what we now call Cajun culture. 
   It is now estimated that there are over 450,000 Acadian descendants in Louisiana alone, and nearly 250,000 claimed French to be their principal language. 
   Last week, I introduced House Resolution 398 to congratulate newly elected French President Nicolas Sarkozy on his recent victory, as well as to recognize the longstanding relationship between the United States and our friends in France. 
   Clearly, nowhere is this relationship between our two countries displayed more than right here in this Chamber where each day we face the portraits of America's first President, George Washington, but also America's adopted son, Marquis de Lafayette. 
   It is clearly fitting that we recognize the Marquis de Lafayette's accomplishments on the 250th anniversary of his birth today. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution. 
   The distinguished gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) outlined the history of the Marquis de Lafayette's accomplishments, and I am not going to repeat all of that at this time. But suffice it to say, clearly the Marquis de Lafayette was a great patriot and a great friend of America, and the relationship between Marquis de Lafayette and our first President is emblematic of the relationship between our two great countries.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend, Mr. Graves, for yielding time to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. H.R. 3246 reauthorizes the Delta Regional Authority, which works to improve the life for residents in some of the most economically distressed areas in our country. Those parishes and counties served by the DRA have per capita incomes at or far below the national average, and poverty in the region runs nearly 55 percent higher than the national rate. 
   Since being created, DRA has worked to improve the economy in the delta and allowed these residents to achieve parity with the rest of the country. The key to DRA's success is its ability to foster partnerships throughout the region and to collaborate with local development districts and other Federal and State agencies to ensure maximum benefit from the dollars invested. 
   In fact, in an article published last year, the Economist noted: ``It is creating, or helping to retain, 36,000 jobs, mostly in manufacturing, which will generate $1 billion in salaries. It has also helped 23,000 families get running water and sewage.'' 
   In the aftermath, Mr. Speaker, of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, the DRA took a leadership role in working to address many of the recovery issues facing our State of Louisiana. 
   I want to thank Chairman Oberstar, my good friend, and the leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the staff, subcommittee Chairman GRAVES, my good friend, for working with me to ensure that several of the parishes in my district that were hit hardest by Hurricane Rita are included in the DRA. 
   Data provided by the Department of Commerce shows that these parishes are now among the most economically distressed in our country, and recovery has been slow. I want to emphasize, though, that the people of southwest Louisiana are resilient, and we will rebuild and, in fact, we are rebuilding. This legislation will provide them with just yet another tool to facilitate growth and return to economic prosperity in the region. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Again, I thank Chairman Oberstar, the Democratic staff, Chairman GRAVES, Chairman MICA and our staff. I want to thank also my legislative director, Terry Fisk, for working with me on this very important piece of legislation.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, a recent article in The Washington Post highlights the importance of expanding health savings accounts for America's families. The article mentioned a woman who switched to an HSA with a high deductible health plan after her insurance premiums increased by 42 percent in 1 year. As a result, the monthly cost of her asthma medication consumed all the money in her HSA. 
   Patients with chronic conditions shouldn't have to pay a high deductible before their coverage begins. Giving patients with HSAs the freedom to choose plans that offer up-front coverage will avoid hospitalizations and reduce the costs that are borne by all Americans. 
   Recently, I introduced H.R. 2639, the Promoting Health for Future Generations Act of 2007. The bill permits HSA owners to receive prescription drugs before paying a deductible. It also permits working families to accumulate more money in these accounts, resolving the situations like the one pointed out in The Washington Post article. 
   I urge my colleagues to expand coverage and empower patients by cosponsoring H.R. 2639. Doing so will give Americans greater flexibility and independence when managing their families' health care needs.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Last week a powerful hurricane hit southern Louisiana.  
   First I want to thank all the volunteers and workers who are helping in this recovery effort. 
   Hurricane Gustav, as Hurricane Ike threatens to do, highlights the importance of American energy production in the Gulf of Mexico. Dangerously, America remains just one major storm or one geopolitical act from another major hike in the price at the pump. 
   Gas prices affect our food prices, the economy in general, and people's pocketbooks directly. 
   Throughout August I joined my fellow House Republicans in urging Speaker Pelosi to bring Congress back to session to help American families struggling with dramatically high gas prices. She refused. But now we can act. 
   We can increase our own energy supply, become less dependent on foreign sources of oil, create good, high-paying American jobs. We can do this. Many of these energy jobs are going overseas, but we can keep them right here in America. By harnessing all of America's vast resources, we can help Americans in the short term and into the future. 
   Let's do the responsible thing. Let's open up parts of our deepwater coasts for energy exploration, and let's begin to reduce the price at the pump. We can take control of our energy future, which is our economic future. We can lower families' anxiety, but Congress must act to increase American energy production across the board now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my friend, the gentleman from Texas, for yielding time. 
   Let me start by saying, first, I want to thank our troops, our embassy personnel, State Department personnel and all their families for the sacrifices that they've dealt with as we've dealt with this problem in Iraq, this 
   challenge that we're faced with. 
   I've come away from a trip just this past week and recognize that I truly believe that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are going to come forward with a very independent, unvarnished report about what's going on in Iraq. We're going to see what's working and what's not working, and I appreciate that. And I think that's going to be the most important report that this Congress will look at to determine how do we move forward; what steps should we take as a Congress with this situation in Iraq. 
   With that having been said, this past year was very difficult. We saw a lot of  violence. I know at the beginning of 2006, Iraq was really threatening to spiral out of control with violence. Some described it as anarchic fragmentation, which was really a very visual term for what was potentially going to happen in Iraq. 
   And when the President announced his surge strategy back in I think it was late December, I have to say I was very skeptical because I kept thinking, what's next? A surge is fine. We can get more troops in. The Iraq Study Group actually agrees that this could be a temporary measure to gain security. But what do we do following that to get political gains in Iraq? What can be done to help develop the economy in Iraq? These were the key issues to me. 
   Then it became clear, subsequently, that our State Department was working on a plan to deal with this. And it was unclear as to what exactly the steps were; but as things have unfolded, we have seen significant success over the past year. 
   And this was highlighted by my recent trip when I walked through the streets of Fallujah with three other Members of Congress. And I would have never thought that just even a month ago or two months ago a platoon of marines could even walk through the streets of Fallujah, much less four Members of Congress. 
   So as we walked through the streets, we saw shops that were open. Shop keepers were smiling, children were playing in the streets. There was a volleyball game going on on one block. Another block I saw some children playing soccer. There were families strolling through the streets and talking. And this clearly was a major change, a major departure from what we had seen just months ago in Fallujah. 
   And what we found out was that an Iraqi solution was being brought to bear in Fallujah, an Iraqi solution for security, which has allowed for security to grow throughout the city of Fallujah, creating an environment that's now allowing economic activity in that city. 
   Children are now back in school. We're seeing shops that are open, microlending programs are ongoing, and this is just tremendous success. And the hallmark of the plan that has been implemented by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker is that you look at the circumstances in a particular local in Iraq, like Fallujah, or perhaps Ramadi or Tikrit, and work with the circumstances on the ground and make those institutions that are available work for the positive. 
   And what I mean by that is, what we have is a situation where, after getting security and working with the Iraqis to set up these joint security stations throughout the city of Fallujah, now we've got a provincial reconstruction team working in Fallujah. This is a team of civilians and military who are working on the political side of things, working to help build the political infrastructure from the ground up. 
   And now what we're seeing is tremendous success with this, with a sort of a grass roots movement. And I've said over and over, the most difficult thing is going to be to get the Iraqi central government to come to reconcile and to come to terms, because it's been a country that's been fraught with division. But it's going to be an Iraqi solution that will bring that together. And as this grass-root development happens in Fallujah, in Ramadi, in Tikrit and Mosul and other cities throughout Iraq and our communities throughout Iraq, we will see a coalescence of political activity which will put pressure on those central politicians to come forward. And that's part of the whole political process. 
   The Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, the Sunni Deputy Prime Minister, his name is Salaam as Zobadaei, told us that you can look at the fruit, but the fruit will not come until you grow the tree. And that was a very, very, precise and visual way of describing what needs to happen. We need to see Iraqi institutions growing from the ground up, because then you'll have a sustainable government. To have an Iraqi Government impose from the top and to try to force it down is not sustainable. So I'm encouraged that this plan is working. We're seeing positive signs, and we need to give it further time. 
   These provincial reconstruction teams are doing an outstanding job. There are some 10 or 14, I believe, just in the Baghdad and Anbar area, and then one in each other province. And I think our State Department deserves tremendous credit for working under very difficult circumstances and putting these provincial reconstruction teams together to make this sort of political grass-roots movement occur. 
   And on the broader diplomatic front, we now know that the Saudis are looking at putting an embassy into Baghdad. Recently, the French Foreign Minister was in Baghdad and they expressed that the French want to play a bigger role. We need to have continued vigorous diplomacy to move forward to get debt relief on the Iraqi Government. And I believe if we move along on the diplomatic front, as I mentioned, on continuing to build this grass-roots political development internally in Iraq, economic development with microlending programs, all because we managed to get security, we're going to see a successful outcome in Iraq. And I think in short order we should be able to draw back down on our combat troops and offer more of a supportive role.

And now that is gone and they are trying to figure out how to reconcile all of this.

And for the first time since I have been in Congress, I have got a level of comfort that I believe we are on the right track. So I would urge patience in this. I do believe we will draw down some of our combat troops in the short term, and I am guardedly optimistic.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in support of this supplemental package. Obviously, we need to get the money to the troops in the field, and, also, my State of Louisiana needs these additional funds as well. 
   But I want to point something out that has not been discussed in the debate. The President called for 10 new provincial reconstruction teams for Baghdad. Upon arrival in Baghdad, General Petraeus has asked for 14, four additional PRTs. State and USAID cannot really adequately plan to put this into effect. Particularly, they are phase 3, where they get the personnel in position. So the much-needed money for the State Department is in this supplemental. And for those of us who are interested in seeing the political and economic side of our plan enacted and successful in Iraq, it greatly depends on getting this funding to the State Department. 
   So I urge our colleagues to support this supplemental package, particularly those of you who are interested in the economic and political side of this, because if we are going to push for reconciliation, it is clearly critical to have these State Department personnel on the ground providing that on-the-ground pressure to move toward reconciliation in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my colleague for yielding time to me. 
   As a physician, I am deeply disappointed in the way we are legislating on health care. Here we are, on one hand, physicians are facing a 10 percent cut in reimbursement, which is going to deeply have an impact on access. Furthermore, a 5 percent cut coming up in January. On the other hand, we are going to cut $47 billion out of a Medicare program that is extremely valuable to rural America. 
   I have a substantial number of citizens, constituents in my district, who depend on this program for access, not just coverage. Coverage is something on paper. Coverage gets you, hopefully, into the door, but not necessarily into the door of a physician's office where they can have a physician-patient relationship, a meaningful relationship that focuses on prevention and screening and not just treating everybody as if they are just a cog or an animal. 
   We want to do good health care, and this is an irresponsible way to do this. This bill does not pay attention to access; it simply glosses over it. It pits seniors, seniors against physicians. As a physician, I deeply resent that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the ranking member for yielding time. 
   Madam Chairman, we started off in a very bipartisan way to put this together. We worked in good faith. We worked long hours to come up with a really good farm bill. And when it was all done, we all felt very good about it. We had a great night. We patted ourselves on the back, very pleased with the commodities program, pleased with conservation. It was a good bill. 
   And where are we today? We've had this tax provision put in at a late hour. We have a tax provision that was not properly vetted by the Ways and Means Committee. It was placed in this by the Democratic leadership, using the Rules Committee to legislate. And this has threatened a very good farm bill. 
   There are problems with this. First of all, I don't think we really know  what the real impact is going to be with this tax provision on the cost of feed, fertilizer and pesticides. Many of the companies that are going to be taxed with this new tax will be forced to raise prices on this. And our farmers are already suffering from the high cost of inputs, particularly in my State of Louisiana, which is suffering from the aftermath of two hurricanes. 
   Furthermore, this bill has Davis-Bacon provisions in this which are going to hurt a nascent industry, the nascent cellulosic ethanol industry. I spoke to the CEO of a company today, and this is going to raise the cost of building these new facilities by 10 to 20 percent. This is an industry that we want to see grow. We don't want to tax it. 
   Finally, the bill places unfunded mandates on the States. I tried in committee with an amendment and tried to get this to a full floor debate to help our States continue to modernize the Food Stamp program, to have the flexibility to do the right thing. This bill, the underlying bill, has provisions in it that take away the flexibility that our States currently have. It puts the State of Indiana in real jeopardy, at risk of losing $100 million. 
   This bill is less and less about farmers and it's more and more about pure raw politics.

   Now we see a tax provision that has been put into this at the last moment, a tax provision that has never been vetted. It is a complex tax provision that abrogates treaties. Furthermore, it is a tax provision that is going to hurt the very companies that produce pesticides and fertilizers that are helping our farmers. 
   My farmers are trying to recover from Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. This provision is going to hurt them. This provision threatens this bill. Frankly, I am offended that we are here at this point in time. 
   Furthermore, I had an amendment that would have addressed a problem in the bill with the Food Stamp Program. The States need adequate flexibility to create efficiency so that we can take care of our neediest citizens. That amendment was not allowed to go forward in this debate. It certainly deserves a full and open debate, as the previous speaker said.

   Today, advancements in satellite and fiber-optic technologies have led to incredible gains in every area of our society, including health care, economic expansion, education, and military operations. Unfortunately, though, our laws have not advanced and our intelligence community continues to face significant obstacles because of simplistic and antiquated laws. 
   Make no mistake, we live in a time when extremist groups continue to plot acts of terror against us both abroad and here at home. National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell outlined a list of obstacles he faces with the current FISA law and the tools he needs to correct these problems. Sadly, the bill proposed by the Democrats leaves our intelligence community in the dark. This is too important to play political games with foreign intelligence. We need to vote ``no'' on this bill.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, when it comes to a national energy policy, here we go again. 
   In January, the Democratic leadership promised to work across party lines to come up with a sound, comprehensive energy bill that would address Americans' anxieties about dramatically high gas prices and escalating home heating costs. 
   However, the Democratic energy proposals have lacked any substance to outline a blueprint for increasing our domestic supply. 
   Make no mistake: we must boost our domestic energy supply. The American people want stable prices at the pump, and we can begin to address these problems; but we in Congress must make reasoned energy policy. 
   By promoting a level playing field for technologies, diversifying energy supplies, and increasing our domestic opportunities, we can harness our ingenuity and natural resources to relieve our current difficulties. 
   The American people expect more from Congress. We must increase our supply without overburdening energy producers with unwieldy bureaucracy. Let's work together to help the American people and provide some relief to the anxiety they face this winter.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank my colleague from Washington State for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and this underlying bill, because I believe, first of all, this is an abuse of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. It's further demonstrating the party here, the opposite party position that we have to have an either/or policy. It's either the environment or energy. 
   Whereas I believe on our side of the aisle, we are advocating that the two can march hand-in-hand. I believe this is also a way of blocking sensible energy policy going forward. Clearly, I think, the American public understands it, as well as we do, that we need a comprehensive energy policy. 
   I want to make a few points. First of all, we have seen LNG development down in my district. I have got one facility that is expanding on a river. It's in the midst of a very densely populated area. That river is used not only for industrial purposes, but also recreational purposes. There has been a record of safety, in fact, an unprecedented record of safety. 
   We have a new LNG facility that came online, I guess, a couple of months ago. Secretary Bodman was down there with me. This is creating new American high-paying jobs. Furthermore, there are two other LNG facilities under construction. Finally, I would say these are all small companies. They are not large, big oil companies. 
   One of the companies, the one that does have the one, the facility that's new and up and running and building a second one, not only that, what they have done is participated in coastal restoration projects and marsh preservation. So we know down in Louisiana that our beautiful marsh and wetlands can also be a working wetlands. 
   We also know that this creates great jobs. We also know there is a record of safety with the facility that's in the midst of a densely populated area. 
   I would ask my colleague, what's he going to say to his constituents in Massachusetts and the Northeast when heating oil prices are going to be exorbitant in this next winter? What is he going to do? What is he going to say?

   Clearly, these companies have been good corporate citizens, and they have worked to be good stewards of the environment. I will point out that one company, in addition to marsh restoration and preservation, also prepaid taxes in the State of Louisiana to build schools after Hurricane Rita. 
   This company also built the new health clinic in a small town that never had a health clinic before. These companies are good stewards. They show that environmental policy and energy policy can march hand-in-hand. 
   I don't understand the argument that the other side is making. They are just intent on blocking comprehensive energy policy, and I oppose the bill.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill. WRDA reauthorization is long overdue, and it is vital that we pass H.R. 1495 and get a bill signed into law this year. 
   WRDA authorizes nearly $2.1 billion for the Louisiana coastal area, and it will allow the Army Corps of Engineers to move forward on many critical coastal restoration and hurricane protection projects statewide. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Oberstar for accepting my amendment in committee to add projects identified in the Southwest Louisiana Coastal Hurricane Storm and Reduction Study to the list of priority projects and projects to be expedited under this bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   This study is the first comprehensive assessment of hurricane and flood protection needs of southwest Louisiana. The Corps has nearly completed the reconnaissance phase, and I anticipate that we will enter into an agreement with the State to proceed with the feasibility phase in the near future. 
   It is important that we expedite these projects, not only for southwest Louisiana, but for the entire Nation because in southwest Louisiana our waterways protect much of the vital and necessary energy infrastructure that keeps this country running. 
   We have one of the largest strategic petroleum reserves in my district that is affected here. Also, the Henry Hub, which is where pricing is set for natural gas for the country, is in my district. And it was actually flooded in Hurricane Rita. 
   And nearly 25 percent of the liquefied natural gas will run through my district by 2015. 
   These waterways and coastal wetlands are far more than just commercial routes or playgrounds. They are a critical buffer to protect homes, business and our energy infrastructure and our way of life in Louisiana. What we are talking about is America's energy coast, a working coast. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Madam Speaker, our Democratic friends claim that they won't consider covering anything less than 10 million children, and yet the Congressional Budget Office shows that their own bill falls short yet again. It also fails to give real priority to poor children. It imposes billions of dollars in new taxes on poor families, and we know that this tax revenue stream won't even cover the expense of the bill in the outyears, and it causes millions to lose private coverage. 
   Finally, despite warnings from GAO, it also ignores provider access, something that's critical for our children in the SCHIP programs throughout the country. I know in my State of Louisiana we have a serious access problem, despite the fact that we have 106,000 children in the State covered by SCHIP, 6,000 who should be on it not covered, and yet all of them have significant access problems. 
   I ask the question, why did our Democratic friends block debate on any amendments that would have addressed these and other concerns? We really shouldn't be playing political games with this. We shouldn't be playing games with children's medical care. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and let's work together in good faith to improve coverage and access for children.

Yesterday, the Department of Energy announced a $715,000 grant to my alma mater, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, to develop more effective ways to drill for oil. Students and professors will work together, along with industry, to achieve higher energy yields from each drilling hole. Better exploration and drilling procedures and techniques are just two parts of a comprehensive energy strategy that we need to have because a magic bullet will not solve our energy challenges. It will not lower the price at the pump alone. We need a comprehensive strategy. 
   People of southwest Louisiana and around the country want to increase responsible energy production, they want to see increased refining capacity, they want to unleash American entrepreneurship and ingenuity to solve our energy problems, and they don't want any further delays because gas at the pump, as you can see, is just short of $4 a gallon.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte, the Democratic staff of the committee and the Republican staff of the committee for working with my staffer, Michael Hare, on this amendment. I think it's a very important amendment. 
   I am pleased to offer this with my colleague and good friend, Mr. Alexander, from Louisiana as well. 
   Sweet potato farmers throughout the Nation are involved in an insurance pilot program being administered by the Risk Management Agency. This is a multi-year process which involves many adjustments along the way. The biggest problem was a change made by RMA that defines what qualifies as a marketable sweet potato. 
   The new definition of the term ``marketable'' includes all sweet potatoes over 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Unfortunately, this definition does not allow for any sweet potato that has been ruined and is considered unmarketable from being deducted from the total yield calculation. 
   Sweet potato farmers in Louisiana, as well as in many other parts of the country, suffered heavy rains in September and October of 2005. While these heavy rains led to significant yield losses, sweet potatoes that were over 1 1/2 inches in diameter were counted as a part of the total yield. By counting the sweet potatoes ruined by heavy rains, farmers were unable to qualify for disaster payments. 
   Our amendment would simply use the data collected by the local FSA offices instead of the RMA to be used for the purposes of determining crop losses.     
   These local offices already have the production yield information for the 2005-2006 crop year and will be able to certify if a sweet potato farmer is eligible, indeed, for disaster payment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to be clear: this amendment will only apply to farmers who purchased crop insurance and had a 35 percent crop loss. This amendment simply corrects a technical error made by RMA. 
   Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge that we support our sweet potato farmers and adopt this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOUSTANY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3247, introduced by Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton, will improve the provision of disaster assistance for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This bill was created through an open and inclusive process. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton for working with our Republican Members to include our provisions to this bill. Additionally, I want to thank my good friend and colleague from Louisiana, Ranking Member Baker, for his steadfast support of Louisiana in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Congressman Baker has been a great advocate for our State, and I thank him for helping the committee to draft this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, earlier this year the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management held a hearing on the recovery in the gulf coast following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The bill includes a number of provisions recommended by Members of Congress from both parties who testified at this hearing. These provisions are designed to alleviate specific problems with the recovery in the gulf coast. 
   H.R. 3247 authorizes changes to the Stafford Act programs exclusively for the recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and applies these changes retroactively. The Congressional Budget Office does not expect these proposed changes to have a significant effect on the pace or amount of Federal expenditures from the disaster relief fund and has estimated that enacting H.R. 3247 would have no significant effect on direct spending. I support this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton specifically for working with our gulf coast delegations on this important legislation. The T&I committee has really been very helpful and a strong advocate throughout this process, as my home State of Louisiana and the rest of the gulf coast have tried to recover. I am pleased that the tradition continues today with the work on this bill. 
   I also want to mention that while much of the Nation's focus remains on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, I want to remind my colleagues that there were two storms of similar magnitude that hit the gulf coast in 2005. The second storm, Hurricane Rita, brought high winds in excess of 120 miles an hour and a storm surge equivalent to that of a category 5 storm. Total damage in southwest Louisiana was estimated at approximately $10 billion, making Rita, the forgotten storm, the third most costly natural disaster in U.S. history. 
   Two years later our recovery remains slow, but progress is being made and the people of southwest Louisiana are resilient and we will rebuild. This bill will help fix some of the roadblocks to recovery that we have encountered along the way. Notably, I want to mention one particularly. The bill addresses one of the bigger problems still lingering in my own district, which is the reimbursement to the sports arena called the Cajundome for use of the facility in sheltering both Katrina and Rita evacuees. The Cajundome acted as a shelter from August 30 through October 28, 2005, and processed an estimated 18,000 evacuees within that 60-day period. The facility was subsequently closed until January 2006 for recovery and repair from the sheltering operations. FEMA initially approved and then sought reimbursement for funds paid to the Cajundome for use of the facility while conducting response activities. 
   At issue is whether or not a government entity can be reimbursed for fees for sheltering evacuees after a disaster. The Cajundome, however, operates autonomously from city government, does not have a sustaining tax base, and instead relies on the fees it generates from events during its peak season to maintain operations year-round. H.R. 3247 will allow FEMA to pay for the reasonable cost of renting or leasing a public facility that was used for conducting response activities for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Facilities like the Cajundome are integral to our disaster recovery and response. We shouldn't punish them for opening their doors and providing shelter during a national crisis. 
   Again, I want to thank the committee staff as well, especially Mike Herman and Jennifer Hall, for working with my legislative director, Terri Fish, to develop language that will address this problem. Again, I thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Norton, and Ranking Members Mica and Graves for including it in the bill. Again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3247. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my colleague from Louisiana (Mr. Baker).

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, I thank our ranking member for yielding time to me. 
   Mr. Chairman, while there are many disagreements about policy in Iraq, we can all agree that a military solution is insufficient. More evidence is clearly needed on the political, diplomatic, and economic fronts. But I have concerns about what I am hearing from across the aisle. Given the history, if we look back at the CR at the beginning of th e year, there is a lack of clarity about how funds could be used by our State Department. 
   Furthermore, we saw a marked reduction in human intelligence funding in the Intelligence authorization bill. In the supplemental, economic support funds were basically withheld. But some funding was restored through administration waivers. And now, in this bill, economic stabilization funds were basically zeroed. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank our colleague, our ranking member, for trying in subcommittee and in full com mittee to restore this funding. With this amendment, which I believe is very essential to success in Iraq, he has put forth this effort. This funding is clearly important if we are going to fund the political and economic endeavor in Iraq. The State Department cannot complete its planning and implementation of phase three of putting together these provincial reconstruction teams which are absolutely necessary to the success of the mission. So it is clear that we need for this amendment to pass to allow the State Department to plan and move. 
   In the post-Cold War environment, we have grave responsibilities as a Nation. Yet we are refusing to fund our State Department worthy of this position of responsibility. The United Kingdom alone, which has one-fifth the population of the United States, has 5,600 diplomats worldwide and 130,000 troops. The U.S. has a mere 6,500 diplomats worldwide with 1.4 million troops, 2.5 million if you count our Reserves. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this amendment. Cle arly, it is the responsible thing to do to move forward. It restores $140 million in economic support funds, $16 million in nonproliferation, anti-terrorism and demining efforts, a critical, critical piece to this, and $2 million to increase international military education and training. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a responsible thing to do. I urge all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment.

   Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Chairman, first let me start by saying I have deep respect for the work that Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Wolf have done with this bill. I also have shared the major concerns that both of you have with regard to the internal Egyptian reforms that you're advocating. I share those same concerns. I am also deeply concerned about the border situation between Egypt and Gaza and the smuggling of arms that's ongoing. 
   My amendment takes a step to strike the language in section 699 from the bill that I believe unnecessarily places restrictions on the FMF funding for Egypt. I believe these restrictions are actually harmful to U.S. national strategic interests. 
   I have to say that clearly Egypt has been a vital strategic partner in the region for many, many years, and this is not the way that the U.S. should treat its friends and reward its friends. 
   If you look at the record, Egypt has worked with us to expedite the processing of our nuclear warships going through the Suez Canal when otherwise it would take weeks. Also, the Egyptian Government has shared critical intelligence with us across the board, and there has been significant military cooperation for quite some time now. 
   The other things that have happened is that Egypt has worked hard to maintain the March 1979 Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty. And even as we speak tonight, there are plans being facilitated by Egypt to bring Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas together at Sharm el-Sheikh next week. So clearly Egypt is trying to do what it can to help facilitate the peace process. 
   I believe this funding is a critical part of keeping the peace with Israel, maintaining balance in this part of the region. And also I believe it's in the interest of Israel's national security as well, in addition to being in our national security interest. 
   The current language in the bill would place, I believe, unrealistic restrictions. It requires the Secretary of State to provide certain certifications which are going to be very difficult to provide. And it may just simply end up being political cover. And in the interest of good policy, without browbeating our important ally Egypt in this process, I think we can work with them in a more cooperative way as we go forward to achieve the things that we're trying to achieve, such as getting stability on the border with Gaza, reducing the smuggling or arms, and also moving forward on internal reforms in Egypt itself. 
   This ally is important. I think we need to work with them. We need to understand their timelines, and work with them and respect that timeline as we go forward. 
   I urge adoption of this amendment.

Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, on September 24, Hurricane Rita smashed into Louisiana and Texas, making landfall first in my district at Johnson Bayou in Cameron Parish, a small town in southwest Louisiana. The storm was one of the worst ever to enter into the Gulf of Mexico, causing $11 billion of damage to the area. 
   Hard-working individuals at the community level have had the greatest impact on our recovery and reconstruction, and that's despite fits and starts with government health and so forth. It's the individuals, local officials, families on the ground that made the difference. 
   This storm also caused unprecedented damage to the oil and gas industry. Again, individuals working in those companies got our oil and gas infrastructure back up and running in record time, so that we could fuel America's energy needs. 
   At the Federal level, funds have been appropriated for assistance, but they have been clearly slow to arrive, because of bureaucracy. This has been an ongoing battle that we in Congress have had to fight with and local officials have had to fight with as well. 
   Two weeks ago, I was down there at Johnson Bayou, that little town where they struggled to get their school back. Actually, private funding allowed the school to come back before we could even get Federal funds down there, because of the bureaucracy. That took 2 years, but private funds allowed for the school to be rebuilt. It was one of the first schools to be rebuilt back in Louisiana. 
   I was down there 2 weeks ago for a very special time. We had a ribbon-cutting for a new health clinic in Johnson Bayou down in Cameron Parish. This little town did not have a health care clinic. It never had one. In fact, families had to drive many, many miles on small roads or oftentimes had to rely on a ferry to cross a body of water to receive health care, and if that ferry was down, they were stranded. 
   But with the opening of this health clinic, for the first time, families at Johnson Bayou now have access to health care. This was very special, because a family donated the land for the clinic. A company actually put up money, $2 million to build the clinic, and an additional $1 million to fund its ongoing operations for the next 3 years. For the first time what we have now seen is a health care clinic in Johnson Bayou, where the community came together to put this in place to create access for health care. 
   You know, we all talk about how all politics is local, but I would submit that all health care is local. If we don't have access to health care, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what's available in Boston, Massachusetts, or in San Francisco and New York, because if the folks down in Johnson Bayou don't have access to health care, then what good is it? What good is the great advance in Boston or the wonderful hospitals around the country if folks can't even enter into the health care system in their own community? 
   Access is critically important, and there are many, many things, many factors that affect access. I know this firsthand, as a cardiovascular surgeon before coming to Congress, that many rural communities don't have access because there aren't doctors in these rural communities, or there are no clinics in these rural communities. 
   We have a severe shortage of physicians nationwide right now, and there are many reasons we have shortages. I have asked for a GAO study in the past on this and tried to pass an amendment in the higher education bill last year to look at why we have these shortages. 
   Clearly there are a number of factors, and we need to correct those deficiencies to get a sufficient physician workforce to fill our rural communities and provide access. 
   There are cost issues that limit access, cost for families, where they can't afford health insurance. There are costs, actually, reimbursement factors for physicians which do not provide adequate incentives for physicians and nurses to be in rural communities. We have a severe shortage of nurses. All health care is local, and we have to remember that if we are going to reform the health care system. 
   The United States has one of the best health care systems in the world, and  we spend significantly more on health care than any other nation. Health care costs have doubled between 1993 and 2004, growing to nearly $2 trillion annually. 
   In addition to this, malpractice premiums have continued to skyrocket. Physicians premiums rose 15 percent between 2000 and 2002, and as much as 33 percent for some specialties. Many physicians are basically retiring early from their practices because of the severe costs imposed by malpractice premiums. 
   Some of my Democratic colleagues and some of the presidential hopefuls have lately been advocating a government-run universal health care program, saying that this is the only way we can have universal coverage. But I will tell you this, and I know this as a physician, that universal coverage does not equate to access. Coverage is one thing, but if you don't have the facilities, you don't have the physicians, you don't have the nurses, you don't have the clinic or you can't afford insurance, or you can't find access, it doesn't matter about the coverage. It's access that's important. 
   Now, one of the things that Congress is looking at is the SCHIP bill. One of the things that SCHIP fails to recognize is that the measure fails to take into account that children's health, separated from the parents' health coverage, is not going to be good enough. Again, it's access. 
   I think we have to have three principles, information, choice and control in health care. In a subsequent speech, I will get into more of those things.
