<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (EARMARKING THE SWAMP -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, after we Republicans lost the majority in last year's elections, the new majority promised that they would ``drain the swamp.'' The new majority seemed to recognize that the political cost of earmarks far outweighed the benefits, and modest reforms were instituted to make the process more transparent. 
   However, it soon became clear that the earmark reform rhetoric was not matched by reality. The old majority seems just as mired in the mud as the old. 
   Still, it was with some excitement that I recently discovered in the House-passed Interior appropriations bill a $750,000 earmark for the Great Swamp National Wildlife Preserve in New Jersey. Predictably, this earmark was not to drain the swamp, but to preserve it. 
   This begs the question: If we can't stop passing earmarks to preserve swamps, how will we ever drain the earmark swamp? 
   Mr. Speaker, our constituents and this institution deserve far better. Let's follow up on our promises for earmark reform with actual reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office says that there are unfunded mandates in this bill, but we really don't know what's there because we got this thousand-page bill, thousand-page bill, just about 12 hours ago. 
   As we know, we have a House rule that says we are supposed to get a bill like this 72 hours before instead of 12. Common practice has been if you can't get 72 hours, then at least 24. We've cut that in half, just 12. And most of that was during the time when most of us were asleep. I can guarantee you that few, if any, in this body have read this bill; yet we are voting on it, a billion dollar bill that virtually nobody knows what's in it. 
   We do know, however, and that's the reason this point of order lies against the bill, there are unfunded mandates in the bill. 
   We also have rules with regard to earmarks air-dropped in a bill like this. It's not a conference report of an appropriation bill but an actual bill where they are dropped in at the last minute. The truth is, with a bill that's over a thousand pages long, we simply don't know what's in there; yet we are being told we have got to pass it, we've got to move this thing today. That's simply wrong. 
   I would like the assurance of those from the Rules Committee that there are no unfunded mandates in the bill or there are no earmarks that have been added to the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman. 
   Let me read from the CBO: ``These provisions also contain several private sector earmarks. CBO estimates that their aggregate costs would well exceed the annual threshold established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act for private sector mandates, $131 million in 2007, adjusted annually for inflation. 
   There is the answer to the question of unfunded mandates. They are in the bill. We're waiving those points of order so we can get around that. 
   I would suggest that at some point you've got to say, are we living up to the promises that were made at the beginning of the year? 
   Now, the majority has made a habit, and I don't blame them, of saying this is what you Republicans did while you were in the majority. That is true. Many of us stood here and raised these same points of order when our own party did it. I would love to see on the other side somebody stand up and say this is the wrong thing to do. If it was wrong when Republicans did it, it's wrong when Democrats do it. 
   With regard to earmarks in this legislation, nobody has been able to do anything more than a cursory read of a thousand-page bill that we got just 12 hours ago. But in the biofuels subtitle, we've found a university-based research and development competitive grant program. This grant will be for universities to conduct research and development of renewable energy technologies for ``trees dying of disease or insects infestation as a source of woody biomass.'' This grant is for universities that are near ``trees dying of disease or insect infestation as a source for woody biomass.'' That smells a lot like an earmark to me. It sounds like there is probably just one university, a particular university, or two that meet that qualification. That is certainly an earmark. And that's why these rules were waived again to get around that kind of thing. 
   The Democrats put in some good earmark rules at the beginning of the year, but your rules are only as good as your willingness to enforce them. And that's the problem here. We are not enforcing our own rules.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Thank you. I know it's a very difficult thing. That is a very large bill. 
   That earmark is somewhere in here. We have no idea where. My guess is there are a lot more of them. 
   Let me just talk about one other one. Another questionable provision that looks like an earmark to me is a provision terminating the remaining portions of the New York Liberty Zone tax incentives program. The House-passed previous version of the energy bill gave New York a tax credit of $2 billion to build a rail line from JFK to Lower Manhattan.     
   The bill now purports to reduce the cost of the New York tax provision to $1.1 billion, but the result is only true thanks to some very creative drafting.  In fact, passage of the bill would still let New York keep a total of $2 billion of Federal taxpayer money, with at least $900 million of that coming between the year 2018 and 2019. 
   Again, that creative drafting is somewhere in this document that we got last night, 12 hours ago. And we're expected to go through this and make sure that it complies with the rules. Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this when we have very specific rules? 
   And as I mentioned, I was the first to commend the majority for putting in some good transparency and accountability rules in January. I felt they were better than what we did last year. But your rules are only as good as your willingness to enforce them, and there seems to be no willingness here. That's the problem. 
   So I would be glad to hear from the other side. I will retain my time and hope to hear an explanation of whether or not there are actual earmarks in the bill or unfunded mandates. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, the gentlelady's comments that we have finally removed special interests from the energy field with this bill, when you have a bill like this, I guarantee you it's full of special interest provisions, many of which we haven't discovered yet. 
   I mentioned you have one earmark in here, a grant for universities that are near ``trees dying of disease or insect infestation as a source of woody biomass.'' I would suggest it's probably one particular university in mind, or some special interest, that an earmark will be going to. The New York Liberty Zone provision is another special interest provision. 
   I would also make the point that this is technically not a conference report; there wasn't a conference. This is a House amendment to a Senate amendment to H.R. 6, if I'm not mistaken. What that means is the point of order that I would have liked to have raised against the provisions that may include earmarks in the bill doesn't lie against the bill because it's not a conference report, because it's a House amendment to a Senate amendment. That's another creative way to get around the rules that the majority themselves have put in place. 
   If you say that there are no problems with this bill, why are we waiving all points of order against it? Of course it's to hide things in it. People should be skeptical whenever they see something a thousand pages long, a thousand pages long that nobody, not anybody on the Rules Committee, not anybody anywhere has had the opportunity to read, 12 hours, 12 hours to read that. I don't think Evelyn Wood, with a speed-reading course, or anybody could get through this. And when the majority can simply say, We're not aware of anything, I mean, you can take the Fifth, you can plead the Fifth in court, but I don't think you can do it here. I don't think that that flies, certainly not outside of the Beltway. Certainly people around here should be skeptical of a multi-billion-dollar bill with special interest provisions rife throughout it that we've had 12 hours to review before voting on. 
   When all the majority can tell us is, We're not aware of things in there, let me remind the majority that we had an instance earlier this year, or several instances, where the chairman of the Appropriations Committee signed off on an appropriation bill saying, There are no earmarks in this bill, which prevented us in the minority from actually lodging a point of order against the bill, after Members had already issued press releases claiming credits for their earmarks in the bill. 
   So clearly you can pass some good rules, which you have, but you have got to enforce those rules, and they're not being enforced here. That's why we should uphold this point of order and not move forward and proceed with this bill. You cannot put a thousand-page bill, give it to us with 12 hours to review, with problems rife throughout it, and not have problems. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Let me just make one point with regard to special interests, that they have been removed from this process. Because we were trying to get copies of this legislation and couldn't yesterday, we couldn't get it from the majority, so many of the Republicans were actually getting excerpts and pieces of this legislation from firms along K Street, from the special interests themselves. They seemed to have copies before we in the majority did. There is something wrong with this process. We only get it last night from the majority, but we were getting it yesterday from special interests downtown who already had copies of it, or portions, at least.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (FUNDING THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HOMETOWN SECURITY BY EARMARK -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight an earmark in the fiscal 2009 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. Now, the reason I'm having to do this is that it looks like we won't even be considering this bill on the floor, and therefore, it may be that all of the earmarks, the hundreds of earmarks that were approved in the committee for that bill, may be dumped into the bill, just air-dropped into the bill, at the last minute without even being considered by the House. That's simply not right. 
   This earmark is for the Kentucky-based National Institute for Hometown Security. When I came across this earmark, I was surprised at the dollar amount. In fact, it was the second largest earmark requested by an individual in the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. Now, I would submit that spending like this pushes the Federal Treasury threat level past orange, or high risk, right into the red zone, or severe category. 
   According to the Web site of the earmark recipient, the institute sponsor suggested organizing the higher education institutions of Kentucky to more effectively compete for research funds and projects aimed at improving homeland security. It appears that the purpose of the consortium and of the institute is to make Kentucky better at receiving Federal funds, arguably an admirable purpose. It's simply too bad that it's paid for with Federal funds. 
   The institute goes on to say that the institute is designed to help develop new technologies and devices that commercialize them. Now, with taxpayers shouldering over $5 trillion in Federal debt, why do we need to fund programs for the benefit of commercializing products? 
   This institute was created in 2004. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the agency which is charged with overseeing this, the Department has never requested funds for the National Institute for Hometown Security. Why are we doing this through an earmark? 
   I must ask the question: Would this institute exist in the first place if select members of a powerful committee did not direct the spending for it? 
   Since receiving its first earmark, the institute has received more than $60 million in Federal earmarks, including $12 million in 2005, $20 million in 2006, $20 million in 2007, $11 million in 2008. If this earmark is approved, the institute will have received $74 million in earmark funding. For what? What has the center produced or achieved that can possibly be worth this kind of money? Will we continue to earmark for this institute indefinitely? 
   I am certain, if I had the opportunity to challenge this earmark on the House floor during regular order, the sponsor might be glad to highlight what he believes the institute's achievements are. My response would simply be: If this institute is so important, if it's so needed for the Department of Homeland Security, why do you have to earmark funding for it? Why doesn't the Department seek its own funding and say this is a vital institute? ``We ought to provide funding within the budget. We're going to request it.'' No. The money has to be earmarked by an appropriator. 
   In 2005, a Washington Post story provided details on the institute. It indicated that the sponsor of the earmark has, as a senior appropriator, ``encouraged contractors to move into his district and has announced millions of dollars in antiterrorism research at Kentucky colleges and universities.'' 
   That same article highlighted the sponsor's having taken credit for $206 million in homeland security research-related funding for the State. The Post article indicated: ``So much Federal money for high-tech homeland security projects has flowed to southeastern Kentucky, that those who are there have taken to calling it `Silicon Holler' with the institute and the university consortium at the heart of it.'' 
   I would submit that handling this funding in any other way than through earmarks might put a damper on what appears to be a spoil system where certain powerful Members are able to shower their districts with taxpayer dollars. If we had regular order and a regular authorization-appropriation oversight process, we wouldn't be earmarking funds like this. 
   I would inquire also as to what, if any, oversight the Appropriations Committee has undertaken to ensure that the $60 million that has already been given to the institute was worthwhile and why an additional $11 million is warranted. 
   I would submit also that, when taxpayers send their dollars to Washington, they expect more than an earmarking system that is absent real oversight and that seems to just give the keys to the Treasury to a few powerful appropriators. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will soon be circulating a letter to Speaker Pelosi and to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, asking them to ensure that if we don't have regular order and if we don't go through the appropriations process that we not air-drop earmarks into an omnibus bill when this body has not had a chance to even see them, let alone to adequately vet them. 
   I urge my colleagues to do better with the taxpayers' money. We should be better stewards. We have a time-honored process in this body of authorization, appropriation and oversight  that we have been ignoring for years, and the taxpayers are the worse for it. We cannot continue to do that. This institution is a better body than that, and we ought to give more respect to it.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And first I want to compliment the Democrats for earmark reform that is stronger than the Republicans did. Democrats in this way had more guts than we did to tackle earmark reform in a meaningful way, and I compliment them for that. And let me just note, though, with regard to earmarks something that was said a little earlier. It was said that we can't save money by eliminating earmarks. That is simply not true. It was not true when it was said on this side of the aisle last year, and it is not true when it is said from that side of the aisle today. 
   It is like saying, and the best analogy that I think of is if you go to McDonald's and you order a combo meal and you are sitting there and you say, I am going to save money by not eating the French fries I just ordered, you are correct, you can't. That is the same analogy that is being made on that side. Once you get to the appropriation process, once the 302(a)s and 302(b)s are already set, that is right, you are not going to save money. But you can save money by not ordering the combo meal, by saying, We are going to be spending, we spent last year $3 billion in earmarks in this bill, let's lower our allocation and let's spend less. 
   So this notion that we can't save money by deciding not to spend money on a teapot museum or the Wisconsin procurement initiative is simply not right. 
   But I appreciate, and again I want to compliment, the Democrats for doing stronger earmark reform than we did. 
   Let me make a few comments about PAYGO. If you are going to do PAYGO, I would argue do it whole hog. Let's apply it to mandatory spending; let's apply it to automatic adjustments that come up in the appropriation process every year. This PAYGO reform is incomplete, and it may simply lead to tax increases because you will say the only way we can make this mandatory adjustment is to increase taxes. So the PAYGO restrictions, it is disappointing that they aren't stronger. I would support PAYGO on spending. There is a difference between saying you can keep your own money or we are going to spend your money. And that ought to be made plain in PAYGO.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman. I just want to make a brief observation here. 
   We were here yesterday with the farm bill and witnessed the kind of traveling back in time, if you will, to find a baseline to use so that we could comply with PAYGO. So the majority party seems to use PAYGO however it fits their purposes. They will use PAYGO or they will ignore PAYGO or find ways around it by shopping for a baseline that works rather than what the law provides, or they will say we've got to comply with PAYGO today because we need to increase taxes. 
   So it seems just an observation here that PAYGO is only used as a way not to enforce spending discipline because, if it actually does enforce any discipline, we waive it, but if it's used to increase taxes, then, by golly, we've got to enforce it. 
   I just don't see how one day can make such a big difference if this wasn't the case.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Chair. 
   I brought with me today a stack of Congressional Records. All of us are familiar with these. We used to use them quite a bit, but today not so much. Today most of us just simply go on the computer and have a searchable version that is much faster, searchable back to 1989. With the click of a button, you can find what you are looking for. So we don't use these as much. Unfortunately, we haven't caught up with the times. 
   These are just a few of the thousands and thousands that are delivered that are never read. This was just from one office, the Legislative Research Center in the Cannon Building near my office. These are those that are just going to be thrown away today. One office that collects a few of these will throw these away just today. 
   This year alone these records will cost the American taxpayer over $25 million. Recently my office did an informal survey of about 100 offices. We went in and said, ``What do you do with the Congressional Record that comes?'' Virtually all of them, nearly every one of those 100 offices, said, ``We throw them away. We wish they would stop delivering them.'' We had some offices say that they had requested that they stop being delivered. They are still delivered. 
   So they stack up. They are thrown away. They fill up landfills. I believe the figure is something like 57 tons of paper each year are thrown away just here. 
   Before the Congressional Record was put on line, as I mentioned, they were useful, but they are not now. We obviously do have to have some paper copies. We simply don't need so many. 
   Our amendment would simply do this, and I should add, this amendment was offered by myself and Mr. Blumenauer 2 years ago and was accepted by the then majority. It was simply taken out in the conference. I think we would do well to accept it again today. 
   This amendment would simply save $3.2 million annually by instructing the Government Printing Office to print only half as many copies. Today only 5,600 are printed. Half would do us just fine. That amendment would not reduce the funding for preparation, data collection or other aspects of the Record. It would simply reduce the ink-and-paper copies for half of what we print. So those who might oppose this amendment might say that it is going to cut deep and cut personal and others. It won't as long as fewer records are printed. The costs will go down. 
   This is simply a good way to save taxpayer money. It will show the country that we are interested ourselves in cleaning up our own house, making sure that we move ahead in a fiscally responsible manner.

These groups were selected by competitive audition out of dozens of high schools across the country to perform on March 19, 2007, at New York's famed Carnegie Hall. 
   The Chandler High School Chorale from Chandler, Arizona, has already distinguished itself as one of the top high school choirs in the Nation. Led by Dean Anderson, the chorale has performed across the country and around the world over the past two decades. This is the choir's second performance in the Carnegie Hall National High School Choral Festival, a singular achievement in the festival's history. 
   The Highland High School Concert Choir of Gilbert, Arizona, has also secured a spot in the festival. Led by Rita Scholz, the concert choir has performed in the Arizona ACDA conference, the Arizona Music Educators Association Conference, and the 1998 MENC National Convention. The Highland High School choral music program consists of 170 students in five performing ensembles, presenting four concerts on campus per year, as well as other performances around the country.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, we have passed some good rules with regard to earmark reform and transparency, but we have found a way around them already, because when a report comes to the floor the rule states that it has to state if there is an earmark there, which Member requested it, and what it is for. Yet here we have something that is clearly an earmark for the Stennis facility and not an emergency by any definition. And my office actually called NASA, called the administration, asked was this requested. No, it wasn't; the request came from Congress. Clearly, an earmark request. 
   Yet the report comes to the floor; and because it says there are no earmarks, we have to take it for the purpose of the rule that there are no earmarks. 
   I am just wondering if this is how the appropriations cycle is going to go this year? Do the earmark rules mean anything? Or simply, can we get around them this way? What is to stop every Member from going to the chairman and saying, I have a request for this for my district. Will you simply put it in the overall request? Therefore, my name won't be attached to it. 
   We need to clean up these rules. If the chairman of the Appropriations Committee would clarify this, I would be most appreciative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, in a couple of weeks, it is likely that we will be addressing the Labor-HHS bill. We have passed the bill in the House. I believe they have passed the bill in the Senate, but conferees have not been named. We will be asked to approve a large bill that I believe is over the President's budget. But, more significantly, this is the first test of actually doing a conference under the new earmark rules. 
   We had new earmark rules passed at the beginning of the year that provide a little more transparency than we have had before, and that is a good thing; but it hasn't done much to cut down the number or dollar value of earmarks, because we haven't gotten through the process now. 
   Some people have said in the House we have fewer earmarks, the dollar value is down, and that is a good thing. Certainly it is a good thing. But we are only halfway through the process. Typically, when you get to the conference process, that is where a lot of the mischief happens, where earmarks are added in the middle of the night and you aren't given a chance to vote on them. You simply vote on the bill, either up or down. 
   Just to give you a flavor of what is in this Labor-HHS bill, the House bill included about 1,342 earmarks. These earmarks were added in the conference report of the bill that came to the House. They were added just days before the bill came to the house. We had very little opportunity to actually look at the earmarks to find out which Member had offered them and to offer amendments to strike those earmarks. A few amendments were offered here on the floor, but that is hardly a process that can pass for due diligence to actually see what is in these earmarks. 
   Now, I hasten to add that this is not a partisan issue. There are both Republican and Democrat earmarks in this bill. When Republicans were in charge of this body, typically Republicans got about 60 percent of the earmarks, the Democrats got about 40 percent. Now that has switched. 
   But, really, I wish it were a partisan issue. I wish, as one of my side of the aisle, that Republicans were right on and Democrats were wrong on. But we haven't seen that. We have seen both parties continue to earmark in this fashion. 
   There are 1,342 earmarks in the House bill. Let me just read through a few to give people a flavor of what is there. 
   I wish we didn't have to do this. I wish there was another way. But as I mentioned, when these bills come to the floor, the committee report will accompany the bill. It will only come a few days before the bill passes, and we aren't given a real opportunity to vet these earmarks and look at them. 
   Let me read a few of them. For example, $300,000 goes to the American Air Power Museum in Farmingdale, New York, for exhibits and educational programs. This may be a great museum, but why the Federal taxpayer should be on the hook to fund it, I don't know. 
   And $200,000 in this bill goes to the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, for exhibits and education programs. It may be a great museum, but why is the Federal taxpayer paying for? 
   $200,000 for the American West Heritage Center in Wellsville, Utah, for a lifelong learning initiative. 
   $125,000 for the Children's Museum in Indianapolis, Indiana, for exhibits and equipment. 
   $200,000 for a Children's Museum in Los Angeles for exhibits and educational programs. 
   $150,000, College Park Aviation Museum in College Park, Maryland. 
   If you are recognizing a theme here, the Federal Government is funding a lot of museums. Why is this the case? Why, when we are running massive deficits, when we have a big debt and other obligations that are crying out to pay down the debt, to lower the deficit, why are we funding programs like this? Why are we on the hook for these programs yet again? You have to remember, whenever you are funding a museum, because we have a deficit, we are borrowing money to do that. 
   $250,000 for the Discovery Center in Idaho. This is in Boise, for a science center. 
   $350,000 for an aerospace museum in McClellan, California, for exhibits. 
   $350,000 for the George and Eleanor McGovern Library in Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, South Dakota. 
   $75,000, Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, California. 
   Here is another theme. We fund a lot of aquariums. There are great aquariums that educate a lot of people, but why we are doing it at the Federal level, I don't know. 
   $350,000 for the Museum of Aviation Foundation in Warner Robins, Georgia, for educational programs. 
   Let's pay attention to the Labor-HHS bill as it comes along.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I stand in opposition to H.R. 6. This bill is fatally flawed, both because of the provisions that it contains and also the process that brought it to the floor. 
   Simply put: Congress performs best when the process of Authorization, Appropriation, and Oversight is followed through the regular order. 
   This bill seeks to both Authorize and Appropriate at the same time by short-cutting the authority of the Budget Committee and directing spending. 
   In addition, this new language was brought to the floor without the benefit of review by any Committees, and even before the Resources Committee has been organized. 
   Finally, this bill seeks to create a slush fund for spending on non-specific programs with no enforcement mechanism to ensure that funds are spent appropriately. 
   We are not talking about an insignificant amount; rather, CBO estimates that these provisions will raise $14 billion dollars in federal revenue--$14 billion that should be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction, if raised at all. 
   Beyond the argument of oil and gas tax incentives, sanctity of contracts, or renewable resources, I simply cannot support a bill that displays such a disregard for the legislative process and handle taxpayer dollars with such irresponsibility.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, in the past 24 hours, we have heard word from Cuba that President Fidel Castro does not plan to return to power. This is good news, I think, for all of us. And this is not a surprise to those of us who have been watching Cuba. But here we are, as Americans, on the sidelines again still. For the past 40 years, we have been on the sidelines offering no influence whatsoever in what happens in Cuba. 
   This is a travesty, Mr. Speaker. It is time for a get-tough policy with Cuba. It is time to allow Americans to travel there and spread freedom and influence. If we lift our travel ban, some say that Cuba will simply impose their own on us. But if somebody is going to limit my travel, it should be a communist, not my own government. We should let freedom ring here, and it will soon ring free in Cuba.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Seventeen amendments were ruled in order. But I can tell you one that wasn't: It was one that I offered. It would have been simple to do it. If we are going to make seventeen amendments in order, why not make this one? 
   I offered an amendment that would simply have prevented any funds appropriated to the Federal agencies that must participate in these grant programs from being used for earmarks. 
   Now last week we had a bill called the Beach bill. It came under an open rule; so I couldn't be blocked from offering a similar amendment saying no funds authorized in this bill could be used for earmarks. I offered that amendment and it received overwhelming support. It passed by a 2-1 margin. I believe more than half of the Democrats voted for it and an overwhelming number of Republicans. Why wouldn't we allow that amendment to be offered here? 
   We have programs here, grant programs, and it's conceivable there could be 5,000 or 6,000 grants offered under this program. The temptation is going to be, as it is with all of the other accounts that we have earmarked in this place, to earmark it, for Members to simply set it aside and say I want this grant to go to one of my constituents or somebody else. And for those who say we haven't traditionally done that with this program, well, we didn't traditionally do it with the Homeland Security bill either. For the first 3 years that it came to the floor, some $32 billion, none of it was earmarked. But last year about $750 million was earmarked, more than 600 earmarks, nearly all of them air-dropped in at the last moment. So we have a habit around here of discovering a pot of money that can be earmarked for our own political purposes. 
   I know that the overwhelming majority of rank-and-file Members in this body don't want this to happen because it's typically those Members in a leadership position or a committee Chair position or some Member of seniority that typically benefits more than other Members. But I was denied that ability to bring that amendment to the floor today, and I would submit that the more we allow bills like this to come to the floor without amendments being offered like this, the more we're going to suffer.

   Mr. Speaker, as we allow authorization bills to come to the floor and we don't have a prohibition about the money being appropriated later from being earmarked, we are going to see them earmarked. That has been the trend around this place in recent years. That trend is not just continuing; it is accelerating, with the Homeland Security bill, as I mentioned. 
   So I would appeal to everyone to vote down this rule. Let's bring back a rule that allows a broader scope of amendments, ones that will actually preclude all of the grants authorized in this bill from being earmarked for political purposes. 
   And with that, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the committee for their indulgence here. I just wanted to make sure that Members who have earmarks that are being challenged here have the ability to come to the floor and are able to defend them. 
   This amendment, Mr. Chairman, would strike $300,000 from funding for the Belmont Complex in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania. 
   The Belmont Complex is a local recreational center. It offers an Olympic-size swimming pool with a 150-foot water slide and an indoor skating rink and arena. The center has an adult hockey team and also offers indoor soccer. 
   To generate money, the center sells advertising space on the ice. A dashboard ad costs about $800. The center also charges $5 a day for admission to the pool. Individual pool memberships for the summer season are also available, and they can run up to $77. 
   But, apparently, despite all the available revenue streams, the Federal taxpayers are being asked to pay $300,000 for this recreational center to rebuild or renovate the center. 
   The bad news is I don't think any of us are given a free pass. We aren't given a season pass. That is something that is just for the locals. I think the entire project should be for the locals. 
   Reading through this, it struck me that virtually every Member here in this body has probably a dozen or so of these recreational centers in their district that we could, with the same justification here, come to the Congress and say we need a Federal taxpayer subsidy for this. We are not charging enough for people to come in, where our local funds are low, so we are going to give the Federal taxpayer the chance to pay for it. 
   We simply can't do that, obviously. We can't fund all the recreational centers across the country. So why do we choose this one? Why do we pick winners and losers here? Is it just because there is a particularly powerful Member who is behind it who can say, hey, I am going to get funds for my district for this recreational center? What happens to all the other ones? What do you tell the recreational center down the street just across the district line? You're out of luck? You have to charge more for your season passes? 
   It just doesn't seem fair to me. This isn't the road we should go down. And if we have turned over a new leaf, and we are doing something different in terms of earmarks, then let's do something different instead of the same old same old. 
   We are told that we are going to have a process that vets these a little better. There are, I believe, about 1,500 earmarks in this bill. We just got word of what they were just a couple of days ago. And so it just doesn't seem that the process is changing all that much. It looks too much now like it did when Republicans were in charge. 
   So I think that we ought to change it, and that is why I am offering this amendment.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, let me just say if you can justify this earmark for a recreational center to help them basically defray cost of memberships or to rebuild or renovate, you could do that for any recreational center in the country. There is nothing that I can see, and I wish the sponsor of the amendment would have come to the floor to actually defend it or shed some light on what makes this special, why there is a Federal nexus here that doesn't exist with other recreational centers across the country. I wish we  could have had that debate or not. So we have to assume that this is no different than any recreational center anywhere in the country. So if you can justify this one, you can justify any of them. And we simply can't afford that, and we shouldn't continue just to say, well, we have cut the number of earmarks or dollar value in half. I mean, we are trying to get back to fiscal sobriety here after a binge that took place for years, and I admitted that that binge was my party. But if we are trying to get back to sobriety, it doesn't count to say, all right, we are only going to drink half as much this year as we did before. That's just not acceptable. 
   This process is out of control. It remains out of control. And this earmark is a great example of that. If we can approve earmarks for this kind of thing, anything goes. Katy bar the door.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, let me just respond. 
   The truth is we went from about, as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee often points out, from zero earmarks in Labor-HHS to some 1,400 last week. Much of that was under my party. 
   I think Democrats are as much to blame probably as Republicans are. The difference is as Republicans, we pretend to stand for limited government. We should be saying this isn't what we should be doing. If the agencies are out of control, we need to rein them in through the oversight process rather than to try to compete with them in terms of wasteful spending.

   Mr. FLAKE. Let me just say, in response to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, this isn't the best process. I appreciate having a couple of days and being able to come to the floor. The problem is, under what was proposed by the chairman, we would have had more time, yes, but we wouldn't have had the ability to challenge individual earmarks. So that was a trade-off that we were unwilling to make. And I still maintain that we made the best decision here. But I think it would be nice to have more than a couple of days to actually look at these, but I appreciate that the Appropriations Committee is doing so. 
   This amendment would prohibit $250,000 in Federal funds from going to the Walter Clore Wine and Culinary Center in Prosser, Washington, and reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount. 
   I'm sure people like to be wined and dined, but I think this earmark goes a little too far. I think that this is another example of, if we can justify economic development here, then we can justify just about anything. 
   We often complain that the Federal Government, the agencies spend willy-nilly, they're wasting money here, they're wasting money there. They are, certainly. One amendment that I wanted to bring today but got it too late would be one to simply cut the account that provides economic development earmarks because I think the Federal agencies do waste money in this regard. But instead of reining that account in and saying you shouldn't be doing that, we're kind of competing with them and saying we're going to do our own economic development earmarks. I just fail to see a Federal nexus that exists here that wouldn't exist with other organizations. 
   You can justify anything in terms of economic development. The act of spending money by itself inherently means there is economic development. But where do we choose? Do we just choose this one or that one? It just doesn't seem to be a very good process, particularly without a real Federal nexus here. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, Washington wine industry revenues are estimated at about $3 billion a year. The industry employs, I believe, about 11,000 people. Over 2 million people visit Washington wineries every year. That's just the point I was making. This is an industry that does pretty well. And I just wonder why the Federal taxpayer has to be involved here. 
   Public/private partnerships, there is nothing bad about that on its face; but not every public/private partnership is justified, particularly when that partner is the Federal Government. I just still fail to see a nexus. 
   And, again, we should actually be providing more oversight of the Federal agencies that expend these economic development grants because a lot of it is wasted. I'm sure a lot of it is wasted in my own district. But we shouldn't be trying to compete with that account by earmarking our own funds. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, as mentioned, this amendment would strike $400,000 in the bill from the North Central Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission.  
   According to the certification letter submitted by the sponsor, the commission will receive Federal funding to establish the Technology Revolving Loan Fund. 
   According to the Web site, the commission is a public agency dedicated to providing professional services to local governments. These services include economic development, geographic information systems, intergovernmental cooperation, land use planning, and transportation. The commission's funding comes from Federal grants and State and local money. 
   This earmark brings up a lot of questions. First and foremost, why is this fund being created in one particular part of Wisconsin? I'm sure every Member of Congress would love to establish a revolving loan fund to help their local businesses. If it is deserving of Federal aid, why aren't others? Again, why do we pick and choose here? 
   Can the sponsor of this earmark assure us that once this is done, that once these monies are loaned out, that more monies won't be sought? Is this an earmark that will beget more earmarks? It seems that these are questions that should be answered. It's a dangerous slippery slope, I think, if we use Federal taxpayer dollars for parochial revolving loan funds. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Why are we helping to set up a local revolving loan fund for local businesses? What is to stop every Member of Congress from wanting that in their own district? Isn't this a slippery slope if we just allow taxpayer money to be used in this fashion? If you can use it for economic development, if that is the criterion, any spending is justified.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Chair. 
   Let me first respond. I had yielded back my time when the gentleman from Wisconsin talked about Arizona, the Central Arizona Project as an earmark. 
   Perhaps in the debate at the time it was called an earmark, but it doesn't fit the contemporary definition of earmark. There was no project over the history of this body probably that wasn't debated through authorization, appropriation, followed up by oversight, than a project like that. I would have no complaint if some of the projects that we are challenging here today went through that process of authorization, appropriation and oversight, but that isn't what this is about. 
   The contemporary practice of earmarking that we have fallen into, under Republicans and Democrats, has been to circumvent the careful process of authorization, appropriation and oversight. So that is the complaint here. So bringing up the Central Arizona Project whenever an amendment is offered to take funding away from an economic development in a local community is a specious argument, I would add. 
   This amendment would prohibit $50,000 in Federal funds from being used by the National Forest Recreation Association for the National Mule and Packer Museum and would reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount. 
   According to the earmark description and certification letter submitted to the Appropriations Committee, the funding would be used for the construction of a museum to memorialize and help to preserve the role of mule teams and mule packers in opening and developing the West.     
   The funding, however, will go to the National Forest Recreation Association. Obviously, you cannot build much for $50,000. I assume there is a partnership with local entities. 
   There is much that we don't know about this. Does the location exist? Will it be owned by the National Forest Recreation Association? Are there corporate sponsors? How much is the total cost of the museum? Will the Federal taxpayer be asked to pay more later on? 
   It seems there is a 20-mule team museum in Boren, California. This is at least the second mule and packer museum we know of. Does that one receive Federal funding? 
   I would simply say it is time for the American taxpayer to say ``whoa'' and  stand up for fiscal sanity and actually stop the practice of earmarking like we are doing. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I am glad the gentleman brought up Ronald Reagan. I think it was Reagan, when he was presented with the highway bill back in 1987, that had, I believe, around 150 earmarks as opposed to the highway bill we did later, in 2005, with 6,300. He said at that time, ``I haven't seen this much lard since I gave away ribbons at the county fair.'' So Ronald Reagan certainly recognized that Congress, at least at that stage, before we even got into the contemporary practice of earmarking, was out of control. 
   I would also like to make the point, and I am glad that the gentleman mentioned, there is no such thing as Federal money. It is money given by the taxpayer to the Federal Government. Some of it funds the core functions of government. Some of it is spent on things that I don't think are the core function of government, and I don't think most taxpayers around the country do either, when you say this money is being returned, but it is not. As long as we are running a deficit, which is now 2, $300 billion, then the money is borrowed to pay for projects like this. 
   I simply don't think that we are giving the taxpayer a fair shake. I think we should stubbornly refuse to fund this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, the amendment would prevent $200,000 from being used to fund the Huntsville Museum of Art in Huntsville, Alabama, and would reduce the cost of the bill by a corresponding amount. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are, I think, 480 earmarks funded in the Economic Development Initiative account, at least 11 proposed to fund museums. There stands about a million dollars total for museums. This doesn't take into account projects described as cultural centers and other various exhibits. 
   The spending initiatives do not illustrate any sort of restraint on our part on the Federal level. In the past, we have funded Faulkner museums, teapot museums. This year we are funding museums about mules and hunting and fishing museums. The Huntsville Museum of Art was named as one of the State of Alabama's top destinations by the Alabama Bureau of Tourism and Travel. They bring as many as 23,000 visitors for a single exhibit.     
   Mr. Chairman, all of us have museums in our districts. All of those museums, I'm sure, if given the opportunity, would take Federal money to defray some of their costs. We simply can't fund all of them. 
   I don't know why we have the account in the agency. Like I said, we should go after that one, but here we have to show some restraint. And every once in a while, I think the taxpayer would appreciate if we actually stopped funding for some of these earmarks. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

At some point it would be nice to give the taxpayers a gift and actually say we're not going to fund a particular earmark. We did it a couple of weeks ago. 
   This is not an idle process. We've had one occasion already where I've come to offer an earmark, and the sponsor of the earmark beat me to the floor and offered an amendment to revoke his own earmark. So obviously there needed to be more vetting of that earmark. I would assume that there are others like it.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, just once I would love to hear the other side say, we have no objection to that amendment and will accept it, but I suppose I won't be so lucky today. 
   This amendment would prevent $100,000 in funding for the Hunting and Fishing Museum in Pennsylvania and reduce the cost of the bill by a corresponding amount. 
   Mr. Chairman, my staff and I have never had a hard time fishing for earmarks that seem to be fiscally irresponsible, but this one seemed to be a particularly easy catch. It seems that there is no museum that we will not fund. We have funded teapot museums. We've funded mule museums. We have funded rock and roll halls of fame. Now, we're being asked to fund a museum honoring the time-honored hobbies of hunting and fishing. 
   According to the earmark description, the earmark would fund the development and creation of interactive, educational and historical exhibits. According to the Web site for the Hunting and Fishing Museum, the museum came as a result of its location in a forest area of Pennsylvania where hunting and fishing are already big industries. 
   I enjoy fishing and hunting as much as the next person, but I'm not convinced that the Federal Government has a role here. I'd like to have explained what the Federal nexus is. 
   According to the National Association for Sporting Goods, the hunting industry did $2.8 billion in business sales in 2004. For fiscal year 2003, the fishing industry's retail sales totaled over $40 billion. With these kind of profits, why are these industries relying on the Federal Government to fund a museum honoring their pastimes? Are we not picking winners and losers when we select only a handful of museums to fund? Is this a fair and equitable process? 
   More than that, more than being equitable, some say if everybody is given the chance and there's an account to do this, that it's okay, that it's justified, everybody's getting theirs, let me get mine. But I think, particularly for us on this side of the aisle who say that we believe in limited government, economic freedom, individual responsibility, it seems a particularly hard sell. 
   I'm not making fun of the hobbies of hunting and fishing. As I mentioned, I do a fair amount of both myself. But here I just fail to see a Federal nexus and a Federal role. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, nobody is suggesting that it is a crime to support this kind of earmark, nor would it be a crime to actually deny funding for it. That's what the process is about. 
   My complaint, and nobody has suggested either, that there's this pure process at the Federal agency level. It's dysfunctional. We haven't provided the type of oversight that we need to. 
   The fact that there is an account over there to actually fund economic development projects suggests to me that it's out of control, that that's what we are about, what we should be about. We control the Federal purse strings. It should be in our interest actually to rein in spending over there rather than trying to compete with it and say if they do effect spending on this project or that, whomever has the district, that we shouldn't compete with that here and say, well, we can do one, one-up them with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. If they had funded another hall of fame, we should say, is it the Federal Government's role to fund these? That's what I am questioning here. 
   If we can fund teapot museums and mule museums and hunting and fishing museums, what is off limits? What would come here that we could say we are not going to fund that? We could fund a mule museum. How about a donkey museum. Is that out of line? Where do we say enough is enough, and where do we say let's give the taxpayer a break?

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would take $300,000 from the Friends of the Cheat Rails-to-Trails program. The Cheat Trail is one small part of the 13,600 miles of trails built by the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. The program's mission is to create a nationwide network of trails for former rail lines. 
   The program is a nationwide effort, yet this earmark is aimed directly at one trail in West Virginia. This is not the first time Friends of Cheat have bypassed the Rails-to-Trails program for funding. The House approved a $300,000 earmark for the Cheat trail just last year. If the trail is in such need of funding, isn't it coming from the funding and the many grants allocated in the Rails-to-Trails program? 
   This is another problem I have with the contemporary practice of earmarking. If we set up processes at the Federal agency level, and we set up accounts, often when people apply to that account, and apply for a grant and don't get it, then we in Congress will go and give them that project anyway through an earmark. 
   So if we are telling the Federal agencies, here is a process that you should go through that is merit based, that is competition based, and then fund those who don't get a contract, what are we saying? If we have a problem with a Federal agency's process or program, then we should amend them. 
   We should change them. We should call the agency heads before us and say explain why are you doing this, why are you giving money to this organization and not that one, but not to circumvent the process and basically add to it. 
   The Rails-to-Trails program has over 100,000 members, receives Federal, State and private funding. It was created over 20 years ago. I think that if this organization was to apply to the program, they are quite capable of finding funding. There is funding there. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, let me just close. Let me say, again, I fail to see the relevance of the number of defense contractors that Arizona has or the amount of Federal money that goes there by contract, by competitive bid or otherwise. How is that relevant to this process? 
   The truth is, there is something wrong with the process when we have thousands and thousands and thousands of earmarks, when we have 1,500 and just a couple of days to review them before we come here to the floor. There is something wrong with that process. 
   As I have said before, we can try all we want to conjure up some justification for the contemporary practice of earmarking. But if we think the taxpayers across the country are buying it, we are drinking our own bath water. 
   We are believing our own press releases if we think that's the case, because they're not. They're not believing it, and they shouldn't. There is no noble pedigree to this kind of earmarking. There really isn't. 
   So to appropriate money in this fashion is simply not becoming of this Congress. We are better than that. We should have more respect for the institution than that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Chairman. 
   This amendment would prohibit $300,000 in Federal funds from being used by the Houston Zoo in Houston, Texas, for an educational broadcast program and would reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount. 
   According to the earmark description in this certification letter, this funding would be used to develop an educational broadcast program to provide interactive distance learning, first to the neighboring institutions at the Texas Medical Center, and ultimately expanding the program to regional school districts. 
   According to the sponsor's letter, this program would enable children and students to ask questions of and converse with zoo experts in real time, replicating an in-classroom dynamic, but in an exciting and unique manner. 
   I should say the Houston Zoo is the permanent home of 4,500 animals; the zoo attracts more than 1.5 million visitors a year; general admission is $10 for an adult, $5 for a child. In fact, according to the City Navigator, annual revenue for the Houston Zoo in 2006 totaled $39 billion. In 2006 alone, the Houston Zoo had over $43 million in net assets and nearly $20 million in excess revenue. It has a membership base of over 28,000 households. Corporate sponsors include Continental Airlines, Shell Oil, JPMorgan, BMC Software, Conoco-Phillips, FedEx. The list goes on and on. 
   Again, here, if we are going to start to fund programs at zoos like this, where does it end? Virtually every Member has a zoo or some type of wildlife preserve in their district. Where do we say enough is enough?

   Mr. FLAKE. Here again, let me simply say there are a lot of zoos around the country, a lot of zoos that every one of which would like to receive Federal funding. Where do we say enough is enough? Where do we say this zoo is worthy, they have two tigers; this one only has one lion? The tigers get it? I mean, where do we have some kind of equitable process rather than Members just being able to designate funding of this type? We simply cannot continue to go on in this fashion. 
   Again, somebody will probably point out Arizona has a lot of defense contractors and gets a lot of Federal money. Again, I fail to see the relevance of that argument here. Let's throw the taxpayers a bone here, if you will, and let's finally say we are going to stop funding for one of these earmarks and actually return to fiscal sanity. We are running between a $200 billion and $300 billion deficit this year. Remember, money comes into Washington, we don't have enough to fund the programs, and so we are borrowing money to actually pay for programs like this. We can't continue to do that. I urge support for the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (THE ACRE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, Congress recently approved the farm bill and it's now on its way to a Presidential veto. Any farm bill that increases the size and scope of government, lacks real reform, continues to provide for wasteful agricultural subsidies, and even allows millionaires to continue to receive these subsidies, deserves the veto that it's going to get. It also uses a lot of budget gimmicks to get under the level that would allow it to pass in the first place. So I am glad that the President has decided to veto the bill. We should sustain it. 
   There's another big reason to sustain a Presidential veto of the farm bill. It's recently come to light, and we only know this because we got the final draft of the bill I believe on the day or just the day before that we voted on it so very few of us were able to actually look through it and to see what was in it. One of the programs in it is called the Average Crop Revenue Election, or ACRE program. This will allow farmers starting in 2009 the option of taking a 20 percent reduction in direct payments and other farm supports in return for a Federal guarantee on their revenue. 
   Now as we talked about during the debate on the farm bill, farmers can receive direct payments that don't relate to the price of commodities at all. They simply receive payments based on acreage that they had way back when. These payments total about $5 billion a year. They should be done away with completely. But they are now seen as an entitlement. We tried and failed to remove those direct payments from the bill. Those are received, as I mentioned, by millionaires. In fact, a couple, a farm couple, husband and wife in farm and nonfarm income, can make as much as $2.5 million and still receive direct payments in this legislation. 
   If that wasn't enough, this new ACRE program will allow farmers to actually claim subsidies at a level far higher than they used to under the old bill. Under the farm bill, 2002, which was bloated in itself, once crops dropped below a certain price, then some subsidies would kick in. But apparently those prices were too low for this new bill. And so under this new program, at a far higher threshold, new subsidies will kick in. 
   The Department of Agriculture estimates that if the price of corn drops, for example, to $3.25 per bushel, the program, this new ACRE program that is new to this bill would dole out nearly $10 billion just to corn farmers. If the price of wheat drops to $4.50 a bushel, wheat farmers would be eligible for $2.5 million in assistance. Again, this is assistance above and beyond what we have done in the past, or what the bill calls for, anyway. 
   This is new money that taxpayers are exposed to. This is a lot of exposure. It's indecent exposure for the taxpayers. If soybeans, for example, drop to about $7 per bushel, that is another $7 billion in assistance that will be going out to farmers. Now CBO's estimate of this program showed a net savings, but that was largely due to being forced to use outdated projections associated with the 2007 baseline. 
   The bottom line is we have skyrocketing corn, wheat, soybean prices. When we base a new subsidy program off these high level prices, then we are going to kick in a lot more readily than we would have otherwise, and we are going to be paying out a lot more. The taxpayers will be on the hook for a lot more. 
   These estimates, I think had they been available, had more people been aware of this new subsidy program, I think we would have had a lot more votes against the farm bill. It provides Members with a good reason, even if they voted for the farm bill last week, to sustain the President's veto and say let's go back to the drawing board. We simply cannot, cannot expose the taxpayers to this much subsidy. 
   Way back when, part of what is driving corn prices so high, for example, are the ethanol subsidies that we are providing. We have been told for decades these were just to prime the pump. Once we get it started, get this program started, we won't need to subsidize ethanol any more. Yet, here again the bill we passed last week subsidizes ethanol heavily. It also imposes tariffs on imported ethanol. 
   Now I believe that some people are worried that those ethanol subsidies,  because we are learning how much they're increasing the cost of food and how much degradation of the environment is actually being caused by ethanol, that those ethanol subsidies might be going away. This is a way to guarantee money still being paid, regardless of ethanol subsidies, because the cry will be, Well, if we get rid of ethanol subsidies, the price of corn will drop and the taxpayers will be paying anyway if the price drops under this new subsidy program. So this is a way to simply ensure that we are paying subsidies, regardless. We shouldn't be doing so. 
   We know that the farm bill, the old farm bill that we just replaced, the new farm bill, it pays out unnecessary subsidies, it distorts the free market, it forces farmers to plant where they shouldn't plant and not plant where they should, and it also distorts our international trade obligations and makes it less likely that we can open new markets. 
   I would urge us, Madam Speaker, to sustain the President's veto of this farm bill.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, as we commemorate the seventh anniversary of 9/11; we should know that there is a humanitarian disaster unfolding in the Caribbean, in particular, in the country of Cuba hit twice now, one by Gustav and then by Ike. The island is in dire straits, and the people there need our help. The problem is, currently the restrictions on travel and sending gift parcels are so extreme that Americans and family members of people in Cuba cannot help them. 
   I will be introducing legislation today to lift temporarily the restriction on gift parcels. Currently, gift parcels sent by family members to other family members in Cuba cannot even contain clothing, hygiene kits, or medical supplies, and that is simply wrong. We shouldn't have that restriction. It should be lifted, if not completely, at least temporarily. 
   Also, certain humanitarian licenses can be obtained now, but it takes a long time generally for that to happen. I would call on the Bush administration to expedite licensing of humanitarian groups, churches, and others who want to help the good people of Cuba.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND RESTORATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We didn't have to be here today. We could have acted more responsibly in 2005, when we reauthorized the highway bill. At that time, I heard a number of people, appropriators and others, stand up and say: We are authorizing more than we will have money for. We knew it at the time. Anybody who really looked at this knew that we were authorizing more than the highway trust fund contained for projects. 
   To make matters worse, and part of the reason we had far more than we could fund is we had over 6,300 earmarks in the highway bill. That is why this thing was so big. That accounted for about $24 billion of the highway bill. 
   Now, some of those projects, I grant you, would have been funded anyway in the highway bill. There were projects that a Member wanted that would have been funded out of that State's formula anyway. But there are a lot of projects that would not. 
   We all know about the infamous Bridge to Nowhere. That was part of this bill. But some of the lesser known things that are in this bill that have far too little to do with transportation, I would submit: 
   $16 million for the Bremerton Pedestrian Transportation Center in Washington State; $3 million for a parking garage in suburban Chicago; $3.5 million for pedestrian walkways and streetscaping in the village of Western Springs, Illinois; $3.5 million to improve the Pennsylvania Executive Mansion exhibit; $1.5 for the American Tobacco Trail in North Carolina; $800,000 for a transportation and heritage museum in Tennessee; $4 million for bike trails and park space in California; $1 million for the Please Touch Me Museum in Philadelphia; $1 million for the Blue Ridge Mountain Center in Virginia. 
   These are earmarks that are funded in this bill, part of the reason we are having to steal money from the general fund and fund back the highway trust fund, because we just went hog wild back in 2005. 
   Just a few examples of some others: 
   $2.75 million for renovations to the National Packard Museum in Ohio; $2.4 for the National Infantry Museum. Might be a good museum; probably shouldn't be funded out of the highway trust fund. 
   Yet, instead of going in and saying we are going to rescind these earmarks if they haven't been funded yet, some have, some haven't, we are saying we are going to take from the general fund. When you start doing that, you set a horrible precedent in this place, because we know the amount of logrolling that goes on in a highway bill. And if you don't have the natural ceiling that exists with the highway trust fund, where you say we can spend that much and no more; if you can say, well, when we run out, we will just go out and take from the general fund, then ``Katie bar the door,'' this place is going to be out of money sooner than you think. Because when you have this amount of money and you pass around the projects and you have so much buy-in, then very few will vote against that bill because their own projects are in it, and soon we are taking more and more money from the general fund. 
   We cannot start that process with this bill, and that is what this bill is doing. That is what this amendment is doing today. We have got to act more fiscally responsible. 
   Let me just go through a few more. 
   $1.2 million for the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. Now, might be a good museum, probably shouldn't be funded with your highway dollars. $500,000 for the Railroad Museum in Georgia; $200,000 for the Brooklyn Children's Museum. 
   If you are catching a theme here, there are a lot of museums funded in this bill, again, money that is coming out of the highway trust fund that we overburdened the highway trust fund with that we now have to get money from the general fund for. 
   One of the previous speakers said that there is a national consensus or that the Nation is united on this topic that we need to take from the general fund. I would say, where the Nation is united is that we have got to stop this earmarking process. And if we get to it next week, hopefully we will, the appropriation bill for the Department of Defense, you will see more of it, because that bill contains 1,200 earmarks. The bill that has been marked up in  the subcommittee of appropriations for defense, 1,200 earmarks. 
   I took a look at it just to see. It is very difficult to see where the money is and where it is going, but one thing we could see is what we see in every bill that contains a lot of earmarks: A disproportionate number of the earmarks are going to those who chair committees, those in leadership positions, or those who are on the Appropriations Committee. 
   In fact, 1,200 earmarks, as I mentioned. Of these 1,200, more than 560 are associated with appropriators and members of leadership. That is a staggering 45 percent of the earmarks included in the committee print. That is not uncommon; that is what called the spoil system, and that is why it is unlikely that we will be able to stop this amendment today. 
   Please, let's be fiscally responsible.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (OPENNESS IN THIS INSTITUTION -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, one of the hallmarks of this institution is openness. Every minute of debate in this Chamber is captured on C-SPAN cameras. Every minute of debate and dialogue in the committee rooms are transcribed and recorded. This practice is premised on the principle that the public has a right to know what factors go into our decisions here. 
   I don't think the public would be very pleased to learn how much of this decisionmaking process is moving behind closed doors, particularly as it relates to earmarks. 
   Over the past several years it became common practice for appropriators to include earmarks in committee and conference reports, rather than the text of the bills. Frequently, a committee report containing thousands of earmarks would come to the floor only hours before the final vote on the bill. At times the committee report would be made public only after the bill had already passed. 
   The bottom line is that, over several years, earmarks endured very little scrutiny from this body. I think the voters have become very aware of this failing on our part. My party, the Republican Party, allowed the practice of earmarking to get out of hand. Taxpayers have paid the price. This institution has paid the price. Finally, we  Republicans paid the price at the polls this November. 
   When the new majority took over in January of this year, they moved to include more transparency in the earmarking process. Members of Congress would, at long last, have to put their names next to the earmarks. We Republicans had done this in the fall, but only after the appropriations season was nearly done. This was a good move by the majority party in January. As I said at the time, they had the guts to do what we hadn't when it mattered, at the beginning of the appropriation process. 
   There is reason now, however, to doubt the sincerity of these moves. House rules are only as good as our willingness to enforce them. And we have, as yet, not been willing to enforce these rules. 
   When a bill comes to the floor now, there must be a list of earmarks with Member names next to them, or a certification that the bill contains no earmarks. 
   When the supplemental came to the floor, there were clearly earmarks in the bill, yet there was a certification that there were no earmarks contained in the bill. 
   The problem is, a point of order can only lie against the bill if there is no certification. So a certification, even though it might be patently wrong, has to be accepted by the Speaker or the Parliamentarians. 
   The intelligence authorization bill came to the floor without a list of earmarks. The list of earmarks only came after the deadline to submit amendments to the Rules Committee; so then, again, there was no opportunity to challenge any of the earmarks in the bill. Then, despite the fact that there were more than 680 earmarks in the defense authorization bill, no amendments related to earmarks were allowed by the Rules Committee, even though some of the earmarks clearly had no relationship to defense. 
   Now, we hear that the Appropriations Committee plans to keep earmarks secret until the appropriation bills this year have passed the House floor. Those earmarks would later be ``air-dropped'' into the conference report where no amendments are possible, where no scrutiny of these amendment or, I'm sorry, of these earmarks is possible. 
   The vaunted sunlight that we said we were going to bring into this process is gone. We closed the drapes. We've snuffed out the candle. 
   Mr. Speaker, this institution deserves better than this. We can do better. We should, on a bipartisan basis, bring this sunlight back. We need to subject earmarks to the scrutiny that they should have. No spending should occur in this body without the Members' knowledge, and that's what happens when earmarks are ``air-dropped'' into a conference report. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm convinced that in the end, the majority party will pay the political price. I hope that we would move before that time. I hope that we can, on a bipartisan basis, simply move forward and bring sunlight back into the process. That is what I think the citizens of this country deserve. It's what the taxpayers need to have

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I have great respect for the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I heard what he said about the position he's in. I don't envy being in that position, to try to wade through 30,000-some earmark requests. As he mentioned, there are some within that  number that will embarrass this institution and embarrass the Members, I have no doubt of that; and I think that's part of the reason that those have not been made public. I think that is the reason that they are kept with the committee. 
   But we are in a situation now where this well has been poisoned. If we go ahead and go through with the proposal that we simply in August list the earmarks that are being put into the bill, that are going to be airdropped into the bill later, without the ability to challenge them individually, there will surely be accusations, founded or unfounded, that people are being targeted for their opposition to earmarks, to speaking out on the floor, for speaking about them, against them or for them, or people will be favored or not. That's the nature of the game. That's the nature of the political process. 
   So I think it will be virtually impossible to go through that kind of atmosphere without the process being tainted even further. 
   I believe the chairman when he says that he hates earmarks. I think if it were up to him, he would get rid of them, and I would certainly support him. I don't think that the Democratic Caucus would allow that to happen because I fear that they believe, as we did as Republicans, that that's the surest path to reelection, that you protect vulnerable Members by giving them earmarks, that you spread it around in ways that you can curry favor with your constituents and your voters.     
   I think that is a road that leads directly back to the minority, but I wouldn't propose to give advice in that regard. I think that's part of the reason we are where we are today. 
   But all I know is that, when we have a situation, there is no perfect solution, certainly. We are in a fix now. But a situation where you have a choice of actually putting earmarks in bills with information about who has requested that earmark, what entity that earmark goes to, or balance that against a process where you simply can write a letter to the committee and ask about specific earmarks, I think that we as Members should demand the latter. 
   I, for one, am not willing to trade in this voting card. This is a card that we all get when we are elected that we use multiple times a day on this House floor. It allows us to register our support or opposition for specific legislation. 
   I am not willing to give this up for the ability to write a letter to the chairman of the committee or anyone else in Congress. That's a bad trade. I don't think that's a trade that anybody should be happy with. 
   I am intrigued by the chairman's proposal to offer an amendment on each appropriation bill to strike earmarks. 
   I would be most pleased if the gentleman would be glad to yield time if he would explain that amendment there is to offer. I will support it. I will gladly support it. So I would love to learn more about it. Perhaps we can jointly sponsor it. 
   But until then, until then, I think the country deserves to know what's in the bills when we vote on them. We aren't well served with the process, however intended, a process that keeps earmarks secret until a time that it is too late to actually challenge that earmark on the House floor. 
   So I think that this is a fight that is worth fighting, and I am glad that my colleagues have taken it up. 
   I support the amendment.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, Democrats wisely seized on earmark reform as an issue during last year's elections. I believe that their promises of reform, coupled with the Republican Party's inability to control earmarks, directly contributed to the Democrats' success in last year's elections. However, the majority party does not appear to be following through with the substantive reforms that were promised. 
   Take the Labor-HHS bill that will soon be considered in conference. It contains more than 1,300 House earmarks, more than 1,000 Senate earmarks. It goes without saying that few of these earmarks have received even a cursory screening, let alone a thorough vetting. We need to remember that we are only halfway through the process and it is in the conference that much of the earmark mischief occurs. Public confidence in our ability as stewards of their taxpayer dollars will further erode. 
   Madam Speaker, while watching the Democrats make the same political miscalculations as we did in the majority may delight us as Republicans, it has to be sorely disappointing to taxpayers. I urge all Members, Republicans and Democrats, to support legislation to impose an earmark moratorium until we can scrutinize all earmarks.

   The premise of this unprecedented government intervention is that the free market has failed and that government must come to its rescue. 
   In reality, the crisis we now face is a result of government intervention in the market. We are in this predicament largely because implicit, and eventually explicit, Federal guarantees in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shielded the financial services sector from market discipline. 
   Madam Speaker, those who believe that they can control and direct the market's invisible hand will eventually be slapped by it. That is the painful and embarrassing situation we find ourselves in today. We don't have enough money in the Federal Treasury, nor can we responsibly borrow enough money, to keep the market from finding its natural bottom. 
   Now is the time to act on the free market principles we profess to believe in. Let's vote down this bill and instead pass legislation that is consistent with those principles.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   The chairman of the Appropriations Committee mentioned that this debate is really not about the bills that we are debating this week, and in a sense, he is right. Unfortunately, that is the case. Particularly later this week, we will be debating three other appropriation bills, some of which have headroom or a placeholder for tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars that we don't know what that spending is. It is put in place for earmarks to be added later. 
   So we really are not debating the real bills, and that is unfortunate. We should be. How can we as a legislative body decide whether this is appropriate spending or not when we don't know what is in the bill, when that will be added later? 
   I am well aware of the plan to have Members request and that these earmarks later on will be somehow made public. But that is the legislative equivalent of appointing an ombudsman. Why does a body like this need something like that? We are not potted plants. We should be able to see what is in the bills. These are earmarks that should be transparent. 
   The Appropriations Committee has before it right now some 30,000 earmark request forms that could be made public. Other Members could see them. We could see if these earmark requests are appropriate or not. But we are not allowed to see them. We won't be allowed to see them. We will only be allowed to see those few that the leadership decides that we can see, the ones that are approved later; and then once we do see them, we will have no ability whatsoever to have an up or down vote on the individual earmarks. None. 
   That is not a legislative body. That is saying that we can't handle it, so we are going to appoint an ombudsman, in this case maybe a couple of members of the Appropriations Committee, and hope that they will sufficiently scrub these earmarks. That is simply not acceptable. 
   To the other point, that we are simply defending what the President has done or what the administration has done, let me just take one program here that we are discussing today, and that is the State Homeland Security grant program. 
   This program is being plussed up by, I think, about $50 million, a significant plus-up. Yet the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I think very wisely, in the committee report indicated several areas where this grant program is being misused, where there are several frivolous programs going on. Let me just name a few of them. 
   A $3,000 grant was given under the State Homeland Security Grant Program to the city of Converse, Texas, for a trailer used to transport lawn mowers to lawn mower drag races. For a fire department in Wisconsin, $8,000 for clown and puppet shows. That is under the Assistance to Firefighters grant program. 
   Under the State Homeland Security grant program, $202,000 was spent on ``downtown'' security cameras for a rural fishing village in Dillingham, Alaska. Now, ``downtown,'' there is a population of 2,400. This is 300 miles from Anchorage. There are no roads linking that city to anywhere. So $202,000 for security cameras in a remote fishing village in Alaska. 
   Keep in mind, we are plussing up spending for State Homeland Security grants by $50 million. Why in the world are we doing that? 
   Just a few others. $3,500 for small crates and kennels to hold stray animals. This is in Modoc County, California. 
   There are some even in my own State and in my own district; I think we are spending $100,000 or so for synchronization of traffic lights in Apache Junction, Arizona, in my district. That money shouldn't come from the Federal Government. We are making local governments dependent on the Federal Government. 
   Why are we plussing up funding for the State Homeland Security grant program by $50 million in this bill with this kind of wasteful spending? 
   As I mentioned, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee wisely pointed out some of these abuses. I will offer amendments to strike some of that funding. I hope that we have the support of the majority here. 
   This is not frivolous time being spent here. We are spending far too much money. We can ill afford it. If we can't do it here, when will we do it? 
   As I pointed out, we are not discussing a lot of the funding that is in the bills. It is off limits. We don't know what it is. It will be added later. It is secret at this point, secret from us, the Members. 
   So I applaud my colleagues for bringing forth amendments, and I hope that we will have more time to debate it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise again in support of the amendment. Again, we're being  asked to approve a bill that increases spending over the President's request by more than $2 billion. 
   The majority party wisely, I believe, in the report accompanying this bill, explained that there are several misuses in spending; that there is money that is being misspent. How in the world can we, then, appropriate $2 billion more than was requested by the administration? 
   If we believe in fiscal discipline, we should act like it, and we simply can't afford to spend this much more money. 
   I would also, again, talk about the earmark process. It seems to me that if we have a transparent process, or we require Members to actually put their names next to earmarks and to indicate the entity that the earmark goes to, that that ought to mean something, that we should be able to do something with that information. 
   Last summer, during the appropriation process, I offered I believe it was 39 earmark amendments, and I got beat on every one of them. I was beat like a rented mule. I never got more than, I think, 90 votes, and most times under 50 for those that we called a roll call on. It was because of the process of log rolling. I'll vote against your earmark or amendment if you'll vote against the others. And so it goes. 
   But we never had the luxury of actually knowing whose earmark that was. Sometimes, when the earmark was questioned on the floor, the author of the earmark would come to the floor and defend it. Sometimes they wouldn't. Sometimes we'd have the debate. We'd have a vote, roll call vote even, and we still had no idea who requested that earmark or what entity it really went to, because the language was very vague in the bill or the committee report. 
   Now we actually have that information. We would have a different dynamic. If you came to the floor and said, I'm going to strike funding for this amendment, or, I'm sorry, for this earmark, because it goes to a project that is duplicative, it's wasteful, and besides, it goes to a project that maybe this Member is a little too close to, maybe that Member is getting campaign contributions that are linked to that earmark. Those are things that you can find out if you actually have the information. 
   That information now sits at the Appropriations Committee. More than 30,000 request letters sit there right now, and we have no access to them, nor will we. We'll only have access to those few who are approved by a very few Members. And then we have the luxury of actually writing a letter and asking about the project and having the Member supposedly respond. 
   But then to what effect? We can take no vote on it. It's all an academic exercise because we'll have one vote, up or down, on the bill and no ability to strip the earmark. So this process is simply wrong. 
   It's been said that the majority is backsliding on commitments made on earmarks. We've seen that, unfortunately. I was pleased to see the reforms that happened in January. I have said more than once I think there were more effective reforms, more comprehensive than we did as the majority party last year. 
   The problem is your rules are only as good as your willingness to enforce them or use them, and that's where we've fallen down. That's where we're not only backsliding, but I would submit we're actually cutting and running the other direction. And unfortunately, a process in which you have some transparency but no accountability is an unacceptable process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think at this time of night, it is good to remind those who might have been watching or listening why we are here. First, this bill is $2 billion over the President's request. So it is spending that we simply cannot justify moving forward with. 
   The second reason we are here debating and still on, I think, the first paragraph of the bill is that the majority has decided to keep earmarks secret until this bill passes and until we get to the conference report when it will be too late to amend or to strike or to challenge those individual earmarks. That is why we are here. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee has said that if this process does not go well, we may just have to get rid of earmarks completely. That would be wonderful. I would gladly sit down for the rest of the appropriations season if we were to do that. 
   But if we are not going to get rid of earmarks completely, at least we should have a process that even the majority party has said that we need, one that has transparency, one where we actually know what is in the bills, one that has both transparency and accountability. 
   If you have transparency, if you have Members' names next to earmarks and an indication what entity that earmark is to support, that is a good thing. That is an element of transparency, and it is a good thing that the Democrats put that in their reform bill in January. It was a good move, and I think all of us applaud them for it. 
   But what good is transparency if you don't have accountability with it? What good is it to know which name is next to an earmark if that request letter is just buried over at the Appropriations Committee? And none of us have seen them; there are some 30,000 earmark request letters sitting over in the Appropriations Committee. 
   The distinguished chairman said last year that we simply had gotten out of control with earmarks and there is no way, with the staff that we have, to police these earmarks. He was right. He was right. If you don't believe him, you can ask a couple of the Members who are in prison today. We simply haven't policed that process very well. 
   I would submit it is beyond reason that the Appropriations Committee and its staff can alone police 30,000-some earmark requests. It is simply impossible. So why not release those letters and let the other Members see them? Some 30,000, if you do the math, that amounts to 73 earmarks or so per Member. You can't expect the Appropriations Committee to police those earmarks. It is beyond them. 
   I think they make a valiant attempt, and that is great, but it is simply beyond reason that you can police that many earmarks. So release them. Let others see them. Let outside groups and others help in that regard instead of keeping those earmark requests secret, and keeping earmarks out of the bills until those bills pass and then drop them in at a time when it is too late to challenge them. 
   If you want transparency, that's great. Let's have it. Let's also have accountability. That is what we want with this process, and that is why we are here tonight. That is why we are only on the first paragraph of this very large bill. 
   I would suspect until we reach an agreement that either we will have no earmarks, which would be the best in my view, until we reach that kind of agreement; or we will proceed under a different fashion, we will say we are going to have real accountability, real transparency, 
   I think we are going to have this same kind of activity.     
   Because I think that this institution deserves better. Certainly the taxpayers deserve better than the process that they have been given over the past several years. 
   So I'm pleased that the gentlewoman has offered this amendment. I do support it. There will be many more amendments, I believe, tonight. I plan to offer others myself.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This has been an interesting discussion with regard to which system is better in order to challenge earmarks: one in which you can actually come to the floor and challenge specific earmarks in a bill, or in a committee report; or have a situation where the conference report comes to the floor and you have no ability whatsoever, no ability, to bring to a vote any of the earmarks that are in there. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee mentioned that it is better to be able to write a letter to the Appropriations Committee and question an earmark than actually bring it to the floor because he mentioned that Mr. Flake brought 14 amendments to the floor last year and failed on every one of them. 
   I actually brought 39, and I failed even more miserably; I failed all 39 times. Nineteen of them called for a rollcall vote. I didn't come close on any on them because as the distinguished Member mentioned, logrolling works pretty well. People will say, I won't vote against your earmark if you don't vote against mine. 
   But this year is different, partly thanks to the reforms that the Democrats put in place in January of this year following the lead of the Republicans in the fall of last year where you actually said, All right, if you want an earmark, you have to sign your name and claim credit for that earmark.  
   Of the 39 times I came to the floor last year, most times when I came to the floor I had no clue who had sponsored the earmark I was challenging. Many times we had a vote, sometimes a rollcall vote and sometimes a voice vote, and I still left the floor not knowing whose earmark that was because we didn't have a requirement that the Members claim credit for them. 
   That is no longer the case. The Appropriations Committee right now is sitting on more than 30,000 request letters where the Members signed off and said, This is my earmark and it is going to this specific entity. That is something we haven't had before, and I applaud the Democrats for putting that reform in place. The problem is, if we go forward with what has been proposed, it won't mean anything. 
   But here I can tell you, if I was able to come to the floor with some of those earmarks, knowing which entity it was going to, knowing which Member had requested it, and to have the media and others, the blogging community and other organizations going through and finding out what that private entity was or had that private entity made campaign contributions to that Member, if there was a tie that we didn't know about before, it changes the dynamics incredibly here because them Members have to weigh, Do I want to do that or not? 
   The Appropriations Committee chairman pointed out there have been problems with Members and earmarks. There have been investigations and Members in jail, and there are other investigations going on. 
   If you have good information, more information, that gives you power. When you come to the floor and are able to point specifically at earmarks, knowing which entity they are going to and knowing which Member requested them, it changes the dynamics. 
   I would respectfully disagree with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee when he says that this process that is being put in place is superior to being able to challenge earmarks. Again, let me repeat. Under what has been proposed, we will never have a vote on any earmark; and that is simply wrong.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the remarks of the gentleman from New York, and I do agree with him that it would be best, certainly, if the debate could center around the substance of the bill, the legislation. 
   That's why we're here tonight; the fact that we will have 12 appropriation bills coming up, and we can't focus on much of the substance of that legislation because it won't be included in that legislation. We'll have to wait. We'll have to write to the committee and ask for a request or request for a response back. 
   You know, a lot of us receive letters from Boy Scouts who are writing for their Citizenship in the Nation merit badge. I'm wondering if we'll qualify for the same thing by writing to the committee. 
   I think we're entitled to a little more than that as Members of Congress. I think we're entitled to actually debate this on the floor. 
   The other gentleman from New York who talked a bit earlier said that we're standing with the American people. I would suggest, you may want to go in and log on and see how this is being debated in the blogosphere or in the newspapers tomorrow. 
   Let me just read a bit of one editorial in tomorrow's Roll Call, for example, and see how they're playing it. Roll Call is not exactly a bastion of the right. 
   It mentions here, it says, ``So, on Monday, he,'' meaning the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, ``announced a new policy: Earmarks will be fully disclosed prior to the August recess after House voting, but before House-Senate conference, and may be challenged by writing a letter to the Appropriations Committee. After considering defenses from their sponsors, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee will decide whether to put earmarks into conference reports. There will still be no votes on the issue.'' 
   The chairman of the Appropriations Committee ``reiterated this system was necessitated by time constraints that made it impossible to vet 32,000 earmark requests before upcoming votes on appropriations bills. Asked if he would revert to a policy of full and early disclosure next year, he said that he wanted to but couldn't rule out the possibility that specific circumstances would arise.'' 
   This is what they say. ``This simply isn't good enough. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee should not only be disclosing all earmarks before House voting, but all earmarked requests. Earmarks should be open to public vetting, full debate and floor challenge.'' 
   I have the utmost respect for the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He calls himself a reformer, and I believe that. I've had the opportunity to debate him over the past several years on these earmarks, and I know that he is troubled by them, as well he should be. And I know that he struggles with a way to deal with them. 
   I simply believe, and I think people across the country feel that we're better served with real transparency. And real transparency is not keeping these earmarks secret until the point at which you have no ability to challenge them on the floor, when you can simply write a letter and ask for a response.     
   We are legislators; we are not potted plants here. We are here for a purpose. We are here to legislate. And to be relegated to just writing a letter and asking for a response is simply not sufficient. 
   So I simply would say, Mr. Chairman, if the majority party thinks that they are with people across the country, I would beg to differ and I would ask them to reconsider that and wonder if people across the country really want a process where earmarks are kept secret until people in this body whose job it is to legislate don't have an opportunity to legislate.

   One thing that I didn't have when I came before, I never had the ability to know whose earmark I was challenging. Many of those 39 times I came  to the floor, debated, even asked for a vote, and still had no clue, after the vote was called and it was lost, whose earmark that was. That wouldn't happen today, and I commend the Democrats for doing this, because of the rules put in place for disclosure. That is great. That is good transparency. But with that transparency, we have to have accountability.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I have an amendment that has been made in order which I plan to offer later. 
   When I came on the floor yesterday, I was approached by several Members who pointed out that my amendment was, perhaps, overly broad. I went back to the office and took a look, and I  happen to agree, it is. And it might confuse people. Because in my original amendment I said nothing in the action will relieve any sovereign entity within the jurisdiction of the United States, including the Native Hawaiian governing authority, from complying with the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the United States Constitution. 
   And so I would like to see if the proponents of the measure would agree to a unanimous consent request to narrow the amendment so that it would simply apply only to the Native Hawaiian governing authority, as opposed to the Native American or any sovereign entity within the United States. 
   I would yield to the gentleman from Hawaii.

   I'm not trying to play a game of ``gotcha'' here at all. I have the utmost respect, and that respect has grown over the years, for the gentleman from Hawaii.

But for those of us who have some concerns that this goes beyond land disposition or other smaller issues, this is not an idle concern that we have.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman, and I thank him for providing the text of ICRA yesterday. I did read through it and was convinced and compelled that my original amendment was overly broad, and that's why I sought to restrict it here. 
   Seeing that we cannot restrict it, I will withdraw the amendment. But I will offer the motion to recommit later. And the motion to recommit is pretty much similar to what the amendment would have been, further restricted. 
   I take the gentleman's concerns. We don't know what the implications will be with the amendment, but I would submit that we don't really know what the implications might be without the amendment. And what the motion to recommit will do will simply have three sections. It's just one page here. It will say that what will apply is the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights, the Federal civil rights laws, and that no racially defined burdens of immunities, so we will make sure that no persons shall, as a result of the operation of this act, be exempted from any Federal or State law, regulation tax or legal burden that is the basis of the law. 
   I would say that it is true, this needs to go to the Senate and then come back here. And if there are problems in that this is overly broad, the motion to recommit, then that, perhaps, can be fixed as the bill works its way through. But I think that, because we swear an oath to uphold the Constitution, that we should endeavor to make sure that what we pass does not run afoul of, in particular, the 14th amendment. 
   I understand the gentleman's concerns in talking about ICRA of 1968, but I think we can all agree here that the sovereign nature of Native American tribes in the United States is a little different than what we're talking about here. 
   So, I think it would behoove us to be careful here and to make sure that we aren't doing anything that might upset the applecart, that we need to make sure that we're not creating something here that might run afoul of the Constitution. I think that's our obligation.  
   So, that's what the motion to recommit will be. It will be ``forthwith,'' so this will not take any time. It won't have to come back to committee. And I will be glad to give copies across so people can be familiar with it before we're voting on it. 
   But, again, this is not a game of ``gotcha'' at all. I have great respect for those on the other side of the aisle who have worked hard on this legislation. 
   With that, I would yield to the gentleman from Hawaii.

   Mr. FLAKE. I appreciate the gentleman's concern about motions to recommit. They are sometimes by their nature political. I don't always vote for the ones offered by my side because of that. However, I am only going to the motion to recommit now because I can't offer my amendment as modified. I would be glad to forgo offering the motion to recommit if I could get a commitment under unanimous consent to restrict my amendment to what I outlined, and I will be glad to read it again. If it is true that the legislation does address this concern, it would be redundant at best, or at worst, but it would at least give us here, and I think, frankly, there is a pretty safe harbor I would think for those of us who are concerned about the constitutionality in saying that this legislation should have the Bill of Rights apply to it, Federal civil rights laws, and there would be no racially defined burdens or immunities. So that is a pretty safe harbor, and I am not seeing it as political. But I would be glad to withdraw that if we could go back and have my amendment accepted as modified.

   I think that we can work with this in the quiet if we simply accept the motion to recommit or preferably the actual amendment that simply says, and let me read it again, ``Nothing in the act shall relieve the Native Hawaiian governing authority from complying with the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the United States Constitution.'' That's a pretty safe harbor. And I think that if it goes to the Senate and we find there is something in there that needs to be modified or tweaked, we can do that as the bill comes back. But we ought to have at least that, I would submit. And so with the knowledge that we can't modify that, then we will offer the motion to recommit later.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, I originally had an amendment that I would have liked to have offered which would simply say that we would add the following: ``Nothing in this act shall relieve a Native Hawaiian governing authority from complying with the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the United States Constitution.'' 
   This motion to recommit is very similar to that. 
   As I mentioned before, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission has concerns about the legislation. They said, ``This would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege.'' 
   I think there is sufficient concern that we should find the safe harbor here of making sure that the 14th amendment applies. This motion to recommit, I will read the entire thing, it is not long. So I will read all of it.     
   It simply says: ``Page 44, after line 22, insert the following: Applicability of  the United States Constitution's Bill of Rights. The Native Hawaiian governing entity shall be subject to United States Constitution's Bill of Rights and other protections in the same manner and to the same extent as a State or local government of the United States. 
   ``Section (i). Applicability of Federal civil rights laws. Shall be subject to civil rights and antidiscrimination laws in the same manner and to the same extent as a State or local government of the United States. Section (j). No racially defined burdens or immunities. No person shall, as a result of the operation of this Act, be exempted from any Federal or State law, regulation, tax, or other legal burden on the basis of that person's race or ancestry or on the basis of any classification that is defined by race or ancestry.'' 
   This is a pretty good default, a default back to the Constitution, and says that nothing in this act has to be compatible, has to fit within the Constitution. That is all that this motion to recommit does. Some will raise the concern that this might apply to Native American groups here on the mainland. It does not. This only applies to this act, to the Native Hawaiian governing entity. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a very narrowly drafted motion to recommit. It is drafted ``forthwith'' so it will come immediately back so it won't spend any more time in committee. Then, if there are issues unforeseen, when it goes to the Senate and comes back, we can work on them. But in the meantime, I think it is a much better option to actually have this default and to go back to the U.S. Constitution. 
   The gentleman mentioned earlier that the act provides that the Secretary of the Interior has to certify that we are in compliance with the U.S. Constitution. I would just state for the record that we haven't had the best record relying on the Secretary of the Interior to manage trust accounts or other things. We shouldn't delegate that authority here. We shouldn't delegate our responsibility to uphold the Constitution to an official in the executive. That is our purpose here. We make the laws. We should ensure that they are given the guidelines and given the protections here that the Constitution affords. 
   So I would urge adoption of the motion to recommit. As I mentioned, I offered it reluctantly. I would have rather, because motions to recommit sometimes become political, and this is not, so I would have preferred to offer this as a straight amendment narrowed to this specific act, but wasn't afforded that opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also want to say again that I want to commend those on the other side of the aisle for working so hard on this legislation and for their diligence in working to make sure that this is a good bill. This will improve it. This will simply say that those under this act are afforded the guarantees and the protections of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I rise this morning just to shed a little light on the defense bill we may or may not be considering this year in the next week or so. There's a rumor going around that the defense bill might even be brought to the floor without going through a full Appropriations Committee markup. 
   Now that is troubling in itself, but what is more troubling is that there are some 1,200 earmarks in this defense appropriation bill that very few Members of this body have actually even seen. That list has been passed around to Appropriations Committee members. A few members of the press have seen it. Our office managed to see a copy of the report. But virtually nobody else has seen it. That is 1,200 earmarks. For all the talk about transparency and a new process and where these earmarks will be vetted, we see very little of that here. 
   I have been troubled for a long time at the number of earmarks that go through this body. A lot of people have been troubled. The whole country is troubled by the number of earmarks that go through this body without really even being seen and without anybody knowing what they are about. 
   It's not just the money that is spent. We all know that earmarks leverage higher spending everywhere else. Because once you get an earmark in an appropriation bill, then you're really obligated, almost obligated, to vote for that entire bill, no matter how bloated that bill becomes. So you see higher spending everywhere else. Also, earmarks are put in unrelated bills in order to garner votes for other bills. But let me just talk about the defense bill here just a minute. 
   Members of Congress, those who defend the secretive earmarks, often say that Members of Congress know their districts far better than these faceless bureaucrats in the administration, and that somehow, having Members of Congress sneak a secretive earmark into a conference report, is somehow better than having the administration decide where that money is spent. 
   Now I am not here to defend bureaucrats or to defend the spending of money, but I can tell you it's not a good process when Members of Congress can put an item in a bill and have so little scrutiny, and what tends to happen is those who are up on the food chain in Congress, those on the Appropriations Committee, those who are in leadership positions, committee chairs, tend to get a disproportionate number of earmarks. 
   So the argument that earmarks go to places because Members of Congress know their districts better than faceless bureaucrats really means that whoever has the power in this body gets the earmarks. 
   Let me demonstrate a little here. Of the 1,200 earmarks tucked into the full committee report of this bill, it's worth about $2.8 billion. Of these earmarks, more than 400 go directly to Members who sit on the Appropriations Committee. An additional 111 are associated with appropriators. These are earmarks that were requested by that appropriator, as well as a few other Members. 
   I would remind my colleagues that appropriators make up 15 percent of the Members in this body. Yet, in this bill, appropriators alone are taking 44 percent of the earmarks. Again, just 15 percent of the Members of the body, and 44 percent of the earmarks. 
   When you translate that into actual dollar amounts, appropriators are taking $1.6 billion taxpayer dollars back to their district. This represents 48 percent of the total dollars earmarked in this massive appropriations bill. 
   So what we have here, Madam Speaker, is a spoils system. It's not any high-minded, I know my district better than some faceless bureaucrat. It's, If I am an appropriator, or I am in a leadership position, I'm in a good position to get these earmarks. 
   Let me just run through a couple of the earmarks in the bill. This is a defense bill. The purpose of this appropriation bill is to fund our troops and to fund our defense. Yet, we have, for example, something called the Presidio Heritage Center in California. It may be a worthy project. It may be something a local government or local people want to fund, but why in the world the Congress is funding it in the defense bill, I just don't know. 
   But if this bill comes to the floor without being marked up in committee, nobody will be able to challenge it in committee. Nobody will be able to see it. If it comes to the floor under any other auspices than an open rule, then no Members of this body, the body as a whole, will be able to even question it. 
   There's also something called a Cold Weather Layering System. That is usually a highfalutin word for a coat. Sometimes gloves are put in here under big names about hand-warming systems, or whatever else, when it shouldn't be funded in the defense bill at all. 
   Another one, University Strategic Partnerships, Renewable Carbon Fuel from Algae. These may be good projects, but they shouldn't be in the defense bill.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   You know, a lot of us who spent time at home hoping that we would come back here and vote on a serious piece of legislation are disappointed here. This is not a serious piece of legislation. This is a piece of legislation that seems to be geared simply to give some people some cover for the upcoming elections. 
   If we had a serious piece of legislation that would provide for allowing us to exploit our own resources, it would allow States to share in the revenue generated by offshore drilling. Without allowing that, you simply guarantee that no State will opt in. So there is a lot of bait and switch here going on. 
   It seems that the only recycling in this is a familiar pattern of loading the bill up with a lot of items so you can get votes from here and there. For example, one of the spending programs is a National Consumer Awareness Program to educate the public on the environmental and energy benefits of public transportation. That's not a serious bill about our energy crisis. This seems to be a San Francisco bill with New York sensibilities. 
   And speaking of New York, there is a big fat item in for New York, about a $2 billion item which allows for the so-called Liberty Zone. This provision would allow New York City to keep $2 billion worth of the employers' share of payroll taxes to invest in transportation projects. That's a specific limited tax benefit for one entity here. That's an earmark by all definitions. And yet nobody has been able to explain--and we sought this morning, we sought all day to have somebody explain what that has to do with our energy future. Instead, it was just put in the bill to try to get a vote from here and there. 
   Again, this is not a serious piece of legislation. It is meant to provide political cover. It should be rejected. And, hopefully, as the moratorium goes off, we will get to really addressing our energy future.

   Mr. Speaker, I guess that some on the majority side think that they can cover up just by yelling or by raising the volume here of debate. 
   The bottom line here is, and the reason for this point of order, is that the majority party thought that, all right, we can have a bill here, or we can sneak something in. Let's sneak a limited tax benefit for New York. 
   You can call it an earmark, that's the proper definition when you have a limited tax benefit. You can call it a banana. You can call it anything you want to. The bottom line is the majority tried to sneak something into a broader bill that's supposed to be about energy, and that's what this is about. 
   So nobody is trying to distract anybody, other than those who are trying to slip a provision in that doesn't have to do with any comprehensive energy plan. It has to do with New York. 
   You can raise your voice, and you can yell all you want. The bottom line is somebody tried to sneak a limited tax benefit into this legislation. That's why I support the point of order.

   This has been quite a week, Mr. Speaker. I would venture to say that this is the most expensive week in the history of the Republic. I don't think anything ever will even come close to this in a number of years. We are talking about a $700 billion bailout. We had CRs that passed. And then we have this that comes to the floor. And if those at home are wondering why there are so few here in attendance, it's probably because they know that this isn't going anywhere. Gratefully, this stimulus package isn't going anywhere. 
   The Senate already tried to pass something and failed. And so this as a vehicle is not going anywhere. And people around the country should be very grateful for that. We call it a stimulus bill.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman. And if somebody can call a $61 billion bill ``slim,'' then let them try. But this one, you can try to call it ``stimulus.'' But stimulus to me, and I didn't like the last stimulus bill we passed here in Congress. And I didn't vote for it. But to call this ``stimulus'' is a real stretch. People at home want to keep more of their own money and not send it to Washington and then to have Washington turn around and say, well, I think that what we really need and what we needed to take your money for in the first place was so we can spend another $500 million in Amtrak for Amtrak projects, or another billion for transit and energy assistance grants, or $3 billion for green school improvements. I don't think anybody sitting at home thinks that that is very stimulating at all. I think they would be much more stimulated if you let them keep the money they have. 
   Let's be honest here. What this is is a stimulus bill. And it's meant to stimulate the electoral prospects of a couple of hundred Members here. That is what it's about, so Members can come to the floor or send out a press release saying, do you know what I got? I got $1 billion for capital management activities for public housing agencies. It's nothing more than that. That is what this is about. 
   But I think the danger in this is with a 9 percent approval rating, I think we could go into more historic lows here when people say they aren't really serious, a bill that isn't going anywhere, and they stand up and just say all right, this is if we could spend this money, here is where we would spend it. 
   We have to keep in mind that earlier this week, we did something that in my 8 years we have never done. Now I wasn't kind to my own party on earmarks. I thought that we let it go out of control. And the new majority came in and put in some decent rules which we have now broken just about every month. And what we did earlier this week was pass a CR where we brought to the floor a bill that had not even gone through the Appropriations Committee. And then we added 1,200, or there were 1,200 earmarks that were put in this bill that were not known to the Members of this body until a day before it came to the floor. Now we've done that kind of thing before. But what we have never done before that we did earlier this week is not give Members of this body the ability to even challenge those 1,200 earmarks.     
   Nobody could stand and say, why are we spending $1 million for the Presidio Trust or the Presidio Heritage Center in California? What is that about? Who is actually getting the money? Why are we doing this? Nobody had that chance, because we had a secretive process where earmarks were added into the bill with no ability to amend it out.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit a million dollars, and reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount, from being used to fund an earmark for the ACE Program at the Maricopa County Community Colleges. 
   While I am often criticized for meddling in the congressional districts of other Members in my attempts to make Federal spending on earmarks transparent, that accusation would be unfounded with this amendment. 
   As the saying goes, ``all politics is local,'' and this amendment makes that a truism, with a portion of Maricopa County within the boundaries of the district I represent. 
   As I am sure the sponsor of this earmark will be proud to tell you, the Achieving a College Education program was started in 1988 at one of the community colleges in the Maricopa system, and has spread to all 10 of its institutions. 
   According to the ACE Program Web site, the program is a partnership between community colleges and local high schools that was designed to reduce dropouts among at-risk high school students and transition them to community colleges and university studies. 
   It would be foolish and not truthful for me to stand here and say the program is not making a valuable contribution to Maricopa County. However, the criteria for receiving another Federal handout of $1 million cannot and should not rest simply on whether a program is doing valuable things. 
   I am certain that at many, if not all, of the hundreds upon hundreds of community colleges across the country there are important programs that are making valuable contributions to their communities. Surely the taxpayer shouldn't have to fund all of those programs. So how do we choose? How does Congress decide which important, valuable programs get funded with taxpayer dollars and which do not? 
   The willingness of Members of Congress to give Federal handouts to a select few has led to more than $5 billion in earmarks in this appropriations bill, a bill that is more than $1 billion over the President's request and has garnered a veto threat because of it. 
   In addition, this earmark is focused on education and raises the question of  why it is being funded out of the account of the Office of the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration. It is my understanding that Federal funding for the ACE Program came through the Department of Housing and Urban Development in previous years. 
   Other earmarks in the account of the Office of the Administrator for educational programs seem to highlight math and science education. While components of the ACE Program highlight math, science, technology or engineering, this appears to be only one facet of the program and not the sole purpose at all. In fact, other components also appear to highlight health services, business industry technology, community service, adult education, personal finance, and other areas. 
   I would submit to my colleagues again that if simply having a program that makes a valuable contribution were enough to warrant being awarded millions of dollars, the Treasury would soon be empty. 
   Further, I would submit that an earmark of this variety is misplaced in the Energy and Water appropriations bill, and should at the very least be considered in the upcoming Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman who just spoke, Mr. Pastor, and I know of his concern for education and his commitment there. 
   The point I would make again is there are many valuable programs out there. There are thousands and thousands of community colleges out there. I would think that we simply have to stop saying all right, we are going to fund this one or we are going to fund that one without some kind of criteria that should be set by somebody else other than Members of Congress because we are in a position where it happens politically. 
   Now that is not to say that decisions by Federal agencies aren't political. They often are. That's the responsibility of oversight, for us to step in and say you ought to have this criteria or this merit-based selection process or this competitive grant process. 
   But for us to say we don't like the way the Federal agencies do it so we are going to do it ourselves, I would think is not the wisest course. With that, I would urge support of the amendment. We simply can't fund all of the programs, the good programs that are out there, and maintain any type of position here in Congress of being equal or being good stewards of the taxpayer dollars. With that, I would urge support of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $750,000, and reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount, from being used to fund an earmark for the Alliance for NanoHealth, or ANH. 
   The ANH is comprised of seven universities and scientific institutions headquartered in Houston, Texas. 
   ANH's mission is to collectively bridge the disciplines to develop nanotechnology-based solutions to unresolved problems in medicine. 
   This earmark, according to the certification letters submitted by the sponsor, will be used for electron microscopy equipment, a high-resolution CCD camera, freezing apparatuses as well, for training and for upgrades for shared equipment purchases. 
   In 2004, the Federal Government provided $2.4 million in start-up funding for the alliance through an earmark in the Department of Defense appropriations bill. In fiscal year 2005, the Alliance for NanoHealth received a total of $7.4 million in Federal earmarks.  
   In addition to the earmark in this bill, ANH is scheduled to receive another $1 million for fiscal year 2008 in the Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill. 
   There is a competitive and transparent process for awarding Federal research contracts and Federal grants, but this is not it. 
   Let me be clear. I congratulate the alliance for its work and for its contributions to society. I believe that we, as lawmakers, should do everything we can to encourage more private sector research and development activity, but there is a troubling and growing tendency to replace private sector activity with governmental intervention. This earmark bears witness to that. 
   Just look at the 2006 endowment ratings for the university members of the Alliance for NanoHealth: Number 4 on the list, University of Texas system, $13.2 billion; number 10 on the list, Texas A&M, $5.6 billion; number 55, Baylor Medical School, $1.1 billion; and the list goes on. 
   Let us not allow the Federal Government to push private donors aside and remove the incentive for them to contribute in this or any other endeavor. 
   And with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, there is another disturbing trend here. It's often thought that if there is a bipartisan basis for the offering of these earmarks that it's okay. As long as 60 percent goes to the majority, 40 percent to the minority, then it's okay whatever you fund. That shouldn't be the basis on which we distribute taxpayer dollars at all. 
   In this case, for science grants there is a competitive and transparent process at the Federal agency level. If we're not happy with that process, we should intervene in that process, change it, mandate a more competitive process or a change in the process, instead of supplanting that process with one of our own that is far less competitive, that really is just political, because it pits one Member against another or one committee against another. 
   That's not how money should be awarded. If the agencies have too much money, we should cut it. If they don't have enough, we should add more. We should stipulate, we should mandate, we should have oversight of those agencies. But basically saying we're just going to have our own process because we don't like what they're doing over there is not the right way to go. 
   And I would say that this earmark is a good example of that, and for that reason, I offer the amendment and would urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I was tempted just not to offer any other amendments and just offer this one because this one is important for everyone to focus on because it points at problems not just with the earmark itself but with the process that we have in the House. And I would submit that we are not following that process as we should. 
   This amendment would strike funding for the Center for Instrumented Critical Infrastructure. The center is to receive $1 million in taxpayer funding in this bill. 
   When searching on the Web, my staff and I were unable to find the center's Web site. I'm not sure whether the center currently exists or whether this earmark creates the center. I would appreciate if the sponsor of this earmark would clear that up. 
   All the bill says is that it funds $1 million for the Center for Instrumented Critical Infrastructure in Pennsylvania. However, when you look at the certification letter that each Member now, according to our earmark rule, is required to submit, you see that the earmark is actually going to the Concurrent Technology Corporation based in Jonestown, Pennsylvania. This is a leading earmark recipient in multiple appropriation bills over the years. 
   Currently in this year, I believe in the Intelligence authorization bill this same group, Concurrent Technology, received two other earmarks. Why isn't that in the earmark itself in what we were handed? We only learned that through the certification letter. Is the earmark to go to the Instrumented Critical Infrastructure Center or to Concurrent Technology? I would love to have that clarified here. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

I'm wondering, in the report that accompanied the bill, it mentioned that the earmark was to go to the Center for Instrumented Critical Infrastructure, but the certification letter says that it's going to go to that but the earmark should actually go to Concurrent Technology Corporation. Which is it?

   Mr. FLAKE. We were told in this process early on by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that a different process was needed, that the earmarks should be added later in conference and not now because the Appropriations Committee simply couldn't vet or scrub these earmarks well enough. I would submit that this is a perfect example of that. 
   We've had another example. One earmark was actually withdrawn, one on the list that I was to offer, because it hadn't been adequately scrubbed. I would submit that this one should be as well, when the chairman of the relevant subcommittee can't tell us if this  center even exists. We don't know if it even exists, if it's created by this earmark. 
   Concurrent Technology has been the recipient of millions upon millions of dollars over the years. The executives in Concurrent Technology contribute handsomely to Members of Congress. So it receives a lot of earmarks. It seems to be an earmark incubator of some type, an earmark that begets more earmarks. 
   And yet we have the report that comes with the bill that doesn't even mention Concurrent Technology. It just mentions this center as if it already existed. We don't even know if it does. We can't even find any information on it, and apparently we can't even get that information from the Appropriations Committee. 
   So I would submit that this is what this process is about. This is why we come to the floor. This is why we invite the sponsor of the earmark to defend the earmark. But I would say again, does this center exist? Do we even know if it exists? How do we know if it's a good center or a bad center? Is this Concurrent Technology, which already receives millions and millions of dollars in other bills, worthy of another earmark to create another center? 
   These are the questions that we have to ask. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I guess I will finish off. I will call for a vote on this one, but I think it's important when Members are voting on this earmark and whether to retain it that we have to know what we know and know what we don't know. 
   We don't know if this center even exists. We are appropriating money for a center where the Appropriations Committee that has a responsibility to vet this earmark can't even tell us here if this even exists. We don't know that. We're voting on an earmark where in the report it says it goes to the center, but here in the certification letter it mentions Concurrent Technology, a private company. Which is it? 
   If we don't know these facts, we don't know what's going on here, I would say the thing to do is to vote this down, to actually vote for the amendment and wait until the Appropriations Committee actually has time to scrub and to vet these earmarks a little more carefully.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for this wonderful amendment. 
   I rise today out of a concern for what earmarks are doing to this body. Those of us on the Republican side understand very well the perils of unfettered earmarks. It's part of the reason we're squarely in the minority today. But there are greater concerns than which party is in the majority. I hope that each of us, Republicans and Democrats, would recognize this. 
   Proponents of earmarking defend the practice by noting that Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, and that earmarking is consistent with that responsibility. It is true that Congress has the power of the purse. But the contemporary practice of earmarking circumvents, rather than enhances, the careful execution of our responsibility as stewards of the public purse. 
   Take the Labor-HHS bill that will be coming up later today; it contains 1,300 earmarks. Are we to assume that each of these 1,300 has been properly vetted and scrubbed? No way. I suspect that, just as the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee noted a couple of weeks ago, there is no way to adequately screen these earmarks given the tight appropriations schedule. The question needs to be asked, why are we so bent on moving forward with 1,300 earmarks? 
   I should note that last year there were no House earmarks in the Labor-HHS bill. The world didn't come crashing to a halt. The year before there were no House earmarks in the Labor-H bill. The planets are still in order today. 
   Why are we so bent on moving forward when we can't adequately vet these earmarks? 
   Perhaps the most frequent justification for the contemporary practice of earmarking is that ``Members of Congress know their districts better than some faceless bureaucrat in Washington.'' Now, I'm not here to defend faceless bureaucrats. They waste a lot of money in my district, as well as others. Faceless bureaucrats in Federal agencies waste so much money that somebody needs to be constantly looking over their shoulder and providing oversight. That's why we're here. But let's face it, when we approve congressional earmarking for indoor rain forests in Iowa or teapot museums in North Carolina, we make the most spendthrift faceless bureaucrats look frugal. 
   Excess by Federal agencies does not excuse congressional excess. If Federal agencies don't follow the procedures requiring competitive bidding or other processes, then we should cut their funding and/or mandate that they change their practice. We shouldn't try to one-up them with equally suspect appropriations. 
   Just as an aside, we saw just a couple of weeks ago that the majority of this Chamber chose to deny funding for one particular earmark. Now, for the Record, it was my amendment to cut funding for the ``Perfect Christmas Tree Project.'' There was no Federal nexus, and I didn't think it was a wise use of Federal dollars. But it was no less worthy than hundreds of projects funded by the same legislation. 
   The distribution of earmarks is based on politics, not policy. Most appropriation bills award 60 percent of the earmarks to the majority party and 40 percent to the minority party. Is there a policy reason for this allocation that has reversed with every legislation? Are well-positioned Members who award themselves with more earmarks than rank-and-file Members more deserving? Are their districts more  needy? In some appropriation bills, each member of the committee is given an equal share. Are we to assume here that these districts have exactly the same needs? 
   The truth is, we can try all we want to to conjure up some noble pedigree for the contemporary practice of earmarking, but we are just drinking our own bath water if we think the public is buying it. 
   It seems that over the past few years we've tried to increase the number of earmarks enough so that the plaudits we hear from earmark recipients will drown out the voices of taxpayers who have had enough. It hasn't worked, thank goodness. For every group that directly benefits from earmarks, there are hundreds who see it as a transparent gimmick to assure our own reelection. 
   Mr. Chairman, our constituents deserve better. This institution deserves better than we're giving it. Let's return to the time-honored process of authorization, appropriation and oversight that has served us well for so long.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, I won't take 4 minutes, but I just want to commend the gentleman for bringing this forward and having such a thoughtful approach to earmarks. 
   I should mention what we will hear today, I am sure many, many times, is that Members will come to the floor and say, It is my district, I know it best; and other Members will say, Let's defer to that Member because that Member knows his district better than anybody else, and, therefore, we should defer all spending decisions to that Member. 
   Let me remind us all, though, that just a couple of weeks ago more than 100 Members from this side of the aisle and 149 Members from that side of the aisle voted to strike an earmark from a Member's district. So I hope that we don't hear that because that is not always the case. 
   We make policy for the entire country, and we spend the taxpayers' money, and it is not always the case that any Member should have his or her way in their district. 
   So I think that this is a thoughtful process and I would support this. It looks like that there are conflicting amendments that are similar, and I hope that one of them passes to strike all earmarks from the bill.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, this amendment would prevent $300,000 from funding the Exploratorium, a science museum in San Francisco, California, and reduces the cost of the bill by a consistent amount. 
   Madam Chairman, when I came across this earmark, I decided that I would explore why a successful museum like this would request money from the Federal Government. According to the earmark description in the certification letter submitted to committee, the earmark would fund an initiative to promote professional development for science education teachers. But when my staff and I did research on this earmark, we found that a teacher development program already exists at the museum. 
   According to the museum's Web site, the Teacher Institute trains teachers during the summer sessions, while they participate in a mix of learning experiences designed to help teachers with hands-on activities, inquiry, and strong science content.     
   The institute was founded by numerous corporate sponsors and foundations, including the Noyce Foundation and the Bank of America. All of the teachers who attend the Teacher Institute do so with private support. Again, why is the Federal Government funding an initiative that corporations can and do already fund? 
   The Exploratorium is a science museum that consists of 400 exhibits of art, science and the human perspective. It had over 600,000 visitors just last year. Cost of admission is $14 for adults, $9 for children. Income from government sources, both local and Federal, is almost $12 million. Nearly $9 million was contributed from individuals, corporations and foundations. It hardly seems that this museum is in some kind of financial straits, especially to the point that taxpayers around the country should be asked to help fund a program that would benefit only teachers from one small area of the country. 
   I don't disagree with the sponsor's desire for qualified science teachers in the classroom. Qualified teachers are necessary. But I do take issue with the increase in spending. This bill represents an increase of over $10 billion above the President's request and more than $2 billion over the Senate bill. 
   Spending has got to stop somewhere. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Again, we are simply stopping $300,000 for a museum that has a budget of some $12 million.  
   With that, Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, I would have hoped that the sponsor of the amendment, which I believe is the Speaker of the House, would have come here to defend it or talk more about it. 
   That was a nice description, but again, the point isn't whether this is a worthy program or not or whether or not we need science teachers. I've had some rather dull ones as well, and I would rather have ones that are taught well and can teach well. But this museum has $12 million in revenue. This is 300,000 additional dollars given by the Federal Government. Why are we doing this? It's not because it's needed. It's because somebody can. 
   I would submit that when we are running a deficit like we are in this country and we have the debt like we do, why in the world are we doing this? What possible nexus is there for the Federal Government to come in and supplant private dollars with taxpayer dollars? 
   With that, I would urge adoption of the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, this amendment would strike $150,000 for the Burpee Museum in Rockford, Illinois, for educational programming and exhibits and, as mentioned, reduces the cost of the bill by a consistent amount. 
   Now, I don't want to take a lot of time on these amendments. I know a lot of people want to move pretty quickly. 
   Let me just say that I know the name, the Burpee Museum, lends itself to a lot of nice jokes about having dry heaves as a taxpayer and paying this or whatever else.

   Mr. FLAKE. None was intended. I was just hoping to shorten the conversation here. 
   But this museum began as a Works Progress Administration project in 1942. It's an old New Deal program. It's still around, and one might question why the museum is still receiving Federal funds, even though the Depression era has come and gone, and the WPA has long since closed up shop. 
   I spoke to the author of this amendment. I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Manzullo, and he explained some of the things I had a question about. One was a question about where the funding actually goes, was it to the Burpee Museum or was it to Northern Illinois University that has a paleontology department, and as I understand it, is lending staff to the museum. He clarified that, and I think I understand how that goes now. 
   My question is, and the gentleman points out as well and I'm sure he will in defense of this earmark, that this is an economically distressed area. There are many around the country, in every district in the country. If the entire district is not economically depressed,  certain areas of it are, and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to try to discern by Members of Congress where funding should go and where it should not. 
   And I simply believe that it's not our place here to do this. In many cases, the accounts that we're earmarking are accounts that there is a competitive process at the Federal agency for the funds to be given out. By earmarking, we circumvent that process and we say, well, we know best so that we can decide who gets this funding. 
   I don't believe that that's right, and I believe that we should stop the funding for this earmark. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, I'd simply repeat what I said. Virtually every district in the country can accurately say that certain parts of their district are economically depressed. We simply don't have enough money in the Federal Treasury to address all those needs. 
   So our decision is how do we adequately and equitably distribute funds to the Federal Government. If we make the decision that Federal agencies should fund these projects, then we should stick to the process that we have in place, and that process usually involves competitive bidding, for example. We don't want to give up no-bid contracts, but that's what earmarks by definition typically do. 
   So I don't think that that is proper here, and with that, I would urge an affirmative vote on the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $200,000 in Federal funds from being used for the Rhode Island College for development of a Portuguese and Lusophone Studies program and reduces the cost of the bill by a consistent amount. 
   Let me just make a comment on the last comment that was made. It was said that we aren't saving money with these earmarks if we were to strike funding for them. 
   The way these earmarks are structured, we reduce the cost in the bill by a consistent amount. So whether we save money depends on the Appropriations Committee. 
   In any case, that's always what we are told, we will never save any money by striking funds for earmarks. That's simply not the case ever, because the Appropriations Committee could simply request less money the following year or the prior year, knowing that earmarks were going to be struck down. 
   Let me just say, with regard to this earmark, perhaps something was lost in translation. But my understanding is that this program has already been developed. Are we developing a program here that has already been developed, or is this a redevelopment? 
   According to the Web site, the Rhode Island College officially launched its Institute on Portuguese and Lusophone World Studies in October of 2006. The Web site states that the Institute of Portuguese and Lusophone World Studies is designed to be a nucleus of instruction and interaction for the benefit of its students and the larger Portuguese-speaking community of Rhode Island. 
   The certification letter submitted to the Appropriations Committee says that the money would be used for the Rhode Island College Lusophone Studies program. But since we don't have any further information, I guess we can assume, and I see that the sponsor of the amendment is here, and can clarify this, that the Lusophone World Studies is the intended recipient of the funds. 
   Supporters of the earmark will no doubt note that approximately 10 percent of Rhode Island's population is of  Portuguese descent. Through foundation donations and private contributions, over $620,000 has been raised to support the new program at Rhode Island College. In fact, Meredith Vieira, a well-known cohost of NBC's Today Show, and a Rhode Island native, serves as the national honorary chairperson of the Community Campaign for Portuguese Studies Endowment Fund. Here is another case where there is a lot of money coming in. 
   Why in the world do we need to spend more Federal money on it? Why do we need an earmark to divert more funds from our Treasury to programs that seem to exist and subsist fine on their own? In many cases we supplant private or local funds that could be used for this purpose. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Again, I think something has been lost in translation here. I have no idea what this amendment has to do with Enron. This amendment is simply saying that the Federal Government need not spend money on this program. 
   This Rhode Island College is a State university, it's my understanding. If the taxpayers in Rhode Island want to decide through their State representatives that it should receive more funding, then by all means it should. 
   My question is why are we coming here to the Federal Government with all the choices out there. The university that I went to, private university, teaches dozens and dozens of languages. I am sure they would like more funding, but it wouldn't be my place to come in and say, all right, let's have a big earmark for the Afrikaans program or the Chinese program or something else. I just don't think that would be proper. We can't do that. 
   Last time I checked, we are running a deficit here, and we have a big debt. To try to fund all of these programs simply is not prudent. It has nothing to do with Enron. It has nothing to do with misplaced priorities elsewhere. 
   It has to do with whether or not the Federal Government should in this case fund an earmark that is circumventing the regular process of authorization and appropriation. There are programs out there through the Department of Education that award grants to universities that have language programs. This is circumventing that process. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $150,000 in Federal funds from being used for the American Ballet Theater in New York for educational activities, and it would reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount. 
   I should point out that it has been said that if we don't spend this money, those faceless bureaucrats will just spend it. This actually reduces it. So it is up to the Appropriations Committee how that money is spent, not the agency itself. But I think that we could be facing the music if taxpayers learn that we are dancing away with their hard-earned money here. 
   The American Ballet Theater has been home to some of the world's best dancers since 1939. I believe that it holds assets of more than $15 million, $15 million in net assets. Yet, we are being asked to fund $150,000, I believe, to expand outreach by completing in-depth residencies in small and medium-sized communities across the country. 
   I have an obvious love for the ballet. I am not sure if it is that obvious, but I do like culture, and I think it is good for everyone. But telling taxpayers across the country that they should pony up $150,000 for the American Ballet Theater, an organization that has over $150 million in net assets I think is just a bridge too far. 
   There are many corporate sponsors involved in the American Ballet Theater, including American Airlines, Saks Fifth Avenue, Superfund Investing, Countrywide Financial. There are many well-known names on the board who contribute themselves. There is a Kennedy who is an honorary chairman; there is a Trump on the board as well. 
   There is a lot of support out there for this organization. I just fail to see why the Federal taxpayers should be put on the hook for this as well. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I find it curious when it's often said that the gentleman or somebody does not support the arts, does not support education. What would be said if there was a local individual, a philanthropist who gave $10 million to a local university, but did not believe that it was the Federal Government's place to do so? Would that person support education or not? If this is the standard by which people are judged, perhaps not. 
   But I would submit that it's not a very good standard. Just because you don't believe that it's the Federal Government's place, in this case, to favor what is perhaps the best known ballet company in the country, with net assets of more than $15 million, over perhaps local ballet companies that could maybe use more support. How do we make that choice here? It just doesn't seem right to me. 
   We have over 1,300 earmarks in this appropriation bill. I just don't know when Congress is going to draw the line. 
   For the average American taxpayer, I would argue that this $150,000 to the American Ballet Company is too much, or in this case, maybe too, too much. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, this amendment prevents $150,000 from going toward programs at the South Carolina Aquarium in Charleston, South Carolina, and reduces the cost of the bill by a consistent amount. 
   Madam Chairman, when I saw this amendment, or saw this earmark, I thought I was experiencing deja vu here. In the past we've seen earmarks for other aquariums in other appropriations bills. Last year, the Mystic Aquarium received $1 million in the bill allocating funding for the Defense Department. And now we see the South Carolina Aquarium is a beneficiary in the spending bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education. 
   This earmark may have found a more appropriate home in this spending bill rather than the Defense bill; but if I were a betting man, I would not bet against seeing other aquarium earmarks in other appropriations bills. It seems to be a trend here that the Federal Government seems to be funding more aquariums across the country, without, I would submit, much of a Federal purpose. 
   The Web site for the South Carolina Aquarium states that the purpose is to inspire conservation of the natural world by exhibiting and caring for animals, excelling in education and research, and providing an exceptional visitor experience. 
   This aquarium sells tickets for $16 for adults, $14 for seniors, $8 for children. It also has a sea turtle hospital, sustainable food initiative, which includes sustainable seafood recipe contests and a variety of exhibits. 
   But I would ask, why do not all aquariums across the country receive similar funding? What is the criteria for picking winners and losers? 
   This aquarium seems to get favorable treatment over aquariums in Massachusetts, Colorado, Arizona, Kansas, as well as just about every other State. Is this a fair and equitable process? 
   In addition, here, the case again is that the aquarium has a number of business partners and sponsors. The list reads like a who's who of Fortune 500 companies: BP, Whole Foods, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. 
   Why are the taxpayers being asked to be on the hook? Why are we asked to sponsor this aquarium as well? 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $100,000 from being used to fund educational and outreach programs at the Kansas Regional Prison Museum at Lansing, Kansas. I've often joked that the way we splurge taxpayer funds on thousands of earmarks is a crime. But this earmark gives that sentiment a little new relevance. 
   It appears that Leavenworth County in Kansas uniquely hosts Federal, State, military and private prisons, and a regional prison museum is proposed to honor that heritage. This prison museum building would be in addition to the existing Lansing Historical Museum, complete with a gallows chamber, replicated cells and a 12- to 14-foot stone wall around the complex. 
   All told, it appears this prison museum addition would significantly increase the overall display area of the Lansing Historical Museum from roughly 1,500 square feet to nearly 8,000 square feet of display area. Here, I think it is a pretty clear case. It may have some local relevance, but asking taxpayers across the country to pay for a prison museum is probably not a wise use of funds here. 
   The Kansas director of Americans for Prosperity, a grass-roots organization that focuses on taxpayer issues, called earmarking Federal funds for this project ``wasteful Federal spending'' and suggested that ``if there is truly a market for a prison museum, people who find it interesting should pay for it, not the 99.9 percent of taxpayers who will never visit it.'' 
   AFP, or Americans for Prosperity, also suggested that nontaxpayer sources of revenue could be found if there was adequate local support to build an economically viable prison museum in Lansing. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, again, I don't want to diminish the need that the locals feel to have this museum. People around the country have varying needs and wants for museums, whether it is a teapot museum in North Carolina or a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Ohio. Local needs are such and people visit and tourists find that interesting. 
   But why should the Federal taxpayer be on the hook? When do we say, is there a time at which we say enough is enough, we can't handle any more? Thirteen hundred earmarks. Yes, it is down from the heyday of 2005, and I make no excuses for my own party for doing that. But is it right? When should we say enough is enough and simply say we shouldn't be using Federal taxpayer dollars for these kinds of projects?

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, this amendment would eliminate $150,000 in Federal funds for the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Illinois, for exhibits and community outreach. 
   Shedding some light on earmarks like this should be one of Congress' top initiatives, and I am glad that we have this opportunity to do it. 
   The certification letter I submitted to the Appropriations Committee by the Member sponsoring the project stated ``the funding would highlight the Great Lakes aquatic ecosystem and incorporate community outreach, team mentor and stewardships program.'' 
   This is the second largest indoor aquarium in the world containing 8,000 animals, 650 species. An ``all access pass'' for admission is $23 for adults and $16 for children, and this aquarium gets 2 million visitors annually. According to the Charity Navigator, annual revenue for the Shedd Aquarium in 2004 totaled over $50 million. This is revenue in 2004 totaling $50 million. 
   In 2004 alone the Shedd Aquarium had over $215 million in net assets and nearly $13 million in excess revenue. Let me read that again. In 2004 alone the Shedd Aquarium had over $215 million in net assets and nearly $13 million in excess revenue. 
   Why in the world, please tell me, are we giving 150,000 hard-earned Federal tax dollars to a local aquarium that has $13 million in excess revenue in 1 single year? It simply doesn't seem right to me. 
   The Shedd Aquarium has applied for and has received at least four competitive IMLS grants in the past, but this earmark skirts that process. 
   Again, we often talk about how we know more about our districts than some faceless bureaucrat in some agency. Well, those faceless bureaucrats in some agency awarded four grants to this institution. But that wasn't enough. They were back for another earmark, where apparently maybe they didn't get the grant this year; so we are going to earmark funds for the organization. Why do we set up a competitive grant program in a Federal agency and then say we are going to go around it by issuing an earmark? 
   Oftentimes we give earmarks to organizations that fail to get a grant, that fail the competitive process that we have ordered the Federal agency to establish. The oversight process dictates that we actually call in Federal agencies if we don't like the processes that they have set up and tell them to set up a new process or we deny them funding. And for those of us who say that they won't talk to us or those Federal agencies are nonresponsive, cut their funding for a while and see how responsive they become. That is our role, not to compete with the Federal agencies in how we can spend taxpayer dollars without competitive bids or without a process in place. 
   And I see that those who sponsored the amendment are here. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I think the gentlelady may want to check the Record with regard to an energy bill. I'm not familiar with any that I voted for because they are hugely corporate subsidies. 
   And let me just say one thing. Charlie brought up, well, you're from Arizona. The Central Arizona Project, the big Federal project, or the Glen Canyon Dam in the 1950s was built largely with Federal funds, as if these were some earmark slipped into a conference report 3 days before the bill came to the floor. Not at all. I mean, no projects were debated more. Nothing went through more authorization, appropriation and now oversight than those projects. I may have voted differently if I were around in the 1950s, but I wasn't. 
   What we're debating here is whether we should spend $150,000 in Federal funds for a local aquarium in Chicago that in 2004 had $215 million in net assets, $50 million in total revenue, and $13 million in excess revenue. That is the question before us. We can talk about Enron. We can talk about the war. We can talk about anything, but this is what's relevant here, whether the taxpayer should be spending $150,000 for an aquarium, a local aquarium that had $50 million in revenue in 1 year alone. It simply doesn't seem right. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $200,000, and reduce the cost of the bill by a consistent amount, from being used to expand the exhibits and outreach at Jefferson's Poplar Forest in Forest, Virginia. 
   Now, I'm sure that Thomas Jefferson himself would appreciate the sentiment about this, but I'm not sure the earmark is consistent with the Jeffersonian philosophy of ``limited government,'' particularly limited Federal intrusion. He talked about a wise and frugal government in his 1801 inaugural address. I'm not sure that this sits well with that philosophy, spending Federal money, $200,000 in this case. 
   Poplar Forest is an octagonal house, an acreage that was inherited by Jefferson's family. They used it as a retreat in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Now, I won't take too much time on it, but suffice it to say there is a lot of local support for something like this. It sounds like a great house. 
   I enjoy going to Monticello and visiting the sites of Thomas Jefferson. I'm sure that this is a fitting reminder of his life work and historical importance, along with a lot of other things that we have. But here again, there is an infinite need around the country for money for projects like this. If you simply ask the sponsoring Members, if you say that it's needed for economic development or tourism, what earmark would ever fail with that kind of criteria? We simply have to have a higher standard here. Does it have a Federal nexus? Can we afford it? Is it consistent with limited government, economic freedom, individual responsibility? That's what we should be asking ourselves here.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, to end this debate tonight on these earmarks, I would just say that there has not been one earmark that has been challenged here tonight that isn't going to a valuable organization as far as I'm concerned. The question is not is there value in that organization or is there value in what this aquarium or what this historic site is doing. The question is should we be paying for it at the Federal level. And I think that's what taxpayers have a hard time with, and I think they should, particularly given the fiscal problems that we're having at the Federal level.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 2419, FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Chair. 
   This motion to instruct conferees is simple. It would simply urge farm bill conferees to accept the Senate provision on the payment limits for annual direct payments, which is the same as current law. Again, we are simply asking to accept current law, rather than increase payments limitations. Let me explain. 
   Under current law, farmers and eligible landowners can receive $40,000 per person in direct payments per year, not including a loophole that currently exists that enables that amount to be doubled. The House-passed farm bill seeks to raise this limit to $60,000 per person, while the Senate passed bill keeps the limit at the $40,000 level as in current law. In essence, this motion to instruct conferees would simply say, retain current law. Don't increase the limit on how much a farmer or landowner can receive in direct payments. 
   Direct payments are one of the three primary subsidy programs available for commodity crops, along with countercyclical payments and marketing loan payments. Direct payments are paid to farmers and eligible landowners that have had so-called base acreage that was historically farmed for program crops like wheat or cotton or corn. Direct payments go to farmers and landowners whether the whether they farm or not on the property and are independent of crop prices. Simply put, these checks are in the mail to eligible recipients, no matter what the price of commodities. 
   While these payments were originally intended to transition farmers away from subsidies, it is unfortunate that they have come to take a permanent place in the entitlement spending landscape and that Congress is on the verge of upping the limits on how much recipients can receive. 
   These payments cost taxpayers more than $5 billion a year, under the last farm bill, that is, and while the bill under consideration might cut them by a minuscule amount, taxpayers will still foot a staggering bill. 
   These handouts are often distributed to landowners who don't farm. I have even heard anecdotes about rice farmers who later subdivide the land for mini-mansions even, and realtors will advertise that direct payments will come to the new landowners. Lucky them. Get a house on land that was previously a rice farm. You are going to be getting direct payments. How is that? How can we countenance a situation like that continuing? 
   According to a recent analysis by the Environmental Working Group, with the present loopholes that are available to recipients, ``a total of 1,234 recipients collected direct payment subsidies worth $120,000 or more, costing taxpayers $226 million total. One hundred forty-nine recipients got more than $250,000 in direct payments. The top 10 percent of direct payment subsidy recipients in 2007 collected about 60 percent of this government money.'' These are the payments on which the House-passed bill would increase the limit by 50 percent. 
   We have a strong agricultural economy at present. Unlike the countercyclical and marketing loan programs, which, if you have a good agricultural economy, don't get paid out, this program keeps paying out no matter what. These are independent of crop prices. 
   It is unfathomable that U.S. farmers that are enjoying historically low debt-to-asset ratios and consistently high cash receipts and robust farm export values, under this scenario the conferees would need to increase the limit on direct payments beyond the current $40,000 limits. It is unfortunate. It looks like the 2007 farm bill will be a missed opportunity to reform the wasteful farm subsidy programs, like the one I have spoken about. 
   As approved by the House, the best that can be achieved in terms of reform is a reduction in the income cap for payment eligibility programs from $2.5 million to $1 million or $2 million for married folks. Even though the administration has sought a $200,000 income cap, both the House and the Senate it seems, and it seems the conferees, appear content to continue to allow millionaires to receive farm payments. While acting as if real reform had been made on the income cap, the House-passed farm bill actually relaxes the limits on how much a recipient can receive in farm payments. 
   We simply cannot go in this direction. We have been told again and again and again by both sides of the aisle that we won't have a farm bill that has the generous subsidy payments that we have had before, that there has to be reform. This is not reform. 
   Some people may try to sell it and say we are getting rid of a loophole there, so we will have to increase this, and then we will phase it out at some other time. That is probably what we will hear. When you hear that, hold on to your wallet.  
   You have to remember that this program that we are talking about, this direct payment program was instituted in the nineties as a way to transition farmers away from subsidies. Yet here it is still, a decade later, and we are talking about increasing it. So if anybody tells you we are increasing it so we can actually phase it out easier or somehow lessen payments that will go out, don't believe it. Don't believe it. 
   Let's vote for this motion to instruct. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Before yielding to the gentleman from Wisconsin, let me simply say that we are not talking about the food stamp program here. We are not talking about nutrition programs or conservation programs. We are talking about direct payments. This is a different program. This is simply an effort to say, let's not increase the amount of money going to direct payments at a time when commodity prices are so high and when the farm community is doing so well. It just not make sense to reform by increasing the subsidy.

To hear the debate on the other side, you would think it was just one crazy guy from Arizona and another crazy guy from Wisconsin who think that we are out of bounds here.

   Mr. FLAKE. I appreciate the words of the gentleman from Wisconsin. I too have traveled to Australia and New Zealand, and I talked to the farmers there. They heard the same horror stories there. They worried about the same thing when they got rid of subsidies in New Zealand. 
   As the gentleman from Wisconsin mentioned, you would be hard-pressed to find anybody who wants to go back to that system because, just as the gentleman from Arkansas just mentioned, they don't like the government telling them what they can and can't farm. 
   A main element of this program we are talking about right now is that if you are to receive these direct payments, you can't farm specialty crops. You have to farm corn or wheat or rice. You can't do specialty crops. So for all of the talk about we don't want government telling us what we can and can't plant, that is a central element of this program that you accept those restrictions. There is something wrong with that argument when we say we don't want government to tell us; but yes, you can tell us as long as we can collect these direct payments. 
   The gentleman from Arkansas said that prices are up high now, but they will go down. Yes, they will; but these direct payments will remain the same. That is the problem here. These aren't a safety net, these are just a direct subsidy in many cases whether you farm or not. That's the problem with this. 
   And we aren't saying get rid of it. I would like to, frankly, if it were up to me. But we're not saying that. All we are saying is keep it the same. Don't increase it. Yet we are hearing the argument that somehow all of the family farms are going to go away unless we increase a direct payment that bears no relationship to crop prices at all. There is something wrong with that argument. So we are competing here in a vacuum.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman. 
   I mentioned that it is often said on the other side that it is just a couple of guys who don't know what they are talking about, and the rest of the country feels differently. Let me tell you what some people around the country are saying about this farm bill. 
   The Minneapolis Star-Tribune wrote: ``The Senate passed a $286 billion farm  bill that makes only minor changes to the bloated agricultural subsidy system that rewards rich farmers for being farmers.'' 
   The Burlington, Vermont, Free Press: ``The farm bill making its way through Congress is a good example of what's wrong with the way major legislation gets passed in Washington.'' 
   The Boston Globe: ``That kind of calculation is just the sort of special-interest politicking that is making voters nationwide question what was gained by giving the Democrats power.'' 
   The East Brunswick, New Jersey, Home News Tribune: ``The farm bill is the sort of confounding public policy document that too often wins approval in Washington; it's stuffed full of pork and misdirected at the same time.'' 
   This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. The Republicans passed, I thought, what was a far too generous, bloated farm bill back in 2002, and I believe the gentleman from Arkansas and I had a debate at that time.     
   So this isn't a partisan debate at all. This is a debate about what taxpayers should be required to pay. 
   The Orlando Florida Sentinel: ``The system those lawmakers would perpetuate dumps billions of dollars a year in taxpayer subsidies on the farmers of a few crops, whether they need it or not. The largest commercial farms reap the bulk of the subsidies, while most growers get little or nothing.'' 
   The Charleston South Carolina Post Courier: ``So far the impulse to reform has been overwhelmed by the efforts of those representing the beneficiaries of farm program largesse.'' 
   The Winston-Salem, North Carolina Journal: ``The legislation that was designed to put American family farms back on their feet has now become the massive giveaway program to mega corporations that manage family farms. The farm bill is hopelessly bloated and outdated.'' 
   The Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Tribune-Review: ``The U.S. Senate has once again failed to slow the nonstop pigout in multi-billion dollar family farm subsidies.'' 
   The Bismarck, North Dakota Tribune said: ``The provision that would get wide agreement would require that government payments be attributed to an actual, named person, rather than to shadow entities that might even belong to people who do no farming themselves.'' We call that reform. 
   The Lewiston, Maine Sun Journal wrote: ``The prospect of starving constituents is unpalatable. What's worse, though, is using them as chattel to negotiate subsidies for wealthy farmers.'' 
   As the gentleman from Wisconsin said, we're hardly talking about payments to those who are just getting by. In some cases, payments are going to those with adjusted gross incomes nearing $1 million. Yet we're saying, well, there are large expenses that farmers have. Yes. That's adjusted gross income after expenses are already backed out. 
   So we're not a couple of guys here who are seeing things differently. I think we're seeing it as the rest of the country does. I think that this place is in a bubble sometimes when we discuss continuing a program to subsidize people who, in many cases, aren't farming, and having subsidies tied not to crop prices at all, not a safety net, mind you, but payments that go and go and go, regardless of whether or not crop prices are high or low. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I've enjoyed this back-and-forth. Let me just say that it's implied again that we don't know what we're talking about somehow, that somehow we're divorced from the farming community and we don't know what they go through. 
   Let me just say, if you look at the end of my right index finger, it's gone. I left it in an alfalfa field at age 5. 
   I don't know all the ins and outs. I've been away from farming on a real basis for a while. But it's not a complete alien world to me, and certainly not to my family and relatives. 
   But let's get back to what we're talking about with this motion to instruct. We're talking about not a safety net at all. We're talking about direct payments, in many cases to farmers who don't farm at all, that is not tied to crop prices, whether they're high or low. This is a relic of reform attempts in the 1990s when we were trying to wean farmers away from subsidies that didn't happen. But these subsidies still remain, despite the fact that the other subsidy programs came back. 
   And all we're saying here is that, let's keep the limit at current law, at  $40,000 per person, not increase it to $60,000 per person. Yet we're being accused of trying to completely dismantle the family farm by not increasing the subsidies that are being paid out right now. We're simply saying they should remain where they are in current law. 
   So despite all the talk about stable food prices for citizens of the United States, or whatever else, remember, this motion to instruct has nothing to do with that. This simply has to do with a program that gives direct payments to people who, in many cases, do not farm at all, that has no tie to crop prices, whether they're high or whether they're low. 
   Let me simply say also that the administration said this week, this plan would result, talking about the current iteration of the farm bill, this plan would result in the continuation of farm subsidy payments to individuals with extremely high incomes. 
   The administration also said, this is not reform, and does not move Congress closer to a farm bill that the President would sign. 
   I certainly hope that the President sticks with that commitment. We need a farm bill that honors our commitment to have some fiscal responsibility here. Upping the limit of direct payments, increasing it by 50 percent, is not fiscally responsible. 
   So I would encourage my colleagues to join us in voting for this motion to instruct. Discount the debate that doesn't have anything to do with this debate on whether or not the conferees should accept the current subsidies or increase them. 
   With that, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for his words and for all those who have participated. I would encourage a vote in favor of the motion to instruct. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this bill. H.R. 1195 is purported to be a technical corrections bill. When you hear ``technical corrections,'' you often think of missing commas or misspellings or inverted numbers or other drafting errors. We are doing far, far, far more than that here with this legislation. There are, I believe, more than 200 earmarks that are receiving so-called technical corrections here. These are substantial in nature. They are not simply technical. I think they deserve further scrutiny. 
   We have all found out what happens when we rush legislation like this through. The underlying bill had 6,300 or 6,200 earmarks, as was mentioned. If you're making technical corrections, they should be technical. These are more than technical. They deserve more scrutiny. We don't want to find out later that we have the same problems that we had before. For that reason, I will oppose the legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, this amendment would eliminate funding for the operating subsidy grants to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or Amtrak, and save the taxpayer $475 million. 
   The FY 2007 funding level was $490 million. The President requested to eliminate funding for this grant program in the FY 2008 budget. 
   According to the committee report, operating subsidy grants allow the Department of Transportation to make quarterly grants to Amtrak after receiving and reviewing a grant request for each train route. This would be accompanied by a detailed financial analysis, revenue projection and capital expenditure projection. Receipt of these grants also requires Amtrak to achieve savings through operating efficiencies, yet Amtrak has been plagued by inefficiencies and debt since its inception. 
   Amtrak's model for providing intercity rail service has been a failure since it began in 1971. Historically Amtrak has carried has less than 1 percent of the traveling public. It is it has required annual Federal subsidies to cover operating losses and capital costs in every year since its existence, some $29 billion in taxpayer resources to date. 
   It lacks adequate cost controls. It has deferred capitalized repair projects, and it confronts increasing debt-service costs. 
   Now, we were told 30 years ago that Amtrak started from the ruins of what was then passenger rail service. Whatever its origins, the market has simply apparently vanished for passenger rail service of this kind. The Heritage Foundation reported that even if Amtrak increases its passenger load, for every passenger that is increased, the taxpayer pays more in subsidies. So, it's like the retail shop owner saying that I am losing money with every sale, but I am going to make up for it in volume. The taxpayers are making up for it in volume every time. 
   There has been a slight increase in passenger service in terms of passengers served over the past couple of years, or at least there was from 2001 to 2004, and still it bleeds red ink all over. 
   Now, contrast this with some cargo service provided by rail. It's largely free of subsidy. It's done by the private sector. There are huge profit margins there. In many routes they do very well. But Amtrak, passenger rail service, simply can't get there. There simply isn't a market for it. 
   Now, those providing cargo service wouldn't want to provide passenger service, because there is no market. But we continue to let the taxpayer subsidize it. As the last speaker mentioned, some routes the subsidy is between $400 and $500 per ticket. The Federal taxpayer could buy each person on a long-distance Amtrak service on some of the routes a plane ticket for what it costs to subsidize their Amtrak  travel. That's after they have paid a lot more than a plane ticket would cost in the first place. 
   There simply isn't a market for it. How long will we go on not recognizing it, not recognizing that we need some competition from the private sector to allow it to take it over? If there isn't a market at some point, the taxpayers shouldn't be forced to subsidize it any longer. 
   Let me just finish. We will hear that we need passenger rail service. We will need to catch up to countries like Germany and Japan who are doing it. Apparently they are doing a better job than we are. 
   Who among us here thinks that with the current model of government subsidizing a private corporation like this is going to get us where Germany is or Japan is? As has already been noted, people who study this issue note that with every new passenger added, every net increase in passengers, it's actually more subsidies. So under the current model, unless they change or reform somehow, if they increase ridership, we actually have to pay more in subsidies. 
   That simply doesn't work. It wouldn't work in the private sector. No private businessman would stand it. But the taxpayers are simply on the hook for about $1.2 billion a year. It continues year after year after year. I have been here 6 years. I have heard it every year. I suppose if we go the next 25 years, we will hear it again. It will just be an increase in subsidies, like we are doing this year. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, this amendment would reduce funding in the bill by $500 million for capital grants to Amtrak, reducing the funding level to the President's fiscal year 2008 request from $925 million to $500 million. 
   Here the same arguments really apply that were made in the last amendment debate, so I won't go over them all again, but let me respond a little to what was said before. 
   It was mentioned that these amendments are just designated to kill Amtrak. If these accounts were funded at the levels that we're talking about here, certainly there would be a restructuring somewhere. There has to be. It is likely that in some of the corridors, some of the corridors there is only a per-passenger subsidy of around $3 per ticket. In some corridors it's up to $466. I suppose that what would happen is that in those corridors, there are a lot of assets sitting with Amtrak now. If it wasn't shielded from private competition, others would come in and be able to run that service effectively and without subsidy in some of the corridors. Perhaps there'd be a smaller subsidy on some of the corridors. 
   But I can tell you on the corridors where we're having a subsidy of $466, in addition to the per-passenger ticket price of, in some cases, $900, I don't think that that would run at all, nor should it in any reasonable place where you believe in free markets or even limited subsidies. 
   There is no more call for passenger rail service to some places in this country than there is for stagecoach service. At some point you've got to say, how much can we subsidize? Four hundred sixty-six dollars per ticket probably is above that threshold somewhere. 
   So, under any reasonable system, yes, this would cause significant restructuring with Amtrak for that system, and that's what we're calling for. That's what we should be calling for. We can't continue to go down this road, because, as mentioned, even if you increase the number of passengers per train, if you increase ridership, it simply means more subsidy. 
   In any reasonable system that wouldn't be the case, but we have a system here that doesn't respond to market forces. Part of the problem with Amtrak, and we can't just blame the system there, but it's the requirements that we've placed on it. You have politicians in this small town here or this small town here designating routes that Amtrak has to follow, routes that can't even come close to being economical. 
   As mentioned, not many passenger rail or public transit systems anywhere in the world go unsubsidized. It's one thing to subsidize public transit; it's another to be paying $466 per ticket when the passenger is already paying $900. That simply doesn't pass any test of reasonableness. And unless we come in and really strike funding here and force change, it's simply not going to happen. 
   Who here in this body or who listening tonight thinks that Amtrak is suddenly going to become better and provide better service, more efficient service, given the numbers that we've given them here? 
   Some will call it a starvation diet. They've been on a starvation diet, but we've increased funding significantly many times. It hasn't improved. It's because we're shielding them from market forces, in some cases, and subsidizing routes that have no business running in others. 
   So I would offer this amendment to strike funding, or to actually bring it down to the President's level, what he has requested. 
   I've heard the chairman of the Appropriations Committee say many times and point out that the administration is wasting money here and there and everywhere. They are. Here's one case where we should say, there's too much money being wasted by the agencies. Let's direct them, let's exercise the oversight that this body is supposed to exercise and actually say, let's pull some funding back, let's force Amtrak to go through the restructuring that they're going to have to go through at some point. We're simply delaying the inevitable and forcing the taxpayer to subsidize at higher levels than they should until that time is reached. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting debate today. We have heard on the other side: Today is the day I am going to vote to give the American worker a raise. Would that we all had that kind of power. Unfortunately, with this, we can dictate that. Unfortunately, somebody else has to pay that wage. 
   It is simply not right to inject ourselves into the free market in that way. Yes, it would be nice if everyone could make a larger wage. 
   The problem is, the price of everything is elastic. When the price goes  up, the demand goes down. Those are the irrefutable laws of the free market. To think that we can simply go in and dictate and change things that way is wrong. 
   Less than a month ago I was in Cuba. Now, in Cuba, a janitor makes the same as a doctor. Some might say that is a good thing until you realize that they both make about $20 a month. It is not good when government controls the price and wage and controls the economy. 
   I am not suggesting that we are anywhere close to that, but supposing that we can inject ourselves and have this week wage controls, a little later this week, price controls in the form of negotiating with companies what drugs are going to cost, is simply the wrong direction to go. 
   I would urge everyone here to reject the notion that we as Members of Congress should inject ourselves into the free market in that manner.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   You know, when we pass legislation like this, 1,700 pages, barely have time to print it, let alone read it, we are going to have problems like this. Let me just mention a couple of the problems and issues that have come up over the last couple of days when we have been trying to deal with this legislation. 
   Our office found out just a couple of days ago after the bill had already passed that there was another subsidy program actually added to the bill during the conference that was not part of the House bill and was not part of the Senate bill. This is potentially a massive, massive liability for the taxpayers. According to the Department of Agriculture, this could mean as much as $16 billion, in addition to everything else in the bill, additional liability for the taxpayers annually. 
   We don't know much about this program at all. All we know is that for years now the farming community has been upset that they haven't been able to collect money off the countercyclical program and the loan deficiency payment program because prices have been so high. So this new program was put in so the threshold would be much higher at which subsidies kicked in. 
   The only way this could be scored by the CBO as being compliant with our budget rules is to baseline shop. What that means is instead of taking this year's baseline where we should benchmark our spending off of, it is to go back to last year's baseline. And I believe the information is correct that had we used this year's baseline instead of last year's baseline, CBO informs us that they would have scored this as a $2 billion hit additionally, rather than being scored even, as it is in the bill. I mention this only because this is just another example of what we get when we move with haste like this, when we get a bill that virtually nobody has read. 
   Now, the things that we know well about the farm bill should give us pause enough. I mentioned before that we face tremendous problems going forward in terms of entitlements and unfunded liabilities. We are, according to USA Today, and we probably get better information there than what we say on this floor, when you include all of our unfunded liabilities and our debt that is out there, it means that every person in America has a debt of about $500,000. Half a million dollars in debt is what we owe when you total unfunded liabilities and our debt. 
   We simply cannot go forward like this and add a $300 billion bill that pays a farm couple that earns as much as $2.5 million subsidies and continue to pay down the debt. We are simply adding more. 
   With that, I would urge rejection of this measure.

   I just wanted to respond to the statement that was made that we were wrong on the ACRE program in terms of what bills it was in. The ACRE program was not in the House-passed bill.

   Mr. FLAKE. That is not the information that I had. 
   And the point that I made with regard to the scoring by CBO stands. If you use an earlier baseline, it affects it tremendously. If you use the baseline that we should be using under the budget rules adopted by this House, by this majority, then the program would not score as it did; it would score as a big hit to the taxpayer rather than something else.

   Mr. FLAKE. I would like to see it. My information was that it was not in the House bill; and, that if it was in the Senate, it was considerably different than what came over here. 
   But I think one thing we know is it was not appropriately vetted, because USDA was completely surprised at the numbers that came out. They are the ones, when they are saying all these numbers are flying around, the $16 billion in exposure is from the USDA. It is not pulled from some outside group or some other group, it is the USDA that is saying that this could cost us an additional $16 billion. And that should be considered, and it wasn't in this House; it simply was swept under the rug. That is what happens when you deal with a bill this big this quickly.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, I intend to withdraw this amendment after speaking for a few minutes about the process here. 
   I intended to offer an amendment to strip an earmark in California. It's not that I've had any epiphany on the earmark where I think it's good now. I don't. I think it should not be in this committee report. But I'm not at all happy with the process here. 
   I submitted a total of five amendments to the Rules Committee. Two amendments were to target earmarks sponsored by Democrats. Two amendments were to target earmarks sponsored by Republicans. One was to uphold the President's executive order with regard to earmarks. When the rule came back from the Rules Committee, only one of the amendments was made in order, one amendment targeting a Republican earmark. 
   Over the past couple of years, as the Members know, I have come to the floor more than a hundred times to try to strike earmarks. I have tried never to make it a partisan issue. When Republicans were in charge of this body, I sponsored more challenges to Republican earmarks. As the Democrats have taken charge, I've probably sponsored more challenges to Democrat earmarks. But as soon as this becomes a partisan issue, then we lose something here. Earmarks are an institutional issue, an institutional problem here, and we cannot treat it in a partisan fashion. That's why I will be asking for unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment. 
   But the problem here is that we also didn't allow in the rule the amendment to uphold the President's executive order. The President wisely has recognized that when you don't have earmarks in the bill text, when you're allowed to put them in a committee or conference report, you don't have the scrutiny that you should have on earmarks. 
   Just take, for example, this bill. This bill has about 500 earmarks. It went through the committee process. The earmarks were added at the last minute. In fact, I am told, at least on the Republican side and I suppose on the Democrat side as well, the rank-and-file members on the committee didn't even know which earmarks were allowed until the markup had happened; so it was impossible to challenge the earmarks while the bill was in committee. 
   Now, tell me, if we are supposed to be vetting these earmarks, if we're supposed to be looking at them, where are we supposed to do it? It's not happening in the committee process. It's certainly not happening on the floor. So where do we actually look at these? 
   We have a former Member of this body in jail right now for basically selling earmarks to defense contractors. He used the defense bill, year after year after year, I might add, and there was never a point at which those earmarks were challenged. Nobody looked. In fact, people looked the other way. There were plenty of warning signs out there that these earmarks were untoward. But we looked the other way. I would submit we are doing the same thing today. 
   When you have a report come to the floor with more than 500 earmarks, none of which were even known to most members of the committee before it arrived here on the floor, and then when I offer amendments to the earmarks, I'm only told I can offer one on the floor, one targeting a Republican earmark, to try to make it a partisan issue, there's something wrong with this picture. 
   I don't know when we are going to wake up and recognize that earmarks are cheapening this institution, and greatly. In Congress you place value and priorities by appropriating money and authorizing money, but when you have earmarks like this that are slipped in at the last minute out of sight, then you don't get proper debate on these priorities. You basically close your eyes to other people's earmarks because you want to protect your own. And when you have more than 500 earmarks, there are enough to spread around where debate that should be happening on defense priorities or other priorities in other bills is hushed and we simply don't have the scrutiny that these bills deserve.  
   A lot of these earmarks are, in essence, single-source contracts to private companies. We get all over the administration, and properly so, when they give single-source contracts. Halliburton, how many times have we heard it? We should scrutinize that. We should provide oversight. Yet when one of our Members does it, we turn our backs and say we don't want to know because we might want to do it as well. 
   Madam Chairman, we have to stop this process. 
   Madam Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be withdrawn. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona?

   Mr. FLAKE. Well, then there's no need to earmark it this way if it's authorized. There's no reason to put it in committee or conference report language and not have it in the bill. I think what the President has rightly recognized is that when it's not in the bill, then there are limited opportunities for other Members to see it and to scrutinize it.

   Mr. FLAKE. Again, the President's directive doesn't relate to report language in general, it's simply the earmark. Now I just have to say, 500 earmarks in this bill. There will be more than 2,000 when the appropriation bill comes to the floor, if tradition holds. If somebody can make the argument that that is a process worthy of this institution, for more than 2,000 earmarks to come to the floor, and no time, no time--it will come to the floor probably the same day that we vote on it--for this body to appropriately scrutinize it, and for every Predator or worthy earmark that you can point to, you can probably point to a dozen where shirts were earmarked that melt on a soldier's body, but somebody in their district just wanted them.

   Mr. FLAKE. I would simply say that the gentleman mentioned that he believes in disclosure, and if a person puts an earmark in, he should be able to withstand the heat that might come from it. The problem with this process is there's no opportunity for that to happen. I offered four amendments. I was given one. In an appropriations bill of more than 2,000 earmarks, how many can you really do? How many can you challenge. 
   That is why we have had so many problems over the last couple of years with bad earmarks, is there's simply no way to adequately vet them. There were 36,000 earmark requests before the appropriations committee last year, and no way to vet them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, you know, we just heard the gentleman, the majority leader, say the public expects us to act as adults, not as partisan protagonists. That, I certainly hope, is the case. And let me draw attention not to the farm bill portion of the rule but to the defense authorization portion of this rule. 
   As Members of this body know, over the last couple of years I have brought more than 100 amendments to the floor to strike particular earmarks. Not once, not once on one bill did I target just Democrat earmarks or Republican earmarks. Earmarking is a bipartisan problem. We have a former Member of this body in jail today because we didn't do proper vetting and oversight on earmarks that came through the committee process or just through the appropriations process and then sailed through the floor. That same thing is happening today. 
   There are more than 500 earmarks in this bill. I'm told that Members of the minority party weren't even given the list during the markup. So there was never any opportunity to challenge those earmarks or to even find out what they are. Now we get the list, and when I submit amendments to be offered to strike the particular earmarks, I'm given one. I offered four: two Democrat earmarks, two Republican earmarks. And the only earmark amendment made in order was one challenging one Republican earmark. 
   Now, we just heard that the public expects us to act as adults, not as partisan protagonists. I spoke to the majority leader this morning. I asked him to please rectify this problem. I asked him to please just make in order one of the Democratic earmarks. He said he would work at it. 
   I know this isn't the proper forum. We can't ask for unanimous consent. This is for debate only. But if we really want to act as adults and not partisan protagonists, then we can't treat this earmark debate as a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It's our problem. 
   And I would urge a ``no'' vote on the rule unless it's corrected.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman that just spoke talked about how the committee had done so well with such limited resources and makes it sound like this is positively a skinflint bill, that we're just making do with what we have. 
   The truth is we are well over the President's budget that he submitted. Let me just give people a flavor for what's in this bill. This is just a slice of the 150 pages of earmarks, more than 1,000 earmarks that were in this bill, 21 of them air-dropped last night that we had no idea were here until today, but here is just an example of some of them in the House-passed version: 
   There is $100,000 for the Crystal Lake Art Center in Frankfort, Michigan; $750,000 to the Detroit Science Center in Detroit, Michigan; $300,000 for the Houston zoo; $200,000 for the Huntsville Museum of Art in Huntsville, Alabama; $100,000 for the Los Angeles Fashion District in Los Angeles, California; $150,000 for the Louis Armstrong House Museum in Flushing, New York; $50,000 for the National Mule and Packers Museum in Bishop, California; $150,000 to the Renaissance Art Center, Inc., in Rupert, Idaho; $200,000 to the Fruitvale Cultural and Performing Arts Center in Oakland, California; $100,000 for the 1924 Vaudeville Theater in Plattsburgh, New York; $200,000 for the Hunting and Fishing Museum of Pennsylvania; $100,000 for the Lincoln Museum in Hodgenville, Kentucky.

   Mr. FLAKE. No. These were all in the House version, the House version that we had just a couple of days to digest, and we were only able to offer in reality few amendments in keeping with the comity of the House. 
   This shouldn't substitute for real vetting or real scrutiny when you have earmarks like this. And particularly, I didn't mention and I could read the 21 air-dropped earmarks, the ones that were put in last night that because the majority has waived the rules, we have no ability to actually challenge. We don't know if these earmarks are meritorious or not because they were air-dropped in last night. I'm reading these that were in the House-passed version of the bill. 
   Let me read through a few more and maybe this will clarify it: $150,000 for the Atlanta Botanical Gardens in Atlanta, Georgia; $275,000 for the Berkshire Music Hall in Pittsfield, Massachusetts; $400,000 to the Bel Alton High School Alumni Association in Maryland; $500,000 for the Los Angeles County Fire Museum in Bellflower, California.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Speaker. 
   And while the Speaker of the House is actually in the Chamber, I want to read a quote from March of this year. In March of this year, the Speaker of the House said, ``Before Members vote on a bill, there should be an appropriate time for people to read it. That should be a matter of public record. If there is an earmark that can stand the scrutiny, then that transparency will give the opportunity for it to be there.'' 
   Let me just ask, if I can, the representative from the Rules Committee, don't we have a rule that says that we are not to consider a bill or a rule until 24 hours after the bill is actually out there? I would yield to the gentleman to answer. 
   My understanding is that this bill was posted on the Web last night at just after 7 o'clock, yet here we are at 1:35 already considering the rule. I think that is important, because when you look at the bill, we didn't just get it on the Internet where it would be searchable, where we could find things in it. We got a PDF file that is not searchable. 
   When you look at the bill itself, you find complete sections that have been X'd out, or little insertions with little notations here that are barely legible. You have another big insertion here of an entire page. Again, there are little insertions there within the insertion. You have within it ``3 percent'' stricken. It says ``4 percent'' now. To what? 
   This is really difficult to wade through. And when we don't even get 24 hours? I mean, 24 hours, frankly, is far from sufficient to consider a bill that is 531 pages long. Then when you consider the bill itself is not searchable, it was given in a PDF file, and then you also have 141 pages of earmarks that are part of the report. That is not a searchable index, either. It is just given. You can wade through it. 
   The earmarks that are air-dropped into the conference report are supposed to be asterisked. You can see some of those. We identified 21. But is that all there is? We're not sure. But when you look through that list of earmarks that were air-dropped in, you have to be suspicious of why in the world we waited until now to air-drop these earmarks in when nobody can challenge them. 
   Keep in mind, this is a point of order against consideration of the rule. Because the majority has chosen to waive the rule against points of order on the bill, we can't challenge any of the earmarks in the bill, so we have 21 earmarks air-dropped into the bill at the last minute that we have no ability to challenge. 
   You might think that, well, if they were air-dropped into the bill, then they certainly must be vital spending, vital projects, that we just couldn't do during the regular consideration of the bill. 
   I will read a couple of them and you can make your own decisions on whether or not this was vital spending, something that couldn't wait, something that was so important that you had to, at the last minute, in the last 24 hours, include it in where nobody could see it. 
   One is for $200,000 for the Intergenerational Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia, for a community center. The Intergenerational Research Center, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia, for a community center. This is part of the Economic Development Initiative. 
   Another one: Waynesburg College Center for Economic Development in Pennsylvania for a multipurpose facility. That is $300,000 there. 
   Tell me, please, somebody tell me, what was so vital here that we had to violate the rules that we have had in the House to insert this at the last minute, when nobody has the ability to challenge it? 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Well, we've waived other requirements as well here. What this point of order is about is transparency. Again, we got this bill last night, less than 24 hours ago. It has always been the understanding you would have at least 24 hours, and we are violating that even. 
   When you look at the bill itself, here I found another page, section 409, we're not sure what was there, because it is now gone. It is gone from the bill. It is very difficult to go through a bill that is 534 pages that is not even searchable and wade through the earmarks. 
   The gentleman mentioned this is vital spending we have to get done. Let me give you an example of some of what is in the bill itself. $150,000 for the Atlanta Botanical Gardens in Atlanta, Georgia. $275,000 for the Berkshire Music Hall in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for that clarification. 
   Let me get back to this list of these vital projects that we somehow have to rush through here. There is $400,000 for the Bel Alton High School Alumni Association in Bel Alton, Maryland. Again, $400,000 for the Bel Alton High School Alumni Association. Why in the world is this in the bill at all? Is it any wonder that somebody wants to move this bill through quickly and without following the rules?     
   $500,000 for the Los Angeles Fire Museum in Bellflower, California; two earmarks totaling $300,000 to revitalize downtown Clearwater, Florida; $150,000 for the Edmunds Arts Center in Edmunds, Washington; $100,000 for Cooters Pond Park in Prattville, Alabama; $100,000 for the reuse of the Coca-Cola Bottling Plant in Romney, West Virginia; $100,000 for the Crystal Lake Art Center in Frankfort, Michigan; $750,000 to the Detroit Science Center in Detroit, Michigan; and $300,000 to the Houston, Zoo in Houston, Texas. 
   Again, this is just a tiny sliver of the 141 pages of earmarks in the bill, more than 1,000 of them. And again, 21 air-dropped earmarks that we have never  seen before, never had the ability to challenge on the House floor for such vital things as the Grand Teton National Park Pathway System in Wyoming. This may be a good project, but it should receive the scrutiny it deserves, not air-dropped into a report that we are given less than 24 hours to consider, that we have no ability, none, to amend out. 
   Or $500,000 for Park Street Streetscape Improvement in Alameda, California. Why in the world was this that vital where we had to violate our own rules to bring this to the floor and hide these earmarks where they don't see the light of day?

   Mr. FLAKE. In my remaining 30 seconds, let me just say, in January when we passed transparency rules on earmarks, I was the first one to compliment the majority on what they had done. We put some decent rules into play. But rules are only as good as your willingness to enforce them. And we have seen a pattern over the past several months culminating in this kind of thing, breaking the rules so we can bring a bill to the floor with 21 air-dropped earmarks into it where we are simply not following our own rules. 
   This institution deserves better than this. I plead with my colleagues to vote to stop this bill from moving forward until we can actually see what's in it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, among the many downsides of earmarking and one that we rarely talk about on the House floor is the practice of circular fundraising. Campaign donations are given to Members, Members secure earmarks benefiting their contributors, and contributors in turn are able to give Members more donations. This cycle is repeated over and over and over. 
   Unfortunately, this is a bipartisan practice. The media has reported on many such arrangements for Members on both sides of the aisle. Legal issues aside, circular fundraising does not pass the smell test. 
   Whether it is fair or not, the crimes of a few of our former colleagues have cast suspicion over us all. Continued rampant fundraising is simply not worth the trust it costs us with our constituents. I think that most of us had higher aspirations when we came here than groveling for crumbs that fall from the appropriators' table. I hope that we as Members of Congress will finally decide that enough is enough.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. We're often accused of, when a rule comes up, of bringing up something that doesn't relate to the rule at all or speaking on something completely different. I'm here because something has been added to this rule that shouldn't be in this rule at all that bears no relation to this rule.     
   In this rule, for a bill on credit cards, there was an attachment which would allow the chairman of the Armed Services Committee to insert a joint explanatory statement for the defense authorization act, that he would be allowed to file that at any time between now and the end of the 110th Congress. That's important because in the joint explanatory statement is when you learn sometimes about what earmarks have been added to the bill, and you're supposed to get that report and that explanation and statement before you consider the bill on the floor. 
   We will be considering the bill on the floor later today or tomorrow, I guess, under a suspension of the rules with no ability to amend or to question anything in the defense authorization bill. That bill, when it came to the House floor earlier this year, contained more than 500 earmarks. 
   This is the defense authorization bill that we learned of just a day before it came to the floor. It came to the floor under a closed rule--or under a rule which allowed me to offer just one amendment--more than 500 earmarks, one amendment. There were a lot of Democratic earmarks; there were a lot of Republican earmarks. The majority saw fit to only allow me to question one Republican earmark. No coincidence there. 
   And yet even worse--at least then we knew when the bill came to the floor we really couldn't do anything about it, but we knew which earmarks were in the bill. Now there's a possibility that there could be dozens, hundreds, maybe 10, we don't know. We don't know how many earmarks have been air-dropped into this legislation, or if any have, and we likely won't know--we just don't know because this rule on a credit card bill allows the chairman of the Armed Services Committee to file at any time between now and the end of the 110th Congress which earmarks were in the bill. 
   Theoretically, the President could even sign this legislation in a couple of weeks or a couple of months, and we would only learn after that what earmarks were in the bill or those earmarks, theoretically, could even be added after the President signs the bill into law. I don't know how that could be stopped under this rule. 
   I just wonder how the majority--and I would love to yield time to the Rules Committee to explain how we are doing this, how this squares with the statements earlier this year or earlier this Congress that, according to the majority, according to the Speaker of the House, we will bring transparency and openness to the budget process into the use of earmarks. 
   I would be glad to yield 30 seconds to the Rules Committee to explain why this provision was added to the rule.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman. 
   We're being asked to take--it is our understanding that this will happen. We're probably to understand that, yeah, they'll file something before we do a suspension bill that we couldn't amend or question even if we didn't like what was in there. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker and Members here, this just doesn't square with the commitments that we have made on both sides of the aisle to have an open and transparent process. Like I said, it's bad enough to just learn before bills come to the floor that you've had a couple hundred earmarks added. But in this case, we're giving the authority to the authorizing committee to let us know about which air-dropped earmarks have been added after we pass the bill, after it's too late; theoretically, after the President even signs the legislation.

   Mr. FLAKE. Here, like I said, we're being asked to give authority to actually not explain which earmarks have been added until after the bill has passed. I just can't see how that represents good government in any sense, how in the world we can say that we are having an open and transparent process when we have bills that come like this. 
   Now with prior bills, we had a defense authorization bill that came to the floor a while ago that we only got the list of earmarks that were added after the deadline passed to file amendments to actually strike those earmarks. 
   So we have had a number of these cases throughout this Congress. But I can tell you nothing compares to this. Nothing compares to having an unrelated provision added to a credit card rule, a rule to a bill to allow the authorizing Committee of Armed Services to, up to the end of this Congress, to wait a couple of months after the bill passes--after a bill that was passed under suspension of rules, I might add--to add an explanation as to which earmarks are in the bill. 
   So I just want to register my objection there, and I would hope that Members would vote down this rule. We can't do business like this, particularly at a time when we have a financial meltdown, we have legislation on the floor this week to spend $700 billion. If that's not bad enough, here we have a situation where we're simply hiding--I don't know how else to say it--but hiding what we have done in the committees and on the floor and not letting Members of this body actually exercise the responsibility that we have here. 
   With that, I register my objection. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the budget resolution. We have received repeated warnings about Medicare and Social Security, that they are on their way to insolvency. I think we all know that. In fact, CBO recently projected that Social Security will begin to pay out more than it takes in by the year 2020, and at the same time Medicare spending will likely double over the next 10 years. 
   But inexplicably, this budget does nothing. It contains no action over the next 5 years to change this course. Instead, it would allow the unfunded liabilities of both of these programs to grow from almost $39 trillion today to about $52 trillion by 2013. That is a 2 to $3 trillion increase every year. This means that over the next 5 years alone,  every American household will be responsible for more than $450,000 to keep these programs functioning as is. 
   We can't ignore this ever-increasing, this massive problem. I have seen reports, press reports, that Medicare and Social Security aren't the priorities anymore. I would submit that, if we don't start working on a real solution, the taxpayers will quickly see either drastic cuts to their benefits or a spike in their taxes, unless we change the trend that we have. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am disappointed that instead of confronting this issue, we are again burying our heads in the sand. It is not realistic. We can't continue to do this. It is a huge disservice to everyone in this country. I must oppose this budget. 
   Also let me say, it is not just the level of spending that is problematic; it is the type of spending. We have had a lot of arguments lately about earmarking. This budget, the Democratic budget, does nothing to change the practice. Last year we had some $15 billion spent on earmarks, and a lot of those earmarks were never vetted on the House floor. In fact, the vast majority of them, 99 percent of them, were never given a thorough vetting on the House floor, and, in fact, about a billion dollars, just under a billion dollars was spent on earmarks that were air-dropped into the conference reports that never got any vetting at all, that was never subject to any House decision. That is nearly $1 billion. But what do we have in this budget to prevent that? Nothing. Nothing. We are on track to do it again or perhaps even worse. 
   We have got to do better, both on the level of spending and the type of spending that we are doing. In Congress, we have had a process for centuries called authorization, appropriation, and oversight, and over the past several years we have gotten away from that. Instead, we do very little authorizing, a lot of appropriating, and very, very little oversight. 
   There is nothing in this budget to change that process. We are doing the same. And the Democrats will say, hey, over the past several years you Republicans have done wrong as well. And we have. That is the biggest reason we are here in the minority today. But at least you could say it took Republicans awhile to get to this point. In the meantime, there were balanced budgets. There was the reformation of welfare. There were some good things that happened. Then we got fiscally lazy and we started having budgets much like this, and the voters turned us out, as I would suggest they will do to the majority party, who got into this much more quickly than Republicans did. 
   I hope that they change. I would like nothing more than to support a good budget here, but this is not, and I would urge my colleagues to reject it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to once again make the case that earmarking is out of control in these bills. 
   This Defense bill that we are discussing tonight has more than 1,300 earmarks. The notion that this was adequately vetted and scrubbed, that these earmarks had proper review is simply not reasonable. There is no way they could have in this short amount of time. 
   When you read through this bill, you have to chuckle at the creative way that some of these projects have been cast in order to appear that there is some defense application. 
   Just to highlight a couple, there is one earmark in here for a cold weather hand protection system. What could that be? That is a glove to you and me, sold at any outdoor outfitters store. But in here, it is a cold weather hand protection system, and we are going to be giving an earmark to a private company to sell gloves. 
   There are more. There is another earmark for a light-weight foam sleep pad project. What is that? It sounds like nothing more than a mattress. It is one that self-inflates that scouts have been using for years and years and years. And yet we are giving an earmark to a private company to provide it to the Defense Department. Why are we doing that? There are 1,300 earmarks in this bill, many of them like this. 
   Let me get to the first one I am challenging tonight. 
   This amendment would prohibit $2.5 million from being used to restore the parade ground in the center of the Presidio's Main Post, and reduce funding for the overall bill by a consistent amount. This is just one of a long parade of earmarks in the bill. 
   The Presidio is located in San Francisco, one of the oldest continuously used military posts in the Nation. In 1996, Congress turned the bulk of the Presidio, including the large Main Post area, over to a congressionally chartered nonprofit organization called The Presidio Trust to be managed with the National Park Service. 
   In a unique arrangement, the main objective is to achieve financial self-sufficiency by the year 2013 largely by renting out housing and leasing land to businesses. It has been quite successful in this. The San Francisco Chronicle noted last year the Presidio was becoming a scenic enclave where only the well-healed need apply with some houses being rented for more than $4,000 a month. That is high, even by California standards. 
   This earmark raises a number of troubling questions, not the least of which is why an earmark for a park managed in partnership with the National Park Service is receiving an earmark in the Defense Appropriations bill. The Defense Appropriations bill, I think we all agree, is for the troops. Yet here we are bleeding off funds to spend money on an earmark that has been funded in prior bills for a project managed with the National Park Service. I am sure taxpayers would like to hear a good explanation for this. Why are we doing it in the Defense bill? 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I would yield to the gentleman if he would tell us who the sponsor of the earmark is. 
   Well, I guess I will since he won't. The sponsor is the Speaker of the House, and I would hope that the sponsor of the earmark would come and defend this. Why are we earmarking defense dollars for a project managed in cooperation with the National Park Service, a project that is receiving millions and millions of dollars from the outside in a very high-rent district in San Francisco. That doesn't seem right, yet we are doing it. 
   And this is indicative of a lot of the earmarks that are going into this bill. It is perhaps not surprising that there isn't much of a defense for this. But I would think even if it is nearly 11 on the last day of the session that the taxpayers deserve a little better than this. 
   I have a few more earmarks and we will talk a little more about this. But it just seems wrong when you come up with high-sounding words to make the earmarks sound like they are more important. 
   I started thinking that if this podium right here were described in the defense bill, it would be referred to as a multipurpose, ad hoc self-generating, voice-projection platform. Or this pen might be a stenographic multi-functional polymer language communication system. 
   If you name things like this, you might get funding in this defense bill. And people might laugh, but we do it year after year after year, and it grows. People will point out that there are fewer earmarks in this bill than there were in the past couple of years. That is true, and it is a good thing. But it is still too much. 
   How can we exercise proper oversight when we are spending money like this?

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Chair. That last discussion was remarkable, just remarkable. 
   I would gladly yield time to anybody who agrees with the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that, one, that these earmarks are competitively bid. Anybody in agreement here; or, two, that the U.S. taxpayer, after paying for these earmarks, has rights to the technology that developed these earmarks. 
   Any takers there? I didn't think so. 
   I think that is simply wrong. That is simply wrong. 
   An earmark, by very definition, is a sole source contract. It is circumventing the competitive bidding process. 
   Maybe you don't like what the bureaucrats over in the Defense Department do, but to say that this is a competitively bid contract is simply wrong. To say that the U.S. taxpayer has rights to the technology developed with the companies that are getting these earmarks, is simply wrong as well. 
   If anybody can contradict, please take time. But let's not defend these earmarks on that basis when that's simply wrong. 
   Any way, let's get to this one. 
   This earmark, I am sorry, this amendment would eliminate $1 million for the Marine Desalination Systems, Inc., in St. Petersburg, Florida, for atmospheric water harvesting and reduce the cost of the bill by a corresponding amount. 
   The earmark described in the certification letter submitted to the committee by the sponsor informs us that this earmark would be used to fund lightweight, low power expeditionary water production. 
   According to the Web site of the entity, Marine Desalination Systems is a corporation that develops new technologies to create inexpensive, potable water, to bring to market. 
   Again, I have the same issue that the last gentleman to offer amendments did, the gentleman from California. Why are we singling out this one company for this project or this earmark? 
   I would ask similar questions to the ones he asked, but these, I think, are more in the defense speak that goes with the language in this bill. 
   Was this project palmed, which means, is it a program of memorandum? I would ask the sponsor that. 
   Is it on any unfunded requirement list? Number 3, does any operator in the field say that we need this particular program or technology from this particular company? I would love to hear the answer to any of those questions from the sponsor of the earmark. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike all funding in the bill for Concurrent Technologies Corporation. 
   As you may recall, I offered an amendment last month during consideration of the Energy and Water appropriations bill to cut funding for something called the Center for Instrumental Critical Infrastructure in Pennsylvania. We did not know whether the center existed. I had a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee in that time. But we learned that the money is actually going to Concurrent Technologies Corporation based in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Concurrent Technologies has been a leading earmark recipient in multiple appropriations bills over the years. 
   In the Energy and Water bill, Concurrent received $1 million in earmarked funds. In this bill, Concurrent is due to receive $11 million in the form of four earmarks. 
   Concurrent Technologies was the focus of an October 2, 2006, story in the New York Times titled, ``Trading Boats for Pork Across the House Aisle.'' According to the article, Concurrent Technologies Corporation was created by an earmark in 1988. Back then, the corporation was called the Center for Excellence in Metalworking. 
   The New York Times stated that the military and other Federal agencies have paid Concurrent nearly $1 billion in grants and contracts since 1999. That is $1 billion in taxpayer funds to an entity created with an earmark. That does not include the $12 million Concurrent is receiving in earmarks this year alone. 
   Concurrent Technologies Corporation is an earmark incubator. It was created by an earmark to get more earmarks. Without earmarks, this corporation, I think it is safe to say, would not exist. 
   The president of the corporation, Mr. DeVos, was quoted in the local paper saying that the sponsor has ``impressed upon the area's defense industries leaders the need to wean themselves from this aid.'' 
   Mr. DeVos and the sponsor of the earmark have a funny way of weaning Concurrent off of Federal earmarks. The sponsor has secured $11 million more for Concurrent in this bill alone. In addition, The Washington Post reported that Mr. DeVos and his company have spent $820,000 in fees to a lobby firm seeking more Federal aid. 
   I would ask the sponsor of this earmark to confirm what has been reported. With regard to the defense industry's needing to wean themselves off this aid, when is that weaning going to occur? Can we assure Members of this body that there will be no more earmarks to Concurrent Technologies? Can Concurrent Technologies survive without Federal Member-sponsored earmarks? 
   I look forward to receiving answers to these questions. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. The gentleman correctly stated that Concurrent has been given some Federal contracts. Then, why in the world did they need this earmark? If they are getting Federal contracts through some kind of bidding process, then why do they need continued earmarks? Which, as I mentioned, are by their very definition sole-source contracts, no-bid contracts, where we are specifying an individual firm, a business in this case, that hires a lobbyist, $820,000 paid to a lobbyist to get more Federal funds. 
   Where does it end? Is this any kind of process or system that we can be proud of, with these earmark incubators that survive just by getting more earmarks? I mean, how can we do that? If every district in this country had those kinds of earmark incubators, every account in the U.S. Federal Government would be earmarked, I would venture to say. 
   So I would say we simply have to stop this somewhere. I urge support for the amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike $1.5 million in funding in the bill for the Doyle Center for Manufacturing Technology. The Doyle Center, which is a monument to its sponsor, is an earmark incubator, much like Concurrent Technologies, a center created out of earmarks for the sole objective for obtaining more Federal contracts or earmarks. 
   The center is a sister organization to a number of earmarks incubators like Concurrent Technologies, which is an entity, as mentioned before, receiving $11 million in earmark funds in the bill. 
   How do we know that there is a symbiotic relationship between Concurrent Technologies and the Doyle Center? For one thing, the chairman of the board of the Doyle Center is the senior vice president and chief financial officer of Concurrent Technologies. We also know that the Doyle Center and Concurrent Technologies work closely together on projects funded through earmarks. It is no surprise that they share the same leadership. 
   According to a recent article in The Hill, the creation of the Doyle Center is adding another layer to three nonprofit organizations devoted to a similar mission of helping spur economic development in the area, the Pennsylvania Technology Council, Pittsburgh  Technology Council, and the Catalyst Connection. The article in The Hill stated that all four groups share the same address and many of the same officers. 
   In addition, the Doyle Center handed over a large portion of its earmark money in 2004 to the Catalyst Connection for research. These funds came from a portion of a larger $1.36 million earmark that make up the center's entire budget for that year. 
   Just think of that. We are giving an earmark to a center that is funded completely with taxpayer dollars with the goal of receiving more taxpayer dollars. 
   A certification letter for the project says that $1.5 million in earmark money will go toward the Doyle Center. But with all these groups sharing the same address, the same money, the same officers, do we really know where the money is going? 
   So my answer to the sponsor to the earmark is as follows: Is the money going to the Doyle Center, the Pittsburgh Technology Council, the Catalyst Content, Connect, or the Concurrent Technologies? 
   I urge the adoption of the amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman. I don't remember mentioning the RSC, but I appreciate the illumination. But let me just ask the Member, he has talked about the process by which these grants are given. 
   Let me just note, he mentioned earlier that every one of these was scrubbed by the Appropriations Committee. We had a manager's amendment that actually removed some and then put the money back somewhere else. One in particular that I had planned to actually challenge here was called the Advanced Robotic Vehicle Command and Control. I had an earlier version apparently of what came, and it was removed in a manager's amendment in committee. But then the money was taken, that same money, and given to the same Member for another earmark sponsored by that Member entitled Big Foot Airborne Receiver.     
   So the money went from that one just to another earmark sponsored by that same Member to plus that one up. 
   What kind of process does the committee go through? Is it that every Member is allotted a certain amount, or is it what they think the Defense Department needs? 
   I would be glad to yield to the Member.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, there is a story in the paper yesterday that mentioned how much of the funding is in this bill, and the gentleman mentioned that sometimes it is not completely accurate because the Defense Department will ask for things that are then listed as an earmark to the Member. I understand that it is not a perfect count. But still senior members of the Appropriations Committee were given up to $150 million in earmarks when other rank-and-file Members got maybe a million or 2. 
   Are there more needs in certain districts? Is it spread out? How does that process go? What confidence should we have as Members voting to fund these earmarks that it is on some kind of basis that bears any relationship to what the Defense Department needs rather than political calculation? 
   I would be glad to yield to the gentleman. 
   All right. I guess I will accept that as an answer. But let me just say, with regard to the Doyle Center, I would have hoped that the sponsor of the earmark would come and talk about it. But here is another example, as I mentioned, of an earmark incubator where an earmark creates an organization, in this case, named after one of our own, and the same one who it is named after gets more earmarks year after year for the same center to get more earmarks and more Federal contracts. 
   We simply can't sustain that. The notion that that is what the Defense Department needs simply doesn't hold water. With that, I urge adoption of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a little different from the others. The others would strike funding from the bill. This would simply redirect funding to the same account from which it was drawn. 
   This amendment would redirect $3 million from the Lewis Center for Educational Research to the Family Advocacy Programs in the Operations and Maintenance account. 
   Mr. Chairman, it seems that we are debating the Labor-HHS bill rather than the Defense appropriations bill.  Why is there a $3 million earmark in the bill for an organization with a stated goal of providing ``an opportunity for students to experience real science; to learn that science is an ongoing process, not just memorizing facts?'' I am referring, of course, to this earmark for the Lewis Center for Educational Research. 
   This is becoming somewhat of an annual earmark. In fact, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste database, this educational center has received earmarks in past Defense appropriation bills ranging from $2.5 million to $3.5 million in every fiscal year since 2003. According to the certification letter submitted by the sponsor, ``the funding would be used to develop on-line educational curriculum.'' The Lewis Center for Educational research is an ``educational facility designed to improve educational effectiveness and scientific literacy among American schoolchildren.'' According to its Web site, since opening in 1990, the Lewis Center has provided hands-on instructional programs for elementary, middle, and high school students throughout local communities and across the Nation. 
   I would ask the same questions here. Why are we providing an earmark that is to a school that is sponsored by groups like Target, Wal-Mart, Verizon, Boeing, State Farm Insurance, Southern California Edison, Lucent Technologies, and others? 
   This is to a school; this is a defense bill. I simply would ask why is it here in the defense bill? How does it serve our national defense? What essential Federal purpose does it serve? Should it receive any earmark funding at all? And certainly not, I would say, in a defense bill. 
   And then the notion that this is actually taken out of an account for Family Advocacy Programs in the Operations and Maintenance account. I would think that, given the needs that the families of our troops have, that that money would be better left in that account for that purpose than to go to what I think is a charter school for other purposes. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I would simply reiterate what we are talking about here. This is a charter school that, although it has been spoken of as serving military families, it has no more of a mission to serve military families, I would suggest, than the school that my kids go to. There are military families there. But I would not presume to give an earmark to that school simply because military families might attend that school. There is nothing in the literature that we have been able to find anywhere in this school that has any specific purpose to serve military families.

   Mr. FLAKE. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, again, I would say that this is a charter school receiving money in the defense bill that has no more military application than any school that any of your kids or grandkids go to, and yet we are doing it. Does that have a military application? I would suggest not. And the notion that we can talk about this earmark that turned into something good or that one, but for every one of those, I would suggest that there is a company out there that would love to bid on one of these contracts that isn't given the opportunity, a company that might have technology that might turn into something good, but they can't compete because an earmark is given as a sole-source contract to another company. There are hundreds of them in this bill. 
   Again, an earmark is not a competitively bid project. It is a sole-source contract. 
   I urge adoption of the amendment.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would eliminate $39 million in Federal taxpayer dollars for the National Drug Intelligence Center, a project that U.S. News and World Report called ``a boondoggle.'' This amendment would also reduce the cost of the bill by a commensurate amount. 
   There are a number of reasons to support this amendment; primary among these is the fact that we should not spend our scarce intelligence dollars on wasteful and duplicative programs like the National Drug Intelligence Center. 
   This earmark has been part of a growing list of intelligence, or so-called ``black earmarks.'' I think a lot of us have long been skeptical of the practice of earmarking Intelligence accounts, and several of us have repeatedly called for the abolition of this practice. We really didn't start earmarking the Intelligence bill until, I think, around the late - nineties. And it has not gone well for us, as we know with the case of Mr. Cunningham, now serving time. 
   It is important to note that the practice of earmarking only began really in this case in the Intelligence bill in the 1990s. 
   Let me repeat, we shouldn't be earmarking the Intelligence bill this way. This was authorized in the Intelligence bill. There was an amendment offered at the time to strike it. 
   Many of us have been troubled, as I mentioned, with this kind of earmarking. Many of us have asked to see the unclassified version of the report that was commissioned by the Intelligence Committee about Mr. Cunningham and his ability to get Intelligence earmarks. I have not been able to get that report, an unclassified report. I, as a Member of Congress, have been denied that report, and so have all of you. That is simply not right. 
   The Los Angeles Times reported a couple of weeks ago, as did the Associated Press, that they had received a copy of that report, but Members of Congress have not. Yet, we still continue with the practice of earmarking Intelligence bills. 
   When we did the authorization bill, we didn't receive the list of earmarks in that bill until it was past time to offer amendments to the Rules Committee to strike those earmarks. So we haven't had that opportunity. 
   Let me say that we cannot continue to go down this road, particularly with earmarks that have been called ``duplicative and wasteful.'' The administration has tried for years to get rid of this National Drug Center. In fact, they offered $16 million in one of these bills to shut that center down; yet, still, it keeps coming back and back and back.

I didn't believe that FISA should be inserted where it hasn't been inserted already, but I do believe FISA should govern foreign surveillance when it comes in contact with an American.

That's how we learned that there were abuses going on in the national security letter division or department. But I am convinced by the testimony that I have heard, the briefings that I have gone to, that we do need to move forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring another aspect for sustaining the President's veto that hasn't been talked about yet. 
   When this bill was brought to the floor initially, there were some 26 earmarks in the legislation. First we were told there are no earmarks. Then we had kind of a wild goose chase up in the intelligence room to find if there were. We found out there actually were. Then we finally got a list, belatedly. We got the list of earmarks, I think, about 5 hours after the deadline for us to submit a list of earmarks that we wanted to challenge. How convenient was that? 
   And we were told, No, it is just procedural, but too late. You won't be able to offer any amendments. We were told at the beginning of the process this year that every earmark that was offered in a piece of legislation in a conference report, in a committee report would be able to be challenged on the House floor. That wasn't the case here. We had 20-some earmarks worth about $80 million that were never challenged that still, to this day, cannot, have not, will not be challenged by this House. 
   So that, for the process alone, we shouldn't go forward with this piece of legislation. 
   These weren't just any earmarks. One, $80 million worth; and, two, there were big earmarks like $23 million for the National Drug Intelligence Center. This is a center that the President has been trying to shut down for years because it doesn't coordinate efforts as it should. It gets, I think, about $39 million in the underlying bill and another $21 million in earmarked money in this piece of legislation. That's $23 million in taxpayer dollars in this piece of legislation. That's $62 million in taxpayer funding for an entity that the President and the executive branch want to close down, but it happens to be in the district of a particular powerful Member, so it stays. Again, we weren't able to challenge that. 
   That led, as we all know, to an altercation on the House floor between a few Members, a privileged resolution that was offered, but still, that earmark remains. All of these earmarks that still haven't been able to be challenged by the House remain in this piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, if there was ever, ever a case study in why we need an earmark moratorium, it is this piece of legislation that we are dealing with right now. No matter what you do, the earmarks remain. We even had a motion to instruct offered by my colleague from Michigan to take the earmarks in this bill out, remove them because they haven't been challenged, and they weren't brought to the floor in the proper manner.     
   That motion to instruct passed with a vote of 249 votes in favor. A sufficient number of Republicans and a significant number of Democrats voted for that motion to instruct to take the earmarks out, but here we are with this piece of legislation here again today, and every one of those earmarks still remains. You can't take them out. 
   We have to have a moratorium on earmarks so we can address this process. You can have good rules. And I commended the Democrats when they put the rules in place in January of this year. I mentioned that I thought that they were, in fact, a little stronger than what we, as Republicans, had put there. Having said that, rules are only as good as your willingness to enforce them, and the rules were not enforced here. 
   Again, this legislation came to the floor with earmarks that we were never able to challenge, that came after the deadline when we were to submit the list to challenge. And then the House acted, we acted to address, and with a clear, sufficient majority said, let's take the earmarks out. But still they remained. 
   I urge us all to sustain the President's veto of this legislation.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to the GIVE Act. I think that it has as its premise that we won't have volunteerism in America unless we pay for it somehow or unless this body comes up with it. The volunteerism represented by AmeriCorps and the other programs here represent, I would venture, about one hundredth of 1 percent of all of the voluntary activity that goes on out there. But here we act as if it won't happen unless we create it and pay for it. 
   Paid volunteerism is not a very good principle, in my view. We have to remember we are running a deficit. Our Federal Government is running a deficit. So any money we pay here, any increase in any programs, any new authorization, which I think over the 5-year reauthorization is about $4.1 billion more than we were paying before, that's money that has to be borrowed from the Treasury and, in effect, borrowed from our kids. 
   And I think it's prudent to ask what this is going to be used for. I think that most people would be surprised to learn that this legislation would expand and reauthorize programs that the Office of Management and Budget has rated as inefficient and ineffective. For example, the Learn and Serve Program was rated as not performing and results not demonstrated by the OMB. The AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps was rated as not performing and ineffective. 
   It's bad enough that we are continuing funding, but under the Learn and Serve Program, that was rated again by the OMB as not performing and results not demonstrated, we are actually creating a new program within that and funding it with 20 million more dollars. That simply is not a prudent use of taxpayer dollars. 
   We have to remember we are taking money from people who are working and giving it to others who are supposedly volunteering to work. When you are providing a financial incentive, be it defrayment of tuition costs or anything else, you are paying people to volunteer. 
   I would urge my colleagues to reject this legislation and return to fiscal sanity and a little more fiscal discipline in this House.

   And I want to thank the President for vetoing this bill. We Republicans promised a new era of fiscal responsibility, and I don't think it is very fiscally responsible to add $750 million in earmarks in the conference report alone. 
   The Senate passed a $14 billion WRDA bill. The House passed a $15 billion WRDA bill. And when the conference came back, you would think that they would split the difference, maybe 14.5. But, no, it came back at $23 billion. So $14 billion, $15 billion, you compromise and you get $23 billion. There is something wrong with this picture. 
   So I think we should sustain the President's veto. We need to be fiscally responsible not just with appropriations but with authorizations as well. We simply can't continue to add to the backlog of projects that are already out there. It will simply mean that more will go unfinished and priorities will be diverted off into doing studies that will never be done.

A cursory look through the more than 150 pages of earmarks in the conference report reveals such earmarks as $320,000 for the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City, Missouri; $130,000 for the First Ladies Museum in Canton, Ohio; $85,000 for the Los Angeles Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, California. 
   But beyond taking exception to the bill, I raise this point of order as the only means available to highlight the alarming trend toward opaqueness rather than transparency. Rather than allow for a full debate on whether this conference report complies with the earmark rule, this rule actually prevents it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have a little experience challenging earmarks on the floor. It's not been a pleasant experience at times. We don't know much of what are in these bills that get to the conference. And then when you have a conference report that comes with earmarks air-dropped into it after that, and you only get that bill just a few hours before you vote on it, then I think it behooves us to slow down a bit and say what are we doing here. 
   I should note that when I challenged earmarks in the House version of the bill, on one occasion we had an earmark withdrawn before the earmark amendment could be offered because there was a problem with the earmark.     
   In other cases we had the Committee on Appropriations go to the Rules Committee and actually withdraw some of the amendments before they could be challenged. So it is obvious that these earmarks have not been vetted through the process very well, and those are the earmarks that actually went through the House process. 
   We have here at least nine, nine that are identified, nine earmarks that were air-dropped that were not either part of the House or the Senate version. Mr. Speaker, this just is not a good practice. 
   One example of the air-dropped earmarks that we just found out about just hours ago, $1 million for the Thomas Daschle Center for Public Service and Representative Democracy. Now, if we are air-dropping amendments like that into this bill, what else is in the bill? We really haven't had time to go through it. Outside groups are trying to go through this bill and simply haven't had the time. And you are going to have problems; we are going to be learning for weeks or months what's in this bill unless we slow down a bit here. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I think it begs the question, if there was total transparency here, why did we waive all points of order against this rule? I would have liked to have challenged the conference report itself, but I couldn't because the Rules Committee had decided to waive all points of order. Now, you have to ask why. If everything is transparent and everything is known, why did we waive all points of order? Why am I forced to bring a point of order against the rule itself rather than the conference report? 
   And I would submit that I would like to believe that it is a transparency, but when you have air-dropped earmarks dropped at the last minute, again, if we are working so hard for America's hardworking taxpayers, as was just said, then why are we air-dropping an earmark for $1 million for the Thomas Daschle Center for Public Service? Naming a center after a former Member, why is that so urgent that we have to break all the rules that we have laid out and sneak it into a bill at the last minute, with less than 24 hours, in fact, less than 12 hours to actually review it? That's not proper vetting. 
   I should mention that there have been statements made by the majority, and I have liked what I have heard about what we are going to do this year in terms of earmarks transparency. 
   The Speaker of the House said back in June that Members need to have time to read through these reports and that every earmark should have to be defended. 
   These nine air-dropped earmarks into this bill today don't have to be defended. They are untouchable. We can't even go at them. We can't offer an amendment to strike them out because they are air-dropped into a conference report where you have no ability to strike them. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey).

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I am not here to defend the Republican record on earmarks. It's abysmal, frankly. I think that's one of the main reasons we are here squarely in the minority today. 
   But I took great heart, as did many of us, at the promises that were made with the new Congress, that we would have real transparency, real accountability. And, unfortunately, what we are seeing today is a move away from that. 
   Let me read a statement that I mentioned. In June of this year, the Speaker of the House, in a press conference, said, ``Before Members vote on a bill, there should be an appropriate time for people to be able to read it, that it should be a matter of public record. And if there's an earmark that can stand the scrutiny, then that transparency will give the opportunity for it to be there.'' 
   When you have nine, at least, that we have been able to find, and when the gentleman says that they are all marked with an asterisk, how do we know? We have 150 pages of earmarks that we were given just this morning. We only got the hard copy of this this morning. We simply don't know. So it behooves us to move a little slower here. 
   If we really believe in transparency, if we really believe that these earmarks need to be there, then let's have a rule that actually allows for a point of order to be lodged against the conference report, not just against the rule. 
   Again, I have to say if there was complete transparency here and we didn't have anything to worry about, I think we would have had a rule that did not waive points of order against the bill. And that's why we are here today. 
   We need to do far better. This is a wonderful institution. There are wonderful people here. It has a great history. We need to do better by it. And I would submit that this legislation before us today with 150 pages of earmarks and nine air-dropped earmarks at the last minute does not do this institution the good that it deserves. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, people may wonder why we are doing this, combining these two bills, the Veterans bill and also Labor-HHS. It is easy to see when you look at it. 
   There are some 150 pages of earmarks in this conference report, including nine air-dropped earmarks. Now, these are earmarks that weren't considered by either the House or the Senate. They were simply air-dropped into the bill that we have no opportunity to amend out. We have violated our own rules. We are violating our own rules to do this: $1 million for the Thomas Daschle Center for Public Service and Representative Democracy. We are spending $1 million in this bill, air-dropped into the bill, with no opportunity to amend it out, a center for public service and representative democracy at a university somewhere named for a former Member of Congress. 
   This simply isn't right. This isn't right. We shouldn't be doing this. This institution deserves far better than we are giving it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, it's my intent to offer a number of earmark limitation amendments to the FY 2008 Agriculture appropriation bill. 
   In offering these earmark limitation amendments, I hope that my colleagues will join me in finally grabbing the reins on runaway earmark spending, and if you will pardon the pun, plant the seed of fiscal discipline in the appropriation process. 
   In its present form, this bill is under veto threat because it jumps the rails of the President's plan to have a balanced budget by 2012 by close to $1 billion. Part of the $1 billion increase in spending over last year's levels is caused by over 400 earmarks in the bill worth over $300 million that direct taxpayer dollars to congressionally selected projects.     
   As my colleagues have heard me say a few too many times, I am sure, passing appropriation bills that contain hundreds of earmarks worth millions of dollars that are simply noted by phrases in the committee report shortchanges the legislative process of authorization, appropriation and oversight. The earmarking process is fraught with a lack of transparency, fiscal responsibility and equity for taxpayers, all too often rewarding the districts of powerful Members of Congress in the Appropriations Committee at the expense of the rest of the body. 
   Let me just note that, according to a review of the bill in a report by Taxpayers for Common Sense, members of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee and party leadership, who make up 5 percent of the House, will take home one-third of the dollar value of agricultural earmarks, nearly $100 million. 
   If you assume that earmarks with multiple sponsors are shared equally, members of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee and party leadership will send an average of about 4 million earmarked dollars back to their districts. 
   In contrast, if you look at the remaining earmarked funds and distribute them evenly over the remaining 400-plus House districts, at best they would value slightly less than $500,000. As I have said repeatedly, we are creating winners and losers here. 
   I'm usually referring to industries that are refunded by the earmarks. But it is true also here in Congress, if you are a seasoned Member in a position of influence, you typically get a lot more. It is simply not right for all the high-minded purpose we give to the contemporary practice of earmarks, talking about Article 1 of the Constitution and the authority it gives us, to then turn around and the leadership and the members of the Appropriations Subcommittee that control the bill get so much more than anyone else. It hardly seems fair. It hardly seems right. 
   In particular, this amendment would prohibit $878,046 in Federal funds from being used for catfish genome research in Auburn, Alabama, and would reduce the cost of the bill by a commensurate amount. I think that this is definitely one earmark that the taxpayers would love to throw back. 
   According to the earmark description in the certification letter, the funding would go to Auburn University ``to help continue important research into the genomic behavior of catfish in order to resist and cope with virulent disease strains.'' It appears to me that the earmark is intended to make a genetic map of catfish. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are so many earmarks in this bill related to genetic research, I feel I am on some kind of farm-based CSI episode. Unfortunately, this isn't a creative drama. This spending is far too real. This seems to be a perennial earmark. It has received over  $1 million in the last 3 fiscal years alone. 
   Where is the Federal nexus here? Why are we funding catfish research and not trout research? What about sunfish out there? Don't they deserve something? How do we choose here? How do we choose which university gets the funding? It is simply an arbitrary process based on your position on a committee or in the Congress. 
   Mr. Chairman, that seems wrong to me. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Let me just say there is over at the Department of Agriculture something called the Agricultural Research Service, or ARS, account, and it is being funded at over $1 billion for fiscal year 2008. Now, we may not like the programs they choose to fund. If we don't like it and we don't think they have a good process, we should exercise the oversight that we are supposed to exercise and change it. But to circumvent that process and say because you may not have given us a grant in one particular year then we are simply going to go around you and earmark, that simply seems wrong. 
   We are getting away from the authorization, appropriation, oversight program and process that has been the hallmark of this Congress forever. With earmarking, the contemporary process of earmarking, we are circumventing that and we do very little oversight of the Federal agencies, because we are seeking to compete with them. 
   We set up a program over there and we say you have a merit-based program, a competitive grant program, and then, when they don't choose what we want to, we circumvent it.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would eliminate $628,843 for the Grape Genetics Program at Cornell University and reduce the cost of the bill by a corresponding amount. 
   Mr. Chairman, it would seem that Congress is a one-stop shop for the wine industry. There is in this bill here $628,843 earmarked for the Grape Genetics Program, as mentioned, in addition to a $2.6 million earmark to actually construct the Center for Grape Genetics. 
   The earmark description in the certification letter submitted to the committee by the sponsor of the earmark informs us that this earmark would fund a full-time grape geneticist at the Grape Genetics Research Unit and support the viability of the grape and wine industry. 
   Now, according to some, the wine industry faces a growing demand for new technologies and varieties in order to be a player in the global marketplace. I don't doubt that at all. I don't deny that research and development is important to the wine and grape industry. I simply question why the Federal Government is expected to foot the bill for a private industry. 
   According to recent reports, direct sales of wine to consumers are up 30 percent this year. Let me repeat that. Direct sales of wine to consumers are up 30 percent this year. 
   According to a study unveiled by the Congressional Wine Caucus earlier this year, the U.S. wine, grape and grape products industry contributes more than $160 billion annually to the U.S. economy, $160 billion annually. 
   This study indicated that the industry supports more than 1 million full-time equivalent positions and that there are more than 900,000 grape-bearing acres in the U.S. In addition, according to the 2006 report by the USDA, New York has 239 wineries currently, as opposed to 17 in 1976. I would submit that this looks like an industry that is thriving. 
   If the Federal Government is going to support genetic research for one industry, why doesn't the Federal Government provide support for all of them? What mechanism is there to stop Congress from funding mold research on gourmet cheese, or soil research for truffle farming? Where does it stop? Where is the Federal nexus here? Why do we continue to fund these profitable industries? 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, let me just say, nobody questions the validity or the importance of research. Every industry needs to do it, and do a lot of it. But we have a lot of high-tech industries that are vital to this country. Why aren't we funding a company like Intel, for example, for issues related to testing of circuit boards? That is important. They face international competition. 
   Why do we say all right here, only we are going to fund grape research? Also, when we have a program over at the Department of Agriculture that we fund to the tune of a billion dollars this year to actually provide grants in this area, and still it is not enough. Still we say we have to earmark funds to go around that process. It seems like overkill, and I think the taxpayer deserves a break here at some point.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, let me just say to close, again, research is important in every industry, but there are industries all over the country in agriculture, in high tech, in storage, in transportation, you name it. It is going on all over, and not everyone is looking to the Federal Government to pay their research costs. 
   Why here? Why do we have an organization that gets earmarks virtually every year for the same thing over and over and over again? When does the taxpayer get a break? When is this industry weaned? 
   We just had a farm bill pass last week with subsidies going on and on and on. Here are more agricultural subsidies. I don't know where it stops, particularly with the deficit we have, the ongoing debt that we carry. It is time to give the taxpayers a break. I urge adoption of the amendment.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $400,000 in Federal funds from being used for alternative uses for tobacco in Maryland and reduces the cost of the bill by a consistent amount. 
   I would suggest to my colleagues that we can find some better alternative uses for the taxpayers' money, like paying down the national debt, for example. 
   In fact, just yesterday, Treasury Secretary Paulson predicted that the Treasury will reach the nearly $9 trillion statutory debt limit in early October. I would argue that this is a sign that we need to spend less on appropriation bills just like this one. 
   The certification letter submitted to the Appropriations Committee stated that the funding will go to the University of Maryland College of Agriculture and Natural Resources for the Alternative Uses of Tobacco Research Project. 
   The funding for this earmark is through the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service Special Research Grants account, which are congressionally directed and noncompetitive research earmarks. 
   The Alternative Uses of Tobacco Research Project is focused on finding new, nonsmoking uses for tobacco, such as pharmaceutical or biotechnology applications. 
   I am not denying that there aren't potential benefits for this research for the tobacco industry, for pharmaceutical industry, or for other biotechnology industries, but how long is the taxpayer going to be expected to fund specific research for the benefit of these industries? 
   This is not a new earmark. In fact, the project has received earmarks of between $320,000 and $400,000 each year since fiscal year 2002. Including this earmark, the University of Maryland will have received over $2 million in Federal earmarks for their alternative use project. 
   Why are we singling out this program and this school and earmarking funds for it year after year after year? What makes this program at the University of Maryland more deserving than Federal funds at other schools or organizations in Virginia, Tennessee, Arizona, California or elsewhere around the country? There are many other earmark projects that we are funding at the University of Maryland as well. 
   According to research done by Citizens Against Government Waste, from 2001 to 2006, the University of Maryland received just under $17 million in Federal earmarks. I think it is interesting to note in 2006 the University of Maryland paid lobbying firms more than $200,000 for various lobbying activities. Are these lobbyists lobbying Congress for additional earmarks? 
   When do we say enough is enough? When the smoke clears, the taxpayers are still being asked to fund tobacco research. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for the gentleman from Maryland, and I appreciate the tone which this debate has been conducted in. 
   I heard some new things here that I didn't know before. This was a Maryland-initiated buyout for the tobacco industry, a buyout which limited the uses of tobacco afterwards. That's great. It should probably be the State of Maryland that funds this kind of research then, instead of the Federal Government. 
   Another thing I heard that I hadn't heard before is I guess we are moving toward tobacco-based ethanol or something of some such. My old car smokes enough, thank you. I'm not sure that's the way to go, but, in any event, there are limits to what you can do. The truth is you can make ethanol out of an old boot if you expend enough energy doing it, but it doesn't mean that we ought to fund research again and again, over and over and over. There are limits to what the taxpayer ought to do. 
   And let me just say, given that, I mean, we imposed another tax on tobacco just a day ago, and I think there are plenty of incentives there within the industry, be it the growing side or be it on the marketing side or whatever, to find alternative uses for tobacco. I think it ought to be left with them and not the Federal taxpayer.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to prohibit funding for an earmark for the Ruminant Nutrition Consortium. This earmark would provide $489,000 for ruminant livestock production research, rangeland integration and other livestock resources. 
   A press release issued from this earmark in a previous year described it as an effort in the northern plains to further develop beef, dairy and sheep finish-feeding, which may lead to more jobs and more value-added agriculture. 
   Mr. Chairman, I know a little about cattle nutrition. I spent a lot of years on a ranch and a farm; and, in fact, I spent years on what we call bloat watch, where we'd sit at the edge of a field and have to watch while cattle, being the type of ruminant digestive system that they have, might bloat. And you'd have to run and stab the left side and hopefully relieve the suffering and relieve the certain death that comes. 
   I think this is an effort to relieve a little bloat that is here in this Agricultural appropriation bill and certainly in this budget. 
   There is simply no reason we should continue to fund research like this when we have, as mentioned already many times tonight, we have an account over at the Department of Agriculture that is for this purpose to dispense research dollars based on competition, where there are groups that are out there will compete for grants. We've told the Department of Agriculture to set up that program, and here we're saying it's not good enough. We're going to have that program; and then, in addition, we're going to give what essentially is a sole-source contract, single bidder. One university or one entity will get this earmark grant. 
   So it's simply not right.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, let me just say that the gentlewoman mentioned that this is not a single-source contract or single-bid contract. I have the certification letter. It says I'm requesting funding for South Dakota State University in Brookings, South Dakota, to conduct research into production of environmental aspects of ruminant livestock production, et cetera, et cetera. 
   What used to be a competitive grant process is no longer with this earmark. We do have a competitive grant process at the Department of Agriculture. Now, this school may choose to have a competitive grant process beyond that, but we're using Federal dollars to give to one university to perhaps disburse among other universities. 
   If we don't like the process over at the Department of Agriculture, we should end it. We should say we're not going to fund that account anymore, that billion dollars we're giving you is not being disbursed equitably nor wisely. If we believe that, we should tell them. We'd save a lot of money and instead contract with others at the local level and just give it out. 
   But what we're doing here is we're funding both. We're having a process over there where a billion dollars is handed out competitively with some kind of process, merit-based process, and we're going around that and earmarking funds for specific institutions. 
   It simply seems wrong.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, well, I should say I haven't been very successful here. I have noted before I have been beaten like a rented mule here quite a bit. But I must say the majority of Democrats did join me in actually striking an earmark a couple of weeks ago, one Member, and I had the occasion just today of one earmark that I had planned to strike was stricken by the Member himself before I could strike it. 
   So there are occasions when the Appropriations Committee, for whatever reason, I sympathize with them. They simply don't have the time to vet all of these. I would suggest, when you have 410 earmarks in one bill like this, you simply don't have a lot of time to vet them. 
   I know a little bit about cattle ranching. As I mentioned, I grew up on a cattle ranch. The gentleman mentioned the process of moving cattle from one cell to another. Actually, we started doing that on the F-Bar some 30 years ago and are still doing it to some extent. 
   The gentlelady mentioned this is a consortium, four universities, I believe, getting these research dollars, but it's earmarked for that consortium. That consortium could apply to the Department of Agriculture for universities like this. I suppose, cattle have four stomachs, four universities, only makes sense, but they can apply directly to the Department of Agriculture. They don't have to get earmark dollars.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $6,371,000 and reduce the cost of the bill by a commensurate amount from being used to research wood utilization. 
   This is the second year in a row I have stood to address this earmark. It seems that not much has changed in the past year of wood utilization research. The committee provided precisely the same amount of funding last year, $6,371,000, for a variety of projects around the country that frankly seem designed to provide a solution in search of a problem. 
   This is another example of an earmark that has persisted for years that can only be terminated by Congress. The wood utilization program has received Federal funds since 1985 and has received more than $90 million in appropriations. 
   The United States is the world's largest producer of lumber and wood products used in residential construction and in commercial wood products such as furniture and containers. 
   The United States is also a leader in the pulp and paper business, producing about 34 percent of the world's pulp and 29 percent of the world's output in paper and paper board. About 1.3 million people are directly employed in the planning, growing, managing, and harvesting of trees and the production of wood and paper products in all 50 States. 
   The forest industry ranks among the top 10 manufacturing employers in about 42 States with an annual payroll of about $60 billion. This is an industry that dates back hundreds of years and has shown itself remarkably capable to adapt to change. It obviously continues to thrive today. 
   I sincerely question why the Federal Government needs to involve itself in a program that educates students about the utility of wood as a renewable resource. 
   What happened to the free market? What happened to common sense? I think we have had it out there for a while. After 1985, we have been doing this same earmark or this same program for the past several years, or it has been earmarked for the past several years. I would say it's time to reconsider the project. 
   I think the taxpayers may want to take us to the woodshed themselves for continuing to fund at a price of $6,371,000 this same earmark year after year after year.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, nobody here is questioning the need for research. Every industry does it. Every industry has to do it to survive because of competition. 
   What I question here is why the taxpayer is spending $6 million every year on this same earmark for a $60 billion industry. This money goes to universities all over the country, so does research money from paper companies that are in the department next door. 
   There is research being funded. This is a pittance compared to the other research dollars that are being spent. 
   Thank goodness, private industry knows that they have to do it. But why does a taxpayer have to be on the hook again and again and again year after year after year for this same earmark for wood utilization?

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this rule as well. I don't think it's a good precedent to set to move away from open rules on appropriations. I'm one that's often accused of dilatory tactics on these bills, having so many amendments on earmarks. These aren't dilatory at all. 
   I should note that on the bill that we had a couple of weeks ago, the Energy and Water bill, I believe I offered seven or eight. With that, one Member came to the floor before I offered and withdrew or asked for an amendment which he received to strike his own earmark. 
   We're seeing the same here, three earmarks stricken from the bill in the Rules Committee because an amendment was going to be offered to strike them on the floor. 
   My understanding is with the Defense bill tomorrow that there will be another amendment, self-executing rule to strike another earmark that was going to be challenged on the floor. 
   So this is not dilatory at all to come to the floor and say, hey, there are earmarks here that might be questionable. There are a lot of earmarks that would go to private companies. These are, in essence, sole source contracts. 
   I sympathize with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, who said many times that we simply don't have the staff to police this many earmarks. I don't think you could have policed the 15,000 we had a couple of years ago. If this Congress is successful in cutting that down by half, we can't come close to policing that number either. 
   We have former Members in jail because of earmarks that we approved in this body. We simply can't go on like this, and if we shut down this process in a manner where we're only allowed to question a certain number of earmarks, I wanted to question 10 on this bill. There are 410 in the bill. Ten is not an unreasonable number. I was only allowed five. 
   Who knows on the bill that we do tomorrow if we have a closed rule. If we aren't able to question these, where are we able to do it?

   Mr. FLAKE. I appreciate you taking the time to bring this important issue to light. 
   I am the first to admit that our party didn't handle this issue very well. We went over about a decade or 12 years, depending on how you count them, from about 1,400 earmarks in all appropriation bills to more than 15,000. So the process exploded with Republicans in charge. That doesn't speak well for us as a party. We should not have let that happen. 
   I think right here near the end we woke up, and we passed some legislation in October of last year. Unfortunately, I think it was near the end of the appropriation process, when it was really too late to do any good. 
   The Democrats, to their credit, when they came into power in January of this year, passed a little stronger legislation than I think we did, and I think I and many of my colleagues gave them credit for that. It was a good thing to add more transparency to the earmark process. 
   The problem, as the gentleman from Georgia has so aptly pointed out, is that the rules that we set are only as good as our willingness to enforce them. So you can have pretty good rules with regard to earmark reform, with regard to transparency, but unless you are willing to enforce them, they are of little worth. 
   As the gentleman pointed out, when you have rules that allow the chairman of the committee to simply make a declaration that there are no earmarks in this bill, when there clearly are, we have no recourse. We have to accept that statement as if it were fact, when it clearly isn't. 
   The gentleman mentioned the war supplemental that came up. We actually had an example where there was a press release of one Member actually claiming credit for an earmark that had been received for that Members' district, put out a press release touting it. Yet, for that same bill, there was a statement in the RECORD saying there are no earmarks in this bill. 
   So, the gentleman mentioned, it was like a fairy tale. I think it's a lot like Alice in Wonderland, where you say a word has whatever meaning I give to it; and, in this case, you know, an earmark is whatever I pretend to call it. Unfortunately, that doesn't lend itself to transparency. 
   We have the situation now, which is far worse than anything we have heard before, that we won't have any earmarks in the House bills, but, rather, we will wait until the House bill is done, the Senate bill is done. Then the earmarks will be airdropped into the conference report. 
   Now, if that is the case, there is no way for any 
   Member of this body to challenge any of those earmarks that come up. There is no way you can amend, because you can't do that to a conference report. You have to ask yourself, is that more transparency? Is that a better process? 
   The Chairman of the Appropriations Committee stated that more time was needed to actually scrub these earmarks, to make sure that they are proper, and that the committee was undertaking to do that. 
   I think, and I think those who have been watching this process will agree, that the best way to scrub the process is to let sunlight in to allow these earmarks to be made known, to allow the media, the blogging community out there, organizations that follow this and other Members of this body, to actually see these earmarks and to judge them and to determine who is it going to, who is going to benefit from this earmark? 
   If we are really concerned about scrubbing these earmarks, to make sure that they are proper, then let people know about them. Nobody is served well if they are kept secret. 
   So I commend the gentleman again for bringing this important issue to light. I would encourage him to keep up this battle and to make sure that earmarks get the sunlight that they deserve. If we want to really curb this practice that has gotten out of control, we need to ensure that we have more sunlight, not less.

   Mr. FLAKE. Most certainly, I think across the country the taxpayers want to know what is going on. I think that they look at the process that we have now where Members will submit requests, earmark requests, but those requests are only made public if their earmark is actually part of a bill that comes to the House. 
   Now, under this new procedure that has been announced by the majority, those earmark letters, which indicate who the earmark is to go to, won't be made public at all until it's too late in the process to actually challenge that earmark. 
   So it means little to go through the process that we have set up if, by the  time it has any effect, it's too late in the process to change. 
   So the gentleman is correct, I think. Across the country, that's what I hear when I am out there. People want to know. They want open government. 
   When you think about it, every second that this Chamber is in session is captured on C-SPAN, this conversation and every other conversation, whenever this body is in session. When we are in committee, every word that is said is transcribed and is captured. So we have an open process. 
   Yet when it comes to spending money, we have a very secretive process in terms of earmarks, where, according to the majority this year, we won't know it all until it's too late to actually change it, until we have to just do one up and down, up or down vote on a bill. 
   There are several bills in the past, in fact, one bill, the highway bill a couple of years ago, that had 6,300 earmarks in the bill. You could conceivably have that again. At least, you know, virtually every appropriation bill is up somewhere approaching 1,000 or maybe 2,500. So, think of that, 2,500 earmarks in a single bill. The Members here won't even have the ability to challenge one of those, won't even know that they are there until you have to have to take one up or down vote on that legislation. I think every American knows that that simply is wrong.

   Mr. FLAKE. Over the appropriation process last summer, I believe we brought 39 earmarks in several appropriation bills to the floor; and my effort was, in many cases, simply to see whose earmark this was and to have that Member actually justify the need for that earmark. 
   We simply didn't know who requested it. We saw it in the committee report. When the bill came to the floor, it would generally be a vague description of an earmark to a certain entity or a company. But you wouldn't know who actually sponsored the earmark until you challenged it on the floor. Then, typically, the author of that earmark would come to defend it, but not always. 
   I should mention that many of the earmarks that were challenged on the floor in the last appropriation cycle, the author of the earmark never even came to the floor to defend it. He or she simply knew that, through the process of log rolling, that other Members would know I won't challenge that earmark and the author of that earmark won't challenge mine. 
   So it was a very disheartening process to go through. But at least we could go through that process. At least we knew something about what was in the bill, because we had the reports come to the floor. Under the process that has been announced, we wouldn't even have that ability.     
   These bills would come to the floor, there would be no earmark, there would be no letters attached saying there are this many earmarks. There would be no lists listing the Members who had requested earmarks. Nothing. We would simply have to wait until it was too late in the process to actually challenge until the earmarks were air dropped into the conference report. So it's an important distinction. 
   I think the process has been far too secretive in the past. We would typically only get these lists in the committee reports hours before the bill actually came to the floor. But that's miles better than what is being discussed now because these earmarks would not be made known at all until it's too late. They would be kept secret from the body as a whole, and from the taxpayers across the country. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. FLAKE. Well, I just again thank the gentleman. And just to reiterate again, we have had a bad process. We recognize that. That was the reason for the reforms that we did in the fall of last year. And as I mentioned, I applauded the Democrats for the reforms that they put in place in January. The problem is we're running away from those reforms rather fast. And if we are really serious about bringing in sunlight and transparency, then we have to stop this proposed new rule, or this proposed process I should say, it's not a formal rule, to make sure that these earmarks get the sunlight that they deserve, that every member of this body and every taxpayer across the country has a chance to see what this body is doing. That's what open government is all about. And I, again, thank the gentleman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, just 2 days ago, we witnessed a transition of power in Cuba. It is no surprise that the new government in Cuba looks a lot like the old. It's time for a get-tough policy on Cuba. It's time to end the isolation that has been both a friend and an enabler to decades of oppression. This isolation has given the Cuban Government a convenient scapegoat for the failure of socialism. We should not give Raul Castro the same benefits that we gave his brother Fidel. We cannot continue to be the Goliath to their David. 
   For too long, U.S. policy toward Cuba has missed the island by about 90 miles. Our Cuba policy, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, has been more about Florida than about Cuba, more about securing votes in Miami than securing the right to vote in Havana. 
   Madam Speaker, we are too great a country than to deny Cuban American families the right to visit family members in Cuba. We are too great a country than to deny our own citizens the right to travel to the island and to give aid and comfort to those who have endured decades of oppression. 
   Freedom in Cuba is a worthy goal, a goal that would perhaps be more easily achieved if we practice a little more of it ourselves.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   The gentleman from Massachusetts knows the respect I have for his knowledge of free market economics. He often scolds us on this side of the aisle when our rhetoric doesn't match our actions. And he is often justified in doing so. I have heard him quote Adam Smith and Milton Friedman with the best of them. 
   That is why I was baffled to see this bill come to the floor from his committee, a bill that violates the same principles that he has chastened us for not recognizing. He was right then. And he is inconsistent and wrong today. 
   This bill has ``moral hazard'' written all over it. We know that a party insulated from risk behaves differently than a party that is fully exposed to risk. The truth is here we are insulating home buyers and home owners from risk. And we will simply prolong the housing crisis by doing so. 
   Let's be real here. The purpose of this legislation is to insulate political parties from risk. That is what we are doing here. If we felt such a need to intervene here, we ought to remember what we did last September when I believe, if I remember right, we encouraged FHA to give no-money-down loans. Why is it that we think that we are so prescient here about what is going to happen? 
   We can't outguess the market. We shouldn't try to. We simply will delay the bottom and delay and increase the dislocations that will occur when its politicians decide to allocate resources and capital rather than the markets.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, many of us in this body have realized for quite a while that the practice of earmarking is out of control. When we herald the fact that we had a mere 12,000 earmarks last year, as opposed to only 15,000 a couple of years ago, we know that something is wrong. 
   But the exercise we went through last week was perhaps the best indication we had yet that we still have a long way to go. We authorized the Justice Department to investigate the origin of an immaculate earmark, an earmark that wasn't in either the House or Senate version of the bill, that only showed up when the President signed the legislation. The earmark was not in either the House or Senate version. Now, one would think that the discovery of an immaculate earmark would prompt an immediate congressional investigation. Instead, we waited 2 years and then authorized the Justice Department to look into it. 
   Mr. Speaker, we owe this great institution far better than we're giving it, from bridges to nowhere to teapot museums, to immaculate earmarks that we don't even pass, let alone scrutinize. We can do far better than this.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, reserving the right to object, I have a few  concerns. Early this year when authorizations came to the floor, authorization bills and the CR and also last year with appropriation bills and in previous years, it is a common practice to have the report come to the floor very late in the day. In fact, for the Intelligence authorization bill, I believe the report came to the floor a few hours after the deadline for submission for earmarks. 
   What assurance do we have that reports, the committee reports that contain the earmarks, will actually come to the floor in a timely manner? Because it will be difficult to enter into any unanimous-consent agreement on a bill if we haven't had adequate time to actually review the earmarks. I know there has been talk, there's always talk, about some 48-hour rule or 72-hour rule, but it is routinely broken. And is there any assurance that we can have on this side that we'll do better in that regard? Because the record so far this year is not good with regard to authorization bills. 
   I know that is not your fault, but I'm concerned that we won't get the committee report in time to adequately review the earmarks in it in order to enter into a useful unanimous-consent agreement.

   Mr. FLAKE. I would submit that it's unacceptable. The reason we have this transparency, where we have letters actually requesting the earmark, indicating the entity that it goes to, the specific purpose for the earmark, is so that we make informed judgments here on floor. 
   If all we can do is have one staff member go in, they have to wait while meetings are held, they can't go in certain rooms, they are told that they can only read from the list and take notes, not make copies. The practice in the past has been, and I am not saying that this is more a problem with the majority than it was with the previous majority, we had trouble then.

   Mr. FLAKE. Good point. Another point, you made the example of the education bill last year that took some 12 hours to get through. My expectation is that there will be a lot of earmarks in that bill and many others. Last year I offered a total of 39 on all appropriation bills. 
   I was constrained considerably. Many of the amendments that I drew up and brought to the Parliamentarian, I was told that it would be subject to a point of order because the earmark was so vague, that the language was so vague, and that it didn't refer to a specific facility. There were many amendments that I wanted to bring forward and couldn't. 
   I don't expect that to be the case this time because we have better rules in terms of the letters, the request forms, the entity that has to be there. So what I am saying is I expect there to be more amendments brought. 
   I think it may be unrealistic to expect us to be constrained by last year's time frame. It may be longer. As long as it is subject to a unanimous consent agreement, and Members like myself or others who want to bring additional, or maybe more than were brought last year, can still bring those forward, then I think that's the only basis that we can move under.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity we have. For a while it looked like we might not have this opportunity, so I do appreciate being able to challenge these earmarks on the House floor. 
   As rank-and-file Members, we are able to see certification letters that have been submitted by the requesting Member to the Appropriations Committee. I should point out again, as I did yesterday, we were unable to see the actual request letter, so there is limited information that we have available on these earmarks and what they're for, but there are some that we're able to glean. 
   Let me just talk about this one a little. This one I actually challenged last year. That's part of the reason I'm coming again is this seems to be an earmark that just keeps coming up again and again for an organization that seems to exist only on earmarks. 
   This particular amendment would prohibit funding for the Johnstown Area Regional Industries, or JARI, Incubator and Workforce Development Program. Now, I don't know the specifics of the history of JARI, how it was started, I do know, however, that it has received several earmarks over the years. 
   I also know, among other things, JARI helps companies obtain government funding. Its Web site says, ``JARI's Procurement Technical Assistance Center provides an array of services to assist companies in securing Federal, State and local government contracts and subcontracts.'' 
   So, in essence, what we're doing is sending Federal money to an organization, who then turns around with that money and seeks additional Federal money. I'm just wondering where this stops. How many of these organizations can we fund? 
   This is not the only organization of its kind, and that's partly what worries me here. We're finding dozens and dozens of organizations like this increasingly over the past couple of years that have been organized and created to secure additional Federal funding. These are earmarks that beget earmarks. These are earmarks incubators. And I don't know how much we can stand of this because the more we have out there, the more it seems to simply spawn other earmarks. 
   And with that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I always enjoy debating my good friend from New York. My good friend from New York made a point when I challenged one of his earmarks last year that his district has one of the highest poverty rates, or it is number one in the country. 
   Here I have a map. The red areas show those counties in the country that have experienced persistent poverty over the past 30 years. I should note that virtually all of the earmarks I will be challenging today are not in areas that are covered in the red, certainly not the one in western Pennsylvania today. This is not an area of persistent poverty. This is not an area where we are going in and helping the truly less fortunate. 
   The gentleman is correct that Members of Congress are, by and large, intelligent. They know how to work the system. I would submit that that is exactly what this is about. When you get an earmark that begets other earmarks, when you are funding organizations set up with the express purpose of getting other Federal moneys or other earmarks, there is something wrong with that picture. There is something wrong with that. Where does that end? That is simply not right. 
   I would ask the gentleman, this is not the gentleman's earmark. Is the sponsor of the earmark not here to defend the earmark today?

This is an earmark that begets earmarks. This is going to a business organization whose job it is to receive other Federal moneys. There have been many stories written over the past several weeks about organizations like this that exist to draw other Federal moneys. I don't think that you can put it in terms of this Member knows that district and is trying to alleviate poverty or a situation like that. 
   This is a situation, it seems to me, where earmarks are begetting more earmarks. We simply can't sustain that. With the deficit that we have, with the situation we are in with the Federal Government, we can't sustain doing this for much longer.

   Mr. FLAKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   This amendment would prevent the Barracks Row Main Street Organization from receiving $.5 million. The certification letter provided by the sponsor of this earmark indicates that these funds will be used to redevelop the Eastern Market Metro Plaza and the triangle park adjacent to it. This is in Washington, D.C., not far from us here on Capitol Hill. 
   According to its Web site: ``The mission of Barracks Row Main Street is to revitalize 8th Street Southeast as a vibrant commercial corridor reconnecting Capitol Hill to the Anacostia River using historic preservation and the arts and economic development tools.'' 
   In case you weren't aware, Mr. Chairman, Barracks Row was the first commercial center in Washington, D.C. In 1801, Thomas Jefferson selected the site of 8th and I Streets as the first post for the Marine Corps because of its close proximity to the Navy Yard and the U.S. Capitol in case it needed protection. I sometimes wish those marines were around to protect the taxpayer here or funds from flowing from this institution. 
   Also, according to the Barracks Row Web site, since 1999 there have been more than 50 facades restored, 40 signs replaced, 40 new businesses opened, three new buildings constructed and one streetscape reconstruction completed. All told, the total amount of public and private funds reinvested has been some $19 million. At least a portion of that $19 million has come through Federal earmarks. 
   The 2006 Transportation appropriation bill included a $750,000 earmark for the redevelopment of Barracks Row Main Street, Inc. That was apparently the same project included in the earmark that I seek to limit today, the redevelopment of the Eastern Market Metro Plaza. 
   I would submit that the redevelopment of the Metro Plaza would be more appropriately addressed by the authorizers. If the project were authorized, then we should allow the Transportation appropriators to do this bill. 
   I also note that this Metro Plaza may be about to receive at least its second earmark. How many more will be required? How much longer will we be doing this? I certainly hope that we are not approving a redevelopment earmark today to redevelop last year's redevelopment earmark.

   Mr. FLAKE. To hear this discussion, one would think we were funding the Marines somehow here. We are not. We are not. We are funding, according to the certification letter, ``Funding is to be used for enhancing the Barracks Row Corridor by redeveloping the Eastern Market Metro Plaza.'' 
   This is a commercial development, a commercial venture. Home and retail properties in this area have skyrocketed in the past couple of years. The American way is to leverage the equity you have, either in your business or your home, and redevelop the area. That is how every other area in the country does it, almost all without Federal help. 
   Just because it is here, and I would like to get there and watch the Marines march, but let me say again, this has nothing to do with the Marines marching in Barracks Row. This has to do with subsidizing a commercial enterprise, one that could do just fine on its own, and particularly in this area. I couldn't think of buying in that area. It is far too expensive. 
   I appreciate the notion of helping out and the sentimentality of Marines marching, and all of us want to help the armed services, but that is not what this is about. This is about subsidizing a commercial venture, and it is not something we should be involved in in this instance. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit $231,000 from going to the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, otherwise known as SPUR. This organization claims to be San Francisco's preeminent public-policy think tank and claims that through research analysis, public education and advocacy, SPUR promotes good planning and good government. 
   The question we are asked today: Is it good government for the Federal taxpayer to be funding think tanks around the country? You can debate all day long, we only have a couple of minutes here, the merits or demerits of government planning, whether it is a good thing that the suburbs expand or that the policies that this organization promotes are better. 
   But the question is: Should we be sending Federal taxpayer dollars to an organization with policies that run counter to what some people across the country might think? 
   I think we should let think tanks think and produce ideas that they want, but let's not support them with Federal funds and take sides in this issue. 
   As for the specifics of this earmark, according to the sponsor's certification letter, the funding would go towards construction costs associated with a new resource center for small business and community groups in San Francisco. The new resource center will be called the SPUR Urban Center. 
   SPUR's Web site says, ``As we head into the next 50 years of service to San Francisco, SPUR is proposing its most innovative solution yet: Constructing an urban center, the first of its kind in any city west of Chicago. To reach this goal, SPUR is embarking on a $10 million SPUR Campaign for the Urban Center.'' 
   I suppose this funding is meant to help that campaign to raise the $10 million necessary to build that urban center. The list of donors to this campaign is about four pages long. It includes very sizable donations from some very well-known corporations and organizations. It appears to me and to anyone who reads or looks at the Web site that this fundraising campaign is going fairly well. 
   Why again are we putting taxpayers on the hook to help with this effort? The organization and center look to have a local focus and policy approaches that too many taxpayers from across the country might have reservations about. 
   Now, I am familiar with the think tank world. Before coming to Congress, I spent 7 years at the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix. I suppose that there are a lot of people here who would be uncomfortable with the positions that the Goldwater Institute took. I would not presume to get Federal funding for the think tank that I used to work for or any other conservative think tank. That wouldn't be right. I don't think it is right here for any Member to seek money for a think tank at home that might or might not produce ideas that run counter or might be supported by Members here. Think tanks should think on their own without support from the Federal Government in this instance. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. For the record, I believe this is the Speaker's earmark. It would have been nice to have a colloquy like we were having on this earmark with the sponsor of the earmark. That is what would be nice about this process, if we could actually have the sponsor of the earmark come and explain it. 
   I would like to know, for example, taking the example that the gentleman gave that I seem to be willing to let the Federal Government, the agencies, go ahead and spend this money, I would be upset if the Federal agencies designated this themselves. They shouldn't give out money like this. 
   If the Federal agencies responsible for disbursing this kind of money gave money to the Goldwater Institute, I would expect the gentleman and everybody else to say that is not a proper use of money. I would do that if it was put in by a Member as well. It is not who spends the money; it is whether this money should be spent by the Federal Government. 
   I am not defending the Bush administration's spending of money that is earmarked. I have noted many times that much of the money in the Homeland Security bill that is spent in my district is not a wise use of Federal taxpayer dollars. It shouldn't be spent. 
   The question is not who spends it. We shouldn't use that as an excuse saying that the Federal agencies will misspend the money, so we have a right to do that as well. We have a right to misspend that money and designate think tanks who should receive it just because they might do the same thing over there. 
   Our role is to authorize, appropriate, and conduct oversight. My issue is that we have done far too little authorizing, far too much appropriating, and far too little oversight. Oversight needs to be done. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I can assure you that I have been called many things during this effort to shine the light on some Federal earmarks and to try to promote a little accountability. I am prepared after this amendment to answer to the name ``Grinch'' and head back up to my mountain just north of Who-ville. 
   This amendment would prevent $129,000 from being used by the Mitchell County Development Foundation for the Home for the Perfect Christmas Tree Project. 
   The Mitchell County Development Foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to creating jobs and strengthening the educational system, as well as promoting tourism in Mitchell County. 
   It has been reported that the Home of the Perfect Christmas Tree Project is an economic development initiative in economically distressed Mitchell County. 
   According to the project's Web site, author Gloria Houston gave the rights to her award-winning children's book, ``The Year of the Perfect Christmas Tree,'' to the town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina, in 2003. 
   To help with the economic challenges facing the region following the loss of manufacturing jobs, the Home of the Perfect Christmas Tree Project was created to assist entrepreneurs selling handmade crafts and products based on the book. 
   The money included in this earmark would go towards doubling the retail space available for the gift shop selling products like Christmas tree ornaments, lanterns, handmade soaps, et cetera. 
   I have no doubt that Mitchell County is having tough times economically. I don't belittle that fact. It sounds like they are. And I don't dispute the fact that they may be home to the perfect Christmas tree either, although Arizona has some very nice ones. 
   What I do doubt is that there is a Federal role here in doling out funds to the Mitchell County Development Foundation. 
   First, from the sponsor's certification letter, we learn that these funds are requested because the project is expected to double to include 60 licensed product makers in 2007. If this project is successful, does it still need taxpayer assistance? 
   Additionally, according to the USDA's Economic Research Service, there are nearly 400 persistently poor counties in the U.S. These are counties with 20 percent or more of their populations living in poverty for the last 30 years. These counties comprise 12 percent of U.S. counties and 4 percent of the population. 
   Are we to assume that the taxpayers should dig into their wallets and find ways of providing hundreds of thousands of dollars for each of these counties as a means of dealing with economic hardship? We simply can't do that. We simply can't cure every ill out there. 
   I would submit it is often said that this bill has become a Christmas tree. Unfortunately, this bill has a Christmas tree. I would think it is simply not a good use of taxpayer dollars. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Chairman. 
   I think the spirit of Christmas seems to have broken out here, with Democrats agreeing with Republicans and dogs and cats living together and everything else. I'll probably get beat soundly on this amendment. 
   Let me simply say in defense of the gentleman from North Carolina, we would likely not be in this situation where we're debating earmarks on the floor had he not persistently for 3 days helped in the effort to make sure that there is transparency here. And you can be for earmarks or against earmarks. But I think we ought to all be for transparency, and I think that's the message that he helped and very persuasively brought to the floor during  those 3 days. I appreciate his efforts there, all for the opportunity to be flogged in this fashion. 
   I would simply say, and, like I say, I don't want to belittle the economic problems in Mitchell County, but I should point out again there are 400 counties around the country comprising 12 percent of all U.S. counties, 4 percent of the U.S. population, that are in persistent poverty. When you pick like this, we're picking certain winners and losers who are to get Federal funding instead of recognizing that there is opportunity cost to funding as well.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this is another rerun amendment, because this bill contains another rerun earmark. I came last year to challenge the same earmark, and it's back. 
   This is the Fairplex Trade and Conference Center. It's located in Pomona, California, and more than one Member has been involved in the effort to secure earmark funding for this conference center. 
   According to the Web site, ``Fairplex is home to the annual L.A. County Fair and more than 300 other events each year. Included are consumer and trade shows, meetings, expositions, conventions, inter-track wagering, sporting events and agricultural events.'' Its Web site says that Fairplex is governed by the Los Angeles County Fair Association. The association is self-supporting and does not fall under the auspices of any county or State governmental body. 
   Now, Fairplex may not fall under the auspices of any county or State governmental body, but it has had its share of Federal funding over the years, which begs the question, is the association really self-supporting or not? 
   With a steady stream of earmark funding for the organization, I wonder if it is really dependent on this funding. Would Fairplex or the association be able to sustain its operation without annual earmarks? If it would, why do we need to do it in that case? Why would we have an organization that's either dependent on continued earmarks or one that could exist just fine without them? 
   Again, there are about 300 events at Fairplex every year. This year it hosted an international wine and spirits competition and an international extra virgin olive oil competition. It will have a 4th of July celebration next week. There is a Sheraton Suites hotel on the Fairplex campus. 
   With all of these sources of income, I really doubt that Fairplex needs a stream of taxpayer dollars that have come their way virtually every year. Why, this again begs the question, why are we doing this? Why is Federal money going here for a commercial venture? What makes Los Angeles County Fairgrounds more deserving than, say, Yazoo County, Mississippi; Cook County, Illinois or Slope County, North Dakota? 
   We certainly cannot fund every county fairground in the country. By choosing one or a few, we are picking winners and losers among them. I would appreciate an explanation as to how, out of the thousands of earmark requests that come, the committee narrows its list to a few hundred like this one in this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I have great respect for the gentlelady, as she knows. This is just one of many projects like this. 
   Mr. Chairman, again, I would simply make the point that the gentlelady mentioned, that there are millions and millions and millions of dollars contributed by State and local governments to this effort. There are millions of dollars that come in commercial transactions of conferences that are presented. This is simply $250,000. Why are we doing it at all? It clearly isn't dependent on the $250,000, I believe. Last year, because we didn't do earmarks in many of these bills, it didn't receive the funding. It's still up and going just fine. 
   The question is why do we do this? Why does the committee feel it proper to actually designate funding for something like this when we have such dire needs elsewhere in the Federal budget? 
   That's what we are here for today. That's why we are challenging earmarks like this, particularly with this bill. 
   This bill, with financial services, in my view, it's kind of the soft underbelly of the earmarking world, where you have economic development earmarks, that you can justify economic development anywhere in the country. Spending money, by its very nature, generates economic activity. So you could justify any earmark anywhere if you simply say it generates economic activity, it's important to my district. 
   But when we do it in this fashion, we simply pick winners and losers out there. I wouldn't think that's our place.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this would prohibit $231,000 for Advantage West Economic Development Group, that's the Certified Entrepreneurial Community Program. 
   Many of the earmarks in this bill are for economic development organizations, business incubators, workforce development programs and the like. But just because there are hundreds of similar earmarks in this bill doesn't mean that providing this kind of earmark for economic development is okay. 
   In doing research on the different earmarks, many of them begin to sound very much alike. But this one, the Advantage West Economic Development Group stood apart. Its list of corporate sponsors reads like the ``who's who'' list of influential and well-heeled entities, Bankers Branch & Trust, BellSouth, Duke Energy, Grant Thornton, Qualcomm, Spring, UBS, Verizon, Wachovia and other well-known corporations.     
   The listed funding partners are a very recognizable list as well, at least in Washington: the National Park Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Endowment of the Arts, the U.S. Department of Commerce and, of course, through the virtue of this earmark, the U.S. Congress. 
   The Advantage West Economic Development Group Web site boasts that publications such as Money, Kiplinger's, Outside, American Style, Modern Maturity and Forbes have ranked western North Carolina as a top destination for living, working, recreation, arts, technology and retirement. That's pretty nice advertisement. 
   The group highlights the following among other achievements, this group receiving the earmark by the way. During 2005, 2006 the Advantage West Economic Development Group's efforts in the advanced manufacturing sector contributed to economic development announcements of 2,345 new jobs and $902.5 million in capital investments. That's a lot of money. And they do pretty well here. 
   The group helped increase the economic impact of tourism in western North Carolina 53 percent since 1995. 
   I would simply make the point, why in the world, with a group with these kinds of backers in the private sector, does the Federal taxpayer need to turn around and spend $231,000 of taxpayer dollars? 
   As I mentioned, there is opportunity cost when you take this money out of the hands of individual taxpayers, send it to Washington, and then let Washington decide who are the winners and who are the losers, who will receive these kinds of economic development earmarks. That's not a very efficient way to distribute money for capital investment. I am glad the sponsor of the earmark is here. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for the gentleman whose earmark this is. And I also have great fear. I stood in left field when he was at the plate earlier this week in the congressional baseball game, and I'm glad that I didn't have to experience anything hit out there. 
   But I would simply make the case again. The gentleman mentioned that small business makes up 95 percent of all business starts out there. And I would submit that 99 percent of those do it without any help from the Federal Government at all. 
   And when the Federal Government does put money out there, I mean, 95 percent, I don't know what percentage but an overwhelming percentage, certainly, without earmark help. But when we do this kind of earmark, we simply pick winners and losers out there. Certain sets of businesses, certain industries, certain individual businesses are helped when others are at a disadvantage because they don't receive that kind of help. 
   So I would simply say that we shouldn't be doing this as the Federal Government when we have such demand on our scarce budget here for other purposes. And we shouldn't be earmarking for this kind of purpose.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit funds in the bill from being used to pay for renovations to a small business incubator at West Virginia University. 
   Like so many of the other organizations listed in the earmark section of this bill, the purpose of this small business incubator is to promote economic development activities by supporting early stage businesses with space, facilities and support services. 
   The West Virginia University Small Business Incubator is over 5,000 square feet of renovated space in the Chestnut Ridge Research Building on the campus of West Virginia University. 
   The businesses that are tenants of the incubator program have access to the staff of professionals, trained interns and West Virginia University resources. Businesses receive guidance in the areas of accounting, advertising, graphic design, information technology, finance, corporate services, marketing, Web design and Web development. 
   That's a lot of advantages they have. I simply don't believe the Federal Government needs to be in the business of helping them further or funding private companies in this way. This is a  form of corporate welfare that so many Members in other settings rail against over and over again. 
   The National Business Incubator Association is an organization that has 905 member organizations, mostly in the United States. There is certainly no reasonable argument that we should be funding all business incubators in this country. So how do we justify funding just a couple of them in this bill? How are they more deserving of the special treatment that we give them in this bill? 
   How should I explain to the taxpayers in my district, or other districts, that they're subsidizing business development projects in West Virginia, or any other State for that matter? 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, again let me just make the point again that there are too many earmarks in this bill that are for business incubators. There are really in many cases earmark incubators. These are earmarks that beget other earmarks. Many are going to organizations that receive additional earmarks or are there for the purpose of receiving additional earmarks. This is one business incubator, and there are hundreds and hundreds of business incubators, 905 in the association. How do we choose to fund just this one? We are picking winners and losers here. We are deciding who is worthy and who is not, and I simply don't think that is fair. It is not a wise use of taxpayer dollars. This business incubator, given the other partners involved, it seems it would be fine without Federal involvement. And I think that we should test that proposition and not fund this earmark. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   But what he missed, as the good gentleman from Indiana mentioned, Senate Majority Whip DICK DURBIN from Illinois, not afflicted with sun spots, by the way, just yesterday said, ``It is time to reinstitute the Fairness Doctrine.'' So I don't think that we are seeing things here. There is a move afoot. 
   Make no mistake, this is targeted at talk radios, where conservatives seem to have done a little better in the marketplace than the other side of the argument. 
   So forgive us for being skeptical that nothing is afoot. But when the majority leader in the Senate says it's time to reinstitute the Fairness Doctrine, I think we're right to be concerned.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (RESTRICT EARMARKS -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say a few things about earmarks this week. 
   Yesterday was not a banner day for Congress. In the House, we approved a budget that had no restrictions on the contemporary practice of earmarking. 
   In the Senate, they turned down an amendment which would have placed a moratorium on earmarks. It went down bad. It went down 71-29. 
   There will come a day, and I think it will come soon, when we get rid of the contemporary practice of earmarking. 
   Now, many in the other body and in this body have tried to defend earmarking by saying that this is a constitutional prerogative, and somehow suggesting and even, some have said, that the Founding Fathers would be rolling over in their graves if they knew we were contemplating a moratorium on earmarks, as if to equate all Federal spending or Congress' power of the purse with earmarking. 
   There is a place for earmarking. There is a place for Congress to say to an administration, you are not adequately addressing this area; therefore, we are going to go through the process of authorization, appropriation, and oversight and tell you how we want money spent. 
   But that's not the contemporary practice of earmarking. The contemporary practice of earmarking is all about hiding your spending, not going through the process of authorization, appropriation and oversight, but rather to circumvent it. That's what it's all about. 
   When you have a bill that comes to the floor, as we did last year and the year before and the year before, several years with up to 2,500 or 3,000 earmarks in them placed just hours before the bill comes to the floor, that is not the appropriate role of Congress; that is not power of the purse that should be exercised. 
   That's an attempt to hide spending and to spend in a way that will benefit you politically. That is simply wrong, and I would suggest that the contemporary practice of earmarking, everybody knows it when they see it. 
   The difference between the proper use of an earmark and an improper use is whether or not you are attempting to hide funding, attempting to have funding slip through the cracks that nobody sees, rather than saying that we are going to authorize, then we are going to appropriate, and then we are going to have oversight. 
   Another myth that is often put forward is that we have to earmark because that's how we maintain control or oversight on the administration when, in truth, the contemporary practice of earmarking means that we do far less oversight. You can look at it empirically. Over the past decade, decade and a half, as we have seen a ramp-up in the area of earmarking, we have actually seen far fewer oversight hearings in the Appropriations Committee. Believe me, when you have 26,000 earmark requests a year for the Appropriations Committee in the House to deal with, you don't have time or resources or the inclination to do the proper oversight on the rest of the budget. 
   By earmarking, we are basically giving up our power of the purse. We are giving up our prerogative just to be able to earmark what amounts to about 1 percent of the Federal budget. We are effectively giving up control of the rest of the Federal budget. When you hear people say that we have to keep earmarking the way we are doing in order to control the Federal bureaucracy, that simply doesn't square with reality. 
   The contemporary practice of earmarking, as we have seen it over the past several years under Republicans and under Democrats, has been a way to hide spending for individual Members' benefits. It has led to corruption, it has led to scandal and will continue to do so until we end it. 
   I would encourage Members of the House and say that we are going to get  there soon enough. People across the country know that this is the wrong thing to do. 
   Senator McCain made the statement yesterday that there is only one town in America that doesn't understand that this is wrong, and that town is Washington, DC. Everywhere else across the country, people understand that this is a practice that has to stop.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, we'll actually hear about this bill for just a minute at least before I talk about energy. But, no, I do have a serious amendment here that simply clarifies that nothing in this bill is meant to authorize appropriations for the new unit of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
   The bill before us today authorizes a study to determine if the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers in Vermont are eligible to be designated wild and scenic rivers. Now, rivers designated as wild and scenic are managed by a number of Department of the Interior agencies, including the National Park Service, Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
   However, if you ask CRS about this, these four agencies have a combined maintenance backlog of between 14 and $22 billion. That is between 14 and $22 billion. And so we are going to be doing a study of another river, a study that often precedes designation. I think that is the purpose of this study, that will then put this river under the Park Service's jurisdiction or the Interior Department, and these agencies will have to manage it. We're adding to a backlog of between 14 and $22 billion. We shouldn't continue to do this. We can't continue to do this. We have parks in my State and everywhere else that have maintenance needs, that have staffing needs, that have needs that are going unmet, and we're going about just adding more to it, without seeking a funding source or anything else. We're simply adding more obligations to the Park Service, and we can't do that. 
   This amendment simply says that nothing in this authorization implies this appropriation will follow. Again, if an appropriation does follow, we are taking from the existing wild and scenic rivers or other designations that our Interior Department has to manage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for accepting the amendment, and I thank the Chair. 
   Now, let me say a few words about energy, since everybody else has. I didn't plan to when I came down here, but I have to say that Republicans will charge, with some justification, that the Democrats have been in charge for the last 2 years and have failed to pass significant substantial energy legislation. Democrats will charge, with some justification, that the Republicans have been in charge for a number of years and failed to do so. 
   We blamed the Senate. We didn't have 60 votes in the Senate. The Democrats can do the same at this point. 
   But here we are today, and we can't continue to look back and say we should have done something before, because we are here today and people are asking, why aren't you passing something? With justification, I might add. 
   Now, one of the speakers mentioned that what the Republicans were proposing was more like a Fred Flintstone bill of some type. And I would have to ask that same speaker how she plans to get home tonight. Unless she has a Flintstone mobile, she's probably riding in something that is powered by gas, maybe a hybrid, unlikely that it's electricity. In fact, less than 1 percent of our current energy needs in this country are produced by solar, which she talked about. Less than 1 percent is produced by wind. 
   Now, in our plan it has plans for increased solar and wind. But if you doubled, if you tripled, if you quadrupled, quintupled, do whatever you want, to solar and wind for a number of years, we are going to rely on our traditional  energy sources. And so it makes sense that, while we are searching for the next big thing, while we wait for a hydrogen economy, or while we wait for wind and solar to really come on-line, or something else that we may not even know of, we have to use the resources that we have. 
   So nobody on this side is really saying drill and drill only. We're saying it has to be part of the mix and it has to be all of the above. 
   So there's plenty of blame to go around. I myself have not voted for one energy bill since I've been here in the past 8 years because I thought that some of them were too subsidy-laden. I didn't think that they really, really allowed us, in a free market way, to go out and use our resources. 
   But going forward, this is what we've got to look at; what are we going to do going forward. It doesn't do anybody any good to say well, the Democrats didn't do anything, or the Republicans didn't. We're here today, and it's time to do something on this. 
   Again, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee and appreciate him accepting this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Yesterday, we passed lobby reform legislation that deals with earmarks, gives Members certain notice. You have to put your name next to it. There is certain transparency and accountability, some of which is good. 
   I should note, with this legislation, in the middle of the night last night we did the equivalent of earmarking on an authorization bill. We, in the middle of the night, designated some 25 hospitals, giving them a different designation, which will save those hospitals millions and millions of dollars. That's the equivalent of appropriation earmarks in an authorization bill, done without debate, without notice. We're getting it now. 
   And there is a process within the executive branch to deal with this. We have circumvented that process and said we're going to do it legislatively. That is simply not right and certainly not in keeping with the spirit of legislation that was passed just yesterday.

Mr. Chairman, I just have to say from the outset that I have been amazed, like the gentleman from Georgia who mentioned a while ago, you would think if you were listening to this debate at home that the only research, the only science research going on in this country is funded by government, and it is simply not the case, gratefully. In fact, just a fraction of the research going on in the scientific field is funded by government. The private sector funds it gratefully. 
   And unfortunately, one can make the case and the case is often made persuasively that as we increase government funding in this area, it displaces private sector funding because companies can then rely on government rather than their own R&D budgets. 
   There is also something called opportunity cost. Whenever you hear the word ``investment'' in terms of government funding, you have to be a little skeptical. You have to say what is the opportunity cost? If you had left this money in the private sector, would it have produced more? You will never know that. But we do know the private sector tends to do things a lot more efficiently than government does. 
   Let me speak to this amendment. This amendment would strike a new pilot project created in this bill. Keep in mind, people will say we cannot cut this bill or whatever else. This is a new program that I am seeking to strike here. 
   This pilot project would award one-year grants to individuals to assist them in improving research proposals that were previously submitted to the National Science Foundation but were not selected for funding. In other words, if you submit an application, it is not approved for funding, the government will give you money to improve the application so it might be approved next year. 
   The man that comes on television, running around in this crazy suit, Matthew Lesko I think is his name, comes to mind here. Are we going to fund like Matthew Lesko? Are we simply saying, all right, here is more money to help you get government money? Are there not sufficient programs within the National Science Foundation that we  should be funding, that we have extra money to actually fund people who did not get the grants to help them improve their proposals that they might get a grant next year? 
   I understand the defense will say, or those defending these grants that this pilot project is intended to help younger scientists who may be losing out on NSF grants because they do not know how to prepare proposals compared to more seasoned researchers or scientists. The answer does not lie in more Federal dollars to help them prepare grant proposals. If there are problems in terms of more tenured scientists getting these proposals, then perhaps we ought to look at the application process and procedures and tweak those or change those rather than say let us spend money and take money out of the National Science Foundation budget and give it to people who were rejected in their funding. 
   This is a tight budget environment. I need not remind the majority that we are in a deficit situation. I would support across-the-board cuts everywhere in government, but boy, to say that we have got to increase the budget here 25 percent over 3 years is a bit steep, and then to create a new program like this one and to say we are going to give money to those who are not getting the programs, and one more thing before I yield back. 
   I have heard from the other side, those defending the current budget and arguing against proposals to actually cut specific programs, that we have a peer review process and that research grants should only be given out that way. I am glad to hear that because my guess is when we come 3 months from now or 2 months from now to the appropriations process, in the SSJC budget, there will be earmarks from that side of the aisle, from this side of the aisle, to fund specific research grants, some of whom were turned down during the peer review process. So this notion that you have got to have peer review and that we do not have the knowledge, I will confess that, but then why in the world are we earmarking like we are? 
   The earmarks are specifically to say I know better than the folks at NSF or folks over here because I am going to give it to my university or somebody who may have lost out on a grant, and so the notion that, hey, you know, you guys do not know what you are talking about when you are trying to cut spending, leave it to the experts, we do not leave it to the experts. The Congress does not leave it to the experts. If we trusted the experts, we would not be earmarking like we are. 
   But, again, back to the specific amendment, this is a new program, a new program to take money from the existing budget of NSF that we have all heard is so important that we have to have for research, and giving it to people who did not get their projects approved, did not get a contract, did not get research dollars to help them prepare research dollars. 
   This reminds me actually of many of the earmarks that you will see in the given months. Many of those are given to people to prepare grants to receive more money.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First, let me point out I have the utmost respect for my friend from Washington. We have worked together on many issues. First, he mentioned that the private sector groups are in support of this legislation and the National Science Foundation. I have no doubt. It doesn't surprise me at all. But I would submit that that's akin to the government saying we are in a position now to fund free lunches for everyone out there, and you can do it on the government's dime. 
   I would say that virtually every company in America would say that's a great idea. Now we don't have to fund that. We don't have to subsidize it for our employees. We can keep the profits, invest them elsewhere. If private companies don't have to expend that money in their R&D budgets, they would like not to. But that was a point I made, that this often supplants money that would be invested in the private sector, probably more efficiently if overall government spending is any guide. 
   To the amendment in specific, the gentleman from Georgia said it well. With all the high-priority items in the National Science Foundation budget, to take money out of that and to give it to those who didn't present a successful proposal would seem to me not the highest-priority use of money. 
   Remember, this is a new program. I am not cutting a program that exists. This is a new pilot project. I just don't think this is a road that we want to go down. I started to mention, before my time ran out before, we have seen this in other fields, in other earmark fields, where people are funding business consortiums. Many of the earmarks in this body go to business consortiums to help them draft grant proposals to get other earmarks or to get grants from government or to lobby to get earmarks. It's simply not a road that we want to go down as a Congress, I would submit. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, it's no secret that earmarks are not fairly distributed. But with the new disclosure rules in place this year, for the first time it's been documented. In an analysis of House-passed appropriation bills, CQ Weekly and Taxpayers for  Common Sense found that a disproportionate share of earmarks went to relatively few Members of Congress. 
   Now, obviously Federal priorities are not concentrated in the districts of appropriators and leadership. Those Members are simply in a better position to steer Federal money home. That's hardly a defensible way of spending taxpayer money. 
   I've often said that we had higher aspirations when we were elected than to grovel for crumbs that fall from the appropriators' table. But given the lopsided share of earmarks that appropriators got this year, here's hoping that enough Members will finally say, why bother, and we can finally end this practice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, recently I introduced a bill to repeal some of the legislative provisions that have led to an artificial demand for ethanol. H.R. 5911, the Remove Incentives for Producing Ethanol Act of 2008, or RIPE Act, repeals the renewable fuel standard, repeals tax credits for ethanol producers, and repeals tariffs and duties on imported ethanol. These incentives are giving ethanol producers a guaranteed market for their product. 
   Domestic corn, already a heavily subsidized commodity, has been the primary source of biofuel, and the mandate has encouraged farmers to focus agriculture production away from food production toward fuel production. The Department of Agriculture has said that the biofuel mandate has raised fuel prices as much as 20 percent. 
   In addition, ethanol's role as a supposed savior for our energy woes has been severely overstated. Ethanol as a fuel yields about 30 percent less energy per gallon than a gallon of gasoline. This is what happens when government picks winners and losers in the economy and the marketplace. Just 4 months ago, we were convinced we had a winner. It's turned out to be a big loser. 
   We need to remove the incentive. I urge support of H.R. 5911.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I got a kick out of a recent warning made by the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. He cautioned Members that if congressional negotiators were forced to make additional cuts in  this year's spending bills, that he just might do away with all earmarks in the bill. Well, that may pass for a threat here in Washington, but taxpayers all over the country are applauding. 
   Despite the perception that many in Congress seem to have that taxpayers are eagerly awaiting the completion of appropriation bills to see if their earmarks ended up in the bill for their hometown, taxpayers, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, are applauding. They think that earmarks are a waste of money. 
   Chairman Obey has said on many occasions that if it were up to him, he would do away with earmarks altogether; they are a waste of his time and his committee's resources. I couldn't agree more. In fact, I can't think of a better Christmas present to Chairman Obey than releasing him from the stress and hassle of having to deal with our earmarks. I'm sure he would be grateful, and our constituents would be grateful even more.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as was mentioned, you could easily say that there are unfunded mandates in the bill. You could also say there is a particular earmark in the bill. Because the bill didn't go through regular order and we don't have a committee report to go along with it, there was not a certification that came saying that there were no earmarks in the bill. 
   Of particular concern is a provision that would allow New York City to keep up to $2 billion worth of the employer share of payroll taxes and invest the funds in a transportation project. This is not the first time we have seen this. The New York Liberty Zone Tax Credit earmark was included in a previous energy bill passed by the House, but it was removed by the Senate. 
   Now, I think we can all quibble about where the benefits go on some of these things, but it's clear that the target here is New York City. It's a targeted tax provision, and it's what we typically refer to as an earmark in the authorizing bill. And I would say that if it looks like an earmark and acts like an earmark, it is one. And it shouldn't be in this bill unless there is some kind of certification or something that is not an earmark. I just don't know how you can call it anything but that. This is just another example of how little impact Congress's steps to reform the process have actually had in the day-to-day operation of the House. 
   For a point of order against an earmark to be rejected, the chairman needs to simply insert a statement into the Record saying there are no earmarks in the bill, and then the point of order can't be lodged. Here we don't even have that kind of statement, and still we are saying a point of order can't be lodged in this regard. 
   So I would say that we ought to reject this bill for many reasons, not the least of which it's going to blow a $2 billion hole in the budget here for a limited specific tax provision benefiting only one group across the country. 
   With that, I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, new earmark reforms required that Members' names be attached to their earmarks. Unfortunately, transparency alone has done little but air our dirty laundry without cleaning it. Transparency is not a substitute for oversight. Earmarks have names next to them now, but little else has changed. The House has approved thousands and thousands and thousands of earmarks so far this year, and more are likely to be added in the conference committees. However, we know full well that not all of these earmarks were given the scrutiny that Federal expenditures deserve. 
   Every week, I highlight an earmark by making an admittedly lame joke about it, but we need a process that inspires confidence, not jokes or humor. And, unfortunately, transparency alone has not gotten us there. 
   Until this body has a process that can trusted, Mr. Speaker, I believe the taxpayers would be best served by a moratorium on earmarks, and I will soon introduce legislation to impose such a moratorium.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is noncontroversial. I assume it will be accepted by the other side. It's similar to an amendment that was offered earlier this year on an unrelated bill. 
   The amendment simply seeks to ensure that the competitive grant program established and authorized by this bill does not become a vehicle to be earmarked later. I am not alleging that there are any earmarks in this bill; there are not. There's simply a competitive grant program established. 
   My fear is that later on that this grant--that is a competitive grant and it was based on merit for those who apply--will be later earmarked, as has happened in other legislation.  
   My amendment to H.R. 1338, The Paycheck Fairness Act is a common sense amendment that would simply prohibit the earmarking of funds authorized by this bill for a new grant program. 
   In section five of the legislation, a new grant program is created to carry out programs to train girls and women in negotiating tactics. 
   This new grant program is explicitly authorized in the legislation to make grants on a competitive basis to eligible entities. I offer this amendment simply as a precaution in order to avoid future earmarking. 
   Earlier this year, a similar amendment was approved by the House of Representatives during consideration of the Beach Act of 2007 by a vote of 263 to 117. 
   When it comes to earmarking, the message is clear: just because Congress hasn't earmarked an account or a grant program before doesn't mean we won't in the future. My amendment makes no substantive change to the grant program included in the legislation and is simply offered as a safeguard against future earmarking. 
   Judging by the nearly four and a half billion dollars worth of earmarks that have been reported out of the Committee on Appropriations this summer, it appears that, even with all the talk of earmark reform this year, it's business as usual. 
   Unfortunately, when it comes to earmarking, business as usual means Congressional earmarks showing up in programs and accounts that never used to have them. 
   The worst example of this is the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. 
   Kept relatively earmark-free from its inception in order to keep politics out of spending decisions, the earmarking truce was broken when the 2008 omnibus spending bill contained 128 earmarks worth more than $400 million in Homeland Security funding. 
   Included were 95 earmarks for the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program, a competitive grant program with a 70-page guidance document for grant applicants that had not previously been earmarked. 
   If the Fiscal Year 2009 Homeland Security appropriations bill approved by committee becomes law, then the earmarking of the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program will continue with nearly 25 million dollars, or one third of the program funds, already having been spent by Members earmarking funds for their own districts. 
   Emergency Operations Centers funding is another example of earmarks encroaching into a previously non-earmarked program. 
   Created last year by Congress, fifteen million earmark-free dollars were appropriated, to be awarded through a formula-based grant program for the ``equipping, upgrading, and constructing of Emergency Operations Centers.'' 
   This year's Homeland Security appropriations bill proposes increasing Emergency Operations Center funding to 35 million dollars--but also would earmark nearly sixty percent of this funding by including 34 earmarks worth more than 21 million dollars. 
   Unfortunately, these examples of earmarking competitive programs are not lone cases. Another example is a program funded through the Department of Housing and Urban Development called the Economic Development Initiative. 
   This program started in 1994 as a competitive program with strict selection-based criteria to assist with low-income housing and neighborhood development. Over time, the program became a prime target for earmarkers and, by 2000, the competitive program was not funded and the program was entirely made up of earmarks. 
   A similar story can be told about the Byrne Discretionary Grant program. This program was established in 2006 as a competitive grant program where awards are to be evaluated by a peer review system and other review processes. Allegedly, the program has remained that way, however, the agency that administers the program still calls it a competitive program but the account was heavily earmarked last year and it appears that earmarking has been adopted as the standard operating practice. 
   In fact, should the Commerce Justice and Science Committee Report approved by the Appropriations become law, there will be 280 earmarks for the Byrne Discretionary Grant account, alone. 
   The message is clear: just because we haven't earmarked an account or a grant program before doesn't mean we won't in the future. 
   With few opportunity this session to deal directly with the broken earmarking process, the least we can do is explicitly prohibit earmarks in programs or accounts that provide funding on a formula or competitive basis. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.  
   With that, I would like to ask if this amendment will be accepted by the other side and reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this is really a simple amendment. It simply says that all earmarks in this bill will be taken out. This is consistent with the Republican budget that was passed. So I'd remind my colleagues on this side of the aisle that you have already voted, in essence, for this amendment. We passed a budget which said that we should have a moratorium on earmarks this year. That's what this amendment would do with regard to this bill. It would simply say that there would be no earmarks, Republican or Democratic, for this legislation. Now, supporters of earmarks will often say that this will lead to a more Democratic allocation of Federal resources and funds, but I'd like to draw your attention to a chart here. 
   This is the MilCon bill that we're looking at right here. If you took the dollar amount of the earmarks in this legislation, which is just north of $600 million, and spread it evenly across all House districts, it would mean about $1.4 million across each district in this country, but that, obviously, is not what we have in this legislation. 
   If you'll look, the majority leadership is associated with an average of $6.2 million in earmarks in this legislation. That's about four times the average of rank-and-file Members in the House. Vulnerable Members, so-called vulnerables, identified by each party receive $7.7 million, or associated with that much, in earmarks. That is, I think, four or five times more than the rank-and-file Member. If you're on the Appropriations Committee, you get about $10.5 million. Now, that's about, I think, seven times as much as a rank-and-file Member in this body will get. 
   So I guess you could make the argument or try to make the argument that those military installations or those facilities across this country that happen to be in districts represented by an appropriator are more needy or are somehow in greater need of Federal funds than those facilities located in rank-and-file Members' districts. I don't think you could make that argument with a straight face. You simply can't. This is consistent with bill after bill after bill. 
   Unfortunately, this is likely to be the only appropriations bill that we have this session. We're not likely to get to the others, so this is our only chance to actually speak up and say that we know that this process isn't working very well and that we have to fix it. 
   There has been a lot of talk about earmark reform over the last couple of years, as well there should have been, both when we have controlled this body and when those across the aisle have controlled it, but very little has changed, and this chart shows it. Very little has changed. It is very much a spoil system. It's not a system where--I'm sure we'll be told in just a few minutes--these earmarks were vetted by the Pentagon and that this is a different process than we have for other bills, but let me tell you: 
   Did the Pentagon vet this process and say, ``You know, we think that those who are in appropriators' districts deserve seven times more than those who are in a rank-and-file district''? I don't think the Pentagon went through that vetting process. 
   Now, if we don't like the way that the administration and the Pentagon award Federal grants--and I agree there may be problems with it--let's exercise the oversight that we're supposed to exercise in this body. Under article I, we have the power of the purse, and we should conduct oversight, but simply saying ``we don't like the way the administration allocates funds, so we're going to pile on 130 earmarks in this bill, as skewed as the allocation will be, and somehow we'll fix it'' is not an appropriate way to do it, and we know it. We know that this process is broken. Yet we're continuing this year, just like in other years, and we can't continue to go on. 
   Let me just bring that chart out again. Again, what we have is, if the money were to be spread out among districts, it would be about an allocation of $1.4 million. Instead, we have up here those facilities in appropriators' districts that receive seven times more than others. That's simply not right. There is no way you can make with a straight face an argument that those districts, that those facilities in those districts, somehow need more Federal funds. There is no way with a straight face you can make the argument that this hasn't become a spoil system where we're doling out by favor to just those who are in a powerful position. That's what this process has become, and we should stand up today and say, by golly, we're going to fix it, that we're going to do something different for a change, that we're going to vote until we can fix this process, until we can say we have a sound process where these earmarks are vetted either in the Appropriations Committee or elsewhere, and that we're just not going to continue with this anymore. 
   Let me tell you that this institution has had as its hallmark over the centuries the process of authorization, appropriation and oversight. We have short-circuited that process with earmarking, the contemporary practice of earmarking in particular. So we do too little authorizing, very little oversight and simply too much appropriating. When you deal with, as the Appropriations Committee did last year, I think, 36,000 earmark requests, there is absolutely no way that this body can adequately vet those earmark requests, let alone exercise oversight over the rest of the Federal budget as is our purview and as we should be doing. 
   So I would appeal to the Members both on this side and on the other side of the aisle. Let's fix this system before we go on. A great way to do it is to say let's adopt this amendment and say we'll have no earmarks in this bill this year until we can come up with a better process. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the words that have been spoken. I appreciate the passion of those who are defending the bill as it is. 
   And let me just say this is not my favorite bill to come and propose earmark amendments to. Not at all. But this is the only chance we have got. I'd love to come here with Labor-HHS. I'm glad that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee mentioned that there are a couple of bills where earmarks are legitimate, but maybe for the rest they're not. I have heard him say before that when he left as chairman in 1994, there were no earmarks in the Labor-HHS bill; yet today I think last year there were close to 2,000. There were a couple of years, I know, and we are not breaking that trend very much. And we are likely to see that again later this year, but we won't have an opportunity to come to the floor and debate that. It's likely to be stuffed into an omnibus bill and we take it or leave it with no vetting whatsoever. At least here we have a chance on one bill to point out the flaws in the system, and the flaws I pointed out. 
   The gentleman from Texas made a great point. He said that not all wisdom resides with the executive, that somebody in a basement somewhere in some Federal office hasn't had some epiphany about how to spend money. I accept that completely. But it stands to reason as well that some lowly rank-and-file Member who is getting an average of $1.4 million in this bill doesn't have any less knowledge than a vulnerable Member, a Member who is in a swing district, in a tough district, in a tough race. Does that somehow imbue you with some knowledge about how much money would be spent in the MilCon bill or if you're on the Appropriations Committee? And it may not be. These numbers may be off a little. I accept that. It's not perfect. But how in the world with a straight face can you say this is not a spoils system, this has not become a spoils system?

   Mr. FLAKE. My largest complaint with the earmark process is not what we spent in the waste in some bills, maybe not in this one, maybe in others, a lot in others. My biggest complaint has always been with the earmark process; that we, as Members of Congress, give up our authority under article I because we ignore, with our zeal to earmark 2 percent or 1 percent of the Federal budget, we have basically called a truce with the administration saying we will ignore your willy-nilly spending if you ignore ours. 
   So we let bills like the Department of Homeland Security bill, $32 billion, very little of it earmarked, but so much of it wasted because we are so intent on earmarking our little portion that we just don't do the oversight that we're supposed to do under article I, and you can look at empirically, anecdotally, any way you look at it. 
   I commissioned the GAO awhile ago to look at the Appropriations Committee, since 1994, since the contemporary practice of earmarking really got started, under Republicans. I concede that. And if you look at the number of witnesses called, the number of hearings held, any way you slice it or dice it, we aren't doing the oversight that we once did, since the contemporary practice of earmarking started. And I would submit that that's true across the board. But if you look specifically at this bill, there is no way that you can say that this isn't a spoils system. 
   When facilities residing in appropriators' districts get about seven times as much. Maybe it's six. Maybe it's five. Maybe it's eight. But with that kind of average, something is wrong. And that's what we are saying here. We have got to fix this system. We should fix it before we move on. 
   I appreciate the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell) for the work that he has done and for cosponsoring this amendment and for those who have spoken on it. And I would just say again this is our only chance. This looks like this is it for the year to actually have a voice on earmarks and to say enough is enough, it's time to change the process. 
   So I urge my colleagues to accept the amendment, and I appreciate the gentleman for yielding.

   It was once said of someone who didn't know exactly where he was going that he was traipsing down a flower-strewn path unpricked by thorns of reason. I don't think there's a better description of what this budget is, than that, traipsing down a flower-strewn path unpricked by thorns of reason. 
   We were just told the other day, the gentleman from Texas mentioned it, that when you include all unfunded liabilities, not just the national debt out there, but all the money that we promise to pay out, that every American citizen owes something like $500,000. Nearly half a million dollars for every person living. Yet, this budget does nothing to change the course of that. 
   We will be adding a couple trillion dollars every year in fact that this budget is in place. Over the next 5 years we will go from something like $39 trillion to $52 trillion in unfunded liabilities. 
   I am not here to defend our record as Republicans when we were here. We did terrible, frankly, in terms of reining in spending. We added a new entitlement program, Medicare part D, which Democrats by and large voted against. If you didn't like it, please repeal it now. Some of us on this side didn't either. But it's bankrupting us and we can't continue to traipse down a flower-strewn path unpricked by thorns of reason. 
   These budgets have consequences, and the consequence here is we are saddling future generations with untold debt, debt that you can't even contemplate, debt that dwarfs most Americans' personal debt, a mortgage that they pay on a house, that they owe to their Federal Government. Yet we still continue to add program after program, new entitlements, new spending. 
   Just last week, a huge massive bloated farm bill was passed. Just yesterday, we were getting into construction for school facilities. We can't continue to do this. 
   Please reject this budget.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I didn't plan to speak on the bill itself. I already spoke on the rule. But I have been hearing some of the conversation in my office and felt I had to come down. 
   The honorable majority leader mentioned that there are things in this bill we have seen before. That's not entirely true. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of earmarks that we have not seen before. Now, some of them are part of the bills that passed without earmarks, MilCon or homeland security. But in the case of homeland security, we were told we could do that because that's not a bill that is traditionally earmarked. It hasn't been. 
   Well, it is now. There are more than 100 earmarks there. 
   And the gentleman from Wisconsin mentioned that in Labor-HHS, there were only earmarks added for new Members who are coming because they are entitled to representation. 
   I would suggest that nobody is entitled to get earmarks. You're entitled  here, as a Member of Congress, to exercise oversight in how the Federal agencies spend money. It doesn't entitle you to get earmarks. 
   And, also, on that same point, we have the Energy and Water bill that we did consider, and there were hundreds, if not, I think, close to 1,000 earmarks there. Well, we added 34 more. I will just highlight one of them. There's one for the Northwest Regional Planning Commission manufacturing conversion for energy efficiency, a $5 million earmark.

   Mr. FLAKE. I said 34, but I will take your correction. Thank you. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, these were earmarks that were added in addition to what was there before. They were air-dropped. They are earmarks that we haven't seen before that we do not have an opportunity here to strike or even debate. I mean, there are some of them that are simply for a city. We are told Findlay, Ohio, will get $100,000. For what? Ottawa, Ohio, $100,000. For what? We don't know. The City of Santa Clarita, California, will get $41,000. For what? We have no idea. 
   We simply don't know what's in this bill. How can we be voting on it?

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, those of us who have teenage kids at home know very well the saying ``nothing good happens after midnight.'' That is why you have a curfew. Nothing good happens after midnight. 
   I would say the same holds true when you are putting together an omnibus. Here is what you get when you pass an omnibus and you present it after midnight; 34 pounds, some 3,400 pages of documents here that we have no idea what is in there. Any Member who says that he has read it isn't telling you the truth. Nobody has read through this thing. We will be discovering for months items that are in this bill that we simply don't know. Preliminary analysis, and you will hear me say this several times, because that is all you can do is a preliminary analysis, a cursory reading will tell you that there are 9,241 earmarks in this omnibus bill. 
   Now, we earlier in the year passed a couple of bills without any earmarks in saying we would probably be nearly earmark free when it comes to the omnibus, or when it comes to the end of the year, MILCON and I think Homeland Security, because typically, particularly Homeland Security, that bill is not traditionally earmarked. Well, guess what? It is now. There are well over 100 earmarks in the Homeland Security one, and I think over 150 in the MILCON, earmarks that I have never seen, I don't think anyone in this body has seen until midnight last night. So those are air-dropped earmarks, more than 300 of them, I think, in this bill that we have had no opportunity to see, let alone challenge on the House floor, we are just seeing for the first time now. 
   Let me just give you an idea of what happens when you do things after midnight. Here are a few of the earmarks that were slipped in. These, by the way, we are always told that you have to leave it open to air-dropped earmarks because there are vital things that need to be done. Maybe there is a natural disaster somewhere, something that you have to account for. Well, here is what was added last night. One was a $1.8 million earmark for the East Capitol Center for Change, Capitol Area Asset Building Corporation, and the National Center for Fatherhood to administer Marriage Development Accounts in the District of Columbia. That is something that couldn't wait for a regular bill to go through? Did we have to do that in the middle of the night? How about $400,000 for the Burchfield-Penny Art Center in Buffalo? The Burchfield-Penny Art Center was so important that we had to air-drop it into this bill and not have any challenge, any way to challenge it on the House floor. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that we agreed in the transparency rules earlier this year that if there were air-dropped earmarks into a bill, we would have an opportunity to offer a point of  order to strike them out, to at least eliminate them. We can't do that here because this is not a conference report. This is an amendment between the Houses. 
   We have had that before. Rules are only as good as your willingness to enforce them, and we have seen a pattern of unwillingness to enforce the rules or to seek ways around them. Now, some will stand up and brag and say, Hey, we have 40 percent fewer earmarks here than we had 2 years ago. They will say we have 40 percent fewer, the dollar value is down. Well, if you look at last year, we have, I think the figure is, about 400 percent more earmarks than last year. It is hardly, hardly a mark of fiscal discipline to have 9,200 earmarks in this bill when you have already had 2,000 pass in the defense bill. For one, that is not a 40 percent reduction, and two, it is about a 400 percent addition to last year. 
   Let's reject this rule and reject this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to the rule. 
   The authorizing committee saw fit to include some 680 earmarks that we got news of just yesterday in the bill. Yet I offered four amendments to debate these earmarks and wasn't allowed any of them. 
   If they can allow 680 earmarks at the last minute in a bill, you would think that the Rules Committee could have seen fit to at least allow debate on a few of them. 
   The earmarks include $5 million for Diminishing Manufacturing Sources for Automation Alley in Troy, Michigan; $2 million for the Physician Order Entry Initiative for Mission Hospitals, which is a private hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, and keep in mind this is a Defense authorization bill here; $10 million for Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, a former naval shipyard being economically revitalized with taxpayer dollars, defense dollars, for the city of San Francisco; and $500,000 for Rapid Identification of Technology Sources for the San Diego East County Economic Development Council. 
   Our role here should be to ensure that our Defense dollars are spent on defense, not economic revitalization, not nondefense private ventures. That is why these amendments were offered. Unfortunately, the only shot we might have at checking these amendments is in the appropriations process. By the time we get there, the Members will say these projects were authorized, implying that there was some sort of scrutiny given when there surely has not been. 
   So, unfortunately, we cannot support this rule. It doesn't allow debate on any of the 680 earmarks in the bill.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, if this represents reform, I would hate to see what the Ag Committee calls a boondoggle. We have here not just a continuation of all the programs we had before, some even at higher levels; we have a new program. 
   As the gentleman from Wisconsin mentioned, there was an article in the Washington Post today detailing the ACRE program. The ACRE program is a new program where subsidies will kick in at far higher levels than they ever have before. In fact, just take corn, for example. If corn hits $3.50 a bushel, where it was just a year or two ago, at historic highs for the time, if we hit that again, that will trigger subsidies totaling about $10 billion a year, in addition to everything we are doing today. 
   That is not reform. That is far away from reform, and how somebody can stand up today and with a straight face say this is reform, I just don't know.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to the gentleman from Virginia responding to my statement about the ACRE program and the potential for taxpayer liability here. 
   The reason that the CBO scored it as a net savings is because of what is called baseline shopping. It was done with this bill, where we actually reached back and chose to base the bill on a baseline, a prior year baseline, when corn prices, when wheat prices, when soybean prices weren't as high. Had we used this year's baseline or this year's projections, then we would see that next year, for example, when this kicks in, that you could have corn at $4.25 a bushel still receiving subsidies.  Now, keep in mind $4.25 is higher than corn has ever been, until this year.     
   And so dropping back to just what it was before this year will trigger subsidies that would not have been triggered before. That is not reform. That is not reform at all. That is soaking the taxpayers. That is farming the taxpayers rather than the land.

   Mr. FLAKE. I just want to address some of the comments that have been made. It's been said several times that this bill is good because it's a bipartisan bill. If this is the standard by which we judge legislation, then we're doing pretty poorly in this House. 
   If anybody remembers, just a couple of years ago, the infamous bill that brought us the Bridge to Nowhere. Do you want to know how bipartisan that bill was? I believe it was 412 votes for, 8 votes against. If that isn't bipartisan, what is? 
   Yet who would want that vote back if they could? 6,300 earmarks, with a lot of bad ones, including the infamous Bridge to Nowhere. And yet we laud legislation simply because it's bipartisan. 
   I would love to see a lot more partisanship in this House when it comes to fiscal discipline. I wish that my  party, the Republican Party, would stand up and say, anybody who believes in limited government cannot support a bill like this, a $300 billion bill that is bipartisan because so many groups are now involved. 
   You do a specialty crop title; you add another subsidy program called ACRE, you get biomass in it, you get cellulosic ethanol, you add another nutrition program, and pretty soon you have so many people in it that they don't dare vote against it, and it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger, and pretty soon you have a $300 billion bill that you can only pay for by shopping for a baseline other than this year's baseline, and waive PAYGO requirements. That's why this is a bipartisan bill. 
   I would hope, in a week where a major news organization published, and I hope it set off some alarm bells here, that not only do we have about 9 or $10 trillion in debt, but when you add in the unfunded liabilities, it adds up to about a half a million dollars per person in this country, the amount of debt and unfunded obligation that we're on the hook for. 
   If we cannot, in this legislation, tell a farm entity, a farm couple that earns as much as $2.5 million that they can no longer collect farm subsidies, how in the world are you going to tell a grandmother, you're going to have to postpone your retirement for a couple of years because we can't afford your Social Security payment? 
   How in the world are you going to tell somebody, you know, you're going to have to have a higher copay on Medicare for prescription drugs because we have a big farm bill like this? 
   We need to be more responsible, and I would urge us to sustain the President's veto. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (EARMARKS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I will speak for a minute and then refer to a few charts. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise to draw attention to earmarks contained in the Homeland Security appropriations bill. We may not even have any appropriations bills on the floor this year. What may happen is that we will simply do a continuing resolution in September and then sometime in January do a big omnibus bill, and all of the earmarks, the thousands and thousands and thousands of earmarks that have been put into the bills through the appropriations process that have never been to the floor, will simply be approved with one vote. So it behooves us to do what we can to actually highlight what some of these earmarks are. Now, we know some of the earmarks that are in the Homeland Security bill, and we hope that it comes to the floor. It likely will not, so we'll talk about one of them here. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is in the Homeland Security bill something called the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program. Now, this has not traditionally been earmarked in the Homeland Security bill. It only started last year. Last year and this year, we have earmarked some $75 million total for this account. Now, in this account, some $500,000 was earmarked for Westchester and Rockland Counties in New York for pre-disaster mitigation earmarks. This comes on the heels of the same counties getting about $1 million last year. 
   Now, New York State has its share of disasters. I think there were 21 Presidential disaster declarations over the past 10 years, but there were just as many in other States, other States that had to go through the regular process whereby grants were awarded on the basis of merit rather than on the basis of: Do we have an appropriator? Do we have a high-level Member of leadership who can get us an earmark for some of these programs? 
   For example, in parts of Oklahoma, they had 20 disaster areas declared in the last 10 years. Yet Oklahoma hasn't received a dime in earmark funding in this bill. They must not have an appropriator here. 
   We often endlessly hear that Members of Congress know their districts better than some faceless bureaucrat; that's why they've got to earmark, but let me ask: Does a member of the Appropriations Committee or a Member of leadership know his district better than a rank and file Member? Because the former are getting most of the earmarks at the expense of the latter. 
   Let me refer to this chart. On this chart, in the last 2 years, for pre-disaster mitigation earmarks in the Homeland Security bill, rank and file Members have gotten about 37 percent of the earmarks. Here, appropriators and other highly ranked Members have gotten 63 percent. Of the $75 million total, 63 percent of the earmarks are received by just 27 percent of the Members in this body. 
   Now, again, do those 27 percent know their districts better than others? I would suggest not. It's just that they're in a position to get these earmarks. So all of this hifalutin language about, you know, ``we know our districts'' means just this: ``I'm in a position to get money for my district at the expense of others whether or not there's a Federal nexus, whether or not there's a real need.'' 
   Let me just point out that, in terms of Westchester and Rockland Counties, out of all of the thousands of counties in the country, only 11 were wealthier than Westchester County in New York. Does Westchester County really need $500,000 in pre-disaster mitigation earmarks at the expense of some poor county somewhere else in the country? This earmarking, as we all know, has gotten completely, completely out of control. 
   Let me just go to a couple of other charts. One of the other often used justifications for earmarks is that we as the legislative branch have the power of the purse. Article I gives us the power of the purse. That is certainly true. That is often taken as justification for doing the earmarking that we currently do, for the contemporary practice of earmarking. Well, at my request, I asked CRS to actually look and see what the Appropriations Committee has been doing over the past several years as the practice of earmarking has really grown. 
   As you can see, from the 104th Congress to the 109th Congress, this is the line here. This is earmarking. We've gone from about 1,500 earmarks up to nearly 10,000 just on this chart, but when you look at the number of witnesses called before the Appropriations Committee for a hearing to actually look at what we're spending, that line goes down. That line is in the blue. 
   So what we're seeing is that, as earmarking has grown, real oversight has declined any way you look at it. If you want to look at numbers of witnesses, some people will say, well, you can't tell everything from that. I concede that. 
   So let's look at the number of days of hearings. Here in the blue, from the 104th Congress to the 109th, we've had a decline in the number of days of hearings, yet a huge increase in earmarking. 
   Keep in mind that another justification for earmarking is people will say, well, that only represents about 2 percent of the Federal budget. We ought to really worry about the rest of the budget, not just earmarking. Well, that's true. We should worry about the rest of the budget, but because of earmarking, we simply aren't. 
   Now, I would suggest the reason that there are fewer days of hearings and that the reason the number of witnesses has declined and that also the number of survey and investigation staff reports has declined as earmarks have grown is we simply don't have the time or the resources or the inclination, frankly, on the Appropriations Committee to actually do real oversight. 
   So, for getting just a couple percentage points of all of the Federal spending designated to earmarks, we really give up the power of the purse that we have. That's why we've seen other spending, all discretionary spending, grow by leaps and bounds as we've had earmarking go up; we simply don't look at the rest of the spending. 
   We all know that the party that is now in the majority has made a lot of hay over the past couple of years that, in this Congress, there was a culture of corruption. If that were the case, certainly earmarks were the currency of corruption. That continues. It simply opens up too many opportunities when Members of Congress can without real oversight write checks to people from home, either to campaign contributors or to constituent groups or to anybody. Unless we really come on the floor and do real oversight, this is going to happen. When you have a process like it looks like we're going to have this year where we don't even have appropriations bills on the floor where we can challenge these earmarks, these earmarks go unchallenged. 
   That, Mr. Speaker, I think, is certainly unacceptable. This body deserves better. We have a great and storied institution here, and we have a time-honored process of authorization, appropriation and oversight. We have skirted that for the past several years. Those in power now might point out, from the 104th Congress to the 109th, that was all under Republican rule. That is true. But the trend has not changed since we've had the new majority.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (EARMARK LIMITATION AMENDMENT -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, every year now we hear a lot of high-minded rhetoric about earmarks and how earmarks represent Congress' Article I authority, that we earmark in Congress because we have the power of the purse and we are simply exercising that power. 
   But the reality belies that claim. Let me talk about one earmark tonight that will give just an example of how this high-minded rhetoric that we often hear is so wrong. 
   We may not even get appropriation bills on the floor this year. We may not have any. It may be that we simply do a continuing resolution to fund appropriations for the next fiscal year; and then in January have a big omnibus bill and all of the earmarks, the thousands that have been put as part of the bill that we haven't even seen on the House floor, will be dumped into the bill. 
   So all we can do, I guess, is come to the floor in a forum like this when we are not even officially challenging the earmarks, but to highlight what a waste some of these earmarks are. 
   This earmark that I want to talk about tonight is $200,000 in funding for the Advantage West Economic Development Group's Certified Entrepreneurial Community Program in North Carolina. There are a number of earmarks similar to this in the Labor-HHS bill which we won't see later this year. These are funds set aside for economic development, business incubators and workforce programs. 
   I would never argue, nor would any of us in our campaign literature, that this is a proper role and function of government. Yet we see time and again earmark after earmark to fund these kinds of programs. 
   This is not the first time I have challenged an earmark for this specific group. In fact, last year I came to the floor and argued that this group need not have Federal funds to carry out its objective. I say this because Advantage West Economic Development Group's Website has a long list of corporate sponsors, including BB&T, BellSouth, Qualcomm, Sprint, UBS, Verizon and Wachovia. In addition to more than 80 corporate sponsors listed, the group also counts the National Park Service, National Endowment for the Arts and the U.S. Department of Commerce as ``funding partners.'' 
   On top of that, the group received a $282,000 earmark in last year's appropriation bill. 
   So why in the world, Mr. Speaker, with so much financial support coming here should this group receive an additional subsidy? It simply makes no sense at all. 
   I think that we ought to mention here, as was mentioned in the July 9 issue of Roll Call, that we often hear that earmarks are given out because Members know their districts much better than faceless bureaucrats in some department.     
   But why is it, then, if there is such a noble purpose for earmarks, and the Members are simply knowing their district and getting these districts, why is  there such a disproportionate allocation of earmarks? Why are so many going to leadership or so-called vulnerable Members on one side. 
   Why are earmarks given out to Members who are at risk of losing their election? According to a Roll Call article just a few days ago, it said that ``Sixteen Democrats in the `Frontline' program, aimed at protecting the 29 most vulnerable House Democrats, secured $810,000 worth of earmarks each'' in the Labor-HHS bill. This is not a one-sided effort. It's not just the Democrats, it's my party as well. 
   The article went on to say, ``Among the 23 Republican incumbents participating in the `Regain Our Majority Program' this cycle, 14 secured $900,000 or more in the Labor-HHS bill. 
   ``Twelve of those--the Republicans pulled down $1 million or more in the CJS bill, with 8 of them securing $1.5 million each.'' 
   Again, why is it, after we hear all this lofty rhetoric about earmarks, because we know our constituents best, why is it that the only ones that really know their constituents best are those who are at risk of not being re-elected back to this body? It simply doesn't make sense. It cheapens this institution. We are a better institution than that, and we should, we should respect this institution more than that and respect taxpayers' money more than that. 
   Also, another reason that's often given for earmarks is that we need to provide oversight. Earmarking is a way to provide oversight, because, after all, we know better than those bureaucrats on how to spend money. 
   I asked the Congressional Research Service to do a little research to see where the actual oversight in Congress has gone since the contemporary practice of earmarking has really started in the mid-1990s. If you look at the 104th Congress, we just had--not very many earmarks. By the time we got to the 109th Congress, we were up around, I think, the final numbers were about 15,000 earmarks. Yet the oversight hearings actually go down. That's not a legitimate reason for earmarking.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today a bit disappointed but unfortunately not surprised. On December 4, just a week ago, the House of Representatives passed a motion to instruct conferees to remove the earmarks from this authorization.     
   That vote passed by a margin of 249-160. 
   Now, I have a little bit of experience with amendments trying to strike earmarks, and I don't think I've ever come close to 249. That's a significant number of votes. That was a bipartisan total, in that 60 Democrats joined Republicans to oppose these earmarks; yet these earmarks remain in the conference report. Every House earmark that was added remain in the conference report. 
   Simply put, if controversial earmarks like these can remain in a report and aren't eliminated, what earmark will ever be eliminated? When will we ever get around to eliminating these? 
   Let me just remind you that procedural irregularities surrounded the consideration of this bill when it came to the House. The earmark list required by the House rules was not submitted with the House report. The amendment review procedure was flawed. Members didn't have the critical time necessary to review these earmarks. In fact, the earmark list, when we finally got it, was submitted after the deadline to go to the Rules Committee to offer the amendments that would be considered. So we got the list of earmarks after the deadline to oppose them. So we had considerable irregularities going into this. And then we have a vote where the majority of this House, a clear majority, 249 Members, 60 Members of the majority party, said please remove these earmarks; yet they remain. They're still here. Why are we doing that? Why are we doing that? If we can't remove these controversial earmarks, when will we ever remove any earmarks? 
   Let me remind you as well there have been numerous, numerous newspaper articles, media accounts since that time about these same earmarks; some of the private companies they are going to, what kind of consideration or scrutiny was given. I can tell you, very little, if we don't even get the list in time to be able to offer amendments to strike them and then we're presented with a conference report where we have no opportunity to strike individual earmarks after a majority of the House has said let's remove them all. Why are we bringing this bill up? Why are we being urged to vote ``yes'' on this? I would ask the majority, please tell us. 
   As mentioned, I attempted before to convene a secret session to provide a review of the classified earmarks in the bill. That was defeated. But I would ask my colleagues who are associated with the 23 House earmarks in this bill to please voluntarily give them up. Concede that no proper scrutiny was given. And I will offer legislation in the next session to actually defund each of these earmarks in this authorization bill. 
   And I would encourage all of those, and I look forward to having all of the 249 Members who voted to remove these earmarks, to join me in pushing that legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, tomorrow we're going to be voting on a very important piece of legislation. This is the farm bill, something that we reauthorize every 5 years or so, and I would  have hoped that we could have a good debate tomorrow. But I just learned a few minutes ago that the bill will come to the floor under a structured rule which will not allow anybody opposed to the bill to claim time in opposition. 
   So, if you can believe this, this is one of the most expensive, most important pieces of legislation to come before this body in years, and it will come to the floor under a structured rule that does not allow those opposed to the rule to claim time in opposition. This is a bill that the President has said that he will veto. This is a bill that has opposition. But those who favor this farm bill do not want those who oppose the bill to be heard. Imagine that. 
   There is time under the rule, as with any bill that comes to the floor, for what's called general debate. If you can think of this, general debate tomorrow will mean that time will simply be split between the majority party, which favors the bill, and those on the minority party who also favor the bill. If you oppose the bill, you cannot claim time in opposition, and you must go and get time, which you may or may not be able to get from your respective party officials or those who are controlling the time. 
   That is simply wrong. We shouldn't run the House this way, under Republicans or Democrats. A bill of this importance should be debated, should be debated fully. 
   Let me explain a few parts of the bill that I think led to the decision to make this a structured rule where those opposed to the bill cannot claim time in opposition. 
   We have said we had heard that we were going to have some reform in this farm bill. Those who are on farms making millions of dollars on farms in the past have been able to claim massive subsidies. We were told that this was going to change. In fact, what the President said is that we should have a limit of $200,000 adjusted gross income, or AGI. Anything above that and you should not be able to receive subsidies. That sounds reasonable. 
   But instead, in this piece of legislation, you can make in farm income $750,000 in adjusted gross income. As an individual, a single farmer can make that. Remember, that's adjusted gross income. That's your income minus expenses. That's after all expenses are taken out. You can still make as a single farmer $750,000 and receive subsidies. If you're married and you structure it properly, your spouse can also make $750,000. That means you can have adjusted gross income as a couple of $1.5 million and still receive thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars in subsidy payments from your government. 
   What's more, if you're a farmer and the farmer's spouse making up to $1.5 million in adjusted gross income, if you have non-farm income, that can amount to $500,000 in addition, and then if your spouse has non-farm income, that's another $500,000. So you can have a couple making $2.5 million in adjusted gross income. Again, adjusted gross income is your income minus your expenses. 
   People will point out farming's an expensive venture. There are a lot of expenses, but those are taken out, and you can still have adjusted gross income of $2.5 million and collect subsidies under this bill. Is it any wonder that those who favor this farm bill didn't want anybody to be able to claim time in opposition to the bill tomorrow when we debate it? 
   A few other things that should be discussed here. I should mention that over the past couple of years, since we passed the last farm bill, farm incomes have shattered all kinds of records. We have net farm income that will reach $92.3 billion in 2008. That's a 56 percent increase over 2006. 
   Average household farm income significantly exceeds the national average. In fact, average household income for farmers is $89,434. Why do we have these kind of subsidies for those who are far better off than the average American? It simply doesn't make sense. 
   There are also some pretty severe budget gimmicks in this bill to make it look like it's coming in under budget when it really isn't. The Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, identified numerous gimmicks in both the House and the Senate versions of the bill that, for example, they shift costs outside the 10-year window and unrealistically assume that some of these programs will be ended in 5 years, and we know that they won't, just to fit them under the budget window. 
   Also under this legislation, for the first time that I've seen this, those writing the bill were able to go baseline shopping where you basically say I don't like this year's baseline funding or baseline limit so I'm going to go off last year's baseline limit; that will allow me to spend more. It's like if I were filling out my taxes and I said, well, you know, I could pay less if I claimed last year's income instead of this year's and I would be able to choose that. 
   That's what the sponsors of this legislation have done. They've shopped for a cheaper baseline so they could fit more spending. That gimmick should be exposed, and it's no wonder they didn't want anybody to claim time in opposition. 
   Madam Speaker, I don't know how anybody in America thinks that we're going to be serious enough to address the entitlement problem we have in this country with Social Security and Medicare if we can't say no to millionaire farmers. How will we ever address entitlements if we can't say no to millionaire farmers?

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike funding in the bill for the TSA puppy breeding program, the increase that is slated to take place in section 203 of the underlying bill. 
   The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, has a puppy program that puts government in the role of being the breeder of bomb-sniffing dogs. This is clearly a role for the private sector. 
   There are literally hundreds, or thousands perhaps, private contractors that perform this function. It seems laughable to me that the Federal Government needs to be in the business of breeding dogs for any purpose. 
   Some will defend the role of bomb-sniffing dogs. I don't question the importance of the work that these animals do. It is important. It is needed. It is certainly necessary. 
   What I am questioning is whether or not the Federal Government ought to be in the business of breeding dogs. This is something that the private sector does a lot more effectively. 
   I would ask any American who has been to the airport, any airport at any time recently, if they believe that the TSA is so efficient in what they do that they have somehow found new efficiencies in dog breeding and that this is something that they ought to be spending their time doing. I would venture to say, no, that they ought to spend their time in doing the tasks that they have been given and not expanding their reach further into this business. 
   How much this will cost the average American taxpayer is unclear. In the bill it simply says ``such sums as may be necessary.'' I think that we should, if there is a figure, it ought to be there rather than a simple ``such sums as may be necessary.'' We have no idea how expensive this program may become. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time and look forward to hearing the justification for this program.

I will bet if you go to the private contractors here they would say there is enough. There are plenty of people in the private sector that are doing this. 
   Why is the Federal Government competing with the private sector? Why are we in the business? 
   I can guarantee you that TSA hasn't found efficiencies that people in the private sector already know.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike section 107 of the underlying bill. This section authorizes $87 million for a new Homeland Security grant program for private bus companies. 
   I and some of my colleagues have expressed concern about what we see as Homeland Security grant waste. It is everywhere in the country. It is in my district. It is in virtually every district across the country. 
   I pointed out in a recent meeting that in my own district there is some Homeland Security funding going to things like synchronization of street lights. It shouldn't come from the Federal Government. It needs to be done, should be done, by local governments. In this case, this is activity that should be done by the private companies themselves. 
   We have seen Homeland Security grants in recent years go to protect mushroom festivals, lawn mower races, investigations into bingo halls, and puppet show performances. There seems to be no end to the waste. Yet now we are going to authorize a new Homeland Security grant program to go to private bus operators like the Hampton Jitney? 
   For those who have not ridden on the Hampton Jitney, it is a private bus service that brings wealthy East Side Manhattanites to their beach homes in the Hamptons. The Hampton Jitney and other private bus companies such as Greyhound and Peter Pan Bus Lines have received Homeland Security grant dollars under the Intercity Bus Security Grant program in 2005. 
   This is corporate welfare, pure and simple. These are for-profit enterprises that should not be underwritten by the taxpayer. 
   This amendment to eliminate this wasteful spending is supported by an array of taxpayer groups across the country. I would urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, let me point out that in 2005 I mentioned there is already an Intercity Bus Security Grant award program. Under this program, since 2005, Academy Express LLC has received $267,279; Greyhound Lines has received $5,471,365; Trans-Bridge Lines, $466,611. 
   How do you decide which private sector business gets the grant and which ones don't? What about a group like, as I mentioned, the Hampton Jitney? It is hardly a model of an intercity where it is just taking people that can't afford to ride the bus. It goes to the Hamptons. Yet we are subsidizing that. 
   Here is another one. It is called the Hampton Luxury Liner. This is another one that would qualify, that would be eligible to receive grants under this program. They advertise complimentary snacks, complimentary beverage, a feature movie. The latest periodicals, newspapers, and magazines are handed out to those patrons who ride those bus lines, yet they will be eligible to receive grants, taxpayer money, to subsidize their business. 
   Why are we doing this kind of corporate welfare? Where are those who stand against corporate welfare? When are they going to stand up and say, enough is enough, we shouldn't be doing this? We are wasting too much money in the Homeland Security program that should be actually spent in threat-based programs where there are real, actual threats, instead of simply spread around by formula or favor around the country.

   We gave out millions and millions of dollars to private bus companies and others. Yet how are we going to fix it? We are going to create a new authorized program, a new one on top of this.  Instead of saying, let's go in and find the waste, fraud, and abuse that was there before, we are not doing that. We are adding a new program. 
   What this amendment does is simply strikes funding for the new authorization so we don't do more. If we do need these expenditures that are risk-based, then let's take out the formula funding that we are already doing. 
   If you are in the majority and you have the power to do it, please don't blame those in the past. I have no brief for what we did before. I didn't vote for the creation of the Department.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, the day after the House passed the Labor-HHS spending bill containing more than 2,000 earmarks, we got a look at the Defense bill. What we're finding is troubling to say the least. 
   Again, there are more than 2,000 earmarks in this bill, a bill that is intended for the military. Now, we all know that earmarks draw funds away from more urgent priorities. Nowhere is this more clear than with the military spending bill. Simply put, every dollar that Congress has earmarked in the Defense bill is a dollar that troops won't have for critical equipment. 
   What's so important that it diverts money away from soldiers? Well, air-dropped into this conference report and this Defense appropriation bill, $3 million for a golf program for kids. This earmark might be par for the course in any other bill, but in the Defense bill, it's clearly indefensible. 
   I don't believe that earmarks like this represent the sentiments of the country when it comes to military spending, and I urge my colleagues to reject the bill until the earmarks are removed.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H. Res. 491 says it shall not be in order to consider a conference report unless the joint explanatory statement includes a list of congressional earmarks that were air-dropped into it or that were not committed to the conference committee by either Chamber. 
   It's unfortunate, just like the Labor-HHS bill, the majority has reported a rule that waives all points of order. Yet, I have to ask here: if we've done everything right, if we've done the transparency that we committed to earlier in the year, why are we waiving all points of order against the bill? Why are we doing this again, second time this week? 
   We have these transparency rules that we hyped at the beginning of the year that we aren't going to have air-dropped earmarks into a conference report that can't be challenged; yet here again, here we go, waiving all points of order against the bill. That is why I am raising the point of order against the rule; it's the only option I have to highlight what is going on here. 
   In a press conference in March, the Speaker of the House said: ``Before Members vote on a bill, there should be appropriate time for people to be able to read it, that it be a matter of public record. And if there is an earmark that can stand the scrutiny, then that transparency will give the opportunity for it to be there.'' 
   The majority leader, in March, said: ``Let no one be mistaken, after the earmark explosion under Republican leadership, Democrats have led the way in bringing transparency and accountability to earmarks.'' It appears that we're not doing that now. 
   The majority leader also said: ``This is a new day and a new Congress. The days of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil are over. This Congress embraces its constitutional responsibility to conduct real, meaningful oversight, as well as our values of openness and transparency.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that when you have a conference report and we finally get a look at it last night, less than 12 hours ago or so, and there are more than two dozen earmarks air-dropped into it, this is the first we've seen of them, we haven't seen any of them before this time, that is not the model of transparency. That is not openness. We have no ability to challenge those earmarks. None. We can't highlight them and say you vote up or down on this earmark. 
   The joint explanatory statement says that there are 24 Defense earmarks that were not passed by either Chamber, costing $59 million. Let me give you just one example of what's in there. There is one of these earmarks, $3 million earmark in the Defense bill, remember, this is the Defense bill we're talking about, a $3 million earmark for a program, according to The Hill newspaper, intended to attract disadvantaged and minority children to the game of golf. This is the game of golf in a Defense bill. Is it any wonder, should anybody be surprised that this was an earmark that was air-dropped into the conference report when we don't have the ability in this Chamber to challenge it? This is the only opportunity we have, a procedural vote, as to whether to move forward on the rule. Now, that is not openness, that is not transparency. 
   It's often brought up that the Republicans, when we were in charge, we did the same thing. We did, and we played the political price for it. We shouldn't have done it. It shouldn't excuse what's going on today. This is supposed to be a new day in Congress. This is business as usual. This is par for the course, to use a bad pun, to put a golf earmark in a Defense bill, and to hide it until the last day, until nobody can challenge it anymore. 
   Now, we may think that that's cute here, but I can tell you people across the country have got to be incensed with it. And we felt the brunt of it, as Republicans, last year. I would suggest that, unless the majority party sees its way clear to change this practice, they're going to feel the brunt of it as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Let's get down to the bottom line about what this is about. At the beginning of the year, we were promised transparency. We were promised that if earmarks were dropped in to a conference report, if they weren't considered by either the House or the Senate, that we would have the opportunity to challenge those earmarks, that we would have the opportunity to shine a light on them, to actually see what they are about. We are not getting that opportunity because we have waived the rule. What good are rules if they are waived routinely? 
   Let me say, this is not our rule on this side. We were glad to see it. But it is the majority's rule, and it is being waived. It is no surprise here when you look at the earmarks that are in, 24 earmarks, some of them are to private companies. These are sole-sourced contracts, single-source contracts, no-bid contracts to private companies and to universities. We have no opportunity to see what they are about. None. We just got the list 24 hours ago. We don't have the opportunity to challenge those. 
   The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, many media outlets over the past couple of weeks have raised issues about these defense contracts, the ones that went through the House and the Senate, whether or not they are appropriate, whether they are linked to campaign contributions coming back, a whole host of questions are raised; yet we have no ability here, because the rules are waived, and we can't even challenge these. 
   And then when you see an earmark for golf in the Defense bill, you have to say, you know, did they intend on hiding this? Would that withstand the scrutiny when it comes to the floor? We have the Woodstock earmark over in the Senate, the hippie museum that didn't withstand the scrutiny. We had one over here on this side this year that didn't withstand the scrutiny. I raised a couple of earmarks, one of which the sponsor came to the floor before I could get here to withdraw his own earmark. In another case, the majority party Appropriations Committee went to the Rules Committee and said remove these earmarks because there is questions about them. That is just on a few earmarks we were able to challenge. 
   So there may well be those questions here, as well. Or, you have to wonder if this Caddyshack earmark would have made it through the scrutiny that would have come had we been able to challenge it in the House. Or would enough Members say, you know, maybe we shouldn't be funding golf in the Defense bill. 
   Is it any wonder that an earmark for golf is hidden in the Defense bill? That is what we have to ask.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, this motion to instruct conferees is simple. It would urge the farm bill conferees to not include a new permanent disaster program contained in the Senate-passed farm bill. The Senate-passed farm bill included a new and permanent disaster program which has been estimated to cost an additional $5.1 billion. 
   First of all, I want to commend the House for not including the disaster title. It is not needed. We end up paying far more than we should in the regular subsidy programs; but to add a permanent disaster title is simply heaping too much on the taxpayers. As I go through some of this, you will see why. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, since 1989 Congress has passed 35 appropriations authorizations or farm disaster acts that have added more than $60 billion in supplemental funding to USDA programs with just under 8 percent of that coming in the last 10 years. An analysis by the Environmental Working Group showed the Federal Government provided $26 billion in disaster relief payments between 1985 and 2005. Congress spent more than $8 billion in disaster payments between 2002 and 2006, with an additional $3.4 billion being made available for the 2008 omnibus for disaster payments for losses between 2005 and 2007. 
   So you see, we have regular subsidy programs that are awfully big, and then we are being asked to add a disaster title on top of that. When we debated the bill in 2002, the 2002 farm bill, the idea was to stop the expensive disaster assistance payments. Former Senator Daschle said at that time: ``We are getting rid of these ad hoc disaster payments approaches. We are actually bringing down the cost of the Federal program.'' 
   So in essence we were basically including permanent disaster relief within the farm program in 2002. Or that is what was said at the time. And now we are being asked again, let's add another disaster title because we simply aren't subsidizing enough. 
   Representative Lucas of Oklahoma said during that debate: ``On the committee, both Republicans and Democrats worked to find a balanced bill so we would not have to come back to Congress and ask for ad hoc disaster bills year after year. We have found that balance in the manager's amendment.'' Again, that was in 2002. 
   We were told if we passed the bill in 2002, we wouldn't have to come back again and again for disaster payments. But guess what, we were back the next year and the next year and the next year with disaster payments; and we are being asked again here to include a permanent disaster title. Now believe me, if we do this, next year we will be asked to add disaster payments again and the next year again and again. This is nothing more than an effort to increase the baseline, to increase more subsidies going out to farmers. 
   Representative Pomeroy said in 2002: ``There is a better way to go than to add ad hoc year-to-year disaster bills that leave the farmer and their lenders and their creditors not knowing where they stand. The better way is to put it in the farm bill, just like this bill does.'' 
   Let me remind you, that bill was passed. We did exactly what these Members said we should do in order to avoid ad hoc disaster payments henceforth. Guess what, we didn't. We have seen those payments again and again. Now we are being asked to include a permanent disaster title, only to see these payments again and again. It is simply too much. 
   When do we stand up and say enough is enough? The taxpayer is on the hook for too much. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. The gentleman mentioned that having these permanent disaster titles built into the budget would be a good thing so we don't have the ad hoc disaster programs. I agree, it would be. But we've done that. That's how the last firm bill was sold to us; that yes, it's a bit bloated; yes, it's bigger than you'd like, but it's going to include disaster payment so we don't have to do ad hoc stuff anymore. We're going to build it into the budget. 
   I read several quotes. There are several more. Let me just read one more. Representative Combest of Texas said, ``There is a safety net which is built into the program. I think, to my budget conscious colleagues, of which I am one, this is more of an honest way to deal with this problem than ad hoc disaster bill after disaster bill after disaster bill after disaster bill.'' 
   Now, that sounds just like what we heard. This was in 2002. And we've had many ad hoc disaster bills pass since that time. I guarantee you, if we pass this, with this large disaster bill attached to it, we'll see more disaster bills after this time. 
   The gentleman mentioned that disaster bills come to fill in the gaps when there are bad crop years. That's the purpose of it. In fact, we subsidize crop disaster insurance to the tune of about $3 billion a year, I believe. We've had many programs, many bills to do that. But it hasn't seemed to work because we keep funding on top of that. 
   If you look at this chart, this chart will show 2002 through 2006, these were not particularly bad years. In the red you will see the subsidies that were given during this time. In the yellow you'll see disaster payments added on top of the programs. So you see, in good years, in bad, it doesn't matter. We seem to have crop disaster programs and money paid out every time, no matter what. 
   This next chart is quite telling. Shortly before the 2002 Congressional elections, the Bush administration faced growing pressure from ranchers and politicians in a handful of western States that were hit hard by drought. There was pressure to actually do something to help these ranchers. 
   The USDA responded with a plan to give ranchers cash payments based on how much livestock they owned. Now, to qualify, a rancher had to be in a county that suffered from a drought and declared a disaster by the Agriculture Secretary in 2001 or 2002. Legislation was approved by Congress to extend the livestock program into January of 2003 as well. 
   Let me just give you one example of how this works. I'll go to this chart later. But all you have to do is to be in a county where some kind of disaster is declared. The rules were loosened so it didn't even have to be a weather-related disaster. Something else could trigger it as well. And all a farmer had to do is say, or a rancher had to do is say, I am from this county, therefore I deserve payment. Per head livestock payment. And that was paid out. 
   And you had counties that had no disaster at all, or parts of counties, in Arizona we have large counties, only 15 in the State, so you have parts of counties that perhaps weren't suffering any disaster at all where people were collecting payments. 
   But what you also had, and this will demonstrate the absurdity of the program we have now and the eligibility rules. In Texas here, on February 1, 2003, we had a very unfortunate incident where the Space Shuttle Columbia exploded over Texas, upon re-entry. It scattered over a certain part of the State. The President declared certain counties in Texas a disaster area in order to have emergency services go and collect the debris. 
   Because that was a national or, I'm sorry, a disaster declared in certain counties, all ranchers had to do in those counties is claim there's a disaster; I'm going to collect benefits for my livestock. And you had, literally, millions of dollars paid out to ranchers for their livestock because of a disaster, a space shuttle exploding over Texas. 
   Now, that will give you some idea of the eligibility rules that apply here. This, we make no effort in this legislation, nor have we made any effort in any others to really seriously tighten up these eligibility rules. And that is simply wrong to do this. 
   We are embarking again, let me remind you, in 2002 we were told, let's include a bigger bill, let's have a bigger bill that will include disaster relief, and then we won't need to come back anymore. We'll include it in the base bill. That's better budgeting. 
   That's exactly what we're hearing today, the same thing, but with no promise that we'll actually get rid, or that we'll actually cut other programs, go into the commodity programs, shave money here to pay it here. No, we're just increasing the baseline substantially. 
   And I should note, this is not paid for in the bill. The permanent disaster relief is above the base line. We're having to charge fees somewhere else to pay for this. So it's not in the bill. It's not paid for. It's actually above the baseline. 
   So let me just urge my colleagues, you know, we have a program here that I think all of us, in our candid moments, realizes is out of control. We have subsidies going here that are well beyond what is required and necessary and right and proper. Yet, we continue to do this simply because it makes for good politics. I would think that we're better than that. 
   I would think that we can rise up, at least now, as the House did, frankly, and say, we shouldn't have a permanent disaster title. Again, I want to commend the House for doing that. But this is why this motion is to instruct the conferees to go with the House version and not the Senate version. 
   And I would ask my colleague, I would yield for just a minute, if you would, if we felt that a disaster title was so needed, why wasn't it included in the House bill, and why did we rely on the Senate to have it? 
   I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman.

   Mr. FLAKE. Reclaiming my time, we heard some of these same arguments in 2002, that we had tightened things up, and that we wouldn't have the ability to game the system. Yet I mentioned the shuttle disaster as one of the more egregious examples. There are plenty of others. 
   For example, after the Katrina disaster, part of the programs that we have allow, if prices drop substantially, that prices can be locked in at a certain price, and then farmers can go sell on the market afterwards. The system was gamed at that point; to the loss, to the tune of a couple of billion dollars. These were imaginary losses. These were not real losses.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I would simply say in response to that, this is what we heard in 2002, that we have fixed these loopholes, that this has tightened up. We won't have to have ad hoc disaster payments. There are several types. I mentioned the number of bills that have been passed to provide this type of disaster relief, whether it was for livestock or crop loss or something else. We just passed a myriad of bills to do that. And every time we hear, We've tightened it up; if you just give us a little higher baseline, if you just increase it a little more, then we promise we won't come back again and again and again. And here we are. We're back doing the same thing again. 
   I would submit, Madam Speaker, that we simply can't do this any more. We simply can't do this. 
   Let me go to this chart for a minute. 
   May I inquire as to the time remaining?

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I assure my colleagues I won't take my entire 15 minutes, but let me point out this chart right here. 
   These are areas that have received disaster payments in 11 of the past 21 years. When you think disaster payments, you think this is something that happens once every decade or once every century or something that is an odd occurrence. It doesn't always occur. Yet here we see, look at these dots here. One, you can tell they're highly concentrated. Certain areas keep going back for more again and again and again. These areas where you see the dots received disaster payments 11 out of the last 21 years. One dot equals one recipient here. 
   Now 11 out of the past 21 years, if you do the math right, that's better than once every 2 years people are coming back for disaster payments, catastrophic losses of some type or another. So the notion that we're taking care of it all, that we won't have any more catastrophic disasters, I think is blown away by this chart because we see again and again. 
   Another thing that's quite notable with this chart is you see there is a very political disbursement here. I will point out one place, right here at the top of Arkansas. You will see a smattering of dots where this represents, believe me, millions and millions and millions of taxpayer dollars going to disaster relief. But something funny happens here. Once you cross the State line into Missouri, virtually no dots at all. Very little was received at all. 
   Now, unless droughts respect State boundaries right along the State line, or a tornado is deterred by a barbed wire fence, then this is political. There is no other way to explain this. You look down here near the panhandle of Florida into Georgia and whatnot, there are a lot, and then as soon as you cross over that State line, virtually nothing. 
   What this suggests to me, and I'm sure anybody who looks at it in candor would say, There's probably a very active farm service organization there that is applying for these grants and going after that drought relief for whatever it's for. 
   But you have to concede there is no other way to explain this than to see that this is extremely political. That's how it happens. That's how it happened after 2002 when the White House was under much pressure to provide disaster relief before the election was coming up. It doesn't just happen under Democrat's administrations; it happens under Republicans and everyone. We shouldn't allow this to happen. 
   Let me just close by saying, again, we heard this in 2002, we're hearing it again. We bought it then. We shouldn't have. Let's not include this $5.1 billion disaster program. I'm hearing that it's down to $3.8. That's maybe a good sign.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman. 
   I should note that the gentleman mentioned that we've cut billions of dollars since the last farm bill. We haven't cut anything. The reason that not as much has been paid out under countercyclical or some of the other programs is being a product of high prices, and that's as the program works. But I should note that even though there have been high prices, we're still having disasters seemingly everywhere with very loose definitions of what a disaster is, and I would suggest that we will have those again, whether or not we include a permanent disaster title. That's what experience tells us. That's what we've learned just over the past few years. It doesn't matter if you include a permanent disaster title or you include this under the baseline, you will have disaster payments go out. 
   And my plea would be let's stand for the taxpayer here. We don't often do that in the Congress. Let's say that enough is enough, that we can't continue to pay out money on top of money that we said we weren't going to pay out. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I know we went a little longer than we thought. 
   I would urge support for this motion to instruct. 
   Let's keep what the House did and reject the disaster title that the Senate put in. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, one of my astute colleagues recently said, ``One of the toughest parts of being a Member of Congress is remembering what we are supposed to be outraged about.'' I thought about this yesterday when I heard the report that surprise, surprise, earmarks were being used to help Members get reelected. The reason that is treated with kind of a ho-hum is because, as it turns out, that is one of the more noble explanations as to why earmarks are used. 
   With the reporting that is going on about earmarks being tied to campaign contributions, or chairmen, or people in leadership positions getting tens of millions of dollars in earmarks for favored companies or organizations in their district, it seems that we have simply gone too far when we don't recognize this as a problem. 
   I would call on my colleagues in the new year to have a moratorium on earmarks. Let's put a brake on this process until we can put a process in place to adequately vet these. There is no noble purpose for the contemporary practice of earmarking. Try as we might, we aren't coming up with one.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I was in my office and I heard the distinguished majority leader talk about personal responsibility and how we've got to get this deficit and this debt under control. 
   Personal responsibility begins with personal responsibility. There's an article that ran a couple of weeks in the Washington Post that mentioned one Member, who shall remain nameless, tucked in $96 million worth of pet projects into next year's Federal budget, almost all of which is in today's bill that we will deal with. 
   Included in that was an earmark for a group called InTune. When asked what they would do with the grant, they said it might be music camps, it might be lessons, it might be how to be a DJ, it might be how to create a television show. The last earmark that this group got was spent on lesson plans for funk music. 
   This is not personal responsibility. Were there not earmarks in this bill, we would likely have a continuing resolution that would fund at last year's levels, and we could start to get a grip on this debt and deficit that we have.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I oppose this rule that will allow this omnibus to be brought to the floor. We had some discussion yesterday, and it should continue today, about the over 9,000 earmarks that are in this bill. It was mentioned by the majority leader yesterday, or the day before. He said, ``Having said that,'' in justification for bringing this bill forward, when it was pointed out that many of these earmarks had been brought to the floor for the first time with this bill, he said, ``this bill incorporates all of the bills that passed this House. This is not as if these are items of first impression. These are bills that we considered in this House and passed with essentially overwhelming bipartisan votes.'' 
   That is only partly true. Yes, these bills, many of them were brought to the House before. A few of them left the House earmark-free. One of them, the Department of Homeland Security bill, we were told we can let this one go and not have the earmarks added because it isn't traditionally earmarked. Guess what? There are more than 100 earmarks that have now been air-dropped into that bill. We are sitting today with hundreds, literally hundreds of earmarks that have been air-dropped into the bill that we have never seen before yesterday. Never seen before yesterday, or Monday, I should say. That is simply wrong.  
   Let me give you just a couple of examples. There was $1.6 million for the City of Bastrop, Louisiana. According to the Bastrop Daily Enterprise, ``The money is officially earmarked for the purchase of bulletproof vests and body armor. Bulletproof vests only cost about $700 to $800, however, so $1.6 million would appear to be overkill.'' Police Chief Curtis Stephenson agrees, conceding, ``There's no way we need that kind of money just to put all our people in vests.'' Again, this was an earmark for bulletproof vests for the police officers in this city, and the city comes back and says, We don't have that many police officers. 
   We are told that these earmarks are vetted. How are they vetted? The answer is they are really not. They are not vetted by that party; they aren't vetted by this party. It's more of a game of ``Can you catch me with my hand in the cookie jar or not?'' 
   Earlier this year, when I was challenging a couple of earmarks on the floor, one Member who had one of the earmarks I was going to challenge beat me to the floor to withdraw his own earmark because he didn't want the scrutiny that would come if that earmark were publicly debated. Later that same week, the Appropriations Committee, when they found out certain other earmarks might be challenged on the floor, called the Rules Committee and struck some other earmarks that were to be debated on the House floor because they couldn't withstand the scrutiny. That isn't vetting. That is hoping that your hand isn't caught in the cookie jar. 
   Now we have this bill today with over 9,000 of these earmarks. Now, the majority will say, Hey, that is a 17 percent reduction in the number of earmarks in our worst year. Put another way, that's like saying, You know, last year I smoked five packs a day and I am down to three this year. I darn-well quit. That is hardly something to pat ourselves on the back about. 
   Put another way, we have just 17 percent fewer earmarks than the worst year in congressional history for earmarking. Please don't use this side of the aisle as a bar with which to judge yourselves. That is a bar that a snake could crawl over. We didn't handle ourselves well in the majority with regard to earmarks. That is one of the big reasons we find ourselves in the minority today. But when the new majority came into power in January of this year, we were told that we would have transparency, that we would have names next to earmarks, that there would be time to actually discuss these earmarks and debate them, that if there were earmarks air-dropped into a bill, there would be an opportunity to strike all earmarks, at least one vote. 
   We don't have that today because this isn't a conference report. You simply have to change the name of the bill that is coming to the floor and you obviate your obligation to live by your own rules. That is simply not right. It's nothing that we should be proud of. 
   I mentioned earlier on the floor today that an astute Member of Congress told me yesterday one of the toughest parts of being a Member of Congress is to remember what we should be outraged about. I would submit that this is something that we should be outraged about, but we are not. We blithely pass it as if this is standard business. It shouldn't be. It shouldn't have been for us when we were in the majority, and it shouldn't be for the new majority. 
   It was in a press report yesterday that some Members were upset, I think justifiably, that there seemed to be just a few Members getting all the earmarks. They mentioned in the press article that a lot of the earmarks are going to the vulnerable Members instead of to the established Members in their district. 
   I would say that that is something I think outside of the Beltway people say that is just wrong, for money to go to Members just to be re-elected. But here, unfortunately, we see that and say, Hey, that is one of the noblest purposes we have seen for earmarks. Usually they're tied to campaign contributions or something else. 
   We need a moratorium on earmarks. We should pass a CR rather than this omnibus and go into next year without these 9,000 earmarks.

   This amendment says, ``None of the funds made available in this Act may be used for W.A. Young & Sons Foundry, Greene County, Pennsylvania.'' 
   The three-sentence certification letter for this project states that the purpose for this funding is to restore the machine shop at the foundry to its original likeness. 
   Once again, it's important to note that the certification letters that we get from the Appropriations Committee are not the request letters that Members give to the Appropriations Committee to request their earmark. So we really don't know all that much about what the earmarks are for, other than a three-sentence or a four-sentence certification letter. So I would have hoped to have had more information, but we were unable to get from the Appropriations Committee the actual request letters. So we are at a bit of a loss to find out what the earmark is really for, but we did our best to do a little research.

   Mr. FLAKE. Maybe that's safer. 
   What I would like to ask, for example, I mention that this foundry is only open 2 days a year. It has been open for private tours for quite a while for a number of years. There is no indication with this earmark, certainly because we don't get the request letter, we only get the certification letter, that it will be open for any more than that. 
   And I don't know about you, but it's a tough sell. I can tell you, I have five kids. It would be tough to say, Do you want to go to Disneyland or W.A. Young & Sons Foundry? 
   I can see why anybody would want an earmark to renovate something or to promote tourism in a particular area, but virtually every district in the country would like that as well. How do we decide this one is worthy and this one is not? Just because we have a Member who is a powerful member of the Appropriations Committee or not. We shouldn't be doing it this way. 
   The gentleman made a good point, that the President has his own earmarks. The administration does earmark funds, but it's typically with accounts that we've given them. We say, here's an amount of money and for this program. For example, there is the Save America's Treasures account that the President, or the administration through a competitive grant process, decides this site is worthy of historic preservation or worthy of receiving funds. What we're doing with earmarking frequently is circumventing that process and saying, I don't think they're going to do it right, so I'm just going to earmark my own project and get that funding for my own project. That's no way to do business. If we don't like the way the administration is doing something, that's what the oversight process is about, and we should go back in and stipulate and mandate. 
   I have mentioned many times, particularly with Homeland Security grants, there are projects in my own district that I think are a waste of Federal taxpayer dollars or not an appropriate use of Federal taxpayer dollars, and I would like to go in. And I will, through this process, if I can, seek to strike some of the President's own requests. We should be doing that. But we shouldn't say because they do it and because they misuse Federal taxpayer dollars that we should as well. That's not what our power of the purse should be about. 
   So that's why we're here today, to say what is an appropriate use of Federal taxpayer dollars. Is it appropriate, in this case, and we can talk about what the Republicans did versus what the Democrats did. You won't find me defending what Republicans did in terms of ramping up earmarks. We went from some 1,400 to 14,000 over a decade, and it's a pox on our House. It's part of the reason I think we lost in November. I hope the minority, now majority learn a lesson from us. 
   I am glad to see the number of earmarks and the whole dollar value come down, but it should come down much lower. We not only need to change the level of spending, but the type of spending as well. And with earmarking, it was way out of control. It's still out of control with this legislation, in my view.

   This amendment would prohibit funding from going to the Columbus Firefighters Union, which is an AFL-CIO-affiliated union. 
   The certification letter for this project is quite vague. Remember that  these are not request letters, so we don't know a lot about these earmarks. These are only certifications that are made, usually three or four sentences long. The certification letter says that the earmark money is for the Columbus Firefighters Hall. The letter also states that the entity to receive this funding is the Columbus Firefighters Union. The earmark list accompanying the bill calls the project ``Firefighters Hall.'' 
   According to the certification, the funding would be used to renovate and expand the Toledo & Ohio Railway Depot. Suffice to say, this information wasn't much to go on to learn about the earmark, so I had my staff e-mail the Appropriations Committee for further details, which they did provide. 
   The committee informed us that the Toledo and Ohio Central Railway station at 379 West Broad Street in Columbus, Ohio is the largest remaining 19th century railroad palace in central Ohio. Today it serves as local headquarters for the Volunteers of America, a national organization with a variety of charitable and service programs. 
   The committee also stated that the depot has been adapted to serve the modern needs of the Volunteers of America, while also preserving much of the 100-year-old architecture. The decorative ``grand lobby'' may be rented for parties, receptions and meetings. 
   It's a little unclear whether this is to renovate an old building. It seems to me there are already tenants in the building. And one of the tenants in the building I believe will be, or the entity that is receiving the earmark to renovate is the AFL-CIO-affiliated Firefighters Union Local 67. 
   Again, this is a question of there are a lot of firefighters halls around the country, there are a lot of buildings that need to be renovated. We give the administration money under programs to allocate on a competitive basis to do historic preservation. This, seems to me, is circumventing that process again. And again, why is it proper to say that this one is worthy of funding and this one isn't? 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Let me just say, again, the gentlewoman mentioned that we have this program for historic preservation, the Saving America's Treasures, and that it is tough to get on the list for that. As I understand it, grants are given out and those grants are announced in late summer. If you receive one of those grants, then you are named an historic site or an official recipient. You can also make a contribution. If you are a local entity looking to have your own facility designated, you can make a contribution to Save America's Treasures and earmark that for the project that you want it to go to. There are other ways to receive recognition. 
   It just seems to me that it would be more appropriate for the local entities to bear responsibility for this and not the Federal Government.

   Mr. FLAKE. That is understood. There are a lot of State and local governments everywhere, I would submit, that would like to have this kind of participation. But we simply can't do it. We simply cannot fund every project out there. So it seems to me that if we are going to have a project, or we are going to have an account that we set up with the Federal agency, we allow that to take its course.  
   If we don't like the way it is run, it is our obligation as Members of Congress to stipulate that it should be done differently. But we shouldn't go in and circumvent that process and say, all right, I am going to earmark these projects because I fear that they might not receive designation or they might not be chosen by this Federal agency. If we don't like how that is set up, let's change that process. But let's not move in, as Members of Congress, and designate specific funds. 
   I have a lot of respect for the gentlewoman from Ohio and count her as a friend. I am not questioning anything here but the wisdom of using Federal taxpayer money to do this type of thing.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prevent any funding in the bill from going to the Philadelphia Art Museum for their exterior facade work. The Philadelphia Art Museum is receiving $100,000 in taxpayer funds in this bill. 
   The certification letter submitted to the Appropriations Committee in this project is a little vague again. It simply states that the money is to be used for a comprehensive exterior renovation and preservation project of the main building historic facade. I should note again the certification letters that we get as Members tell us a lot less than the actual request letters do. That certainly is the case here.  
   When my staff looked at the museum Web site, it is clear that the museum has plans for expansion by creating a ``skylit galleria, a spacious gallery extending along Pennsylvania Avenue in Philadelphia.'' 
   The skylit galleria would be some 35 feet high, 200 feet long, and join the lobby and new cafe. The Web site says that with its terrazzo floor and tilted corbelled wall, this new space connects the old building to the new extension along the length of the preexisting north exterior facade. 
   I understand the main building is historic. But the question is, if the certification letter says it is for the historic facade and you are talking about flooring and other things, it seems to me that the money is going to the new extension. 
   Again, I would simply make the same point here that I have made before. There are a lot of worthy projects. Certainly renovation and historic preservation is a good thing and a lot of good people contribute their own money to it, as they should. But the question is, should Federal taxpayer dollars be used in this way, particularly given the financial situation we are in as a Federal Government. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit any of the funds in the bill from going to the Payne Art Gallery at Moravian College at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The certification letter submitted by the Member sponsoring the project stated the money would go to the restoration and preservation of the Payne Art Gallery at the college. The funding would be used for exterior restoration, rehabilitation, and conservation of Payne Gallery. 
   Payne Art Gallery is a small art gallery at a college. The college underwent a renovation in 2001 to achieve Smithsonian exhibit standards. It currently hosts about five to six exhibits a year. This small art gallery is to receive $150,000 in Federal funding from the U.S. taxpayer. 
   Again, I would simply ask, there are a lot of small colleges around the country, hundreds of them, thousands of them. Many have art galleries. Where do we say this is worthy and this is not? Why are we using U.S. Federal taxpayer dollars for this purpose when we are in the fix that we are in financially?

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I will simply make the point, this sounds like a great gallery, a lot of history, certainly something that tourism and other things can pay for, that can carry its own load locally. Why do we need the Federal Government to be involved, that is my question. 
   Given the priorities and the situation we are in with the Federal Government, the last time I checked we were some $8 trillion in debt, why are we doing this? Where does it end? When do we say enough is enough? 
   We can't afford to fund projects like this around the country that have a local program that can support it. We simply can't go on doing this. That is the point that I would like to make. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prevent funding from going to the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. This is one of the most expensive earmarks in the bill. The commission is to receive an earmark of $1.2 million. The Web site for this commission states that the southwestern region of Pennsylvania was hard hit when a lot of manufacturing jobs left the region. The Web site also states that it was a ``tough transition for hundreds of steelworkers, coal miners, railroaders and other workers who now find themselves without a job.'' I certainly, and any Member in this body, can sympathize with in their own district. 
   But the Web site goes on to say that ``An idea emerged that the very industries that were struggling in the 1980's had transformed America once before. Could the proud history of southwestern Pennsylvania once again lead America through the next economic transition? With that, the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission was born.'' 
   A bill creating the Southwestern Pennsylvania Industrial Heritage Route, or Path to Progress National Heritage Area, was approved in Congress in 1988. The heritage area is managed by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission. If this is confusing to listeners, it is to all of us. 
   The Commission's Web site states that the law created the new heritage area to ``make it possible for millions of Federal dollars to flow into southwestern Pennsylvania.'' No doubt. 
   All of these funds are to be managed by the Commission. 
   The Commission's Web site states the Commission has ``created organizations, corporations, alliances, confederations, authorities, commissions, councils, and new businesses.'' No doubt. 
   The site goes on to explain that the committee ``spent money, borrowed money, loaned money, earned money, granted money, and accepted money.'' Nobody doubts that either. 
   The Web site explains that the Commission legislative mandate was renewed by Congress and it was to begin transferring its responsibilities to a public foundation. 
   I quote, ``several entities were created by the commission to achieve this--the Allegheny Heritage Development Corporation which then evolved in the Westsylvania Heritage Corporation and the Progress Fund, which would serve as a Community Development Financial Institution, providing gap and equity financing to an increasing number of tourism-oriented businesses.'' 
   I should note that I have added language in this amendment to prevent Federal funding from going to the other two nonprofit entities that were created by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Commission. 
   My point in offering this amendment is to highlight the concept of earmark incubators, or entities created by Members of Congress through the legislative process that exist for the sole purpose of receiving more earmarks. 
   In this case, the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission seems to be just that, an earmark incubator. It has spawned at least two other nonprofit entities, each with the sole purpose of fostering economic growth and tourism development in southwestern Pennsylvania with Federal taxpayer dollars.     
   It is no surprise that the CEO of the Westsylvania Heritage Corporation is also the executive director of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission. He is also a former Interior Department employee of 32 years. 
   Keeping track of all these entities that have been created based on this one national heritage area almost boggles the mind. The point of this amendment is to prevent funding from going to one entity, you have to go after all three. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Thank you. 
   Reclaiming my time, I don't doubt that it was funded in the previous Congress. The question is with economic development. It is said that this helps promote tourism. It helps development. No doubt. You cannot spend money without creating economic activity by its very nature. But if we take economic development as the criteria, what project anywhere in the country is not worthy of that? And why is this project and all of these entities created, and I quote again from their own Web site. The commission Web site says: ``This organization created organizations, corporations, alliances, confederations, authorities, commissions, councils, new businesses,'' many of which are also eligible for earmark funding.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think this is a real test here. We all campaign every 2 years, and we put out campaign literature. We go speak at town halls and other events. And I would venture to guess that not one person in this body said, Reelect me because we need to spend more on Interior appropriations. We need to spend more. We need to spend 4 percent more than we did last year. I am going to go back to Washington and spend $1.2 billion more than we did last year. 
   I venture that nobody said that. Virtually everybody said we need to rein in spending. We need to promote fiscal responsibility. 
   I am the first to concede we didn't do a good job of it over here. For the past several years we have grown government far too big. That is part of the reason we are now in the minority. But the majority comes now and says, don't lecture us, we are going to increase that spending. 
   This bill spends $1.2 billion more than last year. Last year spent too much. This year spends too much too much again. 
   So, please, we know we did wrong. That is why we are in the minority. But when you are in the majority now, let's exercise some fiscal discipline. There are plenty of areas that can receive cuts. We have outlined several of them over the past several hours with amendments. 
   Museum funding, part of the reason the gentleman from New Mexico mentioned that we have a backlog at the National Parks, he is right. But yet in the authorizing committee, we have created several more National Heritage Areas and earmarked a lot more money for them. There are earmarks in this bill for National Heritage Areas. That is money that will come out of the National Parks budget. They will tell you if you spend money here on this new area, this National Heritage Area, you can't spend money maintaining the parks that we already have. Many of us have fought to stop that. We have said don't keep creating these National Heritage Areas. Yet with the new majority, we are creating them at a faster rate than we ever have. 
   I would say, let's promote fiscal discipline. Let's pass this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. This week, the Senate is expected to approve an $8 billion bailout of the highway trust fund. We already passed that in the House here in July, and at that time, myself and 36 other Members opposed it. At the time, we were backed by both the administration and by the Secretary of Transportation. 
   For years, Congress has known that the highway trust fund was losing its purchasing power. The Federal law gas tax of 18.4 cents has not been increased since 1993, and high fuel efficiency standards have meant fewer fill-ups. Then, of course, earlier this summer, fewer vacations were taken; fewer miles were driven. That means less money for the highway trust fund, but this concern has gone back for years. In fact, when we did the 2005 highway bill, there were many who stood up and who said we're authorizing more projects, more funding than we will have in the highway trust fund, but what did we do? We didn't take any action to solve the problem. Instead, we more than tripled the number of earmarks in SAFETEA-LU, which was the last highway authorization program that we did in 2005 for the 5-year period that we're now in. 
   So here we are 3 1/2 years later, just a year before our next reauthorization, and we're out of money to cover the projects that we've authorized, but contrary to the example we've seen throughout this Congress, a bailout shouldn't be the answer to every shortfall. No effort, for example, has been made to rescind any of the 6,300 earmarks that were in the highway trust fund, of course, the most famous of which was the bridge to nowhere. That money was rescinded or at least the authorization to spend on that project was taken away by the Congress, but we've made no effort on any of the other 6,300 earmarks in the bill. We need to do so. 
   The Secretary of Transportation had indicated earlier this summer that, if we were to take funding from the earmarks that have not yet been funded in the bill, it could relieve the pressure that we now have on the highway trust fund, but we haven't done it. Instead, we're simply saying go ahead and fund all of those transportation museums and all of those projects that have very little or nothing to do with moving people. We're saying go ahead and fund them. We'll just take the money from the Treasury now instead of from the highway trust fund. That is a very, very dangerous precedent to set. Whenever you load up a bill with 6,300 earmarks, the process of logrolling takes effect. That's why you only had, I believe, eight votes against the highway bill back in 2005 and, I think, only three votes against it in the Senate. It's because, if you lard it up enough and if you have enough buy-in, very few people will vote against it or will oppose it. 
   If you start taking money from the general fund and if you don't have any kind of ceiling that was provided at least by the highway trust fund, then Katy Bar the door when it comes to spending. There's no ceiling. There's no discipline. We can not get in this position where we're robbing from the general fund to fund highway projects delineated by Members of Congress but  earmarked by Members of Congress, because there will simply be no discipline on the process. 
   So I would urge the President to take the position that we shouldn't take money from the general fund, to veto this legislation when it comes, and I would urge the House as we prepare to reauthorize the highway bill just a year from now to take a different approach--to look at public-private partnerships and other methods--so we simply don't get in the position where we have thousands and thousands and thousands of earmarks that mean we have a bill that we can't fund and where we will again be robbing from the general fund to fund these projects.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I didn't plan to take any time today, but we will be debating the farm bill later today, and the rule that has come to the floor does not allow anyone to claim time in opposition to the bill; so those of us who are opposed to this $300 billion piece of legislation cannot even stand up and oppose the bill unless we get time, if they are generous enough to give it to us, from those who support the bill. Now, if I were wanting to hide what's in this bill, that's what I would do too. 
   This legislation allows multimillionaires to still collect farm subsidies. Under this legislation you can still make $2.5 million as a couple in farm and nonfarm income and still collect subsidies. I would have a closed rule or a highly structured rule as well if I had this in a bill and wanted to hide it. 
   This bill needs to be rejected today. I hope we will all vote against the farm bill.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, sometimes here in Washington, we tend to drink our own bath water and believe our own press releases. And to hear some of the debate here, you would think this is the best bill in the world and that everybody out there has got to support it. 
   Let me just read a couple of editorials from around the country to give you an idea of how this bill is being played outside of Washington: 
   The Columbus Dispatch: ``The current compromise version of the farm bill includes little retreat from the subsidy program that for decades has bled taxpayers, fattened the already fat, distorted market incentives, soured U.S. trade, hurt the environment, and done little for family farmers.'' 
   The San Francisco Chronicle: ``From the fiscal watchdog perspective, this bill is a sign that the new Democratic leadership is as profligate as the Republican leadership it replaced. Make that more profligate ..... The $286 billion farm bill is good politics only because the millions of taxpayers who are paying the bill are not pushing as hard as the relatively few who benefit.'' 
   The Albany Times: ``Corn prices are up. Same for flour. That means farmers are enjoying boom times ..... So why would Congress even think of giving more generous subsidies?'' That's a good question. 
   The Spartanburg Herald-Journal: `` ..... The fact that reform has failed, and Congress is about to pass a renewal of the same failed, wasteful subsidies, is a testament to all that's wrong with politics in Washington ..... Congress has reached a House/Senate compromise bill that will continue to take money from you and other families struggling with high food prices to further enrich big corporate farmers who are already earning record prices for their crops.'' 
   The Dallas Morning News: ``The legislators negotiating the new farm bill evidently don't do their own grocery shopping. Otherwise, they'd have seen the dramatic rise in food prices. And they'd have done more than trim only $400 million from the $26 billion in direct-payment subsidies they're planning for farmers .....'' 
   We can do a lot better than this. I want to associate myself with the comments of Mr. Kind from Wisconsin. Taxpayers expect more. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I yield myself 1 minute. 
   We have mentioned the generous subsidies that still flow to multimillionaire farmers. Let me just put that in perspective in this legislation. With this legislation, a farm couple earning $2.5 million in combined on-farm and off-farm income is still eligible for hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm payments. Yet an urban couple earning a little more than $17,800 or owning more than one vehicle can become ineligible for food stamp benefits. 
   Now I am not making an argument that we should raise the threshold for food stamp benefits. But look at the difference here. How in the world can you justify having a farm couple with on-farm and off-farm income of $2.5 million still eligible for hundreds of thousands of dollars in subsidies? It is simply indefensible.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I raise this point of order realizing that it is a bit of a stretch. The reason that we have this point of order in law is to guard against unfunded mandates being levied on the States. In this case, there are a lot of unfunded mandates being heaped upon taxpayers. I realize, as I said, this is a stretch. But I have to do this today because the rule that is before us does not allow anybody opposed to the bill to claim time in opposition to the bill. 
   Now how is it that a bill of this import, a bill that will spend over the next 10 years about $300 billion, is not important enough to allow those who are opposed to the bill to claim time in opposition to it? Instead, the structured rule before us today allows time to be split between the majority and the minority. Now those who will be controlling that time are people who are in support of the bill. How is it that we can discuss a bill this large, this important, that spends this much money, and that heaps this kind of burden on the taxpayer, yet again, without having a real discussion? 
   When we have a bill before the House, we have time called ``general debate.'' In this case, general debate is between those in the majority who support the bill and those in the minority who support the bill. Now how is that debate? Why is it that the Rules Committee can't see fit to actually allow people who are opposed to the bill to claim time in opposition to it? 
   With that, I would love to hear an explanation from the Rules Committee why we have a structured rule that does this. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Again, I realize this bill has been in discussion for a couple of years. And I will come to that a little later as we talk about why earmarks had to be airdropped into the bill at the last minute. If we have been discussing this bill for 2 years, then couldn't we actually discuss these earmarks that were to be added to the bill instead of airdropping them into the conference report when nobody in the House or nobody in the Senate had even seen them? So it is hardly a defense to say that we have been discussing this for 2 years, nor is it a reason to deny those who are opposed to the bill an opportunity to actually claim time in opposition. 
   Let me read from the House rules. If the floor manager for the majority and the floor manager for the minority both support the conference report or a motion, one-third of the time for debate thereon shall be allotted to a Member, Delegate or Resident Commissioner who opposes the conference report or motion on demand of that Member, Delegate or Resident Commissioner. 
   We waived that. And we are not doing it. And let me tell you why I think that is the case. Now if I were supporting this bill, and I had been touting this bill as some big reform to our farm programs, I would flat be plumb embarrassed to bring this bill to the floor in its current form. I would be embarrassed. 
   What has got most of the attention, the problem that we all note, that everybody across the country realizes, is how in the world can we have a situation where multimillionaire farmers are collecting subsidies courtesy of the taxpayer? 
   And the real effort in here, what the President wanted, what others wanted, and what many of us here in the House argued for, was to put a cap on how much income you can have and still receive subsidies. The President suggested $200,000 adjusted gross income.  Remember, adjusted gross income is your income minus expenses. All of us here collect a salary of about $169,000. By the time we deduct things for mortgage interest, medical expenses and charitable contribution, it brings that down by at least one-third, maybe even one-half. Under this legislation, a farm couple can have farm income and nonfarm income totaling $2.5 million and still receive direct payments under this legislation. 
   Now, if I were bringing a bill to the floor and had touted this bill as reforming, man, I would want to hide that as well. I would not want somebody to be able to stand up and say, how is it that a multimillionaire farm couple can still collect subsidies from the taxpayers? So I commend the Rules Committee and those who are in support of the bill for actually putting a rule together that minimizes opposition that can be raised and that the only way people can stand up and oppose and be guaranteed time in opposition is to use a maneuver like raising a point of order against the bill. 
   I should mention there are other problems with this and other reasons why this rule should not go forward. We are waiving PAYGO rules. Now one thing the majority said when they came into power is we will not waive PAYGO. We are going to live by PAYGO. When we give money out, we have to make sure that that many money is in the Treasury or we won't do it. 
   This waives PAYGO because there is simply no way you can be in compliance with PAYGO and pass a $300 billion farm bill. And in this case, the writers of the legislation did something very creative. They actually went baseline shopping. What PAYGO says is that you have to take the current baseline, the most current baseline of spending, and total up your spending in the bill based on that current baseline. 
   Instead, what the authors of this legislation did was said, oh, let's go to last year's baseline because we spent less money then and it means we can spend more money in this legislation. Baseline shopping. It is as if I were to say, I don't want to pay so much in taxes this year. So I am going to use last year's wages that I was paid, and I am going to report that instead. Now if I did that, I would be thrown in jail. But we are allowed to do this here. We are allowed to say, we will take whatever baseline we want as long as it allows us to spend more money in the legislation. And then when the bill comes to the floor, we will just waive the rule that required us to be honest in terms of bringing legislation that complies with PAYGO. 
   I would love an explanation from the Rules Committee as to why PAYGO was waived in this regard. 
   And I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I can well understand why the other side does not want to talk about PAYGO and why I should confine this debate to unfunded mandates because PAYGO was, in fact, waived here. PAYGO was waived. And were it not waived, it would be subject to a point of order, the same point of order that the gentleman is lodging against this debate right now. So I can understand that. And I guess we will have to go with the flow. 
   There is another point of order that will be raised shortly with regard to the waiver of the earmark rules that we have in place as well. 
   So let me get back. This is an unfunded mandate on the taxpayers, of course. According to the Environmental Working Group, the Federal Government handed out $13.4 billion in farm subsidies to 1.4 million recipients, $11.2 billion of which related to various commodity support programs, programs that the underlying bill simply does not change. 
   The taxpayers have a huge unfunded mandate here that we are going to be paying off for a very, very long time. 
   With that I will gladly yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind).

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, this second point of order, and I will be calling for a vote on this one, is raised because of earmarks that have been airdropped into the legislation. 
   As the gentleman mentioned, this is not a new bill. This is not something that just popped up last week and that there was a need to add $1 million for the National Sheep and Goat Industry Improvement Center, but that was something that had to come up at midnight and be dropped in when nobody had seen it in either the House or the Senate. 
   This bill has been under consideration for a long, long time, and yet, still, we have earmarks that have been airdropped into the legislation, a number of them. Now, the gentleman may say in defense, we have listed the earmarks that have been airdropped in. 
   It is true that some have been listed. If all of them were listed, why would we waive all points of order against the bill? If the majority was confident enough that all earmarks have been listed, then we wouldn't have waived the points of order against it. I will speak specifically about a few of these earmarks. 
   But let me just mention some of them that are in the bill. There is authorization language for a National Products Research Laboratory. Again, this was airdropped in at the last minute when it hadn't been in the House version of the bill, hadn't been in the Senate, it was airdropped into the conference report. There is authorization language for a Policy Research Center, authorization language for Housing Assistance Council. 
   Now, what that has to do with the farm bill, I am not sure, and the problem is, we will never know until the bill was passed because it was airdropped in at the last minute. 
   That's the problem that the majority party correctly identified when they took control of this body, that we have a problem with earmarks, and they are being dropped in at the last minute without notice. 
   That's why decent rules were actually put in place to try to curb this abuse. The problem is, in this rule, we are waiving those rules. We are waiving those rules so the old practice can continue on just like it always has. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I find it ironic that we are being accused on this side of trying to stifle debate on the bill, that we don't want debate on the bill when I am here to argue against a rule that waives these points of order and a rule that also does not allow opposition to claim time. 
   Now, the majority will say, well, we will yield you time now. Now that we have been caught on this, we will yield you some time. That's not the same as controlling time. 
   When I control time, I can yield time to my colleagues. If I am yielded time, I can't do that. I don't control time in opposition. 
   Our House Rules say that if both the majority and the minority are in favor of the bill for the leadership, that somebody opposed to the bill has a right to claim time in opposition. 
   That was not done here. With a bill this important, you wonder why that has happened. 
   Back to the earmarks, the gentleman mentioned that there is a list of earmarks that was listed, it's right here, a number of them. Now why in the world we had to have more than a dozen earmarks airdropped into a bill that has been under consideration for the past 2 years, I simply don't know. 
   But when you read some of them, you kind of wonder why, like I said, Housing Assistance Council, Sun Grant Insular Pacific Sub-Center, Desert Terminal Lakes, Nevada. This is all we know about them. 
   If you dig into them, you might find something untoward, you might not, but the fact is we don't have time to do that. That's why we have earmark rules that give us time to actually vet them. Those rules are being waived here, and we should not be doing that. 
   Let me mention also, the gentleman said they are all listed. They aren't. There is quite a controversial earmark in this legislation that does not show up on the list. It's a $250 million tax refund to the Plum Tree Timber Company. Now, this is an earmark that allows the Nature Conservancy to purchase that from the Plum Tree Timber Company. 
   Now, the Plum Tree Timber Company, as I understand, is not mentioned in the legislation, it is simply described. It would be like saying I am going to give a subsidy to the gentleman who stands 6-feet tall, weighs 175 pounds, has blue eyes and his middle name is John, but we won't say the rest of it. 
   That's exactly what we are doing here. In an effort to get around the scrutiny that might come if somebody actually said now why is a subsidy actually going to the Plum Tree Timber Company.  
   It is no wonder that the rules have been waived here. If I had something like this in this bill, I would waive the rules too, because I wouldn't want anybody to talk about it. I would also not want anybody who is opposed to the bill to claim time in opposition to it. 
   If I were sponsoring this legislation that I said reformed the farm subsidy program to make sure that multimillionaire farmers don't continue to get subsidies on behalf of the taxpayer, I would hide it as well. I would do exactly what the Rules Committee has done here and the supporters of the legislation have done. 
   Because under this legislation, a farm couple earning as much as $2.5 million in adjusted gross income, that's your income after expenses are taken out, can still receive direct payments under this legislation. 
   Also, the other subsidy programs, rather than reform or to get rid of the loopholes that were allowing people to get extra subsidies, we simply waive the limits there. This is called reform? 
   I mean, is it any wonder that the rules have been waived and debate has been stifled here on this critical legislation? 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. The gentleman mentioned the National Marine Fishery Service earmark. It was added at the last minute. It may have been in a 2006 bill, but it wasn't in this bill until it was air dropped into the conference report. Now $170 million, that may well be a disaster there, but why in the world, if it is a disaster, why isn't it covered?

   Mr. FLAKE. Reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for the clarification. I still would point out we have a $3.8 billion permanent disaster title added to the bill; and still, in addition to that, we are funding these kinds of programs directly and specifically. 
   The gentleman can argue that it is not an earmark. I think that a casual or a tortured reading of this would both say this is an earmark when you are naming a specific entity to receive a specific amount of money and when it wasn't in the House bill, that is an earmark. So there is a good reason for this point of order. 
   The gentleman said, and let me go back to the PAYGO issue. The gentleman mentioned that this rule he thinks is in compliance with PAYGO. Let me read what this conference report says and see if anybody can decipher this.

   Mr. FLAKE. If I might respond, the gentleman, after he raised his last point of order went on to talk about the reforms in the bill which clearly didn't have anything to do with the unfunded mandates language that I had raised or that I had talked about or that he had raised a point of order for. Clearly, I understand that they don't want to talk about this. I understand that. That's why the rules are waived. But to stand now and to raise a point of order against my point of order because I am not addressing specifically the question that they want to address or that they would rather dispose of is, I think, a little spurious.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the other side. You notice the words used, that we have graciously agreed to give them. Under the rules, the House rules, those who are opposed to the bill are required to be given the chance to claim time in opposition, not to be at the whims and graciousness of those who support the legislation. That's why we have rules, and that's why in this case the rules have been waived. 
   I understand completely if I had waived the PAYGO rules, when so many on that side of the aisle, bless their hearts, have been diligent sometimes on raising the issue of PAYGO and saying we shouldn't violate it, if I had violated PAYGO and waived it like this, I would want to waive every rule as well and stifle all the debate I could because it is embarrassing, frankly. 
   I don't have time to yield. 
   I would just say in my remaining 15 seconds, we have a bill that deserves a lot more debate than it is getting. This is important legislation. We are waiving PAYGO rules, and let me just say what this rule says: Therefore, while there is a technical violation of clause 10 of rule XXI, the conference report complies with the rule. It says there is a technical violation, but we have complied. It simply doesn't make sense. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we've detailed many of the problems with this rule, one of the worst aspects of which is that, as has been mentioned, it allows a bit of time travel here for the purpose of going back and choosing another baseline that allows you to actually comply with PAYGO rules. That should not be allowed under the rule, and that's why the PAYGO rules are actually waived in this bill. For all the talk on the other side about PAYGO compliance, if this bill was PAYGO compliant, the PAYGO rule would not have been waived. 
   The same goes with earmarks. More than a dozen earmarks were added, airdropped into the bill; yet we still have a waiver because we know there are likely other earmarks added in the bill as well. So we want to protect against that. 
   Also, I mentioned about the rule. It stifles debate. I don't know of another example where a conference report has come to the floor, particularly one of this magnitude, where those who are opposed to the bill have not been given the opportunity to claim time in opposition. Instead, we have to rely on the good graces of those who support the bill to actually be yielded time to actually speak in opposition to the bill. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we have a real problem in this country in terms of entitlements. We're going to have to reform Social Security and Medicare. Tell me how, tell me why anybody out there, outside of the beltway, should believe that we are capable of doing that kind of reform when we can't tell a farm couple making up to $2.5 million in adjusted gross income every year, that's income after expenses, if we can't tell them that the subsidy party is over? How are we ever going to reform entitlements? I asked that of my party; I ask that of the Democrats. How in the world can anybody take us seriously here if we can't have a farm bill that reforms the subsidy program?

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. One minute is hardly time to speak against this bill. 
   Let me just read a statement that was made by the majority leader a couple of days ago. He commented on the budget that was being passed at the time. He said, ``There is only one person in the United States of America that can stop spending in its tracks, the only person.'' He was referring to the President of the United States and putting a lot of blame, if you will, on the President for not stopping spending that I had argued was going on. 
   Here we have the President standing up and saying, this bill is bloated; this bill is far too big; it spends far too much. Yet the same people who were blaming the President for not standing up to spending are voting now to override the President when he says enough is enough. This is wrong. We ought to stand up--as Republicans at least, if not the Democrats as well--to stand up and say enough is enough. This bill spends too much, far, far too much.  
   This bill lacks real reform, overspends, hides its real costs with gimmicks, jeopardizes trade negotiations, increases size and scope of government, and is disservice to taxpayers. 
   It contains more than $5 billion a year in handouts to millionaire farmers and landowners. 
   It includes the Average Crop Revenue Election program in the conference report, a program that appears to serve the purpose of ensuring commodity farmers get federal hand-outs even though crop prices are soaring. The details of the potential liability to taxpayers only came out after passage. 
   Under the supposed salary cap, married farmers could still be making up to $2.5 billion and receive direct payments. 
   It weakened the payment limit for farm subsidies--lifting the limit on marketing loan benefits and increasing the limit on direct payment benefits. 
   The gaming of the price support program allows farmers to lock in their loan rate when prices are lowest and sell when prices are highest. 
   The bill adds target prices for additional crops and increases loan rates and target prices for others. 
   The brand new and permanent disaster title costs $3.8 billion. 
   Unfortunately, it includes the extension of marginally reduced ethanol production tax credits and the import tariff--thus continuing the failed federal ethanol program that is responsible at least in part for high food prices plaguing consumers. 
   The bill includes hundreds of millions of dollars in loan guarantees for the construction of advanced biofuels plants and a Biomass Crop Assistance Program to provide incentives to cellulosic ethanol crops. 
   This bill forces USDA to sell excess sugar into ethanol production, even though sugar users would continue paying artificially inflated prices ($4 billion or more). (USDA has estimated that ethanol from sugar is twice as expensive to produce [as opposed to corn-based ethanol].) 
   The bill included disclosed earmarks, plus an undisclosed and airdropped earmark that provides $170 million for commercial and recreational ``members of the fishing communities'' affected by missing salmon, and the ``forestry conservation tax credit bond'' to benefit the Plum Creek timber company. 
   This bill represents the worst of legislative process: pandering to special interests, dark of night negotiations, airdropped earmarks worth millions of taxpayer dollars, opposition shut out of the floor process, and a $300 billion boondoggle bill. 
   The cost of the bill is not fully offset: OMB says as much as $20 billion in budget gimmicks and ``illusionary'' spending stops where funding for programs abruptly ends. 
   Conferees waived PAYGO, and went ``baseline shopping'' (did not use the most current baseline). I have said from the beginning: no way to do a Farm Bill without waiving the PAYGO rules. I was proven right. 
   The President has rightly vetoed this bill not once but twice. We need House Members to stand up for taxpayers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. This bill is referred to as the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. I am pained to say there is precious little of either of it in this bill. 
   The previous speaker mentioned that the voters were aware of the needs that existed here in Congress, and the majority party paid the price in November. I fully agree with that. I wasn't quiet on that subject in the last Congress. 
   I was overjoyed to see that the Democrats came in in January, and not that they came in in January; but when they did, they actually enacted earmark reform that I felt was a little stronger than what we had done a few months previous. Having said that, then we go to where we are today where we rolled back a lot of those protections that were there or simply ignored them. 
   The rules that you put in place are only as good as your willingness to enforce them. We just heard this past week that the earmark rules simply are going to be ignored. If a bill comes to the floor, and if it is certified to have no earmarks, we have no recourse, even though there might be earmarks, and have been in a few of the bills already this year. Now we have heard that the plan is to take the appropriation bills through the House process and into the conference process without any earmarks, and simply air drop the earmarks during the conference process. 
   This is not more sunlight. This is actually keeping earmarks secret until it's too late to do anything about it. No amendments can be offered during the conference process, so it will be impossible for anybody to challenge any of what will be thousands and thousands and thousands of earmarks in the bill. 
   This is not better. This is far worse than we have had before. 
   Let me just speak specifically to this legislation and some of the failings. I offered an amendment which would get rid of the so-called Abramoff exemption. Few people are probably aware, but public universities, or lobbyists who represent public universities, or State and local governments, are not required under this legislation, are not bound by the same rules that people who lobby for a private institution are. 
   So what, in effect, you are saying, well, let's just take the final four of the basketball tournament that we just had in the NCAA. There was a game between Xavier University and Ohio State. If you were a lobbyist for Xavier University, you couldn't take a Member to the game. But if you were a lobbyist for Ohio State University, you could treat your Member of Congress, your favorite Member or anybody you wanted to, to a $400 ticket. That's the difference. 
   Now, are we to assume that if you are lobbying for a private institution, that you are somehow inherently suspect, but if you are lobbying for a public institution, you are not? That's the dichotomy here. 
   This amendment was not sprung on the majority as some kind of a gotcha amendment. I took this to the Democrat leadership earlier this year and said, please, can we work together and get rid of this loophole? But we didn't. 
   The amendment was offered in good faith, and it was rejected. Why are we doing this? Why do we allow, right now, if Jack Abramoff were still around, he could still, under these current rules that we are going to enact today, Jack Abramoff could treat Members at the Capital Grille to a big steak dinner. We shouldn't be doing this. 
   The Jack Abramoff incident is what precipitated a lot of these reforms. I'm glad it did. But the problem is, Jack Abramoff represented public institutions, State and local government, territories. I believe he collected about $6.7 million from the government of Saipan. With that, he could continue to do what he did before under these rules, and we should put a stop to it.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago I heard a Member of the Democratic leadership say we have ended meals and gifts from lobbyists. That is true only if you approve this motion to recommit. There is a huge, huge loophole right now in this bill. It doesn't include lobbyists who lobby for State and local governments or for public universities. It is what I call the Jack Abramoff exemption. 
   Under this legislation, unless we pass the motion to instruct, Jack Abramoff  could take any Member of this body out to dinner at the Capital Grille tomorrow and pay $300 for your meal because one of his biggest clients was the government of Saipan which is a territorial government. He would not be included; unless we include this motion to recommit, the Jack Abramoff loophole or exemption will still exist. 
   This is not a game of gotcha. This legislation was introduced last year, and it was offered to the Democratic leadership earlier this year. We didn't need to come to this. It should have been part of the bill. There are some very good things in this bill. This would make the bill far better. 
   State and local governments and public universities spent $132 million last year alone lobbying Congress; $132 million last year alone. None of the lobbyists hired by those institutions are covered in this legislation. Lobbyists for State and local governments and public universities have spent $875 million since 1998, none of which would be covered by this legislation unless you include and unless you vote for the motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, today, the House will take up an extension of the Federal Aviation Administration's authorization. Unfortunately, this bill is more than it seems. It contains an $8 billion bailout for the Highway Trust Fund. Now, for years, we've known that the Highway Trust Fund didn't have sufficient money, that it was losing its purchasing power. In fact, that was a concern going into the 2005 highway bill reauthorization. But what did we do? 
   We not only took no action to shore it up or to do things differently; we approved more than three times as many earmarks as there were in the last highway reauthorization. So now, here we are 3 years later, about a year before our next reauthorization, and we're out of money to cover the projects that we've authorized. 
   Now, I would submit that the action contained in this bill is the most irresponsible thing we can do. We're transferring $8 billion from the general fund into the Highway Trust Fund. As we've known, as we've seen, when Members have the ability to earmark funds from an account, they do so. We did so to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in the highway authorization bill the last time, including the bridge to nowhere and 6,300 other earmarks. If we move additional moneys from the general fund into the Highway Trust Fund, then Katy bar the door when it comes to spending. We simply cannot keep a lid on it. 
   I'm just wondering: When are we going to take up the tough choices? It seems like every time we come to a point when we simply don't have money in the account we simply increase the deficit more and more. We're finding the easy way out. There are options available to us. I will offer amendments wherever I can to take money from the earmarks that haven't been spent, money that we know is not priority spending, and shore up the Highway Trust Fund so that we don't have to move general fund moneys into this account. We simply can't do that. We can't start the process of taking general fund moneys and shoring up the Highway Trust Fund when we know that we can't control our spending appetite when it comes to earmarks. I urge my colleagues to oppose this irresponsible bailout. 
   Another thing that is objectionable: We're doing this on the suspension calendar. That's my understanding today. The suspension calendar is meant as a vehicle to name post offices or to honor sports teams or to do things that are noncontroversial. Yet here we're transferring $8 billion from the general fund to bail out the Highway Trust Fund. Under rules of suspension, that simply doesn't seem right. That is not responsible legislating. It wouldn't be responsible if Republicans did it in the majority. It's not responsible when Democrats do it. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Let's find time to actually take a stand for the taxpayers and say enough is enough. We cannot continue to spend money this way.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike funding for the Lobster Institute at the University of Maine. We will be debating later today subsidies for corn, cotton, rice and sugar. This is about subsidizing lobsters. I frankly think we subsidize corn, cotton and sugar far too much, but lobster subsidies seem to be out of line as well. 
   I think taxpayers are already feeling the pinch, if you will, with high gas prices and huge deficits, and all of the other things that they are asked to pay for. But providing hard-earned taxpayer dollars to the lobster industry should make Members of this body a little red in the face. 
   According to the bill, the New England lobster industry will be receiving $200,000 in Federal taxpayer dollars. The certification letter does not offer much in explanation of what it would be used for except to provide resources for the New England lobster industry. What kind of resources, I think we are justified in asking. This is a private industry that makes millions and millions of dollars annually. What possible support should the Federal taxpayer be offering to this particular industry? 
   Again, this is one area where Congress, through earmarking, is circumventing the regular process that we typically go through. It is a process that I don't like very much. I don't think we ought to be providing funding to the Federal agencies to give subsidies this way either. But there are programs at the Federal agencies, programs that are usually open to competitive bidding where people will submit grant proposals. But through earmarking like this, we circumvent that process and we say we know better what we're going to give what amounts to. It seems like a no-bid contract to a particular industry or business or group of industries. 
   So I would think that this simply isn't the way to go. I would submit that no amount of drawn butter can make this kind of subsidy taste any better. We simply shouldn't be doing this kind of thing. We need to get rid of these kinds of earmarks, again, when we know so very little about what it will go to. We are just told it will provide resources for the New England lobster industry. This is an industry, like some of the others we will be discussing later today, that do quite well on their own. They make millions and millions of dollars. What possible justification can we have for using Federal taxpayer dollars to subsidize or to support an industry like this? 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this is a rather large earmark, $720,000. It's for Federal funding for meteorological equipment at Valparaiso University in Valparaiso, Indiana. 
   Growing up, I was told the best way to tell the weather was to stick your arm out the window of the vehicle as we were going down a farm road. This seems to me to be Congress's way of sticking their arm into taxpayers' back pocket and getting their wallet. 
   The earmark description in the certification letter submitted said the earmark would fund the equipment as a teaching tool for the university's meteorology department and provide weather information to entities in northwestern Indiana and surrounding areas. 
   This university is a coed, 4-year, private university located, as I said, in northwestern Indiana. It's ranked by the U.S. News and World Report as one of the top universities in the Midwest. Its endowment is in excess of $143 million. 
   Again, why do we fund earmarks for institutions that are as flush as this one? Why do we dole out any Federal money to any private institution such as this, with a generous endowment already there? 
   When we approve earmarks like this, we as an institution are bypassing the competitive grant process that already exists for funding educational and research institutions. 
   In 1950, the National Science Foundation, an independent Federal agency, was created by legislation with the intent of promoting the progress of science and advancing national health and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering. 
   In the past, the Federal Government has awarded more than $400 billion in the form of competitive grants; $400 billion has been given out by the NSF over the years. This agency was created with a specific purpose of giving out grants like this. 
   Over the course of this year, the Division of Atmospheric Sciences, an office within NSF, has awarded more than $2 million to fund research for meteorological experiments. Federal funding exists for the sponsor's earmark. This grant process should be respected. 
   Again, we are going outside of the process. There's a process that we have established, that we have caused to be established in the Federal agencies to give out money in this regard, and here we're saying, well, we're not going to go through that. Perhaps this university, I don't know, perhaps it applied for a grant and didn't get it. Perhaps it has received other grants, I just don't know, but what I do know is we are giving what amounts to a no-bid contract where one member of the Appropriations Committee is going to say, I'm going to designate or earmark money for this institution and bypass the process that we have set in place. And I just don't think that's right. 
   If we don't like the process that's been established, let's change it. Let's tell the Federal agencies, you need to have a broader pool, you need to give more grants out to small colleges, you need to do this, you need to do that, but let's establish a process and then follow it rather than circumvent it. And this, I see, is circumventing the process. 
   This bill, the underlying bill today, funds the National Science Foundation at a level of more than $6 billion. What is the purpose of funding an agency like this and telling that agency to  give out grants on a competitive basis if we're going to go around it and give out our own grants from Congress? It just doesn't seem right. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Let me simply say that it's often said through earmarking we are simply asserting our right and the responsibility we have as Members of Congress under article 1. Under article 1, we certainly have the power of the purse. 
   The problem is, I think the contemporary practice of earmarking, when you bring a bill to the floor that has over 1,500 earmarks, you diminish that responsibility that you have, because we go around or circumvent the careful process of authorization, appropriation, and oversight that is a time-honored practice and hallmark of this institution. When we earmark, we get away from that and not enhance it. That's the reason for bringing these amendments forward.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit funding for the National Textile Center. The earmark description in the various certification letters submitted to the committee by various sponsors, and this is one that is sponsored by a number of Members, I understand, says that the earmark will fund the development of a National Textile Center; specifically, the funds will be used to conduct research and development and improve technologies.  
   The Web site for the National Textile Center states that it is a consortium of eight universities, Auburn, Clemson, Cornell, Georgia Institute of Technology, North Carolina State University, University of California Davis, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and Philadelphia University, that share human resources, equipment and facilities. This consortium serves the U.S. fiber-textile-retail complex industries. 
   It's not at all clear what amount this program is to be funded. The committee report language says funding for two textile-related programs, but the proposed funding amount is nowhere to be found in the text of the bill or the committee report. 
   The manager's amendment recommended that the U.S. foreign and commercial service account be increased by $5 million to $245,720,000 in order to fund ``two textile-related programs.'' We can only infer that this increase will fund this program and another program, but there is no way for us to be certain. Inquiries made to the relevant subcommittee failed to clarify the matter. 
   Members of Congress as stewards of the taxpayer's dollars, as stewards, need and deserve more information to make informed decisions. 
   Beyond the transparency issues here, I simply don't agree here, again, with this picking winners and losers here. I understand the textile industry has undergone great transformation with jobs, a lot of jobs going overseas. There is great difficulty there. I don't minimize that. That is true with a lot of industries. 
   In my district and elsewhere, a lot of people would like to receive funding to help their industries transition. We simply can't do it everywhere. 
   Some Internet searching on the National Textile Center indicated the center already exists and has received generous funding in the past. A press release from the center touted that more than $9 million in Federal funds were received in 2001. That, again, is a little confusing when we are told that this will fund the development of a national textile center that seems to already exist. 
   But anyway, again, here, this is an example of a program we have over the Department of Commerce that we have used that funds programs like this. I simply don't see the need to earmark additional funds to supplant or to replace or to augment funds that have already been appropriated and for which there is a process that has been established for competitive grants to be given. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I'll be very brief. 
   One of the gentlemen mentioned that we in Congress simply shouldn't let the Federal Government spend this money. The last time I checked, we are the Federal Government. We're one branch of it, and it's our job to appropriate money to another; that is, to actually spend that money. We don't spend that money here. We don't write the checks. That's done by the Federal agencies. Our role is to provide oversight and to authorize the programs.     
   And so I'm not advocating at all that we step back. I'm advocating that we actually go to the time-honored practice of authorization, appropriation, and oversight. And that allows us to actually go into these Federal agencies and really provide good oversight. 
   But I can tell you, it's very difficult to provide oversight for example for the Defense bill. Last year or the year before, I believe, we provided an earmark in the Defense bill for a museum in New York, in the Defense bill. 
   How can you provide good oversight with any straight face, go to the Defense Department and say, we think that you should have spent more money on body armor for our troops in Iraq. Oh, but by the way, we directed you to spend $2 million on a museum in New York. It just doesn't seem right to me. And so I think, frankly, we cheapen our role when we, the contemporary practice of earmarking, I think, has cheapened the role of Congress and moved us away from authorization, appropriation, and oversight. So that will be my response, and I would urge support for the amendment.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief here. 
   This amendment would simply strike $250,000 for the East Coast Shellfish Research Institute. 
   We just debated an earmark a few minutes ago with regard to the textile industry, and we were told that we needed this earmark because the textile industry is in such dire straits and has been affected by international competition and incomes are down and jobs have been lost. 
   With regard to the shellfish industry, you have the opposite; you have an industry that is actually doing quite well. According to the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association, this is the administrative organization that would receive the earmark, there are 1,300 members of the association with a combined revenue of approximately $80 million this last year. This revenue averages more than $60,000 per shellfish farmer, far more than the median household income in the country. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income is around $44,000. So we have $60,000 in this industry as opposed to $44,000 nationwide. 
   It brings up the question, if we fund earmarks to study industries or to help industries that are in dire straits and we fund earmarks to fund industries that are doing quite well, why not everything in between? What is to stop us from going ahead and funding every private industry and their associations that are represented here or elsewhere? It simply doesn't make sense to me. 
   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Federal agency that manages the conditions of the oceans and the atmosphere, the U.S. seafood harvest has produced increasingly higher yields since 2000. This is in addition to increased consumer demand for seafood based on new dietary guidelines. 
   I grew up on a cattle ranch on a farm, and I don't want anybody to accuse me of favoring beef over seafood or shellfish. I don't. I like both. But in this case, it seems to me the Congress is again picking winners and losers here. We're saying we're favoring one particular industry, be it textiles, be it shellfish, and the only way to not do that is to give earmarks to every industry out there. And I just don't think that we can. We simply can't afford that. The taxpayer needs a break here. 
   So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   In 2005, while on the House Judiciary Committee, I, along with some others, offered a series of reforms to the process of issuing national security letters. These reforms came about during the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. These reforms didn't go as far as I would have liked, but we took the administration at their word when they said that civil liberties would not be violated. 
   During the reauthorization process, I and others were told by administration officials that the reforms we sought were not needed, that the Department of Justice and FBI would never do the hypothetical worst-case scenario that some of my colleagues and I worried about. 
   After a long investigation by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, I can regrettably say many of the worst-case scenarios actually came about and that our hypotheticals were not so farfetched. 
   The FBI has abused its power both in terms of National Security Letters and exigent letters. In the case of exigent letters, it appears the FBI repeatedly asserted exigent circumstances where none existed in order to obtain telephone records. The Inspector General's probe also concluded that there sometimes was no open nor pending national security investigation tied to the request. This directly contradicts the requirements of U.S. law. Letters went out stating that a grand jury subpoena was forthcoming when none was forthcoming. 
   The Inspector General's report was just a small sampling of the use of these letters, and we have not been given a larger picture yet. I want to commend the gentleman from Florida for bringing this forward. He has worked hard on this issue, and we are not speaking anymore in hypotheticals. We have seen abuses. They have been documented. This is very important, and I commend him for bringing this forward, and I join him in his effort.

   Mr. FLAKE. Let me just pay tribute first to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) for the hard work in bringing this amendment and being the lead sponsor to the floor. 
   It strikes me that the committee in this case, as the saying goes, is traipsing down a flower-strewn path unpricked by the thorns of reason. 
   We are running headlong, whether we like it or not, into international trade agreements that will not coexist with the status quo bill. We cannot move forward and maintain the access we have to world markets or increase access to other world markets with this bill. We simply can't. Nor can we maintain the fiscal burden carrying this forward. 
   We need a real reform bill, a reform bill that really looks out for family farms, as opposed to protecting those who are gobbling up family farms. That is what this reform bill is all about. 
   Members of this body have wanted an opportunity to vote for a bill that doesn't increase taxes, that has real reform. This is that chance. This is the amendment. This is the chance to actually do that. 
   We need real reform, reform that allows us to go forward, that allows the American farmer to actually become independent and independently competitive globally. The status quo bill, the committee bill, just doesn't do that. It doesn't cut direct payments. As much as we have heard that tonight, it doesn't. High prices have done that. There is no cut in direct payments at all here. Only prices have done that. 
   I urge support of this amendment.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, we have always been fortunate to have in this body of legislators Members who, for lack of a better term, are called ``institutionalists.'' These are Members on both sides of the aisle who understand and appreciate the fact that this institution will outlive all of us and that we should try to ensure that when we leave the Congress, we leave the institution better than we found it. 
   Madam Speaker, we desperately need these institutionalists to stand up today and play a role in reforming the practice of earmarking that is beneath the dignity of this great institution. 
   It is almost a daily occurrence that we wake up to newspaper articles detailing questionable earmarks that coincide with large campaign contributions, earmarks that face little or no scrutiny in this body, earmarks that were more intended to garner votes or contributions than to address legitimate needs. 
   We have also seen little inclination on the part of those currently in the  position of leadership on either side of the aisle to address this issue in a meaningful way. We have changed the parties in charge, but we haven't changed the practice. 
   So the mantle falls on the institutionalists among us to foster this change, those who deep down know that we owe more to this institution than we are giving it. 
   It is time to stand up and be counted.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the Chair. 
   Before talking about this amendment, there wasn't time for me to speak on the last one, I just want to say that I don't think it is the road that we want to go down to start naming facilities or programs after ourselves. I think that the rules may be a bit vague, but they seem clear enough that we shouldn't do that. The dialogue that I heard was, Are you worthy to have something named after you if you have just been here a few years? Does it take 38 years? What does it take? 
   Frankly, I think it would take a lot more than $2 million to get any college or university in my district to name something the ``Flake Center,'' for a myriad of reasons. But, having said that, I just don't think it is a road that we should go down. So that is why I supported the gentleman's amendment. I hope others as they come to the floor will, as well. 
   This amendment would prohibit $200,000 in Federal funds from being used for the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, for exhibits, education programs, and for an archival project. It reduces the cost of the bill by a consistent amount. I couldn't think of any jazzy line here, but I will just say that earmarks like this probably give taxpayers all over the blues. 
   This earmark would come out of the Institute of Museum and Library Services account, or the IMLS. The IMLS administers a competitive grant program for museums, libraries and zoos. This committee has recommended this program be funded with nearly $18 million. 
   Here is part of the problem, I think, with earmarks, particularly in this bill. We are often earmarking funds that are in programs at the agencies that are already designated to be awarded on a competitively bid process. This jazz museum, I am sure, has submitted applications. Perhaps they have won grants over the years. But maybe this year they didn't. So what earmarks typically do are circumvent the process that we have mandated to be established with these agencies. 
   We often complain about Federal agencies not listening to us and going out and spending willy-nilly. That is often the case, certainly. It is our job, then, to call them in and say, we want to change your program. We want to have you competitively bid projects. 
   I should point out that much of what we criticize the agencies for we are doing here in spades. Earmarks are, by their very definition, no-bid contracts. We are saying to people out there, if you can't get your grant through the competitively bid process, come to us anyway, and we will earmark those funds for you. So there is no concept, no discussion of merit. 
   Try as they might, I am sure the Appropriations Committee is not in a position to adequately scrub and vet all of these earmark requests. That is simply not their role and shouldn't be their role. We shouldn't put that burden on the Appropriations Committee. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman whose earmark this is. I believe he knows that. I commend him for earlier than just about anybody putting his earmarks on his Web site. Certainly, this has been a good reform. I have been complimentary, and I remain so, of the majority party's willingness in January to go down this road and actually require this much. It follows some of what we did in the fall as Republicans. Frankly, in some areas, I think it did better than we did. 
   This isn't a case of something looks untoward in this earmark, or somebody is trying to get some private gain. It doesn't seem to me to be that at all. It is simply a question of, is this a proper priority? Should Members of Congress be able to designate money like this, particularly in this case, when we have a Federal agency with a program to award grants and an account with $16 million that we appropriate every year to award grants under this program? That is my question here. 
   I think that certainly, as mentioned, jazz is uniquely American. I can't imagine them submitting a proposal that would not be granted. It seems like a great place. It seems to be appropriate. What is at question here is,  should the Congress be doing this? That is where I am. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   It was brought up before that we're not talking about what the Federal agencies do. We talk a lot about what Congress does with earmarking, but there's an area of complaint I've heard about what the Federal agencies are doing. Well, this is the time to have that discussion. Right now. 
   We're looking to reduce the amount spent, the amount that we appropriate to the Federal agencies. Yes, they waste money, a tremendous amount of money. They waste money in my own district. This is the time that we say, hey, hold back a little, reprioritize, don't spend as much, and yet we're not doing it. 
   Instead, we say, well, you're misspending money and so we're going to misspend some money with earmarking. We don't like the way you have prioritized, so we're not going to actually go in and provide oversight and say, all right, stop spending money this way or that way. We're just going to add to it with our own priorities. 
   Let me just give an example. It's often said we don't ever give examples of specific programs. I'll give you one. I believe it was last year or maybe the year before GAO came out with a study saying that the DARE program was a waste of money, basically, or we weren't getting the bang for the buck that we should. What did we do? We increased funding for it. Instead of saying, you know, maybe it's not run as it should be, maybe we should scale back on it, force them to change it or scrap it altogether, but instead we increased funding for it. 
   That goes on across the board. GAO studies that we often commission are always followed by, well, they must need more money. Not the money's being misspent. They just need more of it. 
   That's what this amendment is all about to say, hey, Federal agencies you're misspending money; you're spending too much; it's time to scale back, and by the way, we can scale back on our own as far as earmarking as well. 
   So we never hear about the Federal agencies misspending. Here's one saying they do. They do in your district; they do in my district. This is the opportunity to say enough is enough. Let's cut back. Let's have some fiscal responsibility here. 
   So I commend the gentleman for his amendment, and I urge everyone to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I introduced legislation last week with the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran) that would put a moratorium on earmarks until we have a process in place where we can fully vet all earmarks. Earlier this year, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee said it was simply impossible, that we don't have the resources to investigate every earmark request. I agree. However, rather than approving thousands of earmarks, anyway, the prudent course would be to take a break and reevaluate the system. 
   Without the resources to vet over 11,000 earmarks in the House and Senate this year, bad earmarks are sure to slip through the cracks. Not only do these earmarks bring embarrassment to Members, they bring shame to the institution. Our constituents expect better of us. They should get it. 
   Mr. Speaker, the House has traditionally had a process of authorization, appropriation and oversight, a process that we have abandoned in recent years. Until we can get back to that system, we need to take a break from earmarks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. I understand there was an amendment adopted in committee that struck all of the earmarks in the bill. I applaud this. It's a great day when we decide that the Intelligence Authorization Bill is not the place to put secretive earmarks. So that was, indeed, a good thing. 
   I should also mention that the committee also prohibited $39 million from going from the National Drug Intelligence Center. This is a center that has been in need of closing down for years. The administration says that the NDIC has proven ineffective in achieving its assigned mission. Yet it still receives money every year, not because it's effective, not because it does anything that the other drug centers do--there are some 19 of them, I believe, that are already in existence, and it simply duplicates some of those efforts--but because there is a powerful appropriator who continues to make sure that that center is funded. 
   What I wanted to do was to have an amendment here where we could make certain that the NDIC was not funded in any portion of this bill, not just the earmarks in the unclassified version, but to make sure that funding did not go again to the NDIC. That amendment was not allowed. 
   We really need to tighten this up, Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned. This is a center that the administration has said for years needs to be closed. We know it. The administration knows it. Yet we have a powerful appropriator who ensures that money continues to flow, not because the Nation needs it but simply because we can do it, and that's not a good enough reason. 
   So I would urge us to reject the rule and to come back with a rule that allows meaningful amendments to be debated here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, we have a process here with regard to legislation and how it moves through the Congress. In particular, the rules were changed in January, some very welcome changes to the rules with regard to earmarks. 
   We said that if you are going to have an earmark in a bill, or in a report, that you need to state that you do not have a financial interest in that earmark, and then you need to submit that earmark, or it has to be submitted with the report so that Members can actually see that and see that there is no financial interest, see if it has merit or warrant. 
   This process is not being followed here. We were told initially that there were no earmarks in the bill, and then those of us who went up to view the classified annex did not see a list. There was no list available there. We were told later that it was with the Clerk's Office. Then with the Parliamentarians. 
   It turned out that we finally did get the list, and here it is, 26 earmarks in the bill. But the list was not made public. It was not given to us until 5 hours after the deadline that the Rules Committee had established to submit your amendments. 
   So somebody who wanted to amend the bill or actually challenge or to highlight or to discuss the earmarks that are mentioned here and listed here did not have an opportunity to craft an amendment. 
   Again, this list was received, it was made public 5 hours after the Rules Committee already shut down the amendment process. This rule cannot go forward like this. We cannot continue to do business like this.     
   We all know the problems that we have had with the appropriations process with the earmarking, the scandals that have gone on. The earmarking process is secretive enough, it seems, in the Congress without adding the layer of the Intelligence Committee. Then there are things that you can't even discuss on the floor, that we can't discuss openly; so it makes it even more difficult. 
   Members need not be reminded that Duke Cunningham now sits in prison because of earmarks he largely got in the intelligence process, in the Intelligence Committee. We cannot allow that to happen again. We have to have a process that makes sure that that cannot happen. And that process is not happening right now, when you don't get lists until long after the process, when you can't challenge them on the floor. And then we have the problem here in open session where you can't even challenge the earmark and talk about what the earmark is actually about because you are in open session and you might be talking about classified things. 
   So for that reason I am announcing now that I will offer a motion to move into secret session after these votes are concluded. 
   Let me just remind the Members, if you want a process where you know what is going on, we have to move into secret session. If you vote against the motion to go into secret session, you are, in essence, saying let's just let it go; I don't care what is in there. 
   I would challenge those who want to see what is going on to go up and view the classified annex. You may or may not be able to find out what these earmarks are about. But with this process, the way it is, we will never know, and we can't continue this. 
   I applauded the majority's move to new earmark rules in January. They were, I felt, stronger than what we did when we were in the majority. I think they should have been stronger, but they were better than what we did, and I said so. But we aren't following those rules. 
   We have already highlighted a few times that if the majority submits a list of earmarks, incomplete or complete, or simply states there are no earmarks in a bill, there is no parliamentary recourse for the minority or for anyone on the floor. We have to accept at face value that there are no earmarks or that the list is complete. That is wrong. That is something that has to change. 
   But when we are dealing with the Intelligence Committee on something this important, we can't let this process go forward without adopting some of the reforms that we have said that we are going to adopt. 
   So for that reason I will offer a motion for a secret session at the appropriate time, and I would urge a vote against this rule.

   And, also, let me point out again unless you are in secret session, you can't discuss exactly what the earmark might be about; so you might run afoul of any statements that you have signed or any confidentiality agreements that we are under in terms of classified information. And when I actually went up with the list to look at the classified annex again and pointed at certain earmarks, I was told that we are not sure what that was about. That was requested by a Member who is not on the committee. We don't know. And until we can have that Member actually stand up and be able to say what that earmark is about, whether it goes to a private company, whether it goes to an agency, we just don't know.

And in this case, unless a Member can go up and view the classified annex and come away with an assurance or some kind of comfort level that the earmark under question is for the intended purpose or it should be in the intelligence bill, then we are at a loss when we come to vote. I think our constituents expect us to be informed, and when we can't even go up and view the classified annex and be informed, then there is a problem.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. The Congressional Record today makes a statement, ``H.R. 2206, making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes, does not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits or limited tariff benefits as defined in clause 9(d), 9(e) or 9(f) of rule XXI.'' 
   I am just trying to reconcile. I am a bit confused because there is a press release today, and I would ask and would gladly yield time to the chairman if he can explain, there was a press release from a Democrat office today saying so-and-so inserts funds in emergency supplemental appropriations bill for critical flood mitigation projects. It goes on to say so-and-so today announced that $8,665,000 is included in the House emergency supplemental appropriation bill to fund flood mitigation projects in New York necessitated by the recent nor'easter. 
   That seems an awful lot like an earmark to me, if a Member actually does a victory lap afterwards and says that Member actually inserted in the bill. 
   I yield to the chairman to respond or explain.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank you. 
   The problem that we have pointed out over and over is that the earmark rules that have been adopted allow the majority simply to state in the Record that there are no earmarks, regardless of whether that is true or not. In this case, clearly it is not. 
   Yet when the time is right to challenge, when a point of order can be lodged against consideration of the bill, the minority or anybody who wants to challenge in the majority or minority is without recourse. So clearly this needs to be addressed. Clearly this bill does have earmarks.  
   I would appeal to the majority to please tighten up the rules so we can actually have an honest debate.

   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, I thank Mr. Schiff for yielding, and I appreciate working with him on this important amendment and on this issue for a long time. 
   Madam Chairman, this amendment would reiterate that FISA is the exclusive means by which domestic electronic surveillance can be conducted for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence information. 
   As has been stated before, we have, on the Judiciary Committee, for years been asking the administration what can we not do within FISA, do we need to change FISA in order to be able to conduct surveillance we need within FISA. We have never been given compelling information or evidence why we can't do what we need to do within FISA. As Mr. Schiff mentioned, if we do need to change FISA to update it again, as it has been changed and updated multiple times, then we should do it. However, we simply can't say FISA is insufficient; so go around it, and we don't want to know what goes on outside of it. Go ahead with the Terrorist Surveillance Program. We will have no congressional oversight. That is simply unacceptable. If we do need to change FISA, if we do need to modernize it, let's modernize it again, again, and again. But let's make sure that Congress maintains its prerogative to regulate the surveillance that goes on to make sure that it is done with civil liberties in mind. That is what this amendment seeks to do, and I am pleased to work with Mr. Schiff on it.

Some of us simply believe that the best way to ensure the long-term viability of the auto industry is to allow them to go into bankruptcy where they can reorganize in a way that will make them viable in the long term. 
   This legislation simply represents the fatal conceit, the notion that we in this institution can outguess the millions of decisions by independent actors in the marketplace. We simply  can't. We know that. Yet think about it. This legislation appoints a car czar. That sounds like the guy in East Germany in the 1970s who came up with the infamous Trabant, or Trabbie, which is the European version of the Edsel.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for putting together such a great alternative budget. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the budget resolution being considered today, and I do urge support for the minority substitute budget. 
   Totaling nearly $3 trillion, the 2008 budget, as introduced, is the largest in history, and it fails on many levels. 
   First, it fails to provide significant entitlement reform. Second, it fails to provide fiscal restraint on discretionary spending. And finally, it fails in reducing the physical burden on taxpayers. 
   The 2008 budget, as introduced, also fails to provide a blueprint for reining in our bloated farm programs. I want to talk about that for a minute. 
   This budget is consistent with CBO's March baseline and provides funding for reauthorization of current farm bill programs. But it also allows for up to $20 billion in so-called ``reserve spending'' over 5 years. Even with select commodity prices as high as they are, allowing for farm programs to continue at their current funding level is a tough pill to swallow. 
   Even though an estimated allocation is included in the budget, under the current farm programs, the actual amount of spending will depend on future commodity prices. Should crop prices fall, as they did after the 1996 farm bill, we will see dramatic increases in farm payments, spending that we have not accounted for or that we have otherwise offset for. 
   According to the CRS, the 1996 farm bill was expected to cost $37 billion over 7 years, but with farm prices falling dramatically, the Federal Government actually spent nearly $90 billion. This could happen again. With the volatility inherent in current farm program spending, taxpayers should not be saddled with an additional $20 billion over 5 years in so-called reserve spending. 
   While at this point this reserve spending requires offsets, there is no way to ensure that that requirement will actually stick in the outyears. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the minority substitute, which includes fiscal restraint and an unprecedented level of transparency. The substitute budget includes about $300 billion worth of savings in entitlement reforms and balances the budget in 5 years without increasing taxes. 
   With 77 million baby boomers set to retire, pushing the total cost of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid from today's 8.4 percent of GDP to 18.9 percent of GDP in 2050, we literally cannot afford to do nothing. The substitute budget also does not provide the additional reserve spending for agriculture programs. 
   Finally, the substitute budget includes a requirement that earmarks be included in the text of appropriation bills. This is a measure that I have championed for a while, and I should point out in the last Congress I had good bipartisan support. Many Democrats supported this legislation. They are not today. I think it should be noted, if it was good last year, it's good this year as well. 
   I urge support for the substitute budget.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   There has been a lot of rhetoric today and a lot of talk about polling and how Americans everywhere support this, Governors support this, people at the local level support it. 
   We have in this country something called representative government. We are sent here and we are given access to figures and numbers that perhaps others don't have. What figures and numbers I am talking about tell us that we cannot sustain the trend that we are on, particularly ramping up a program like this and spending more than we have in the past. We simply can't sustain it, particularly when gimmicks are used in the outyears to pay for it. We know that. Perhaps those who are responding to the polls do not. 
   George Washington once said: If to please the people we do what we ourselves disapprove, how will we afterwards defend our work? 
   That is what we are here for, to do what we know is right. When I am told you have got to do what your conscience says, my conscience says that we can't afford this. If we have to use gimmicks in the outyears to pay for it, we simply can't afford to expand this program.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (GENERATIONS INVIGORATING VOLUNTEERISM AND EDUCATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, Ronald Reagan once said, ``No matter how big or powerful government gets and the many services it provides, it can never take the place of volunteers.'' I believe that wholeheartedly. But listening to the debate today, you might easily conclude that volunteerism wasn't discovered until Congress discovered it, and that the only meaningful service that anyone can provide is in a program sponsored by government. We all know that that is simply not the case. 
   In truth, the programs that are being talked about today, the government-sponsored programs, make up probably less than one-hundredth of 1 percent of all the volunteer activity that takes place across this country. But when we have community service and volunteer positions, when we end up financing them or providing incentives from government, it becomes just another government service.     
   The new Summer of Service grant program created by this legislation gives incentives to community service work in the form of financial benefits at taxpayer expense. The amendment that I am offering today would simply strike all the language in the bill relating to the so-called Summer of Service program and reduce the authorization by $20 million. This is the amount designated to the program. 
   The new Summer of Service program would award $20 million annually for education awards for volunteer positions in which school-aged participants can earn up to $1,000 for completion of a 100-hour community-based service-learning project. 
   Now, we are all familiar with volunteer service that goes on: churches, Rotary Clubs, Boy Scout organizations. In fact, this weekend, 2 days from now, my own son will be doing his Eagle project. He will provide up to 30 hours of service himself, and more than 100 hours will be provided by people that he has recruited to help him in his project. This kind of activity goes on every day, every minute of every day, every second of every day. And yet, we feel that we have to have new and more government programs somehow to prompt volunteer service. That, I think, sells people across this country short. People can volunteer on their own and do without benefits provided by government. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, this $20 million program is being authorized under the Learn and Serve program. I would be glad to yield 30 seconds to the sponsor of this program or to the committee if I can find out if they actually studied whether this program is working as it is. It doesn't seem they are near the microphone, so I will read something from the Office of Management and Budget. 
   The Office of Management and Budget audited this program a while ago under the Learn and Serve program. The Learn and Serve program was audited to be not performing, results not demonstrated. The AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps, not performing. Ineffective. This is our own government telling us what our own programs are doing, and yet here we are under the Learn and Serve program authorizing $20 million more for a new program without trying to go in and actually fix the old program or eliminate the old program. 
   We in Congress sometimes wonder why our authorizing committees are sometimes neglected. This is why. This is why. This program, the whole AmeriCorps program hasn't been reauthorized I think since 1996 or so; and yet, when we do come to reauthorize it, we ignore what our own government, our own agencies are telling us about these programs and we simply pile more money on. 
   No matter what we do on the overall bill, and I can read the writing on the wall, the bill is going to pass, let's at least give some thought to the taxpayers here who have to fund this, to say that we are not going to increase a program to create a new program under an existing program that has been rated by our own Office of Management and Budget as not performing, results not demonstrated. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the resolution before us. I wish I could do so with the type of certainty that seems to motivate many of my colleagues on the issue. But such resolute certainty escapes me. I do not have a military background. In fact, few of us debating this resolution do. 
   But each of us can find generals or former generals who will support virtually every option we wish to put on the table. In the end, as legislators, we are left with our own council. Hopefully, such council is informed by briefings, hearings, meetings, and visits to the region. 
   But we cannot and should not try to place ourselves in the position of Commander in Chief. Our system of government wisely gives that role to the Chief Executive. 
   This is not to say, however, that we should not be having this discussion. Some have said that simply debating this resolution emboldens our enemies. Perhaps they are right, but we would not suspend due process in this country because it might embolden criminals. It is a price we are willing to pay. 
   Likewise, debating the merits of war is what democratic nations do. My own thoughts on the situation in Iraq are as follows: I have little confidence that a surge in troop levels will change the situation in Iraq in any substantive fashion. It seems clear that the violence in Iraq is increasingly sectarian, and inserting more troops in this atmosphere is unlikely to improve matters very much. 
   Without a more sincere commitment to step up to the plate from the Iraqi Government, we are unlikely to make significant progress. But when all is said and done, we have a Commander in Chief whom we have authorized to go to war. 
   Inserting ourselves as legislators into the chain of command by passing a resolution, nonbinding though it may be, that questions the President's decision to conduct a mission that is clearly already under way strikes me as folly. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This Congress, more than anything else, I think is being defined as the ``bailout Congress.'' We're going to be bailing out the housing industry to the tune of billions and billions and billions of dollars later today. And before we get to that, we're going to be bailing out the highway trust fund to the tune of $8 billion. 
   Let me just remind Members that the TEA-LU, the last highway authorization bill, the bill with the infamous Bridge to Nowhere in it, contains 6,300 earmarks. Many of these earmarks were for museums, bypasses, trollies, parking facilities, landscaping, recreational facilities, highway beautification, street scaping, hiking trails and visitor centers. Billions and billions of dollars went to these items. And yet we are going to be taking $8 billion from the highway trust fund. If you start doing that, Katy bar the door on projects like these that have run rampant already and will continue to. 
   Now we have billions of dollars that have been unobligated, that have not yet been obligated. We should take that funding from those earmarks, from many of those 6,300 earmarks that have not been obligated, and apply it to this funding shortfall instead of robbing the general fund. Once we start robbing the general fund for these projects, Katy bar the door. We simply won't stop. This is a bad thing to do. We shouldn't reauthorize this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the famed economist Milton Friedman once said that the government's solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem itself. I think that that is certainly applicable here today. 
   When we had the housing bill up for debate a few months ago, I had a bit of a dialogue with the chairman of the Financial Services Committee. I had mentioned that he had appropriately and often excoriated Republicans when we would lavish corporate subsidies on private interests there, when we didn't live up to our belief in the principle of capitalism. I think that was sometimes deserving. 
   But here is a gentleman that certainly understands the free market and understands that this bill has moral hazard written all over it. We are pretending to chain a monster here, and we are, instead, letting that monster loose. 
   The competitive advantages that Freddie and Fannie have had over the past several years, with an implicit government guarantee, which many people have tried to tell us who have wanted GSE reform for so long did not really exist, that taxpayers were really not on the hook. Well, that implicit guarantee today is made explicit. 
   Can you imagine the competitive advantage going forward that Fannie and Freddie will have over their competitors when you have an explicit guarantee rather than an implicit guarantee? This is simply the wrong way to go. If we wanted to tailor something that dealt with GSEs, both with ensuring that they are solvent but making sure that the taxpayers aren't put in this position again, that would be one thing. This bill does not do that. We are unchaining a monster here, and we are making the situation far worse.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Madam Chairman, the focus of the Beach Act is to ensure that citizens enjoy recreational activity in the coastal waters and that they can do that safely. That should be the focus of the bill, and that's where I think we should keep the focus of the bill. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to make sure that the purpose of the bill is not to protect vulnerable Members, vulnerable incumbents. And, unfortunately, that's been the case with a lot of legislation that we have passed in the past. It just simply becomes a magnet for earmarks, for Member earmarks, to protect vulnerable Members  or to reward Members or to go towards Members in leadership or in high positions on particular committees. 
   The Beach Act authorizes a formula-based grant program to help implement State and local beach monitoring, assessment, notification programs. What we don't want to see is money bled off from these formula-based programs to Member projects. Unfortunately, that has happened. And if we don't think that it will happen with this bill, then we have our heads in the sand. 
   The purpose of this amendment is simply to say that none of the moneys authorized in this legislation will go toward earmarks, that all of the money as it is now will go toward formula-based funding. 
   Now, some might say that the Beach Act has not been historically earmarked. That is true. That's how it should remain. The problem is some of the legislation that has not been historically earmarked is now earmarked. In fact, when we passed the Homeland Security bill, which we celebrated today 5 years after, we were told this will not be earmarked. This will be formula-based grants, it will be spread out, but it will not be earmarked. And for 4 years that remained true. 
   But last year the legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security had a boatload of earmarks in it. According to Taxpayers For Common Sense, the 2008 omnibus bill contained 128 earmarks worth more than $400 million in Homeland Security funding. According to a story by the Hill, 115 new earmarks worth $117 million were air-dropped at the last moment. These were earmarks that we said we weren't going to do anyway in a bill that we said we were not going to earmark. These were, obviously, to assist vulnerable Members. 
   Many were earmarks in the funding for FEMA's Predisaster Mitigation Program. This was a program intended to ``save lives and reduce property damage'' by providing funds for ``hazard mitigation planning, acquisition, and relocation of structures out of the floodplain.'' In 2007 this program received $101 million to fund competitively awarded projects with no earmarks. According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, in 2008 this program received a boost in funding to $114 million, but nearly half of the amount, $51.3 million, was tied to 96 earmarked projects, including earmarks for projects that should not have qualified for funding under the program. 
   So we could have earmarks in this beach program for projects that aren't even eligible under the formula-based funding that's currently here, and that's what we should all fear. This body has gone far too far over the past several years, under Republicans and Democrats, in bleeding off necessary funding for particular programs just to protect vulnerable incumbents during re-election or just to reward particular Members. 
   Some people will say, well, we know in Congress better than those faceless bureaucrats in some department. Well, if that is the case, then we should have parameters. We should provide oversight. That's what this body is supposed to do. There is a process called authorization, appropriation, and oversight. And that's the process we need to follow, not circumventing that process by earmarking. 
   That's the purpose of this amendment. I hope that we can all agree that this is needed to ensure that this program is not earmarked in the future. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. FLAKE. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding. 
   And I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota, Madam Chairman. I could not agree more with virtually everything he has said. This is an important bill. It was brought here, and it has not been historically earmarked. That is great. We need to keep it that way. We need to keep, as he so aptly put it, Members from meddling in this. That's the purpose of this amendment, to keep Members from meddling with the formula-based program in the bill. 
   It was mentioned that it's unnecessary because it hasn't been historically earmarked. I suppose the same would have been said had I brought the same amendment last year to the Department of Homeland Security authorization bill or the appropriation bill because it hadn't historically been earmarked. We promised not to do that. But yet we have earmarked between $500 million and $1 billion, hundreds of  earmarks air-dropped at the last minute, never debated on the House floor, never debated, never an opportunity to amend them out. And that's what we are trying to do here is to protect this important legislation from the same fate. 
   It was mentioned that we have increased the authorization for money in this legislation. That is true. We did that in the FEMA grants in Homeland Security and then earmarked it. We increased it by a little and then earmarked it by a lot. It doesn't take conspiracy theorists to say that this might be happening here, that maybe this is what is going to be attempted here, to start earmarking this legislation, to get these programs that are funded by formula to instead fund Members who need protection in their re-election or who need to be rewarded in some other way. That's not how we should do business. 
   The purpose of this amendment is recognizing the importance of this legislation and making sure that Members don't meddle in it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, the reason I'm standing today is to question this bill in terms of the unfunded mandate point of order. I can tell you honestly, I have no idea if this bill contains unfunded mandates, and I would suggest that most people here are in that position because we only got this bill last night. We haven't been able to read its contents. We know very little of it except that we know very little of it. 
   This is a massive bill. Let me just take one part of it, and this part has concerned me about a lot of the legislation that's come forward before this body in recent years. We were told earlier this year that we were going to have a transparent process in terms of earmarks. And, frankly, some good language was passed--earlier this Congress, I should say--to provide transparency and to ensure that when earmarks are passed, they receive a thorough vetting, at least that we know who introduced them and have a chance to actually challenge those earmarks on the floor of the House. We have not had that opportunity here. 
   This legislation is coming to us with more than 1,200 earmarks that were attached to it in the subcommittee. Now, these earmarks were known only to my office because we managed to get a copy from the Appropriations Committee--that we could not get officially, we had to get unofficially. I would venture that very few other Members have even seen the list of earmarks. Keep in mind that this bill, this Defense Appropriations bill that is included in this CR, has not even been marked up by the full committee. So the full committee has not even seen these earmarks. There are more than 1,200 in the House version; I think there are more than 800 in the Senate version. So, more than 2,000 earmarks that have been added that very few outside of the committee--and outside of the subcommittee that actually dealt with it--have even seen. 
   Now, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee was asked about this secretive process earlier today, and Bloomberg said, and I quote, ``He was asked if the process has been secretive, and he said, ``It has; because if it's done in the public, it will never get done.'' The chairman of the Appropriations Committee said he wanted to avoid his colleagues pontificating on the content of the legislation, saying that's what politicians do when this stuff is done in full view of the press. He said, ``We've done this the old fashioned way by brokering agreements in order to get things done, and I make no apology for it.'' 
   Now, think of that statement. We've passed rules in this House saying that we would have a thorough vetting, yet we're bringing more than 1,200 House earmarks to the floor that have not even been vetted by the committee. We're supposed to have that list long before and to be able to vet them, we haven't done that. And we don't even have a chance here. I don't have the opportunity to stand and question any of these earmarks, and neither do any of my colleagues. 
   Let me just read a few of them that are in here. The Presidio Heritage Center, one of the Speaker's Office's earmarks, $1.7 million. What is it? We really have no idea. We only got the disclosure letter last night or this morning, and that doesn't tell you all that much. Why is the Presidio Heritage Center in the Defense bill? Yet we won't be able to challenge that here; we won't be able to have a vote on that because it was slipped in, not even vetted by the committee, and certainly not vetted by the full House. 
   There is a $3 million earmark for a Cold Weather Layering System. What is that? Is that a coat? We don't know. All I know is this is likely an earmark that's going to a private firm. This is a sole-source contract that everybody has been, rightly, up in arms about when the Federal Government gives out single-source contracts. Here we are doing it without even vetting it in the committee; we're not even vetting it on the House floor. It's passed and done, and we don't even know who it's for or what it's about. Yet, we're doing it. Why? What is the rush to do something like this? 
   I understand that this all may seem a little trivial in a week that we may approve $700 billion, but I think it speaks to why people across the country are  fed up with us as a Congress for not even vetting these kind of things and for letting 1,200 earmarks come into a bill that we haven't even seen and won't be able to vote on. 
   We have an up-or-down vote. This is not even a conference report. There aren't even motions to recommit. This is up or down, take it or leave it, 1,200 earmarks that you have never seen. How does that square with the promises that were made earlier this Congress? 
   Now, I make no bones about it; I don't think our party on the Republican side did well with earmarks. We let far too much go. And some of us stood up and tried to stop it. The majority party came into Congress, won the elections in 2006, took over the majority on promises that they would do something. And I have to say that this is proof, once again, that it hasn't been done. How in the world can anyone stand up today and say we have kept our promise in terms of transparency? 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2638, CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Speaker, I recognize that I'm here on an unfunded mandates point of order. It's the only chance I've got. They don't allow anybody to stand up and challenge any earmarks. That's not allowed under the rule. So this is the only chance anybody has to stand up and say anything about this bill, and it's a crying shame. 
   And I don't blame the gentleman from the Rules Committee for not wanting to address the point at hand here; I don't blame him at all. I wouldn't want to either. I wouldn't want to say that I'm a member of a Rules Committee that would violate the very rules that we ourselves adopted earlier this year so blatantly to simply say we're just not going to discuss it, we're going to bring 1,200 earmarks to the floor and not discuss them at all. 
   Let me suggest why it happens this way. I mentioned this was done behind closed doors without rank-and-file Members knowing anything about these earmarks at all. There is good reason for that. If you look at these earmarks, a total of 1,200 worth about $5 billion, 60 percent of the earmarks in this bill go to members of the Appropriations Committee. I'm sorry. The Appropriations Committee are getting 37 percent of all earmarks. When you add to the appropriators those in leadership, those who are committee Chairs, those who are ranking members, so the leadership and the powerful here, 60 percent of the earmarks in this bill are going to that group, which makes up, I think, just under 25 percent of this body. 
   Now, if anybody's wondering why this is done behind closed doors and in secret and not with rank-and-file Members able to even see this, that's one of the reasons. Because not only are earmarks bad and it's a misallocation of resources, it can lead to things that we have seen in this House, but it's a spoil system, it's a spoil system. When leadership and those who are on the right committees get these earmarks, it shows what a sham the argument is that we have to do this because we as Members of Congress know our districts better than those bureaucrats and we have to earmark those dollars. Well, does somebody who happens to be a chairman or a ranking minority member happen to know his district a lot better than anybody else? Because that's what we're seeing here, we're seeing a spoil system. 
   And it's simply not right. It is not right that we are approving here, with one fell swoop, 1,200 earmarks from the House--800 from the Senate, but that's their business, our business is here--over 1,200 earmarks that nobody in this body has really seen, unless you happen to serve on the subcommittee of Appropriations because the full Committee on Appropriations never vetted these earmarks either. That is simply not right. 
   I don't know when we stand up and say we've had enough, because people all over the country certainly have. I don't know why we haven't realized it. I'm sure it's reflected in the 9 percent approval ratings that we have. But in a week where we're approving $700 billion--or likely to approve $700 billion--to bail out other institutions, this might seem trivial to some to be approving $5 billion in earmarks. 
   But I think why people across the country are upset is they say, you know you have control of this. You made promises years ago that you would clean up this process and you aren't, because nobody with a straight face can say that we have cleaned up this process when you bring to the floor, under this bill, more than 1,200 earmarks that have received no vetting whatsoever and will receive no vetting whatsoever because we can't even challenge those on the floor today. 
   I have no time remaining. Let me just say, let's hold back. Let's slow this legislation down--whichever we can, whether it's procedurally or otherwise--because we cannot continue to do business this way. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   The speaker just said that unless we have this amendment, this program will be gutted. The truth is the committee keeps the funding level as it is, and I think given the GAO report, that is only proper. 
   As my colleagues have already mentioned, the GAO report that was commissioned by myself and Congressman Delahunt noted that there were items purchased with the money that is supposed to go to dissidents in Cuba: a gas chainsaw, Game Boys, PlayStations, a mountain bike, leather coats, cashmere sweaters. How is that going to help the dissident community in Cuba? I would submit not very much. But yet the same ones who support increasing this funding by five times also will not support allowing individuals to visit their own family members in Cuba and take toothpaste or clothing items or even to take a fishing poll so that poor Cubans might supplement their meager diets. That, according to the group that wants to increas e funding here, should be outlawed. We should continue to outlaw that but increase taxpayer funding for a program that the GAO says there was intense mismanagement, cronyism. A scathing report that came out: lack of bank reconciliations, lack of documentation to determine compliance with cost-sharing requirements, questionable travel expenses lacking adequate documentation, questionable expenses paid to family members of a grantee manager, hundreds of dollars of petty cash observed in the grantee's office t hat was not controlled or properly cured. 
   This is not a good amendment. If you believe in fiscal sanity, please defeat the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. FLAKE. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I recognize that a point of order has been lodged and will prevail, and I will withdraw this. But let me just make the point here. 
   This bill, like previous years' bills making appropriations for the State Department and for foreign operations, doesn't include earmarks in the traditional sense. In other words, it doesn't direct agencies to fund specific programs for parochial interests. 
   However, the report accompanying the bill makes reference to several nongovernmental organizations by name. I think it is most accurate to refer to these as ``soft earmarks.'' 
   Scattered throughout the report is language which reads as follows: ``The committee is aware of the work of,'' and you can insert your favorite organization here, ``and encourages USAID to consider supporting such work in fiscal year 2008.'' 
   I would suppose that, given the agencies we are funding, some of these NGOs are based overseas or are international organizations, and I have no doubt that many of them are doing good work. But why are they any more worthy than the hundreds of other organizations that are not named? 
   My amendment does not strike funding for any NGO. Rather, it simply would remove any funding preference for any of the organizations that are listed in the bill over organizations that are not listed in the bill. This amendment simply would prevent funding from going to any of these organizations outside of a competitive bidding process. With the efforts to shine more light on the earmarking process, I am concerned that we might see increasingly creative ways to steer funding to recipients of funding that Members of Congress want to see it go to. 
   I would like to know how these organizations managed to get mentioned by those named in the report. Who made these requests? Was it the administration? Was it Members of Congress? Was it the committee as a whole? Or the organizations themselves? Will the committee disclose this kind of information? Are these agencies going to be under any undue pressure to give preference to these organizations? Will there be any accounting for whether they have received funding or whether they had gone through a fair bidding process? Are we going to see similar soft earmarking in the future now that there is a brighter spotlight on earmarking in Congress? 
   I would welcome any answers to this question now or I would like to work with the committee to understand the rationale for this type of soft earmarking. 
   With that, unless the chairwoman would explain this or enlighten me as to what these soft earmarks are doing or how they come about, I would be glad to withdraw this amendment.
