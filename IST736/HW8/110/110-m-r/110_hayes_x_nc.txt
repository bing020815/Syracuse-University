<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (LUMBEE RECOGNITION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the committee and distinguished ranking member. I want to particularly commend my friend and colleague, MIKE MCINTYRE, for his tireless effort in outlining in great and accurate detail the essence of the issues being presented here today. 
   I want to thank my friend, ENI, again, for his effort and accurate description of the situation that we find ourselves in. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 65, the Lumbee Recognition Act. Since I have been a Member of Congress, I have worked hard to see that the Lumbee Tribe receives full Federal recognition, and I am very pleased that the House is considering this bill on the floor today. 
   As you know, I am a proud original cosponsor of H.R. 65, which was sponsored by my friend and colleague, Congressman MIKE MCINTYRE. MIKE has been a strong and tireless advocate of the Lumbee Tribe for years, and it has been an honor and a pleasure, as always, to work with him on this and other issues as well. 
   I know Senator Dole and Senator Burr are working hard to garner support for the Lumbee Recognition Act in the Senate, and I appreciate their leadership on the issue as well. The Lumbee Indian tribe has an extensive history in North Carolina, ranging back to 1724 on Drowning Creek, which is now referred to as the Lumber River. The Lumbee Tribe has been recognized by the State of North Carolina since 1885. The Lumbee Tribe has over 55,000 members and is the largest tribe in the State of North Carolina and the largest nonrecognized tribe in America.     
   The Eighth District, which I serve, is home to many of the Lumbees who reside in North Carolina, primarily in Hoke, Scotland and Cumberland Counties. These important members of my constituency should be federally recognized so they are able to receive various Bureau of Indian Affairs and other Federal Government services and programs they rightly deserve. 
   The heritage of the Lumbee tribe is as strong today as when first recognized by North Carolina. The tribe has every reason to be proud of the rich and valued cultural contribution they have given to our community. Today, the House is doing what the Federal Government should have done 51 years ago. We should pass this vital piece of legislation and give the Lumbee tribe the distinction of a federally recognized tribe. It's a very important step forward in the process, and I am hopeful that we will see the other body act favorably on this bill in the near future. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in strong support of the Lumbee Recognition Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (HONORING THE LIFE OF BENNY PARSONS -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I thank my friends Danny Davis and Dan Burton. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Benny Parsons, a friend, a true friend and a legend in the racing community. Benny passed away in January; a great loss to all our community. 
   Benny was born and raised in the foothills of North Carolina. After literally stumbling into the racing industry while working for his dad's service station in Detroit, Michigan, Parsons returned to Ellerbe, North Carolina in Richmond County to drive for car owner L.G. DeWitt, a local businessman who also just happened to own the Rockingham race track. 
   Benny Parsons led a legendary career as a NASCAR driver, and he helped make the sport what it is today. From 1964 until his retirement in 1988, Benny made 526 starts. Benny Parsons was the first stockcar driver to go over 200 miles an hour, and he turned that speed into incredible success on the track. Benny won 21 major races, including the Daytona 500 and, in 1973, earned the highest honor in NASCAR, the Winston Cup. 
   Benny's work and contribution did not end on the race track. Upon his retirement from racing, Benny Parsons entered broadcasting, where he further expanded the sport through his insight and his down-home commentary. Benny was a fan favorite and became known as The Professor for his relaxed and uncanny style of commentary. 
   Besides being a champion and Hall of Famer, Benny Parsons was most revered by his colleagues and fans for his generous nature and lovable personality. 
   Benny told me he was always grateful for the support the people of Richmond County gave him. Despite his fame, my conversations with Benny seemed to flow around eating at the Dixie Burger and talking Raider football in Richmond County. He maintained a home there even after settling in my hometown of Concord. 
   To the people of North Carolina's Eighth District, Benny Parsons will always be a hometown boy as well as a champion. I ask that you join me today in extending your sympathy to Benny's wife, Terri; his sons, Kevin and Keith; and his entire family in the racing community. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask to observe a moment of silence in honor of Benny Parsons' legacy of giving. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back for a life well lived.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about gas prices and energy, specifically, the lack of action here in Congress on this issue. Our constituents want us to do something, and the reality is that we have the ability to do something but we're not. 
   Mr. Speaker, according to media reports, the House leadership is doing everything possible to stop a vote on opening more of the oil and gas reserves available in this Nation. It sounds like the entire appropriations process might be stopped rather than having a vote on using our resources so we aren't so dependent on OPEC. I really don't understand why. Maybe it's being captive to the extreme environmental lobby, or maybe it's a completely different philosophy that says we should not do everything possible to bring gas prices down. 
   What I do know, Mr. Speaker, is that we are not going above and beyond to fix this problem. This House is going above and beyond to stop a viable solution. That's wrong. I implore the Democrat leadership to let real energy solutions come up for a vote and get gas prices down.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding, and, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to confirm what I'm hearing here. 
   We've got an energy crisis. Gas prices, food prices are through the roof, but the answer is to investigate. People at home in Raeford, North Carolina, and Laurinburg and Albemarle are telling me: Congress, legislate. Do what you need to do to get the price of gasoline down. 
   But I hear today we're going to investigate future Presidents and how they communicate. My concern, Mr. Speaker, as I listen to my constituents carefully at home is they're going to examine the records, electronic and otherwise, of this Congress, and they will see that we failed to legislate and do the four things that we need to do to drive down the price of gas. 
   Expand our nuclear capacity, it's clean. We need to have tar sands. We need to have coal turned into liquid and burn cleanly. We need to expand our refinery capacity because, as we import refined product, it costs us even more. And oh, by the way, exploration and drilling in areas where we have known reserves is something that we could stand together on the steps of this Capitol today and say we were going to do, and people around the world who watch signals, telling us where the price of energy is going, would see that America, the richest, the best, and the most powerful Nation in the world, is serious about becoming dependent of energy. 
   But no, Democrats, Republicans, I hear it off the floor of this House, Democrats want to do that, Republicans want to do that, yellow dogs, Blue Dogs, but the big dogs, the Democrat leadership, refuse to allow a vote on this floor that will do the four things that I'm talking about. 
   It's even in our own internal newspaper. It was there yesterday. Read it and weep. We need to act. We have the ability, the capability, and the capacity to do that. And by the way, we must not, as we take the steps we need to take, let happen what has happened before, and that is, as we drive gas prices down, and we can--and there's a bill with my name on it that says any money that we derive from additional leases will be used for research and development for alternative sources of energy which are crucial. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, legislate, do it now, get gas prices down.

<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First let me thank Congresswoman Vel&#225;zquez, Sam Graves, and others for bringing an excellent bill to the floor. 
   I rise today in support of the bill and support of Mr. Matheson's amendment. But I think a picture in this case is worth a thousand words, because as we look at the small businesses, the men and women that make up the small business core of our communities, the one item that is on their minds is the price of gas. 
   In the Washington paper last week was a political cartoon. Unfortunately, there was nothing funny about it. If you would follow me for just a moment: Very obvious in the picture, the Capitol is there. And in the first frame it says: We demand that you energy companies do something about high gas prices. 
   Well, if you move with me to the second frame the question is asking, you have heard it here today: Can we drill in ANWR? Can we explore off our coastal regions while the Chinese are drilling off the coast of Cuba? The answer: Forget it. Forget it. We can't do that. So we take that off the table. Now the second frame it talks offshore. 
   The third frame, clean coal. We have more coal resources than Saudi Arabia has oil. We have technology that can be improved even more to allow us to burn coal cleanly, but we also must be able to turn coal into gas for fuel in airplanes for the Air Force. This is something that we must do. 
   Conservation is critical, and I applaud the new majority for their emphasis on conservation. We are all sensitive to that and we are working in our own ways to conserve as much as we can. 
   Alternate sources of energy, vitally important. But as a livestock and agriculture member, our food supplies, our food prices are being driven up by a lack of balance on alternative fuels like ethanol. 
   So back to the picture. Nuclear power. It is clean, it is safe. We are making progress every day in the effort to use spent fuel in positive ways. But, no, that is not on the table. 
   Last but not least: You're joking. Why don't you do something? 
   Well, folks, we can do something. The Small Business bill is critical. The last Congress that met on this floor passed the legislation that is referred to. The only thing not mentioned in this political cartoon that is not funny is the expansion of our refinery capacity. 
   So, again, I thank the gentlelady, Mr. Matheson, and others for their important efforts to strengthen small businesses. But I would remind everyone here, because you have the same experience that I have, whether you are talking about BRAC, agriculture, economic development, the research campus in Kannapolis, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, gas prices strike you in the face like somebody shaking you by the shirt walking around the room when you see that price going up every day on the sign at the gas station. 
   So, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply ask that we Members of Congress join together in a bipartisan way as we are handling these amendments and put forth a resolution that says to the foreign oil exporters who are gouging us for prices; we say to the rest of the world we will explore, not exploit, we will use nuclear energy, we will use our coal resources, we will expand our refineries so that we become competitive while developing vitally important alternative sources of energy that will ensure the future, the independence opportunity for everyone in this country. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and pay tribute to the Concord High School Spiders men's athletic team for making history by being the first 3A school in North Carolina to win State titles in both men's basketball and football in the same year. 
   The Spiders basketball team, who finished as the runners-up in 2006, defeated Kinston High School 85-79 for the 2007 championship title on March 10. The Spiders football team defeated Western Alamance last December, taking the State championship for the second time in 3 years. 
   Star players on both of Concord's teams include senior guard, Dee Bost, who scored 27 points in the championship game and earned the honor of Most Valuable Player for both basketball and football. Lance Lewis, a starter on the 2004 and 2006 football championship teams, scored 16 points and four rebounds, and was named Concord's Most Outstanding Player in the final. 
   The athletic program at Concord High is one of great tradition that dates back even further than my years of playing there. The nickname Spiders came from the athletic field at the old Concord High School, which was named after Principal and School Superintendent A.S. Webb. Concord's first State title was one in 1929. 
   I am extremely proud of the hard work and dedication of these young men from my hometown of Concord. Congratulations to Coach E.Z. Smith, Coach Andy Poplin and the Concord High men's football and basketball teams on your successful seasons, great teamwork and dual State championship victory.

<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I want to thank Chairman Rangel, Chairman HERGER and Chairman MCCRERY for their great work. Unfortunately, I must rise today in opposition to H.R. 3688, the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. 
   My opposition to this agreement stems from what the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition calls a continuation of a flawed trade policy of trade deficits, offshoring and job losses. 
   Auggie Tantillo, the executive director of AMTAC goes on to state, ``Congress spending the entire year focusing on an unpopular Peru FTA instead of passing a strong anticurrency manipulation bill is an enormous disappointment to U.S. manufacturers desperate for relief from China's predatory trade practices.'' Folks, I could not agree more. I don't see where this particular legislation helps combat the largest threat to our Nation's manufacturing base, China. 
   As many of you know, manufacturing, the textile industry in particular, has taken a massive hit in both loss of jobs in businesses due directly to unfair trade practices by China and their fixed currency. Without a level playing field for our textile workers, businesses, and the manufacturing sector in general, the demise of our manufacturing industry will continue to take place all over the country. 
   I'm a cosponsor and strong supporter of the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, which was sponsored by Congressmen DUNCAN HUNTER and TIM RYAN. This important piece of legislation will level the playing field for American companies by stipulating that countervailing trade cases targeting government subsidies can be brought against nonmarket economies such as China, and it does it in a WTO-compliant manner. 
   Another issue I'm concerned with is the lack of enforcement of our current trade laws, in particular with textile enforcement. Textile enforcement is vital to the future of the U.S. textile industry and its workforce. The U.S. textile and apparel industry is critical to the economic national security of our Nation. 
   The industry contributes almost $120 billion to our Nation's GDP. However, we are putting this industry and its workforce in harm's way if Customs does not continue to utilize all enforcement tools, such as seizures, detentions and special operations to help our Nation's industrial base. 
   Folks, we need to get our priorities right here. We need to focus on preserving American jobs and American businesses. We have lost too many jobs. Too many companies have been hurt because of unfair Chinese trade practices and lack of proper enforcement. It's time to start fighting back.

<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (OUR RICH HISTORY OF FAITH -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I want to thank my dear friend and colleague, RANDY FORBES, and all the other Members who are gathered here tonight in support of House Resolution 888. 
   I rise today to speak in support of this resolution that honors the religious foundation of this country and designates the first week in May as American Religious Heritage Week.     
   From the devout convictions of the Continental Army to the current steadfast faith of our men and women fighting the war on terrorism, faith and religion have played a significant role in America's history, especially in times of conflict. 
   Military chaplains have a long history in serving the religious needs of the Armed Forces. There's a list of chaplains in the U.S. military that goes back to George Washington, who first sought to minister for his Virginia regiment in 1756. Washington placed the success and survival of his Continental Army on the power of faith and prayer. 
   His most famous acclamation was his prayer at Valley Forge. He said, ``Bless O Lord the whole race of mankind, and let the world be filled with the knowledge of Thee and Thy son Jesus. Of all dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. 
   ``To the distinguished character of a Patriot, it should be our highest glory to add the more distinguished character of a Christian.'' 
   Today, military chaplains are found in every part of the military from army medical centers, veterans' clinics, official ceremonies, as well as combat zones. Now more than ever our soldiers, veterans, and their families need spiritual leadership and guidance; yet in some places, chaplains and their religious convictions are coming under fire. In several instances across the country, military chaplains have been marginalized for their reference to God and the Bible in religious ceremony. 
   Tonight, as we honor the religious foundation of America and commend the role of military chaplains, I hope that we can continue in the steps of our Founding Fathers by upholding the importance of faith, prayer, and religion.

<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I want to thank Chairman Edwards and the ranking member, my friend, Mr. Wicker, for allowing me the time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I bring an amendment to the floor today because I feel the Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, implementation process needs more funding than is being provided. 
   Mr. Chairman, the fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution did not adequately meet the needs of BRAC implementation. Though we came back and put a $3.1 billion allocation for BRAC in the supplemental and we funded the President's fiscal year 2008 request in the bill, I do not believe we are doing all we should do in terms of funding this priority. 
   I realize the President's budget and supplemental request were based on the best estimates at the time, but there is no doubt that these figures were low. The Department of Defense currently estimates it will take $30.8 billion from 2006 to 2011 to complete the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure round. 
   As the chairman and the ranking member pointed out in this bill, the current BRAC estimate is $8 billion higher than that given by DOD only a year ago. I share the concern of the committee that even with this large increase, the projected funding estimate does not fully take into account construction and inflation costs and is lower than what will be actually required. 
   My home district, Fort Bragg, the epicenter of the universe, is facing these miscalculations today. As part of the BRAC 2005 plan for Fort Bragg, it was named the Joint Mobilization Center; however, no funding to house servicemembers going through the process of mobilization was involved. 
   The garrison is currently housing these mainly National Guard and Reserve members in the 82nd Airborne barracks, while the 82nd is deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. When the 82nd returns, Fort Bragg will be forced to house those going through the Joint Mobilization Center in World War II-era barracks which are completely inadequate. 
   As part of the BRAC 2005 recommendations, Pope Air Force Base will be realigned to become part of Fort Bragg. This means that Bragg will take over the airfield at Pope, but there is no money currently programmed for the new control tower or the fire and rescue station that will be necessary to support carrying out this realignment. Fort Bragg and Pope are but one example of this trend. No doubt these kinds of BRAC-related, unplanned expenses for military construction needs are prevalent at installations across the country. 
   The BRAC process was designed to increase the efficiency and increase the effectiveness of combat capability of our forces. Underfunding, even slightly, will affect our Nation's combat capability first. In the midst of this global war on terror, we need to be very careful not to underfund our combat capability, either indirectly or inadvertently. 
   Although I greatly respect and appreciate the chairman and ranking member's funding of the Base Realignment and Closure program, I strongly believe that this crucial national security area needs more focus. We need to search for ways to implement it. 
   To this end, my amendment reprograms $30 million from NATO Security Investment to the Department of Defense. As you know, the NSIP is designed to be our contribution to construction of support facilities at NATO bases. While this is important, NATO is forward deployed, and it does not always provide us with a swift return on our investments in terms of combat capability. 
   In the past, NATO fought primarily from fixed bases in forward areas, but now it will operate from deployed locations. Infrastructure provided in NSIP, while important in previous NATO strategy, is somewhat less now. Conversely, BRAC and global rebasing moves direct American forces from Europe to home stations here in the U.S. Security requirements in Europe are decreasing while security requirements in the U.S., as well as readiness requirements at home stations, are going up as new units are reformed here at home. 
   The money could be better spent in the BRAC program with a focus on improving our quick reaction and Special Operations Forces. It will increase our Nation's combat power, fighting the continued war against terrorists, and it will improve the combat power of NATO. 
   I urge you to vote in favor of my amendment and join me in support of Base Realignment and Closure implementation. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3920, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007. Textile workers in my district in North Carolina have been disproportionately affected by trade and have suffered a number of closings. 
   I appreciate what Mr. McCrery is doing. I wish also that these two bills could have been better combined to take care of the advantages of both. 
   As many of you know, I have introduced the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act, H.R. 1729, which seeks to expand the current TAA program to give greater resources to displaced workers. 
   Earlier in the year, I asked Chairman Rangel to include the provisions in my bill in the comprehensive TAA reauthorization bill. I was pleased to see that many of these provisions made it into the legislation. 
   Specifically, this bill expands TAA eligibility to include dislocated workers affected by a shift in production in which workers' jobs are moved to nations that have no preferential trade agreement with the U.S., including, particularly, China and others. 
   It provides a strong increase in the health coverage tax credit. H.R. 3920 increases that credit from 65 to 85 percent. It increases TAA funding authorization from $220 million to $440 million. 
   I was disappointed to see that H.R. 3920 did not include a key provision to provide automatic eligibility for dislocated textile and apparel workers. However, I was pleased to see that it does include a provision that allows for industry-wide certifications. This bill requires the Secretary of Labor to conduct industry-wide certifications when three petitions from firms in the same industry, such as the textile industry, are certified within a 6-month period. This doesn't provide automatic eligibility for dislocated textile workers, but it is a step in the right direction. 
   Since I have been in Congress, I have pledged that our office would do all it could to assist displaced workers from the Eighth District in the State of North Carolina. I am pleased that many provisions of the reform act were included in the bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3920, the Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of 2007. 
   The Trade Adjustment Assistance program is a good program. I have worked hard to expand this program and make it better in the past, but we must make additional changes to help our manufacturing workers in this increasingly competitive global marketplace. While it is good that these workers are going to get extended unemployment benefits and insured health care, we all know that an unemployment check is no substitute for a paycheck. But when workers are displaced, we want to give them the skills to successfully re-enter the workforce. 
   As many of you know, I have introduced the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act, H.R. 1729, which seeks to expand the current TAA program to give greater resources to displaced workers. Early in the year, I asked Chairman Rangel to include the provisions in my bill into the comprehensive TAA reauthorization bill. I was pleased to see that many of these provisions made it into this legislation. 
   Specifically, this bill: 
   Expands TAA eligibility to include dislocated workers affected by a shift in productions in which the workers' jobs are moved to nations that have no preferential trade agreement with the U.S., including China and others. 
   Provides a strong increase in the Health Coverage Tax Credit, HCTC. H.R. 3920 increases the tax credit from 65 percent to 85 percent. 
   Increases TAA funding authorization from $220 million to $440 million. 
   I was disappointed to see that H.R. 3920 did not include a key provision to provide automatic eligibility for dislocated textile and apparel workers; however, I was pleased to see that it does include a provision that allows for industry-wide certifications. This bill requires the Secretary of Labor to conduct industry wide certifications when three petitions from firms in the same industry, 
   such as the textile industry, are certified within a 6-month period. This doesn't provide automatic eligibility for dislocated textile workers, but it is a step in the right direction. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed working with my good friend and colleague Congressman Mike McIntyre on this bill and North Carolina's Rural Center. The Rural Center is a non-profit that seeks to promote economic development throughout North Carolina's rural areas, and the Center has been a tremendous advocate for helping dislocated workers throughout the state. This bill resembles many of the recommendations that were published in the Rural Center's report, ``Gaining a Foothold--An Action Agenda to Aid North Carolina's Dislocated Workers.'' 
   Since I have been in Congress, I have pledged that our office would do all it could to assist displaced workers from the 8th District and the State of North Carolina. I am extremely pleased that many of the provisions of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act were included in this bill to make it possible for these workers to receive expanded assistance and job training to help them to make a successful change in their career. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues as we debate and develop legislation that seeks to help our Nation's workforce adapt for new careers and opportunities.

<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (CONDITIONS AT WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. Congressman Carter, thank you very much for holding this Special Order tonight. I think it is critically important that people be fully informed as to the quality of medical care that is being administered to our troops. 
   You are a true champion for Fort Hood down in Texas. The epicenter of the universe for me is Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, North Carolina. You and I both spend a tremendous amount of time on this. Nothing is more important to you and I and our staffs and other Members of Congress than the health of every active duty, former, or soon-to-be-retired veteran. Anybody that is connected to the military, there is nothing that we will not do to make sure that their care is the absolute ultimate. 
   You and I both have seen, as has Congressman Poe and others, there have been some revelations at Walter Reed Army Hospital. There have also been two instances at the VA hospital in Salisbury, in my district, where the care was not what you and I would have liked. Medicine is an art as well as a science. You and I and the rest of Congress are committed to making sure that those situations don't ever happen. 
   But I think far more important, particularly in this debate, is the American public see here and realize fully that when you and I travel to Landstuhl, Germany, or Fort Bragg or the Hefner Medical Center or the Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas, the care that these men and women receive from incredibly dedicated, well-trained and committed individuals have saved so many lives on the battlefield.     
   These are the pilots who have flown the medical evacuations in helicopters and C-17 and other aircraft, racing the medical clock back to the U.S., Walter Reed, where incredible medical miracles have been performed, not just because of the advancement of science, but the dedication of the men and women who administer the care. 
   As we talk about this, it is appropriate and necessary that we look under every nook and cranny. And if any Building 18 situation arises, whether it is Walter Reed, Fort Hood, Fort Bragg, whatever the case may be, we want to know about it. We have many Members and staff members who follow this closely. We will move as quickly as we possibly can. We try to stay in front of these situations. 
   General Kiley has resigned. I called for his resignation. You hate to do those kinds of things, but the appropriate people need to take action. Action has been taken. People are aware at different levels that maybe weren't as aware as they should have been before. But at the end of the process, and thank you for bringing this to everyone's attention in a concise and I think important manner, the men and women as we speak around the clock and around the world are doing everything they can, not only to treat our wounded on the battlefield, but to provide preventive care for their wives, children and their parents. Everything that can be done, obviously, is not done every day; but it is not because the desire is not there. 
   When I look at Womack Army Medical Hospital at Fort Bragg, they receive tremendous care. I was recently down there with Adam Smith who is now chairman of the TUTC, which stands for Terrorism, Unconventional Threats and Contingencies, to us Special Forces, and he and I toured the medical training facilities where combat medics are trained to respond to battlefield situations. Let me tell you, these men and women have done incredible things. 
   As we move forward, and well we must, you and I and everyone here are going to do everything possible to make sure that care exceeds everyone's expectation. Nothing is more important to this country. They are responsible for the past; they are responsible for the future. Thank God for the men and women in uniform. We will do everything we can to support them. Again, I thank you very much for having this Special Order tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. If the gentleman will yield, you just returned from Iraq, literally landed moments ago. You visited Landstuhl. You were downtown in Fallujah and Ramadi. You were in Landstuhl this time, and you have been there before. I just realized that our Speaker tonight, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps), is a wonderful medical professional in another life. So it points out again and again that care and desire to do the right thing medically, absolutely knows no boundaries here. 
   I remember being in Landstuhl on another trip with Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, and she was particularly intrigued by the facilities for premature babies there. So our wounded soldiers are critically important, their families, their children. 
   You spoke of Dr. Snyder, a Democrat from Arkansas, a doctor from Arkansas. Again, my purpose is to reassure people at home, no, we are not perfect, and yes, it was a serious, serious issue at Walter Reed and there are others, but we are willing, able and anxious and ready to deal with those issues. 
   Could you relate some of things you saw in your most recent visit to Landstuhl, which was this morning?

   Mr. HAYES. I was telling former Chairman HUNTER, Ranking Member Hunter now, that when he and RANDY NEUGEBAUER return, we have our Congressional Prayer Caucus that meets every Monday or Tuesday night, just at the beginning of votes, and three young men who were just wounded and brought back from Iraq, we were able to pray for them and will contact their families tonight. 
   Prayer still goes on here in the Halls of Congress, as you well know. We will meet on Wednesday morning. There are a number of organizations, Semper Fi Fund, Fallen Heroes Fund, but there are numerous others where men, women and children are working around the clock again to assist with these wounded veterans. They are doing a fabulous job. As part of this discussion, I wanted to call attention to them. 
   Last but not least, I met a young man at Landstuhl a couple of years ago, Sergeant Danny Metzdorf, 82nd Airborne, all the way, and walked into that room, and you have had the same experience, he looked just like my son. That was what really caught my attention. He had just been wounded there, and I struck up a conversation with him and he hardly remembered that night. But when he got back to Walter Reed, went to visit him a couple of times, got to know his family, had a prosthetic leg, 25, 30 surgeries, just,  really, all he thought about, I want to get back with my buddies, back with my unit. 
   Well, that outstanding young soldier, Airborne guy, is now the coordinator and jump master for the Golden Knights. So with that new artificial leg, and these stories are, so, so, many, I want people again to be encouraged, not satisfied, but encouraged that medical treatment is not only available but it is something that is so critically important to us. 
   I was here one day and some contentious issue was going on in the people's House, and I got an emergency, I thought, call. Dan Metzdorf is calling you. Oh my gosh, something has gone wrong, surgery, he had a complication. I immediately left the floor and called him. He said, gosh, there was so much going on, are you doing okay? That is the way our young people are today. They are for America. God bless them all.

   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Duncan for the time and wish to add my strong support to H.R. 1773, along with Mr. DeFazio, Mr. Oberstar, Mrs. Boyda, and want to thank the chairmen and ranking members of Transportation and Infrastructure for their leadership on this issue. 
   I was proud to cosponsor Congressman Hunter's legislation, H.R. 1756, and am happy to support the revised H.R. 1773, the bill before us, which incorporates many of the strongest provisions from the Hunter bill. Safety of Americans and American highways must always take precedence over some obscure treaty obligation. As far as I am concerned, the safety of Americans and enforcing American law is far and away the number one priority here. 
   It's commonsense legislation that would prevent Mexican motor carriers from operating in the United States beyond the commercial zones of the United States-Mexico border until the Secretary of Transportation unequivocally certifies several minimum standards: requiring English language proficiency and ensuring U.S. law enforcement personnel have the ability to access databases, verify driving records, identification, criminal history and risk to homeland security the same way the information is used to verify U.S. operators. We do not need 90,000-pound unguided missiles on our highways. 
   Every day, the trucking industry ships more cargo in our Nation than any other mode of transportation. The American professionals behind these rigs and their equipment are subject to constant stringent safety standards. This bill ensures that at the very minimum Mexican truckers are subject to the same standards as our own operators. The safety of our citizens on our roadways must be our top priority, and I urge all Members to support H.R. 1773.

   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I want to pay tribute to Vicki Ann Summers, 59, of Pinehurst, North Carolina, who died on Monday, July 23, 2007, at her home. She was born February 19, 1948, in Stanly County to the late Rudy Lamar Summers and Margaret Ewing Lisk Summers. Vicki was a talented newspaper reporter with a long history in journalism who was most recently employed by The News-Journal in Hoke County. Throughout her career, she spent most of her time covering local government, but she also wrote human interest stories, covered the crime beat and was a photographer. She was recognized for her writings by the North Carolina Press Association. 
   Vicki grew up in Fayetteville and attended Pine Forest High School before graduating from the North Carolina School of the Arts, which she attended on a full scholarship. She later attended Miami-Dade Junior College in Florida and East Carolina University. 
   In early 1970, she was a director of public relations for Sheraton Hotels Corporation and the Fountain Bleu Resort in Miami Beach. Around the same time, she worked as a celebrity correspondent for the National Enquirer, as a lifestyle writer for the Miami News, and as a trends writer and garden editor for the Sun Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale. Before coming to the News-Journal, she worked for the Harnett County News in Lillington and the Erwin Times in Erwin, North Carolina. 
   Vicki was very diligent and really cared about her local community. She took great pride in reporting about the economic development of the county and downtown Raeford streets' redevelopment. 
   A memorial service was held on Monday, July 30, at 7 p.m. at Northwood Temple in Fayetteville. She is survived by her mother, Margaret Ewing Pope, of Fayetteville, three sisters, Carla S. Merritt and Jan Hernandez, both of Fayetteville, and Lydia Aldridge of Raleigh, and one brother, Eric Summers of Linden.

Reverend Barringer has spoken out against what he feels are overly aggressive practices and guidelines, in fact. He resigned rather than implement what he felt were discriminatory policies.

   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for yielding me this time. 
   I rise today to salute our Nation's special operations forces as a cosponsor honoring the 20th anniversary of United States Special Operations Command. 
   As we continue to fight the global war on terror, special operations forces are making incredible contributions and playing a most essential role in winning this war. They truly are the tip of the spear. 
   As co-chair of the Special Operations Caucus, I am very proud my district is home to Fort Bragg, which is home to Army Special Operations Command and Joint Special Operations Command and the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare School. 
   But Fort Bragg is only part of the amazing force that comprises Special Operations. Members of the Navy, Air Force and the new Marine Corps Special Operations Commands also play critical roles in addressing the threats we face as a Nation. 
   These quiet professionals are promoting freedom through their service around the world. During my visits with special operators here, at home and overseas, I have consistently been struck by their unwavering dedication, commitment and capability. 
   The role of these special operations forces is only going to grow, and as they grow, it is vitally important that we keep the soft truths closely in mind: Humans are more important than hardware; quality is better than quantity; SOF forces cannot be mass produced; SOF cannot be easily created after emergencies occur. 
   The service and sacrifice of the 53,000 members of the special operations community and that of their families are a major part of what creates and maintains the freedom we all enjoy. 
   I am honored to be able to work on behalf of our special operators. I salute these quiet professionals in the United States Special Operations Command on its 20-year contribution to our national security. I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry.

   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, there are many heroes fighting the global war against terrorists, and many from the Eighth District of North Carolina. But today I rise to pay tribute to one hero  in particular. Today I am proud to recognize Air Force Staff Sergeant Richard Rose, son of Robyn Rose of Laurinburg, North Carolina. 
   Staff Sergeant Rose, a member of the 1st Combat Camera Squadron at Charleston Air Force Base, served as a Joint Combat Camera photographer with the Multinational Division in Baghdad from May 18 to September 18 of 2006. 
   During this time, Sergeant Rose was attached to several Army units, documenting their daily missions and contributing over 1,000 images of Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Sergeant Rose primarily shoots with his camera lens, but that changed last summer. During a mission with the 101st Airborne Division Air Assault Unit, insurgents began firing at an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team which was clearing roadside bombs nearby. 
   Richard quickly responded by returning fire with his M4 rifle, which allowed the Explosive Ordnance Team to move to safety. His efforts are credited with helping to save the lives of 56 servicemembers during the attack, and his bravery in this firefight earned him the Bronze Star. 
   I ask that you join me in congratulating Sergeant Richard Rose on being awarded the Bronze Star in defending our Nation in the war against terrorists. Pray for their safety, and pray for victory against these terrorists.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I thank the gentleman from California, my friend, Ranking Member Duncan Hunter. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to vigorously oppose and to speak against the resolution at hand; a resolution that is being watched by friend and foe alike; a resolution that I feel will serve to embolden those who promote and use violence in Iraq, and across the world for that matter; a resolution that sends a message to our troops at home and deployed that we are not supporting the mission that we are conducting. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't know of a single Member in this Chamber who is satisfied with the existing situation in Iraq. In fact, with the escalating violence and an increase in terrorist activity, we shouldn't be satisfied with the situation in Afghanistan either. But Iraq has become intensely political, and that is unfortunate. Make no mistake about it, this is the beginning of defunding our military and our national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, in this age when the Internet and global newscast are an integral part of warfare and propaganda, it is naive to think that the resolution is not being watched and its outcome won't be used to further embolden the resolve of those who use indiscriminate violence to advance their radical agenda. 
   When you recruit homicide bombers, they need to feel that their ultimate sacrifice is meaningful, and I fear this resolution will be used as an additional recruiting tool to show that our resolve is wavering in the face of their acts. 
   In some instances, Members have made no secret of their desire to defund the military. Mr. Speaker, it wasn't that long ago that our Nation faced another global war for freedom, it was a different type of war, but a war that was won because we held firm. There were a lot of people who said we couldn't win; they said that pragmatism dictated we would compromise our values and our beliefs. President Ronald Reagan told our Nation that we needed to hold firm because ultimately our values and beliefs would prevail in cold war then, and ``hot war'' now. 
   President Reagan said, ``The ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas, a trial of spiritual resolve, the values we hold, the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated.'' This quote was in context of the cold war, but it is applicable today in our present hot war against terrorists. This resolution shows a lack of will to win. This resolution hurts our troops and it helps our enemies. 
   Mr. Speaker, similar to debates from years ago during the cold war, I have heard speakers on the other side say, all we need is a strategy based on diplomacy. Mr. Speaker, I am all for peace and for diplomacy and for cooperation and for working things out, but al Qaeda is not, suicide bombers are not, terrorist executioners are not. That is reality, and our foreign policy has to be based on reality. 
   Terrorists thrive on poverty, despair, violence and fear. And the bottom line is they cannot afford for freedom and justice to succeed. Conversely, we cannot afford to allow freedom and justice to fail. That is reality, and one-sided diplomacy is not a strategy. Where is the other side's strategy for victory? There is none in this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have concerns with the situation in Iraq. No one wants to see the Iraqis stabilize the security of their nation more than I do. The reality is we have troops over there in harm's way. Troops from the 82nd Airborne, stationed at Fort Bragg in my district, are part of this surge deployment. 
   Mr. Speaker, they are watching. I have received their e-mails letting me know in no uncertain terms that they are paying attention to what we are doing today. One soldier wrote to me using this quote from the ancient Athenians, which he thought was appropriate to this debate. This soldier said, ``I will not disgrace the soldier's arms nor abandon the comrade who stands at my side, but whether alone or with many, I will fight to defend things sacred and profane. I will hand down my country not lessened, but larger and better than I have received it.'' 
   As my colleague from South Carolina quoted a soldier in his district yesterday, he said, ``This is my war.'' That is a soldier's attitude and should be our attitude. It is our war against brutal, ruthless terrorists. 
   I will not support a resolution that tells our soldiers that the United  States Congress is not supporting what they are doing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that everyone pray for our troops, for their safety and for their victory. May God continue to bless America and the magnificent men and women in uniform who protect her.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio, the Ohio delegation, and the gentlelady Ms. Kaptur for allowing me to be a part of this. 
   Stephanie was a special friend. I am terribly saddened by the untimely passing of Stephanie Tubbs Jones. She was someone who cared deeply about helping others, especially those who couldn't help themselves. Tubbs Jones was a wonderful philanthropist and friend. I will miss serving with her as cochair on the House Philanthropy Caucus. 
   Representative Tubbs Jones and I began our work in the House the same year together in 1998. I was honored last year to have the opportunity to partner with her to establish the Congressional Philanthropy Caucus, an initiative that she was very passionate about. Her tireless and tenacious advocacy for the philanthropic field and commitment to, and leadership was  very inspiring and helped to forge new relationships and partnerships between and among law-makers and grant-makers. 
   The Caucus was formed at the behest of the Council on Foundations, a Washington, D.C., area-based nonprofit association of more than 2,100 grant-making foundations and corporations. The Caucus aims to educate and inform law-makers about the field of philanthropy. 
   As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Stephanie stressed the importance of reestablishing charitable incentives that have expired, emphasizing the impact such tools have on giving in the United States and around the world. She was a strong believer that charitable incentives help grow charitable giving to populations in need across the country. Demonstrating her commitment to her charitable values, Representative Tubbs Jones was an original cosponsor of the Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2007, H.R. 1419, which proposed to expand the IRA charitable rollover. That Act is especially significant to the philanthropic field because it proposes to allow distributions to donor-advised funds, supporting organizations, and private foundations to qualify as charitable giving tools. 
   In addition, when given the opportunity on the House floor, Representative Tubbs Jones continually advocated for philanthropy, encouraged our colleagues to join the Philanthropy Caucus, and sponsor legislation promoting charitable giving. She met with her foundation constituents just a few weeks ago to discuss their work and contributions to her home State. 
   Representative Tubbs Jones was a champion for the philanthropic sector and will be greatly missed for her contributions to the charitable giving field. 
   On behalf of the members of the Congressional Philanthropy Caucus, and the many grant-makers that Stephanie supported around the country, specifically Ohio foundations, we wish to offer our sincere condolences and to extend her family, son Mervyn, colleagues, and staff, our deepest sympathies for their loss.

As a result of these tragic murders came the Blue Ribbon Campaign. Many miles of free blue ribbon were distributed throughout the greater Charlotte area. Jeff Katz, a former police officer who hosts the afternoon drive show on WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina, urged listeners to display the blue ribbons on cars and homes as well as on their persons to visibly support law enforcement. On his radio show, Katz asked listeners to donate to a special memorial fund for the families of the slain officers. In a matter of hours, Katz had pledges of $50,000. Those making pledges were directed to make their donations directly to the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 9. 
   I want to commend these officers and their families for their sacrifice and thank their brothers and sisters in law enforcement for their commitment to keep the city safe. I also want to thank Jeff Katz and countless citizens for their tremendous efforts in the Blue Ribbon Campaign responding to this tragedy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this farm bill and especially to thank Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte and really especially the incredible members of the House Republican and Democrat staff for their tremendous work on this very difficult legislation. 
   However, I must oppose a provision that should not be in this conference report. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Nation needs an agriculture policy for the 21st century. Anyone who is paying attention to their grocery bill lately can see that things are changing around the world and in this country. It's showing up in the price of food. If you're keeping up with the news, the changes we are seeing in higher prices are being played out as full-blown food shortages in other parts of the world. Sound agriculture policy is not just about our economy; it's a key component in our national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need this legislation, and I support the passage of the agriculture provisions. But there is a provision that was added late in the process that has nothing to do with agriculture, nothing to do with farmers or our food supply. It's a provision that will liberalize our current trade practices with Haiti. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the impact of this Haiti provision will be. Two of the leading textile groups say the impact will be minimal while the positive benefits of the farm bill will be  much greater. While I would reject this policy change under any procedure, this Haiti provision was added without hearings, without any debate. Mr. Speaker, out of principle I don't think this is the time or the place to add this trade provision with Haiti. And, therefore, to make that point, I am going to cast a ``no'' vote on the farm bill conference report today. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. My vote today is to protest this Haiti provision, but my goal is to ensure passage of the farm bill. I know there's a veto threat from the White House. If the President decides to follow through, I will be there voting to override him because we need this update for our Nation's policy.  
   Mr. Speaker, after a very lengthy conference process, I am pleased to report significant victories in the ag portion of this bill. As the Ranking Member of Livestock, Dairy and Poultry, I worked with my colleagues to eliminate or water down many of the Livestock Competition issues that were included in the Senate passed Farm bill. Most importantly, we were able to defeat the inclusion of the ban on packer ownership. This ban would have been detrimental to North Carolina and the livestock industry across the nation. 
   The economic adjustment assistance program for textile mills is another significant provision included in this bill. This important provision will provide critical assistance to textile manufactures for the modernization of equipment and operations. This is a priority for our leading domestic textile organizations including the National Council of Textile Organizations, the Cotton Council and the American Manufacturing and Trade Action Coalition. 
   The White House or anyone else watching, should not read my ``no'' vote today as opposition to passage of the agriculture provisions in the Farm Bill. Our Nation needs updated agriculture policy. As a member of the Agriculture Committee and conferee to this bill, I had a hand in shaping these changes. We ultimately need to get this done, and I will be there to make sure it does.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize a pillar in the medical community, as well as a friend, Dr. Bertram W. Coffer, who recently passed away. 
   Coffer's medical career began in 1975 when he joined Raleigh Anesthesia Associates. He was 34 years old and married to the former Jeanne Gardner, a registered nurse he had met in a Duke University Medical Center operating room while working as a scrub nurse to pay his way through NC State University. 
   He later served in the U.S. Navy as a Lieutenant Commander, had 2 years of surgery residency at Duke, and completed his residency in anesthesiology at UNC-Chapel Hill. Coffer went on to become not only a certified anesthesiologist, but someone who brought added value to the care of all patients. 
   Bert instituted many positive changes in the way his practice operated in the community hospital. Today, the American Society of Critical Care Anesthesiologists touts the Raleigh Practice Center/Critical Health Systems model, whose essence reflects one of Bert Coffer's philosophies, which was, ``Act like a physician first, and always make yourself indispensable and worthwhile.'' Certainly, the redefinition of anesthesiology by Coffer and RPC/Critical Health Systems helped change the future of the specialty.           
   What a dear friend and wonderful human being. Our thoughts, prayers and sympathy go out to Jeanne, his wife, children Bert, Natalie and Holly, and all their families. We will miss you, Bert.            
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize a pillar in the medical community as well as a friend, Dr. Bertram W. Coffer, 66, who passed away on Thursday, April 10, 2008, at Rex Hospital. He was a native of Sanford, and predeceased by his parents, Dalton and Virginia Coffer, and a sister, Carol Thompson. 
   Bert was a dedicated and caring physician for 43 years serving at Rex Hospital for the last 33 years. He was a graduate of NCSU in 1964, UNC Medical School in 1969. He completed a surgical residency at Duke from 1969 until 1971 as well as an anesthesia residency at UNC in 1975. He began practicing in 1975 when he joined Dr. Lewis Gaskins and Raleigh Anesthesia Associates, which he eventually incorporated and developed into Critical Health Systems. One of his guiding philosophies was ``Act like a physician first and always make yourself indispensable and worthwhile''. He had a vision for the advancement of anesthesiology into new areas such as intensive care, critical care, pain management, and total patient care. He served as CEO from 1975-1996. He was a member of numerous boards, including the Rex Hospital Executive Committee and the Ravenscroft Board of Directors. He was also president of the Royster Medical Society in 1983 and the president of the Wake County Medical Society in 1986. In addition, he was an active member of the American Society of Anesthesiologists for over  30 years, serving on many committees and receiving the North Carolina Society of Anesthesiology's Distinguished Service Award. In 1974 he worked with Project Hope at the University of West Indies in Jamaica. During the Vietnam war era he was commissioned as a Lt. Commander and stationed at Jacksonville Naval Air Station in Florida as an anesthesiologist. As an NCSU alumni he was still active and established the Caldwell-Coffer scholarship. 
   His strong commitment to his country led him to a very active role in politics and public policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and pay tribute to the Concord High School girls basketball team for winning the North Carolina State Championship this year. Lady Spiders ended a 31 win and 2 loss season by defeating Beddingfield 77-62 on March 15, the first girls championship in the school history and the fourth State championship for the school in the last 5 years. 
   Concord's Nyshia Hammond was named Most Valuable Player, and T.T. Belcher won the Most Outstanding Player Award for the Spiders. Concord's coach and school Athletic Director, Angela Morton, was also named the 2008 Associated Press women's basketball Coach of the Year for North Carolina. Morton has coached the team for five seasons, during which she led them from a 0-24 season, to a State championship title. 
   The athletic program at Concord High is one of the great traditions that dates back even further than my years. The nickname, Spiders, came from the athletic field at the old high school, named after Principal and School Superintendent A.S. Webb. Concord's first title was won in 1929. 
   I am extremely proud of the hard work and dedication of these young women from my hometown. Congratulations, Coach of the Year, Angela Morton; Assistant Coaches, JarMark Parker and Samantha Bedford, and the Lady Spiders on your successful season and State championship victory.

<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (GENERAL PETER PACE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the colonel for yielding. I appreciate Congressman Kline for his diligence in bringing this important matter to the floor. You and I have been friends for years. I have been here a little longer, but I say without reservation that probably the main motivation that you and I serve, aside from our specific constituents in our own districts, is our love for the military and our desire to do anything and everything we can to support them at all levels of service. 
   I represent Fort Bragg, Pope Air Force Base, Joint Special Operations Command, U.S. Army Special Operations Command at the epicenter of the universe in Fayetteville, North Carolina. And as I have spent time with these young men and women in all parts of the world, I am continuously astounded, amazed, and incredibly appreciative for what they do every day and every night of the year to keep us free. I say that simply as a little bit of a background to pick up on what Colonel Wilson and Dr. Gingrey have said in tribute to General Peter Pace. 
   For 40 years, Pete Pace has absolutely signified, has identified, has personified, the greatest qualities of the American citizen-soldier-marine that anybody could absolutely personify. He served in virtually every theater for 40 years. He has exemplified Semper Fi. He has been faithful beyond belief to our country. He would still be serving, were it not for political correctness and cheap-shot politics, that has unfortunately become a part of what we do. 
   I think General Pace said it better than anyone. When given the opportunity to resign, he said, ``Why would I  leave my men on the battlefield? If you tell me my job is done, then my job is done.'' 
   General Pace, your job has never been done. It will never be over, because the memory of your service will be extremely strong in all of our minds. 
   Colonel, I would like to add a few more remarks. I feel it is highly inappropriate that the Senate majority leader would make disparaging remarks about General Pace and General Petraeus, the commander of our troops in Iraq and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   Mr. Speaker, General Petraeus and General Pace have had a tough job, and now they should not be fodder for political gain with a group of left-wing liberal activists, or anyone else for that matter. Gentlemen, scholars and warriors, they have devoted their lives to serving our Nation, and have done it well. 
   What is most puzzling is that the Senate majority leader put his endorsement behind General Petraeus and trusted him to carry out our objectives in Iraq when he was confirmed on January 26 of this year. Obviously he felt General Petraeus was more than competent when he voted to confirm him. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't think anyone is content with the existing situation in Iraq, neither General Petraeus nor General Pace. General Petraeus, the commanding general, has cautioned it is too early to judge the success of Baghdad's security and stability. He informs us that the new security effort is just beginning to reach the full number on the ground, because they still have an additional brigade just coming into Iraq, General Petraeus is now in his third tour of duty in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, the majority leader and others have visited troops serving as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. I have been there. I think it is good that lawmakers see the situation firsthand. But there is real arrogance in saying that someone with a commander's-level experience and General Pace's experience is out of touch with the situation in Iraq. 
   As I said, I have visited Iraq many times and recognize General Petraeus as a military commander and as the expert he is on this issue. As he makes determinations regarding the security situation in Iraq, I will ask tough questions. If you are going to declare that he is out of touch or incompetent, then you have already made up your mind. You have already determined the outcome is going to be labeled a failure. 
   Mr. Speaker, what message are we sending our troops when the leadership of the other body has already declared that their effort in this new security strategy is a failure before they have really begun? 
   The 82nd Airborne from Fort Bragg in my home district is currently deployed to Iraq as part of the troop surge. These servicemembers and others are there at the tip of the spear. It is time for everyone to put partisan politics aside and stand together in solid support of our men and women in uniform. 
   General Pace has had an incredible, distinguished career, serving in every capacity, and he deserves much better. His record merits thanks and a second term as chairman. Instead, he becomes another victim of the campaign of personal destruction. 
   General Pace, thank you for Semper Fi. You have always been faithful. 
   Nobody wants their troops to return home sooner or more safely than I do. They should not stay in Iraq one day longer than necessary. While we have soldiers on the ground fighting the war on terror for us over there, we should have no patience for cheap-shot political gamesmanship on this critical national security issue here at home. 
   Colonel Kline, again, thank you. General Pace, thank you, and Lynn, and your family. We are ever grateful for your service.

<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1684, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I thank my friend, Congressman Diaz-Balart, for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule. 
   We've all heard the saying that actions speak louder than words; and, once again, the rhetoric from the other side has turned out to be just that, rhetoric. You've heard all the talk about wanting to do everything we can to protect American jobs and keeping our manufacturing base. The majority actually had a chance to put their money where their mouth is by strengthening our national security and our domestic textile manufacturing base. 
   My amendment was not allowed to come to the floor for debate today. Yes, actions speak louder than words, and the actions from yesterday prove that their talk is cheap because it's not backed up by meaningful action. 
   Current language in the Department of Homeland Security authorization bill regarding domestic production would require a new domestic requirement for uniforms, protective gear, badges and identification cards. While this provision is a good first step, this approach does not reflect a stronger proposal contained in the bill that I put together with the textile industry which is called the Berry Amendment Extension Act. 
   The legislation we put together and the amendment I offered yesterday would ensure that the sensitive uniforms worn by our agents are made in America with American-made components rather than outsourcing to China or Mexico. The problem with the bill in front of us today: The vast majority of the content of these uniforms can be imported from any country in the world, China, Pakistan, Mexico, you name it. 
   Mr. Speaker, that's not what the Members of this House want. On December 15, 2005, we overwhelmingly supported a measure stating that Border Patrol uniforms should be made in the United States. Has anyone changed their mind? I sure haven't. 
   These provisions are an extension of the Berry Amendment, which is a well-established domestic Department of Defense purchasing requirement that has been in practice for 70 years. And the amendment would ensure that we are complying with WTO. Make no mistake about it, I don't put legislation together trying to appease the WTO, but if your legislation is blatantly not compliant, which the existing DH bill appears to be, the end result will be lawsuits and countervailing duties. Put that all together, nothing gets done; and American jobs are lost. 
   You all know I've been a strong advocate for strengthening the Berry Amendment. The Berry Amendment seeks to guarantee the United States has a ready mobilization base of U.S. manufacturers, a critical national security requirement. While the Berry Amendment is 70 years old, Department of Homeland Security is only 5, and this new Department is now home to many functions that are critical to our national security. 
   I am extremely disappointed that my Democrat counterparts failed and missed a great opportunity to expand the successful requirement to include the Department of Homeland Security. It not only protects American jobs but provides the assurance that Department of Homeland Security officials who work on the front lines of national security are the only people wearing these sensitive uniforms. It is outrageous to think that our Border Patrol or airport security uniforms can be made in factories in China or Mexico where any worker could use these uniforms to impersonate U.S. agents. 
   Mr. Speaker, my amendment has strong support from the National Council of Textile Organizations, American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition and the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Again, while the base bill has taken a step to add a new requirement for domestic production, I think we could have done and should have done much better. 
   Let me briefly quote the American Apparel and Footwear Association: The  Hayes amendment ``would provide more complete coverage for domestic sources than what is currently intended by H.R. 1684. By requiring that both inputs and manufacture of uniforms originate in the U.S., the Berry Amendment works to support the U.S. supply chain that provides materials for the production of clothing and individual equipment to the military.'' 
   There are many Members, both Democrats and Republicans, who have been very supportive of the Berry Amendment in the past. In fact, I was particularly surprised when a member of the Rules Committee, who has been a co-sponsor of the bill, voted against allowing the amendment to come to the floor today. 
   Folks, the U.S. textile and apparel industry is vital to the economic security and national security of our Nation. If the majority truly cared about preserving this crucial manufacturing sector, an industry that provides good-paying jobs to American citizens, then they would have supported this amendment in the Rules Committee and allowed it to come to the floor for a vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to vote ``no'' on the previous question so we can allow this amendment to come to the floor for a vote. In my opinion, a vote for this rule as it stands is a vote against the U.S. textile industry, its workforce, and a vote against making our country more secure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I thank Congressman Keller for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Doggett amendment. I believe this amendment will simplify the application process for students and families seeking financial aid. 
   I feel that the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, is overly complicated and a real burden on students and parents who need the most financial assistance. I believe we must take the burden off families and put more of it on the IRS and the Department of Education. 
   Current language in the bill encourages the Secretaries of Education and the Treasury to work together. By adopting this amendment, we are requiring the Federal agencies to work together to use existing IRS data to get positive outcomes. 
   With the implementation of data matching, we can eliminate the cumbersome and confusing FAFSA questions, increase the accuracy of the data used in calculating aid eligibility, and ensure that Federal financial aid dollars are going to the right people for the right reasons. 
   The issue was brought to my attention by University of North Carolina President Erskine Bowles. I worked closely with him on this issue and hope to see the changes that we discuss, which are included in this amendment, be included in the final bill. 
   I thank Mr. Bowles and the UNC system for their commitment to making the FAFSA easier for students and families. Again, if we are going to evaluate this issue, let's do it right. Let's put more of the burden on the government to make the financial aid application process easier for students and families who are applying for assistance. 
   I appreciate Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon for their dedication in improving our education  and hope that my colleagues will support the Doggett amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. HAYES. (WASHINGTON-ROCHAMBEAU REVOLUTIONARY ROUTE NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL DESIGNATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HAYES. I thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding. 
   As we stand here today, I think this is a good bill. We all support it. But as a segue into what the real issue for the American people and people here in this Capitol building is today, how can you afford the gas to drive or fly to go see the area that we are talking about today? 
   Our friend just talked about what happened. Well, Congressman Shimkus reminded us that during the 7 1/2 years of the present administration, gas prices went up but not anywhere nearly as dramatically as they have in the 18 months since our friends across the aisle, the Democrat majority, has controlled. But let me make a very strong and separate point. 
   Many friends on the Democrat side, including the chairman and others, the person sponsoring the bill, these folks want to do what we, the minority, want to do. And that is, all of the above. There have been some neat things done by this House during my almost 10 years here. 
   CAFE standards. I voted for that. Better mileage. That is important. The American people have heard us, and they are working hard to conserve. Price gouging. That is a piece of the puzzle. I voted for that. Speculation. We have had hearings yesterday, today, tomorrow. That is an interesting subject. I support that to the extent it affects the issue before us today. But an attorney from a local university made the point today that speculation adds liquidity to the market. Excessive speculation causes problems. He hasn't told us where excessive begins. 
   But it is important that we look into every single issue that impacts our constituents at home, and that is the price of gas. My friend from West Virginia absolutely knows as well as anybody the importance of utilizing our coal resources. Thank goodness for West Virginia, among others, and their production of domestic energy resources. 
   As you look at our future and our economy, which includes, among other things, food prices, and you see what the incredibly outrageously high price of gas has done to us, you have to come to the conclusion and let those good people in both parties and on both sides of the aisle have a simple, straightforward vote on whether we are going to become more active in domestic energy resources. 
   Domestic energy. We have a small group of people, and they apparently have an unusual hold on the Democrat leadership. That group says no to nukes, no to coal, no to tar sands, no to expansion of refineries. We cannot afford and common sense does not allow for us to maintain that position. 
   I think it is extremely helpful that we are having a lengthy debate. And, again, a lot of good points have been made, but I will refresh everyone's institutional memory to the fact that this House, Republicans and Democrats, in previous terms before we had a switch in majority passed all of the legislation that we are talking about bringing up again today, including exploration drilling in ANWR and off the Outer Continental Shelf. However, our friends in the other body saw fit not to send that to the President's desk. 
   Well, the distinguished majority leader mentioned today how we should use our reserves. I could support that if it comes to the floor. But I am also on a letter, as many of you others are, telling the President to release the moratorium. We cannot afford, Democrats, Republicans, or anyone else, to leave our constituents hanging out to dry with unbelievably high gas prices. 
   So I support the minority leader's call for meaningful energy legislation, including votes on nuclear, votes on drilling which the American public has very clearly said, and at the same time I will reemphasize what the majority and minority, regardless of who is in that position, has said over and over again: Environmentally sound? Absolutely. Safely? Without question. 
   And again thanking you for the time, I wrap up by saying we, this body, regardless of party, has been guilty in the past of using lowered gas prices to conveniently forget how important independence and our future energy needs are. 
   So that is why I have a piece of legislation, and I would welcome any and every one to join me on, that says every additional dollar of revenue created by new leases will go to a trust fund that can only be used for alternative sources of energy. Wind, waves, solar, everything needs to be on the table, ethanol, methanol, biodiesel. 
   Gentlemen, I support your bill. But, again, let's get ourselves together and make sure that we get to vote on what the American people and the majority of this Congress want, and that is lower energy prices.
