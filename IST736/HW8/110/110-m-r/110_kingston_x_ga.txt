   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman for recognizing me. 
   Reserving the right to object and I do possibly plan to object, because we are on the eve of passing the largest supplemental appropriations bill in the history of the United States House of Representatives. The history of supplemental bills actually goes back to the Second Congress, so it is not unusual to have a supplemental appropriation bill. It is just that over the years we have gotten, in recent years, out of the habit of offsetting these pieces of legislation. 
   Now traditionally they have been used for a war or for a sudden disaster or for a health care crisis or something like that. But now we are on the verge of passing a large supplemental appropriation bill for things that aren't emergencies. This bill is not confined to emergencies.     
   I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that I strongly believe that one reason that we are in----

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule, because there are so many amendments that could have improved this bill and saved the taxpayers money, but they were ignored by the Rules Committee, not allowed on the floor of the House, which isn't totally unlike the situation we are in with the supplemental appropriation bill. 
   Here we are about to pass a $200 billion--that's billion with a B--the largest supplemental appropriation bill in the history of Congress, and supplemental appropriation bills aren't anything new. They go back to the second Congress that ever existed because, so often, when you have a war, there are unanticipated costs associated with it, as there are with disasters and other things that might occur during the course of the year. So supplemental appropriation bills are normal. But what isn't normal is the size of this bill.     
   And what isn't normal is the Democrat Party who even has on Speaker Pelosi's Web page, as I speak, a promise to the American people that every bill would be vetted properly and passed through proper order. 
   And we all know from our eighth grade social studies class that proper order is that a bill is introduced; ding. It is sent to subcommittee; ding. The subcommittee has hearings, it has a markup in which amendments are allowed and where endorsements and where statements are made. Then it goes to full committee; ding. And full committee again repeats the process, possibly with hearings, certainly with debate, always with amendments, always with the minority and the majority party putting aside partisan differences on a committee level before the final product goes to the floor. And then again, ding, the bill goes to the floor where again people are allowed to amend a bill. People are allowed to make speeches on it. 
   But instead, what we have from what can only be called a ruthless, iron-fisted majority, an air-dropped bill. Yes, Mr. Speaker, an air-dropped bill, a bill that has bypassed, leapfrogged over the regular subcommittee and committee process.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Again, Mr. Speaker, this bill is thrust upon Members of the House who will not have read it. In fact, I will take a poll right now. 
   Is there anybody who has read, there are a lot of Members of Congress on this floor, have any of you read this $200 billion supplemental appropriations bill of which we will be voting on tomorrow? Not one hand goes up. I rest my point. This bill has not been vetted. 
   It should go through regular order which means subcommittee, full committee and then on the floor. Members should have the opportunity to read a $200 billion bill and they should have the opportunity to amend it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I certainly thank the third base coach for yielding the time. 
   I do think that there is a healthy thing that's going on here, and that is the Democrats are beginning to hear from their constituents that we've got to do something about foreign oil, and we've got to use our American resources. I think that's good. 
   I think this bill will probably pass. I don't actually know why we're debating it. It's pretty much a restatement of current law. I heard one Democrat say it's a ``drill now'' bill. You know, that's what they are doing right now. They're exploring these leases. These leases are very expensive. They don't buy them to sit on them and for the U.S. Congress to think. This is really ridiculous that they're sitting on land where there are great reserves of oil, but for some reason, they're not drilling there. 
   Come on, guys. This is a capitalist system. These companies are money hungry. They run after profit. If there were oil in these places, certainly they  would be working on it. If you want to give them a nudge, I'm all for it. 
   I plan to support the bill. I think it ought to be voice voted out on suspension. It's no big deal. It's a rhetoric bill. It's not a realistic bill. 
   What we do know is that 65 percent of our land resources are tied up and off-limits. We do know that, for example, the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve is the size of South Carolina in a State twice as big as Texas. And in this massive amount of land the size of South Carolina, there is a tundra area of about 2,000 acres which we believe would increase our domestic American oil supply 10 percent. It was vetoed by Democrat liberal President Bill Clinton 10 years ago. If it hadn't been vetoed by the Democrat liberal, special-interest President, we would have that oil today. It's too bad. 
   And then we hear so often from the Democrats, well, you know, if you open up ANWR and all of these places, it will be 10 years before we get the oil. Well, where are these electric cars? Where are these battery-operated cars? I mean, all of this alternative energy, which I certainly support and have been funding from the appropriations side, working very diligently on, that's going to be 10 and 15 years down the road as well. 
   We've got to do three things on our energy crisis: we have to have conservation, we have to have innovation, and we have to have exploration. It's that simple. But you have got to explore where their actually is oil. I concur with the gentleman from Texas. This is good because the Democrats are admitting that we have to open up more lands. 
   So we're going to pass this bill. Nothing is going to happen to the price at the pump. It's not going to be affected by this because it's basically current law, but I'm glad that you guys are slowly, reluctantly entering into the debate of drilling because we believe that in an environmentally safe fashion, you can drill in Alaska, and you can drill offshore.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I just want to say 108 oil platforms were damaged in the Gulf of Mexico during Katrina, and there was no pollution. All of the problems in the gulf, pollution wasn't one of them because now we have environmentally safe ways to extract oil from the bottom of the ocean or from land. 
   I want to say this. You know, we tied up the offshore in the day of the 8-track tape player. That was when you had an 8-track tape player in your GTO and you were the cool, edgy, high-tech guy. Today in the world of iPods and BlackBerrys and cell phones and everything else, technology has moved past the good old 8-track tape player. And the same thing has happened in medicine, the same thing has entered in entertainment, the same thing has happened in oil drilling. We have new technology, modern technology that will extract oil in an environmentally safe fashion. 
   I want to close with this. What is so sacred about protecting the American global environment but not the foreign global environment? The Democrats are fine if you are drilling offshore in your country or drilling on the land in your country, but not in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, I am glad to be here, and I am glad that the Democrats are interested in fiscal discipline. That is a good thing. It is a good bipartisan debate. But there are three flaws in the Democrat PAYGO approach that I think are very important. 
   Number one, this tax issue that just won't go away. You know, based on scoring and based on reality and based on fact, when Kennedy cut taxes, when Reagan cut taxes and when Bush cut taxes, revenues went up. 
   Now we all know that scoring in this town counts a tax cut as a spending increase. How silly in the face of economic reality over the past 40 years. 
   Maybe the Democrat Party could look at scoring and change that. I think that is something we were unable to do as the majority. It would be a good idea for you to pursue it. But you and I both know that revenues went up in 2005 14 percent, in 2006 11 percent, and it was because of the economic growth brought about by the 2003 Bush tax cuts. PAYGO ignores that. How silly. How disingenuous. 
   Number two, I want to talk about entitlement reform. The big money, while I think we do need earmark reform and have supported it, but the big money, as we know, are in entitlements: 53 percent of the budget. 
   The Democrats were getting a lot of good credit for what I would say is kind of a golden oldies agenda, bringing out no original ideas, minimum wage, stem cell and student loans. And I understand those are safe things. But it is kind of like starting out the World Series by bunting instead of trying to get on base with real serious hits.  
   The reason why I submit that criticism is there is nothing in your agenda about immigration reform, Social Security reform, Medicare reform, the heavy-lifting ideas of entitlement, and PAYGO completely ignores those as well. 
   Number three, the real world, where is the Senate on PAYGO? My friend from Florida may know, but isn't it possible that unless they are going to do PAYGO, it is a silly exercise. It is boilerplate. It looks good, but the truth is if the Senate is not on board, which they are not, we are wasting time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise to oppose this bill. 
   As much as anything, I want to say the children's health care bill, you would think would get a little more dignity in the process around here. This is a 299-page bill which we received, ``we,'' minority Republicans, received at 6 p.m. last night, or maybe even later than that. That doesn't give you a lot of time to work on a bill and have any kind of bipartisan deliberations. 
   Plus, there is no motion to recommit. Now I know that is inside-the-Beltway stuff, but this is important if you are talking children's health care. 
   What I do know is that in the bill, adults are still allowed to be covered by it. Adults can push poor children out of the way because States are going to politically favor them and let them have the opportunity to be insured. 
   I know there is a massive tax increase. I know there is very little sympathy for smokers these days, but it is still a tax increase on the backs of the smokers. And in order to get enough money to pay for this, it would require 22 million new smokers in the United States of America. 
   Now, maybe the Democrat Party is planning to pass out cigarettes at the schools and say to the kids: Hey, look, start smoking so you can finance your own insurance company. And you'll probably be needing it, by the way, wink-wink. But in the meantime, the government gets to grow. The bureaucracy gets to grow. The nanny-state, more like the Nurse Ratchet states, continues to grow at the expense of children. I urge a ``no'' vote on this.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (DRILLING IN ANWR -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, Democrats like foreign energy. I don't know why they like foreign energy because if we are dependent on foreign energy, since we import 60 percent of it now, it is a national security risk. 
   You have to ask what area of land have the Democrats agreed to explore. You have to ask that question. When 62 percent of our domestic onshore energy supplies are locked up because of Democrat regulation, and 85 percent of our offshore energy supplies are locked up because of Democrat regulation, you have to ask yourself what can we do. 
   You know, if you started drilling in ANWR, and remember, President Clinton vetoed that 10 years ago. That would have reduced your gas prices now probably 10 to 15 cents; nobody actually knows. But what would ANWR be. Put it this way, if ANWR was a basketball court, because it is the size of South Carolina, but just to give a word picture, if it were the size of a basketball court, the drilling area would be a business card. Fanatical extremists have locked that up. 
   If you announced right now that we are going to start drilling in ANWR, you could get oil out of there within 3 years, according to Don Young, but the announcement alone would send a message to the foreign markets that America wants to wean itself from foreign gasoline. And, therefore, the price of energy would go down because that is how business works. When there is a little competition, your price comes down. 
   ANWR is the size of a business card on a basketball court.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill that we're debating today. In fact, it's a bill that has been kind of in the hopper, if you will, for months, and maybe even a year's time right now. This is a bill that the troops very badly need. And that's why it's odd to me that there are so many unrelated amendments to it. 
   I understand that when the Democrats took over, their promise to the MoveOn.org fringe of their party was that we are going to get the troops out of Iraq. They have not delivered on that. And so what we have here is a little fig leaf debate on getting out of Iraq so that their Get Out of Iraq Caucus can have a political cover story so that when they go home over the Memorial Day recess, they can tell people, yeah, I voted to get out Iraq. But the truth is, there is no delivery here. 
   That debate alone should be something that we do all day long. It should be at least a week's worth of our time, if not more, the debate on getting out of Iraq and imperiling troops in the way. But no, the Democrat Party will not give that to their group that wants the Get Out of Iraq Caucus. What they want is a little fig leaf amendment to a bill, which they know is going to pass and they're hoping that this is going to cover their politics. That is a sham, and that is a shame. I respect somebody who wants to get out of Iraq now, but they should have a debate on that on a freestanding bill. It should not be an amendment. 
   Secondly, I want to point out the stuff which Mr. Culberson referred to as pork. Mr. Obey took exception to that. And I'd say this stuff isn't pork, but it isn't an emergency. It isn't stuff you put on the backs of our troops in the field. 
   I don't know how much money we spent in New Orleans, I would like to know. I think we, as Republicans, spent too much. I think you guys, as Democrats, are spending too much. I understand there is $5.8 billion for levees in New Orleans. Now, Mr. Speaker, as I recall, that did not happen recently.

   Mr. KINGSTON. There is money in here for the census. And I learned in eighth grade geography we do a census every 10 years. Why should that be put on an emergency bill? We know that the end of the decade comes. That funding should be done on an appropriate freestanding manner. 
   The Bureau of Prisons? Why are we passing that on the backs of soldiers? Contractor language. And I'm a former member of military construction and I represent four military installations. MILCON is very important to me. But why is it put on the back of a supplemental emergency bill? That is not what we do here. It should go through the regular appropriations process. It should go through a subcommittee. It should through a full committee before it comes to the House floor. It should not be an amendment that is put on a troop's bill. 
   I think that if we look back in history at the way that we were sticking it to, if you will, the minority party when we were in the majority, I think you guys have a very good case for that. In fact, I respect Mr. Obey. I have a page full of quotes from him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Well, it is important because there is a little history here, Madam Speaker, but during the period of time in which much of the Longworth office was shut down and evacuated right in the wake of 9/11, I don't know how many Members, and perhaps Mr. Dreier knows, but we all had temporary offices in a building downtown, and I do not remember which building that was. But it was interesting. That was a direct threat to the United States Congress, and some of the offices were closed down for maybe a couple of months.     
   I moved my entire staff off premises. And so to say now that we have to construct expensive, unnecessary swing space just to fill in a gap is ridiculous. 
   I want to point out that I think it's important for newer Members to realize there is a history, there is a precedent. And because of the Rules Committee shutting down this amendment and free speech, most Members won't know that we are trying to prevent something that we've already gone through before, and that is temporarily locating elsewhere in a secure premises. 
   I wanted to commend Ms. Wasserman Schultz, the Chair, and the ranking member, Mr. Wamp, for what they have done on the CVC, the Capitol Visitors Center. It is a monstrosity; something we're all very disappointed in. When I was Chair of this committee, we tried our best to get our arms around it. One of the things that we all discussed is unfortunately it's kind of a bicameral problem. You don't have one head of the snake, one committee, one Chair who was fully responsible from alpha to omega. 
   I commend the committee on what they've done on this. I do think that with this FDA building we are creating another CVC boondoggle, as already outlined and debated in the committee. Since 2002, we've been debating this unnecessary additional office space, this swing space. And at the same time, the committee of the same government agencies are involved in it that have given us the CVC. So not to allow that amendment on the floor is something, in my opinion, is worth voting ``no'' on the whole rule debate. 
   The other amendment that I offered, among the many amendments that were turned down by the Democrats, it's very important to say the people who talked about sunshine so much are now denying it on the bill that tells this institution and the public so much about ourselves. No one gets elected or unelected on leg branch politics, except it does show what your culture of leadership is. If you don't allow sunshine, if you don't allow an open rule, if you don't allow open debate on your own piece of legislation that governs the House, then how can you go around and pontificate from coast to coast what an open government you're going to bring the United States people? 
   I know that the members of the Rules Committee and the members of the Appropriations Committee have somewhat been under a mandate, maybe even a gag order, by the leadership, but I would say there is huge hypocrisy and irony in this. 
   Another important amendment that I offered has to do with the Basic Pilot Program. And I'll ask you this: Do you think that people who do construction for the Federal Government should have legal employees, or should they be allowed to have illegal aliens? Well, we know and the Chair would be interested to know about the situation in California, because it's been such a hot debate out there, and the folks who have been building the fence, that the folks who are constructing the fence were busted for having illegal aliens to build a fence to keep illegal aliens out of the country. That is absurd. Similarly, we see this all over the place on Air Forces bases and Federal institutions, where contractors come in, and after close scrutiny we find they are hiring illegal aliens. 
   What the amendment would have done, which I believe would have wide bipartisan support, simply says that you need Social Security verification if you're going to do business with the Federal Government. No big deal, except for in this town and in this Chamber somehow that might offend some of our K Street friends, or should I say some other people's K Street friends. Because folks I know back home, they want Social Security verification. Unless you attack the job magnet, you're always going to have the attraction for illegals to come into the country. 
   This would give us an opportunity to lead by example to say we're not going to let you do business with the Federal Government unless you have verified Social Security. And the program is run by ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. It's called the Basic Pilot Program. Nothing controversial whatsoever. However, the Rules Committee is not even going to allow us to have a vote on it. 
   I cannot believe that the people one year ago, indeed, 7 months ago, were campaigning out there, telling Americans the Democrats are going to deliver open and honest government, because this rule is anything but that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Thank you, Mr. Wamp. And I thank the Chair and congratulate both of you on your work for this bill. 
   I want to say, however, I do not support it. I am very disappointed that after the bill left the Appropriations Committee and went to the Rules Committee, a funny thing happened. All this transparency and all this promise of open government and open rules seemed to fade away in a dark corner room up on the third floor of this building, because there were 23 amendments offered, and yet only three of them were accepted. 
   We talk about bipartisanship and we talk about sunshine in the process, and yet this is the very bill that basically funds and perhaps even governs our own body, our own congressional branch, and yet it has the closed rule. And 20 amendments won't get the sunshine, will not get the debate because of the Rules Committee under Democrat leadership. I would say you need to go back to your campaign brochures and look at all the promises that you made before you pass another rule like this. 
   One of the casualties of this closed process was an amendment that I offered that deals with contractors who deal with the Federal Government, who work for the Federal Government. I'll give you some examples. December 2005, 22 Mexican nationals were found illegally working in Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. January 27, 2001, illegal aliens were found working at Fort Benning, Georgia. March 2007, the Golden State Fence Company was actually fined because, in building a border security fence, they had hired 10 illegal aliens. 
   It doesn't stop there. In Louisiana, December 2005, a local company was busted working on a Veterans Administration hospital because they had illegal aliens. This is absurd. Now, I've heard from many people the theme of ``leading by example.'' Perhaps one thing we could do and absolutely should do is require that if you are contracting for the Federal Government, that you have a Social Security verification process going in your business, more than the sham, more than the, Yeah, but we have an I-9 kind of approach that we're seeing. And this would actually say you need to be in the ICE, which is the Customs and Immigration Enforcement Service, you need to be in the ICE Basic Pilot Program, which is a way to know that your employees have correct and legal Social Security numbers. That's all the amendment would have done. 
   I would predict that this amendment would get lots of bipartisan support because we see that the biggest issue facing America, besides Iraq and perhaps energy, is the issue of illegal immigration. And here was an opportunity for us to make a definitive statement, to have a significant amendment added to the bill, and the Democrats said no. 
   I hope they'll reconsider on future legislation.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, I offer this amendment to bring something to the Members' attention that I think is very important. 
   We are about to create a fourth building for the House of Representatives. We have Cannon, we have Rayburn, we have Longworth. We are about to put on another 200,000-square-foot building. I think you should know about it, and I think we deserve a vote on it. 
   Number one, this is an earmark. Now, we have been talking weeks and weeks and months and months about transparency and ending earmarks. Yet if you will look in the report on page 20, there is a $16 million earmark for a new House office building. There is no explanation of the project, no total cost, there have been no hearings and no oversight, and it is not in the Democrat budget. It was not requested by the Architect of the Capitol, and, yet, it's in the bill. 
   Now, looks like a duck, walks like a duck, could be an earmark. That's where we are on this. 
   Number two, I think Members have the right to vote on a fourth office building. As former chair of this committee, one of the big frustrations I have about the Capitol Visitors Center is none of us owned the project. There wasn't one person that you could say it's his or her fault. It was all diluted and by committee. We never had a vote on it. 
   Indeed, when I was a chairman of this committee, a staffer put in $18 million to renovate the House floor, which none of us knew about. I took the money out of it, as did Chairman Lewis last year. 
   But things get stuck in the bills that we don't know about that we deserve a vote on. This gives you an opportunity, unlike the CVC, which started out as a $260 million project, with partial private funding, and now is up to $600 million. 
   This motion to recommit gives you the opportunity to vote on something and say no to something that has already cost this House $140 million. This is a 200,000-square-foot building. That's the size of 15 House floors. It's the size of four White Houses. It's five football fields big. This isn't incidental swing space. 
   What is this needed for? In case we renovate the Cannon House Office Building. Now, don't you want to vote on that? I haven't had a debate on renovating the Cannon Office Building, but I want to know about it. This is a big building of substance, and you deserve a vote. 
   Incidentally, this isn't going to be the only new building. We are adding 580,000 square feet in the form of the Capitol Visitors Center.  
   This building is huge. To move forward, it's going to cost us not the $16 million that's in the bill, but actually $56 million, and then another $12 million to lease it, plus $18 million for furniture for it. 
   Think about it. How many times have we heard from some Members in a rather preachy fashion, we need to control our carbon footprints? Ladies and gentlemen, all of those of you who want to reduce our carbon footprint, here is your opportunity. Say ``no'' to a 200,000-square-foot boondoggle which we are about to put in. 
   This has not had the proper oversight, it has not had the proper hearings. The contracts have all been verbal. That's why we are all in the situation. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

He did volunteer work for Safari-International and worked with many of you, got to know Ron Marlene very well and Jo Ann Emerson, among others, and he is ready to go on any codel to Montana or Wyoming that he gets invited to. 
   Paul is going to be a great Member of the House. He is a hard worker. I think you will like him on both sides of the aisle because he will work for what is best for the United States of America. 
   Mr. Lewis has already gone over his resume, so I won't repeat it. But I will just say, Paul, welcome to the greatest body the world has ever seen, the United States House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Broun of Georgia. Madam Speaker and colleagues, I am glad to call you colleagues. I am eager to work with you. I am eager to represent the people of the 10th Congressional District of Georgia. It is exciting to me. Just 1 week ago, I was campaigning. Things have been going very quickly ever since then. I am just overwhelmed. 
   I look forward to working with you and working with this great, august body. I appreciate the opportunity. I appreciate the well wishes and all of the host of welcomes that I have gotten from each and every one of you. 
   So I appreciate the welcome that you all have given me. I look forward to working with you. Thank you so much. God bless you.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (CHARLIE NORWOOD DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman from Arkansas. I thank the gentleman from California for your support of this legislation and your kind words about Charlie Norwood. 
   This bill, Charlie would really approve of it because it has three things that Charlie loved dearly. He loved veterans; he loved Augusta, Georgia; and he loved medicine and doctors giving medicine and taking care of patients. Probably the only things he loved more were his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ; his wife, Gloria, and their family; and, indeed, the United States of America. 
   Charlie was a happy warrior. We all know Charlie. And whether you agreed with him or disagreed with him, he always smiled, and he always expected you to push back. He never would resent your opposition to any philosophical point whatsoever, and that was a double-edged sword. He was a Republican's Republican at times; but I can say this, if it meant doing something he believed in, he would oppose the Republican Party. 
   We all remember the Norwood-Dingell bill which Charlie championed that was part of the patients' bill of rights, and that was a bill which was largely not supported by the Republican Party. And yet Charlie just charged away and said we're going to do this because it's the right thing. And he earned the respect of both sides of the aisle by handling this. 
   I remember him relating a story to me when the President of the United States called him and said, Charlie, what can I do to get you to back off this bill a little bit and give us some flexibility? And I believe he said, Mr. President, not a thing. But if you know Charlie and you know the President, that conversation probably has been cleaned up a little bit. But the whole time you could see both of them kidding back and forth because that was the nature of Charlie Norwood. 
   I remember one time I used to represent Emanuel County, and because of reapportionment, Charlie became the Representative. I said, Charlie, now, you're from Augusta. These folks are rural. I need to go up and introduce you. They're not going to take to you easily. We were going to meet about 7:30 in the morning in a local restaurant, a little diner, the epitome of what you always see on TV. And I got there just a few minutes late, and I thought, oh, man, Charlie has been surrounded by these farmers for a while now and I've embarrassed him by coming late and they're looking at this Augusta city slicker whom they've never met before. 
   I walked in and it was like interrupting somebody else's family reunion. Charlie was sitting at a table surrounded by farmers, surrounded by rural folks, while Charlie spun one yarn after another about what was wrong in Washington, DC. They loved him, and I hardly even got a place at the table, sort of nodded my head and said, Charlie, you take it from here and said to my former constituents, ``You guys are in very, very good hands.'' 
   I remember one commercial that Charlie had, and I had been elected the term before Charlie. So I had a little bit to say here and there and Charlie had actually never been in elected office. Many of us had served in the Georgia General Assembly together, and Charlie ran an ad that said, I'm going to do what I can for you. I'm going to try to do my best, but I'll tell you this, if you're from the 10th District of Georgia, I don't care who you are, I'm going to do anything I can to help you.     
   I said in my sage way, Charlie, now, look, if somebody has broken the law, you don't want to make that statement out there that you are going to help anybody for anything. He said, No, I will, and that's the way I feel. 
   People understood that about Charlie Norwood, that he was a fighter for them, he was a fighter for the cause, and he literally did mean it. If I can help you, I am going to do what I can for you. 
   I see we are about out of time on my half of the program here, but I want to state some facts for the RECORD about Charlie. Mr. Boozman has outlined a lot of the specifics of his military career, but it is substantial. He was a fighter over and over again for the veterans. Again, he would be with the Republican Party or with the Democrat Party if it was in the best interests of the veterans. That's why it's so good to have such strong bipartisan support for this legislation today. 
   We want to say, Charlie, we love you. Gloria, and all the family, we certainly love you as well and support you. It's going to be a proud day when we get this building renamed.  
   As a soldier, Charlie earned both the Combat Medical badge and two Bronze stars while he served in Vietnam. He helped develop the Dental Corps standard operating procedures of delivering dentists to forward-fire bases. He dutifully served and provided dental, emergency medical and surgical care for both U.S. personnel as well as Vietnamese civilians and prisoners-of-war. As a Congressman, he co-authored and helped pass into law the Keep our Promises to America's Military Retirees Act and was also a key Member in passing the Retired Pay Restoration Act. Year after year, he defeated attempts to reduce Federal support for the Augusta VA Center and helped maintain and increase funding for the center. He received the Cocklin Award from the Association of the U.S. Army in 1998. 
   Over the past few months, we have received letters from several veterans organizations in support of this legislation. Here is a sample of what some of them had to say: 
   ``We support this bill as Congressman Norwood spent his life supporting the overall well being of veterans''--Georgia Department of Veterans 
   ``He was a member of the Augusta MOAA chapter and he would attend meetings unannounced to make sure he stayed in touch with Georgia veterans. He was always quick to protect TRICARE benefits, and he co-sponsored legislation to fix the military Survivor Benefit plan inequities, and improving military pay raises''--Georgia Military Officers Association of America 
   ``Designating the Augusta VA after Charlie Norwood is the most appropriate act for a great Congressman and a grateful community''--The American Legion, Department of Georgia (Note: He was a life member of the Georgia chapter) 
   ``Renaming the Department of VA in memory of Congressman Norwood would be very fitting and greatly appreciated''--Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department of Georgia 
   ``Speaking with the veterans in Augusta, you can tell that most of them do not want to forget the great things that he has done for all  veterans. As a native of Augusta, Congressman Norwood would always be remembered by renaming the VAMC located there.''--AmVets, Department of Georgia 
   Former Congressman Charles Taylor: ``I know the many Veterans who received care through Charlie's many efforts would like to say thank you. He often reminded us, `we are in fact defending our nation's future' by showing young people the `level of importance we place on military service'''. 
   Former Congressman Bob Beauprez: ``Charlie epitomized the phrase `servant leader'. He went about his work daily without thought of himself, building a legacy, or attracting notoriety. Headlines he did not seek, and even in his battle with the disease that finally took him from us, sympathy was never his objective. He could make a decision and he could argue passionately for a cause, but he also was one of the most caring, forgiving, decent, humble Christian men I ever met.'' 
   President Bush: ``Charlie was a good friend and a strong, spirited legislator who always stuck to his principles, remembering that his duty was to represent the best interests of the citizens of his district.'' 
   From the New York Times obituaries: ``A feisty conservative who railed against government bureaucracy, Mr. Norwood was part of the Republican wave that took control of Congress in 1994. Mr. Norwood prided himself on serving his northeast Georgia district, promoting his success in cutting through federal regulations a decade ago to allow a constituent to bring home a stuffed polar bear the man had killed on a hunting trip in Canada.''

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for the opportunity to offer this for consideration. And I do realized that the chairman has reserved a point of order. I hope he doesn't insist upon it, but if he does, I certainly understand, as we share, I think, the same goal of cracking down on illegal aliens. 
   What this amendment does, Mr. Chairman, is say that if you sell or contract or do business with the Federal Government, then you need to be part of the Social Security verification project known as the Basic Pilot. And the Basic Pilot program is a tool for employers to verify the Social Security numbers of employees. 
   We all know that the Federal Government is one of the worst offenders of hiring contractors and subcontractors who in turn hire illegal aliens and do a lot of government work. We also know that since the inception of ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, Julie Myers, the head of it, has stated that there have been hundreds and hundreds of arrests at military installations, power plants, chemical plants, sensitive facilities, and truly this would include a lot of the agencies and a lot of the contractors in work that is done in the Department of Interior for work on our national parks and other land areas. 
   There was one very high-profile case where a defense contractor had hired illegal aliens to work in a shipyard in Mississippi, another one at an Air Force base in North Carolina, and another one at a Marine base in Virginia. Those are more defense oriented, but this would certainly apply to all Federal agencies. 
   The success of this program, though, is that 92 percent of the prospective employees have their Social Security number verified within seconds of the work authorization. So this isn't requiring that employers have some cumbersome, unworkable paperwork requirement. In fact, 50 percent of the employers who use this program surveyed have said that it is an excellent, good, to very good program. And 98 percent say that they are likely to continue to use this program. It is a very good tool, I think to crack down on Social Security verification. And as we know, right now the U.S. Senate is debating an enormously unpopular bill which seeks comprehensive immigration reform. 
   This is a step. The American people have sent a clear signal that they want immigration reform but they would like it in the form of steps rather than comprehensive. 
   So with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I just want to say as a member of the Appropriations Committee now going on 14 years, I remember several years ago when Congressman David Skaggs of Boulder, Colorado, offered an amendment in the committee which reinstituted the War Powers Act, because at that time we were concerned that President Clinton was getting us involved in a war in Bosnia; so we put it on that bill. And I believe last session we put on the continuation of government on an appropriation bill, and I am a firm believer that we do routinely authorize on appropriation bills. We just need to agree with the authorization. 
   So I want to say to my friend I have seen things accepted and things rejected.

   Mr. KINGSTON. In any case, Mr. Chairman, I understand where the distinguished chairman of this committee is coming from and we will continue to work with him, the Appropriations Committee, and all Members of Congress to try to get Social Security verification done by businesses that contract with the Federal Government. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any other Member seek recognition on the point of order? If not, the Chair is prepared to rule. 
   The amendment would require a determination of whether an entity does or does not participate in a given pilot program under immigration law. This determination is not currently required of the relevant Federal contracting officials. As such, the amendment constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. 
   The point of order is sustained.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, the Democrat Party has just ended its 6 for 600 hours, or whatever they call it. I wish I had a clock at home that tracked hours the way the Democrats did. By that standard, I would be 25 years old, and probably look a lot better, as a matter of fact; more youthful. 
   But I want to say this. The Democrats did this agenda based on kind of, you know, trite, older, more established, safer issues. There was no real reach for the sky here; no entitlement reform, no tax simplification, no energy independence. What they did also was cram down a bunch of things that bypassed the committee process, and I want to give a contrast with the Contract With America. 
   The Contract With America was 24 pieces of legislation. The number of bills we had open to amendment was nine. The number of bills considered under a closed rule was only three. The numbers of bills considered under suspension of the rules was only two. The total number of Democrat amendments, 154, of which only 95 failed. Many, many Democrat amendments passed. 
   I hope, as we go into your next 200 or 300 hours, that we can have a more participatory democracy.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, there is one economic fact that doesn't belong to the Democrats or the Republicans. Facts work that way. And that is, that price in the long run is the cost of production, period. It is true with anything. 
   What we are doing with this bill, should it pass, is we are increasing the cost of production, specifically, domestic production. 
   We live in a world where, in 2004, we spent $103 billion buying oil from nondemocratic countries. Now, some of them might be your best friends. Saudi Arabia, for example. Others might be less than your best friends. Of course, I say that tongue in cheek. But Iran, Iraq, Russia, Venezuela, that is who you are buying your oil from today; and you are going to increase the cost of domestic production. It doesn't quite make sense, except for in the context of the last 2 weeks, the context of the transfer of power from Republican to Democrat. We were promised open government; we were promised open rules; we were promised the opportunity to add amendments and to have fair debates. And yet this bill, as has been the case with the five bills before it, did not even have a committee hearing. It is like giving a book report having not read the book. 
   Sure, it is a power jam, and certainly the majority has the right to jam its power through on the minority. But in this case, wouldn't it have been more helpful to have a committee hearing so we could have gotten rid of what I would call the tuna fish clause? 
   Now, we know what the tuna fish clause is. Right? That is where we heard over and over again on the minimum wage debate that increasing wages was good for everybody, good for the economy, good for the worker, particularly the poor worker. And then we read this insidious, surreptitious scheme to exempt American Samoa and the tuna worker factories. Sorry, Charlie, but only the best tuna workers are entitled to minimum wage, not the folks on American Samoa. 
   Now, that is the tuna fish clause. Now, frankly, I think other States ought to have that option, too. We found out there was a tuna fish clause yesterday in the education bill; and that was that the title of the bill was to decrease the student loan interest rate down to 3.4 percent, but the tuna fish clause in it said that it was only applied for 6 months of the bill. How do you go back home and tell people you cut student loan rates in half when you only did it for 6 months? It is a tuna fish clause. 
   How do you tell the American people that you are going to have open government, and yet your first six bills bypass the committee process? That is the tuna fish clause. 
   Today the tuna fish clause is that our domestic oil production is low in terms of our consumption, and we are going to be increasing the cost of the production, which will be passed on to the American consumers. 
   We do need alternative energy. We need it on a bipartisan basis. I would say to the majority, you missed a great opportunity to work on this.

   If you have an alternative plan, introduce it. Get out of the back seat. November 7th put your hands on the steering wheel with the President. You  can now help drive the direction of policy, national policy in Iraq. This is a silly resolution. I recommend a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding, and Mr. Speaker, I thank you. 
   I want to say this, that if the troops in Baghdad watched what Congress was doing today, they would be outraged. Fortunately for us in the Free World, they do not sit around and watch C-SPAN and what silly politicians do. They live in a real world where there are real bullets. 
   This resolution, on the other hand, is not real. It is a political whip check designed for press releases. It is nonbinding. 
   The Democrat National Chairman, Howard Dean, famously said: ``The idea that we are going to win the war in Iraq is an idea which is just plain wrong.'' 
   Speaker Pelosi called the war ``a grotesque mistake.'' 
   So if the situation in Iraq is so hopeless, and unwinnable, why are we messing around with nonbinding resolutions? If the war is a lost cause and there is no longer an American interest, why do we not just go ahead and get out of there now? It is not worth another life or another dime. 
   Conversely, if the cause is worthwhile, should we not fight to win? Nonbinding resolutions, Mr. Speaker, are great for the Democrat club back home, but for those of us who serve in Congress, we are the law of the land. We are elected to pass laws, fund wars and influence policies. Our opinions, as expressed in nonbinding resolutions about what should happen in Sudan or Israel or Cuba, they are appropriate, but when it comes to American soil, our job is to pass real legislation and make real laws. We do not have to vent our frustration. We can change policy. 
   This week's resolution is just a cover-your-rear-end political design to give the legislative branch a chance to say I told you so. But, Mr. Speaker, as you know, like it or not, a real vote is coming. 
   It is coming in the form of the fiscal year 2008 supplemental bill. In that supplemental resolution, $5.6 billion is designed to pay for 21,500 new troops in Iraq. All Members will have a chance to vote on that supplemental bill; and as you know, an amendment can be offered to delete the $5.6 billion. A ``no'' vote would be against it, and a ``yes'' vote would be to say we are against having the troops there and we are not going to pay for it. That is what is real. 
   I think in November the electorate made an adjustment. They did not like what the Republican House was doing, and I certainly understand that. I think we did fail on many levels to deliver the products which we promised we would deliver to the people. But the Democrats are in the same situation. It was an anti-war fever that swept so many of them into office, but here we are with a nonbinding resolution. 
   Now, I understand that it is frustrating. I serve, as you do, on the Defense Committee; and as you know, many times we do not get all the information that we want. We have heard, as Mr. Boyd said, general after general after admirals after captains telling us we do not need more troops in Iraq, and now they are saying that they do. We have also heard the President say the decisions for military changes in Iraq will be made in Baghdad, not in Washington, DC, and I hope that is the case with this situation. 
   I am very frustrated about it, but one thing we have been told unequivocally by those same generals and admirals and Secretaries of the Navy and Army and Secretary of Defense and today from the ambassadors from Jordan and Egypt is that if America withdraws from Iraq at this time, it is sure to bring chaos and destruction. That will lead to a full-scale sectarian war which could lead to a division. It could be so chaotic that the United States of America would have to return to Iraq in larger force numbers than we have now. It could lead to Iraq becoming a nation state controlled by terrorists or terrorist sympathizers and that would be in control of the third largest oil reserve in the world. 
   Now, we have seen what Mr. Putin and Hugo Chavez down in Venezuela are doing with their petro-dollars and all the anti-American ill will they are spreading around the globe. Would you really want to empower a bunch of terrorists with those kinds of oil revenues? 
   Then the other thing we are told is if you pull out immediately or quickly what happens to U.S. credibility abroad? As we are dealing with China, who very recently shot down a satellite, we are very concerned about that. North Korea, we are at the negotiating table with them right now. And Russia seems to be slipping away from democracy and going back to some of its older ways that we are worried about. As I have just said, Hugo Chavez is spreading bad street money all over South America, which is not a good sign. 
   And then finally, Mr. Speaker, if we pull out, what does it say to the American servicemen who have already lost their lives? Hey, sorry, we did not mean it; your sacrifice was not worth us gutting it out, if you will. 
   You know, it is interesting, the President has been criticized for ``staying the course,'' and he is no longer staying the course. Who is supporting staying the course by a ``yes'' vote to this nonbinding resolution, but the Democrat leadership and the Democrat Party.     
   If you are saying it is a lost cause but we support you, how are you saying, no, we are not going to send recruits? It doesn't make sense. You just can't have it both ways. This is staying the course. The President no longer wants to stay the course. He is saying let's plus-up the numbers, let's divide Baghdad nine different ways. And that is something the RAND Corporation has called for as it has studied the history of nations that have insurgencies. Subdividing the areas is an effective way to fight insurgencies. The President has said let's go into al Anbar province; let's go into Sadr city. Those are changing of the course. 
   Mr. Speaker, a ``yes'' vote is a vote to stay the course; a nonbinding resolution is an insult to those who are in harm's way. If you truly believe that the war is a lost cause, why mess around with a nonbinding resolution? A ``no'' vote to this is a vote for change, and I believe it sends a stronger signal to the troops that we support you and we are sending new recruits to help you finish and complete this job.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, I think that there is a good part to the Democrat takeover of the House and the Senate, and that is that now the Democrats are at the table when we talk about Iraq. And there are many in this town who say failure is not an option. I think failure is an option. I think there would be disastrous consequences to that. The third largest oil-producing nation in the world would belong to terrorists. What would happen to the existing and fledgling Iraqi Government if you suddenly pulled our troops out of there? What kind of genocide would that bring? Those are things that have to be dealt with. 
   But I think that it is good that now we can have a bipartisan approach that the critics of the administration and the policy are now inside the room actually making policy. With that spirit, I think that it is time to tone down the rhetoric and work on a solution that will be best for Iraq, for America, and for the international community. And I say this with sincerity now because I think there is a good opportunity, and we only will have it, I think, for a few short months because the Presidential elections are kicking in, lots of rhetoric is floating around, but I think we can work together and come up with some good policy.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (WAR SUPPLEMENTAL IS BAD POLITICS, BAD POLICY -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight. 
   I wanted to talk on the eve of what may be the most controversial bill that we have voted on since I have been a Member of Congress, and I have been a Member of Congress now for 16 years. In fact, sometimes I don't like to admit that in public because everybody gets so concerned about term limits, I don't want to be the poster child for my enemies on that subject. But I have been in Congress for the NAFTA vote, for the renewal of GATT, the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. I have been here for the impeachment vote. I was here for welfare reform, some very significant pieces of legislation, the Contract With America, and recently with the Democrats' 6 for 06 plan. Yet in all my years of Congress, I can say that this week, perhaps tomorrow, perhaps Friday, we will have what is the most controversial bill that I ever voted on and the largest supplemental appropriation bill in the history of the United States Congress, a bill which the President requested for our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on terrorism in general. His request level was $101 billion, but it is actually going to be about a $124 billion bill, because there are many things that aren't even related to the war that have now got stuck in the bill. 
   There are a lot of different views on this that I wanted to talk about. I have my friend, Mr. Carter from Texas, who is a fellow appropriator on this Special Order. The thing that is interesting, though, is that a lot of the traditional allies of the Democrat Party, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, and sometimes in fact those two newspapers are inseparable from the Democrat talking points, but they are squarely against this bill. The editorial pages have gone out of their way to say what a bad bill this is, to say do we really need a General Pelosi, which is what the Los Angeles Times said. And to quote the Los Angeles Times, ``After weeks of internal strife, House Democrats have brought forth their proposal forcing President Bush to withdraw the troops from Iraq, 2008. This plan is unruly, bad public policy, bad precedent and bad politics. If the legislation passes, Bush says he will veto it, as well he should.'' That is the Los Angeles Times. 
   Here is the Washington Post. The Pelosi plan for Iraq. ``The only constituency House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi ignored in her plan for amending Bush's supplemental war funding bill are the people of the country that the U.S. troops are fighting to stabilize.'' That is real important. 
   ``The Democratic proposal doesn't attempt to answer the question of why August 2008 is the right moment for the Iraqi Government to lose all support from U.S. combat units. It doesn't hint as to what might happen if American forces were to leave at the end of this year, a development that would be triggered by the Iraqi Government's weakness. It doesn't explain how continued U.S. interest in Iraq, which holds the world's second largest oil reserve and a substantial cadre of al Qaeda militants, would be protected after 2008. In fact, it may prohibit U.S. forces from returning once they leave.'' That is the Washington Post. 
   These are not what I would call mainstream moderate newspapers. The Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post are out there drumming the drums for the liberal causes, time and time again, and they are both squarely against this plan. 
   You know, I think one thing Americans have to ask themselves is, is there U.S. interest in Iraq? Rhetorical question. Is there U.S. interest in Iraq? Now, if there isn't, and the war is in fact in the tank as Speaker Pelosi and many of her followers believe, get out tomorrow. Get out. Get out yesterday. Now, this bill doesn't say that. It is more of a slow-bleed, sure-formula-for-defeat plan. But if you really think the war is in the tank, why spend another nickel there? 
   Now I understand, I haven't spoken to him, that my colleague from Georgia, John Lewis, has made that philosophical and principled position. JOHN is a liberal senior Member from Atlanta. And he says, I am against the war. Why should I vote to spend $100 billion more there? I respect that position. But if you are going to spend the money and give the troops some assistance, why are you tying their hands at the same time? Again, if there is a U.S. interest, then is there not a U.S. interest in victory? Is there a U.S. interest in defeat? And so often the critics of  the war always dodge those important questions. 
   And you can go back to 2003 and cite many things that have gone wrong. I am a Republican and I will tell you what, there have been many things that we have misjudged and done wrong, and it is regrettable. And I would also say that even prior to 2003, maybe some things should have gone in a different direction. I will say, as a Member of the House at the time, we were driven by the 17 United Nations resolutions, which the Iraqi Government ignored. We were driven by the best intelligence estimates at the time, which said that there were weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein would use them. That was a view that was shared by Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Ted Kennedy, and all the other leading Democratic critics of this war. But they all had the same conclusion in 2001, 2002 and 2003, leading to our resolution to give the President the use of force to go into Iraq. But I understand politics. Backseat driving and revisionist history just comes with the turf. 
   So we can politically revise history. I understand there is a short-term memory and a convenience factor, and if you are running for the Democratic Presidential nomination, you have got to be dodging and weaving, as JOHN KERRY did last time, voting for it and then against it and having positions all over the court. 
   But we are here now. Whether you are Democrat or Republican, the last election, November 2006, put the Democrats in charge. They are no longer in the back seat of the car. The President may have driven the car to where it is, but the Democrat Party now has its hand on the steering wheel. And you can steer good policy. And this, as the Los Angeles Times says, is bad policy, very bad policy. 
   If you believe there is a U.S. interest and you think, what would happen with the U.S. out of Iraq suddenly? There would be chaos, there would be civil war, and it is quite likely that the second largest oil-producing nation in the world would fall into the hands of anti-American, anti-Western terrorists and become a nation state of terrorists, a haven for more terrorists. 
   I don't know of anybody in the Congress that thinks it is a good idea to ignore terrorism the way we did prior to 9/11, when the two embassies were attacked in Africa, when the USS Cole was attacked in Yemen, and when the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center happened. We are not going to let that happen again. We understand that you just can't ignore terrorism, that you have to be engaged with it. 
   So if you believe there is an interest and there is a huge downside in sudden withdrawal, why would you vote for a bill that says we are going to withdraw but we are going to withdraw slowly? We are going to let our troops stay over there, but we are not going to give them the backup that they need. 
   Now, I have the honor of representing the 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, Fort Hunter, Georgia. I also have a couple other military bases. But Fort Stewart leaves this week on its third deployment there. And I don't see how I could be expected to represent those soldiers and tell them, you know, ma'am, your son is patroling the streets of Baghdad and I had the opportunity to send him 20,000 troops to cover his back and I voted no. Because it is a fundamental question. If you are in Iraq, do you want 20,000 more troops helping you or not? How can you say you support somebody if you are not going to give them additional troops to back them up? 
   Now, I don't believe this is a status quo vote at all, because General Petraeus, who is now our commander over there, has designed this plan as a way to ramp up our forces and clamp down on the violence and the attacks, train the Iraqi troops, and then stabilize the country and come home. I believe that that is an exit and a victory plan, and it is changing the status quo. 
   So why would you put the general in charge, who I think was approved by the Senate by a vote of 80 or 90 to zero, I don't think there was a dissenting vote, and then say to him, good luck, but we are going to micromanage the war because we have 435 Members of Congress who, General Petraeus, are mighty good military folks in own right. Maybe we should in fact move Congress to Baghdad, since all the generals seem to be in this room who have all the answers.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I have found the same way. I have been to Iraq twice, and when I go there to talk to the troops, their biggest enemy is the American media. They will tell you it is so frustrating, and they never would have believed the media was so bad. 
   I want to show you some statistics that I think are important because you have just been there, but this was a poll that, again, good old American media covered up that was actually in Sunday's London Times, a British company, the largest poll in the history of Iraq, over 5,000 people were surveyed. 
   Now, I think so often when we hear polls that CNN reports, they poll their newsroom, 25 people, all whose minds have made up against the war and against George Bush. But this was the largest poll in the history of the country, largest poll during the war, of over 5,000 people. 
   They found this: That al-Maliki's, as a Prime Minister, approval rating is 49 percent. In September, it was 29 percent. That is a significant statistic. 
   The other thing is we keep hearing that we are caught up in a civil war. Well, the flip side is this: It is 70 percent of the people do not believe that they are in a civil war. 
   Now, is it not strange that the Iraqis do not believe they are in a civil war, but if you poll the Democrat Members of Congress, I bet you 90 percent would say they are in a civil war, and yet somehow the folks who live there do not believe they are in it. I find that a strange, just a very big difference, but, you know, who knows? I mean, we are politicians. We know everything. So certainly we know what the Iraqis are up to, and maybe they do not. 
   The other thing that that poll, and it is not on my chart, but the other thing that the poll showed is that 66 percent of the people say they are better off now than they were under Saddam Hussein, conveniently unreported in American news, but I would recommend to you all to check out Sunday's London Times. 
   One other statistic that was not in the poll, but this is just a fact. But the month before we started the surge, and the surge officially started the 14th of February, the month before, there were 1,440 civilian casualties. Since that time there have been 265. You cannot ignore that statistic. 
   Now, I also want to give everybody a homework assignment. This is just for the folks back home. I would love you guys to see what the Democrat leadership says about the bill they are introducing tomorrow. Remember, this is a bill that is their official war plan. 
   Go to www.gop.gov/news/documentsingle, and what do we have? Aspx? This, if we can get this on camera, if anybody would come call me, I would love you to see the Democrat leadership explaining their plan. I am telling you, it is absolutely, it is almost right out of Comedy Central. Are they really saying this? Because everything is, well, what date y'all call getting out? Well, I do not know, let me ask my colleague here. Well, I do not know, let me ask my colleagues. It was kind of like, okay, can anybody tell us the capital of Iraq? This is, yes, it is on a GOP Web site. That is the only thing partisan about it. It is absolutely not touched up one bit. 
   I want to be sure everybody has an opportunity to look this up, but go to www.gop.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx? And ask for the document ID is 60396, and if you cannot find it, just call my office and we will give it to you, but it is scary. It is on one hand hilarious. On the other hand, it is scary that here is a leadership of a party saying here is our plan, and they cannot even explain it on prime-time television. 
   I wanted to say the scary part is these are high-stakes stuff, but please, look this up and watch this news conference. If you still think that this is the right thing to do, well, you are seeing something I am not seeing.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Let me talk to you, for the $23 billion extra that are not related to the war but are on this bill, designed to bring in more people to support it, this is what it includes: avian flu, $969 million. We have already spent, I believe, $5.6 billion on avian flu. We have already spent $5.6 billion, but it is an emergency, we have got to spend nearly another billion. 
   Spinach, spinach recall, not spinach disaster, but recalling to the private sector, $25 million. 
   Minimum wage, well, we know that is an emergency. Hurricane citrus program because of Katrina and Rita, I guess like avian flu, Katrina's the gift that keeps on giving in terms of any time you need to pass something. 
   NASA, $35 million for exploration capabilities. Well, that is certainly emergency. We better deal with that on the backs of the soldiers. 
   Corps of Engineers, more repair to the levee system in New Orleans. I do not know how many times we are going to repair that levee system, but maybe the Corps of Engineers cannot get it right, and who knows, maybe we need to bring in the private sector. 
   And, of course, FEMA is going to get more money. I mean, what would an emergency bill be without the FEMA bureaucrats getting more money? 
   And then there is rental assistance for Indian housing, another emergency; crop disaster assistance, shrimp, $120 million; frozen farm land, $20 million; aquaculture operations, $5 million for aquaculture for shellfish, oysters and clams. It does not have to do with Katrina, to my knowledge. 
   Of course, the emergency at the FDA, $4 million for the Office of Women's Health. Big emergency. I guess you guys have been getting a lot of letters about that one. 
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, $60 million for fishing communities, Indian tribes, individual, small businesses, fishermen and fish processors, $60.4 million. 
   And then there is the emergency of Secure Rural Schools Act, $400 million for rural schools to offset revenues lost by the Bureau of Land Management owning timber. 
   And then low-income energy assistance program, a little confused about this one because, you know, with global warming, and it already being March, well, who knows? I digress. 
   Vaccine compensation, $50 million to compensate individuals for injuries caused by the H5N1 vaccine. Now, as you know, that is avian flu. And so of the $5.6 billion we have already spent, and of the $900 million we are about to spend, we still have to give $50 million extra on that.     
   Then, $50 million for the Capitol Power Plant. I mean, we have got to get that building renovated.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Yes, I think so. Then the children's health care program, the SCHIP program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, there is a shortfall. But we have to ask ourselves, what is the shortfall? The gentleman Mr. Carter knows, one of the big reasons is because the children's health system has been abused in many States because they have insured adults.

   Mr. KINGSTON. The gentleman will remember in committee last week, when we debated this funding, Dr. Weldon and I had an amendment. I pulled out a chart that showed the number of States that had put the majority of their money into adult health care rather than children's health care. 
   You know, if there is a problem out there, that should be addressed. I want to say for the record, these things aren't programs that don't have merit. All of these things that I have listed are, I think there are some valid arguments for them. Some reforms are certainly needed in many of them, but they don't belong in a war bill, a funding war bill.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I want to read you this statement by the Speaker of the House, third in line for the President, March 19. This is Nancy Pelosi talking, ``When we do this, when we transition, when we change the mission, when we redeploy the troops, build political consensus, engage in diplomatic efforts and reform and reinvigorate the reconstruction effort, then we can turn our attention to the real war on terror in Afghanistan. I hear the voice of the future in the Chamber. What a beautiful sound. What a beautiful sound.'' 
   Now, I guess that qualifies you to micromanage the war in Iraq because you have acknowledged there is no terrorism in Iraq, that it's all in Afghanistan. I guess if the real war is in Afghanistan, then the fake war is in Iraq. Therefore, it's okay, at the hands of the troop.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I want to say also on a bipartisan basis, you have a lot of support for the good that is in the supplemental. I will hand it to the Democrat leadership, the Democrats on the Appropriations, for putting in things that we know the troops need such as the MRAPs, the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Humvees the troops want; more money for the joint IED defeat fund. We had some really good testimony on that. Increases for the defense health care program, that is important; more money for equipment and training, more money for Afghanistan to counterterrorist-laden regions, money for a shortfall in the theater. There is some very good things in this bill that we believe, on a bipartisan basis, that the troops need. 
   But the part which requires the Iraqi Government to do certain things, which they may or may not be able to do by a deadline of July 1, really does tie up the Commander in Chief. I will say we are an equal branch of government, but the Commander in Chief is in charge of wars, not Members of Congress. 
   Just to give you an example, to rewrite the Iraqi hydrocarbon law, which has to do with revenue sharing of the oil, I think it's a good thing to do. But I think if you say it has to be done a date certain, July 1, they might not be able to do that. 
   Here we are in the United States Government, last year we could not pass a budget. Right now, we are having trouble passing a budget. Sometimes these things take longer than they do shorter. 
   We got to give a new government the opportunity to get things done and not micromanage their government. But I think the biggest concern is, among other things, that there is still a pullout. There is still a date certain for a pullout, August 2008, and it's possible Iraqis won't be ready. It's possible we could do it before then. 
   What General Petraeus has outlined for us is to go full-fledged with this troop surge, bring stabilization while ramping up the training of our Iraqis, so that we can hand them the baton in a way that we have continued stabilization, and then we can go home. I think letting General Petraeus call that shot in Baghdad is far more important than 435 wannabe generals here in the United States Congress and in Washington.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I wanted to point out one more time: Civilian casualties a month before the surge, 1,440; casualties after the surge beginning February 15, 265. Bombings have dropped 40 percent, from 163 to 102. And that would just be general bombings, IEDs. And then car bombings are down 35 percent, from 56 to 36. That is progress we are already seeing because of the surge. 
   And I want to get the guys home, but you need to complete the job, you need to have victory and make sure that we do not have to go back, and an arbitrary pullout date would cause that. 
   I also want to say this: I really do believe the Democrats are right in having more oversight. Frankly, I think that, as Republicans, we did not get the  oversight that we should have. We should have been tougher on some of the testimonies that we received. And I think that their suggestions of what the Iraqi Government should do aren't far off. But I think giving them deadlines when we have trouble passing legislation ourselves, I think that is a little unreasonable. 
   But then the biggest part is the arbitrary pullout date of March 2008. And I think you are setting up failure when you are doing that. That decision has got to be made by our generals in Baghdad.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, in 2004, we spent $103 billion buying oil from nondemocratic countries, countries such as Iran, Venezuela and Russia, and the list goes on and on. Indeed, we are funding both sides in the war on terrorism, because every time we send money to these folks, the money winds up in the hands of somebody, some group, who doesn't stand for what we stand for and often is overtly anti-American. 
   That's why we should pass the DRIVE Act, which I have co-sponsored with Democrat Congressman ELIOT ENGEL. The DRIVE Act seeks to reduce our oil consumption by 20 percent, which is roughly the amount of oil we buy from the Middle East. 
   We do this through tax incentives, putting people in hybrids and flex-fuel vehicles, getting gas stations to convert to flex-fuel stations so that they can sell ethanol and biodiesel and giving a tax incentive for automobile manufacturers so that they can work with lightweight material to make cars more fuel efficient. 
   Please co-sponsor the DRIVE Act.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding the time, and I want to talk a little bit about my own background. 
   I was in the insurance business for 13 years, worked strictly on commission. I was a broker, which meant I worked for the buyer, helping them find the best quality insurance in the insurance marketplace. I also represent the entire coast of the State of Georgia. I've been involved in flood insurance and wind storm insurance and fire insurance a great deal of my adult life. So I'm very familiar with this. In fact, I'm the only CPCU in Congress, which means Charter Property and Casualty Underwriter. That's a professional designation. I know this stuff is my point. 
   Now, what you have with the insurance business is you have two types of profits, one they make from underwriting. They don't want to insure a building if they know it's going to burn down because they won't make an underwrite profit. Fair game. They do everything they can to make sure the building does not burn down. 
   They also make a second kind of profit called investment profit. When they get the cash flow from premiums from underwriting, they invest it and they make a lot of money in that. But generally speaking, insurance companies are risk averse. They don't want to insure wind if you're on the coast. They don't want to insure flood if you're in a flood zone. It makes sense from a business standpoint. 
   But as they will gladly cede this to the Federal Government, then what happens is exactly what Mr. McHenry said: you have the private sector pulls out of it. They don't put in their ingenuity to it. 
   Now my friend Mr. Taylor, and I know having represented coastal areas, it is possible that there are a lot of buildings and homes that have been constructed that probably shouldn't be there or probably shouldn't use the construction standards that they should, I know as I go over the entire district of Georgia on the coast that people in Idaho and Iowa and Maine are subsidizing the flood policies for my homeowners out there. 
   It's hard to say this is politically unpopular, but it is the truth. I just want to say that the insurance companies need to own up to their social responsibility. They don't need to take a walk on this. 
   The Federal Government is already supplying health care, retirement benefits, transportation benefits, food, drugs, even school uniforms and babysitting. Yes, there are programs for that. I don't believe the Federal Government needs to get into the wind storm pool in a major way. We need to let the private sector continue to provide this service, and we need to look ourselves in the eye and say maybe not all these buildings should be built. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this.

   But in your great State, in Massachusetts, in Boston or in Savannah, Georgia, historically very old communities, there weren't Federal programs that did the underwriting. These were all built by the private sector. 
   What I'm saying is if you just step back and let the market do its place, the market will continue to work wonders as it did for hundreds of years in the United States of America until the Federal Government let them start taking a walk by providing products that competed with the private sector.

There was no Federal insurance program of any nature when that house was built, which is my point for Boston and for Savannah, Georgia. All of those old buildings never had any Federal insurance programs: fire, flood or windstorm or anything else. 
   And what I'm saying is I agree with you. They are not pleasant to work with, and I understand and I want to commend the gentleman for his great work on this. But the reality is, if the Federal Government steps in, the private sector will move out.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and I thank my friend from Massachusetts for generously yielding time, and I want to speak about the manager's amendment. Now that I have done that, I want to talk about Public Law 15. 
   Public Law 15, or the McCarran-Ferguson Act, says that the States will be in charge of insurance, not the Federal Government. 
   Therefore, when a company comes into a State or tries to leave a State, the State insurance commissioner actually has the opportunity to twist an arm and say, if you are going to come into my State, you have to write a certain amount of coastal property, a certain mix of teenage drivers, a certain mix of elderly people for health care or whatever. State insurance commissioners by Public Law 15, the McCarran-Ferguson Act, are very powerful in the insurance business. 
   So I want to say that is where my philosophy comes from is that I do strongly believe that the States can twist arms and get a lot more done. 
   But I just want to say that Federal flood fund insurance companies did not start until 1968; yet, we have historic properties all over the coast of America because the private sector was there. And, again, having sold flood insurance through a private insurance company, I know that it is possible. And I don't know if the gentleman needs some time. I will be happy to yield, because it is your amendment.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Does it apply to the wind storm policy? And here's why I'm asking: as I understand it, we're talking about a multi-peril policy that would have flood and wind. And a mortgagee, or a bank, the lender is going to require you to carry flood insurance. Therefore, you go out in the market, well, it won't be the market. You go to Uncle Sugar, I mean Uncle Sam, and you say, I want to get this policy and you're going to get the flood care, but they're also going to sell you the wind storm as part of it. 
   So is it your intent for people who are in this floodplain area to also get a discount on their wind storm coverage?

   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say I'm confused here. This is opening up the floodgates for coastal development. Whom are we fooling here? As a matter of fact, I just understood that U.S. PIRG and a lot of pro-environmental groups are opposing this. It puts me on an odd side of things. But whom are we kidding? This is all about coastal development. And don't say, when you're knocking over the marshland, don't touch that sand dune. If you're serious about sand dunes, if you're serious about the wetlands, if you're serious about the environment, the fragile coastal environment, you will oppose this bill. This is the best thing in the world for developers. In fact, I'm a little bit surprised that developers aren't knocking down the doors and saying to fiscal conservatives who are opposing the bill for that, what are you doing? This is the best thing. 
   The great State of Florida, where I have vacationed and so many other people do, we all love the State of Florida and its natural environment. But, goodness gracious, Carl Hiaasen wrote the book ``Strip Tease.'' I mean, there's book after book about overdevelopment in Florida.  
   That is all this whole bill does is allow continued overdevelopment in the coastal area of Florida and other environmental areas. So to have a fig leaf here to say, well, don't worry, FEMA is going to worry about that sand dune and those sea oats in the coastal area, that's a very mixed signal. 
   Let me yield to my friend from Massachusetts, who I am sure has some great wisdom for this confused guy.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Let me restate. Right now it is a fact homeowners and lenders are having trouble getting flood insurance and windstorm insurance in the areas where there are lots of floods and lots of windstorms, coastal areas. This allows them to get it at an economic price that is a lot lower than the private sector because it's a government subsidy. Therefore, America, being great entrepreneurs, this is a very pro-growth, pro-development amendment. I cannot understand how you would not agree with that.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, let me say this. We just passed an amendment for people who have to buy insurance. They don't have to buy insurance. They can move. If they are living in areas that are susceptible to flood, this is still a free America. They can move on. So we are encouraging them to move into flood areas and windstorm areas that are critical environmental areas.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, just to emphasize this point. This creates a stable predictability in the insurance premium by the homeowner and developer. Therefore, it makes it easier to develop in a coastal area. 
   Listen, I understand what you are doing, but I just think this fig leaf of an amendment saying let's protect the environment is a little bit silly because the entire point of the bill disregards the environment.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I want to say to my friend, I actually think that you're feeling around the right part of the woods on this stuff. This is actually an important amendment; but I, like the gentlewoman from West Virginia, really doubt FEMA's expertise in solving this problem. And I hope that during the legislative process of this you can maybe shore up the language to say that they ought to have somebody with a lot better scientific and organizational mind than they would be in this. I mean, I keep thinking FEMA-Katrina, not a good idea to let them study anything. In fact, there are a whole slew of amendments here that probably won't be speaking of, but it gives FEMA instructions and directions to do this and that. I don't have the faith in FEMA which your side apparently does. I think this is like asking the post office to do an efficiency study; it's just not a good idea. 
   But I do believe that you should put in there something about rising tides because you don't have anything about tidal levels. In the State of Georgia, we have a 7-foot tide, Florida has about a 1- or 2-foot tide. That stuff all makes a difference.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I want to say to my friend, again, I support what you're after; I think this is a serious amendment. But when you say this information is out there, FEMA can get it, it was also well known that people were in the Superdome, but FEMA had trouble figuring that out and what to do about it. So just keep in mind who you're giving this authority to. But I do want to say to the gentleman, I understand what you're after, and I think it's important.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (PULLING OUT OF IRAQ WILL MEAN DEATH SENTENCE TO IRAQI GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, you know, one of the questions that I never hear asked and certainly don't hear answered by those who want to pull out of Iraq, like Harry Reid, who says the war is already lost, I have a question for him and others who say that the war is lost. As soon as America pulls out, the people like al Maliki, or Deputy Prime Minister Saleh, who was here in the Capitol last week, it would be a death sentence to them. 
   All those folks who stepped forward who bought into the American and international concept of freedom and self-government and democracy, they will be executed. 
   Now, what are we going to do? Are we going to give amnesty to political refugees, 50,000, 100,000? Maybe those on the left have an estimate of how many people we would open our border to. 
   But I can say this: There is no question about it, these folks who stepped forward to try to build a new government will be executed. Their children will be executed. Their spouses will be executed. Their grandparents will be executed. So inevitably we will open up the borders to them as political refugees. My question is, how many of those will we let in, and can we do that now on a bipartisan basis?

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to, first of all, start off by complimenting the Chair of the committee. We have had a number of hearings this year. We've had a lot of great oversight opportunities. I look forward to more. We've thoroughly reviewed this bill, and there's many things that we found agreement on. There are some things that we're going to have debate on today and things that we'll continue to debate as the bill goes through the process, but I want to commend Ms. DeLauro for a bill well put together. Also, I want to thank her staff, Martha Foley, Leslie Barrack, Diem-Lihn Jones, Adrienne Simmonson, Kelly Wade and Brian Ronholm, and thank them for everything that they've done. And on our side, Martin Delgado, Dave Gibbons. You'll note, on the Democrat side, I pronounced the Republican side with equal ineptitude as I do the Democrats. Jamie Swafford, Meg Gilley, Merritt Myers, Emily Watson, Heather McNatt, Elizabeth Davis and Jason Lawrence and Scott Stevens. We have a lot of folks who've helped. One of my friends on the floor said, Well, how many people does this take? And I said, Well, you know this is almost a $100 billion bill, so we all have to get involved in it. 
   I also wanted to say something about RAY LAHOOD. Mr. LaHood is a great committee member. He's going to be leaving Congress at the end of this term and made that announcement this week, and I thought I'd be remiss if we didn't say something about Mr. LaHood. He is a great appropriator. He's a guy who had early on worked with the Hershey Retreat to bring more bipartisan civility to the floor. He was instrumental when I was Chair of the Leg branch subcommittee of getting the staff gym started. Indeed, I don't know if we would have it without him and all of his hard work. 
   And also, when we were in majority, he stood and sat where you are, Mr. Chairman, many times guiding this House through hot debates and emotional issues, and we're all going to miss Mr. LaHood. 
   I want to start off on the bill a little bit because so many people think of agriculture as just farming. And yet, if we look at the breakdown of this bill and we see this large blue part, the actual money in this bill, the majority of it goes to domestic food assistance programs. And it's appropriate that it is in the ag bill because so much of what  we're talking about is national security, as seen through our food policy, but direct farming programs are in this more purplish area, and it's about 35 percent of the bill. We also have money for conservation, rural development for the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and foreign food assistance. But I think it's important for people to realize that this is not just a bill that affects the rural areas. 
   I also want to point out that much of this bill our committee doesn't have the control over that we would like to. In fact, if you look at this bill, we have an expression here in Washington called ``mandatory and discretionary spending.'' Discretionary spending is spending that Congress itself can effect on an appropriate bill. Mandatory spending is what authorizing committees do. This would have been done through the farm bill, for example. 
   Now, I don't like the term ``mandatory.'' I think it should be called automatic spending, maybe even lazy spending, maybe even unchallenged spending, since we debate it once every 5 years and then lock it up in a farm bill. I think that the mandatory portion of this budget, since it is almost 80 percent of the budget, should be opened up and debated. I think there's a lot of things in there that need more scrutiny. Indeed, of the $18 billion in the discretionary spending area, we have been scrutinized and we've had a good look at it. 
   I want to make a couple of points. Number one, the bill at its current level will be vetoed. We do not have a veto-proof majority. This bill will pass today, but not by a veto-proof. The President has made it clear that at a 5.9 percent increase over last year, he will veto it. I think it's important for us to realize this since this is a bipartisan body. This is not a veiled threat. The President has the votes to sustain the veto, and so that's what's going to happen. I think we would be better served getting together and bringing down the numbers on this bill. 
   The second thing that I wanted to point out is there are a lot of issues that we're faced with in this House this week. One of them is the government health care program that's being pushed on the States and taking away a lot of their discretion. Another one is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. These bills are being pushed aside for this bill, and while I have a lot of passion for this bill, being an aggie myself, the reality is, this bill will leave the Chamber and it will sit over with the Senate. The Senate Appropriations Committee, for all intents and purposes, is defunct. We've been working hard. We've been working long in the House to pass our appropriation bills on time, and I commend Mr. Obey and the Democrat leadership to make sure that we get the bills over there. 
   And yet, the reality is the Senate is going to sit on this bill, cram it into another bill, stuff it into a shoe box called an omnibus bill, and I think that's the wrong way to approach things. And at the same time, we're going to have other things that slide. 
   Another thing I wanted to do is set the record straight on some of the nutrition programs, because we've had and heard from a number of people on the Rules Committee earlier today that this restores funding for important and critical child nutrition programs. And you would think that under Republican control, that the bill did not give any money for food and nutrition programs. And yet, if you look at this chart, Mr. Chairman, going back from 2001 on up to 2008, you can see there's simply a linear progression in nutrition funding that has taken place under Republicans mostly, and now under Democrats. But there's no huge dip. There's no great spike now that the Democrats are in charge. And it's important to set the record straight on that. 
   In fact, I'm one, call me old fashioned, who doesn't think it's great to have lots and lots of people dependent on government programs. I think we should work to get people more independent, and I don't think that increasing these programs blindly makes sense. For example, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, I don't follow the math on that. Last year the casework estimate was 490,000 people. The actual number to participate was 463,000. And yet this year, even though the projection's 464,000, the budget increase is $42 million for it, and I don't follow that logic at all. If the number of participants is going down, why is the spending going up? And the President actually had zeroed that out. Why did he do that? Does the President not care about hungry people? No, it's because they are eligible for food stamps. There's another program for them. Why have two bureaucracies doing basically the same thing, especially since you have electronic benefit transfer cards which are very simple to do, and those were some that this committee led in. 
   The other thing that I wanted to point out on the subject of nutrition and hunger is it's interesting that we debated obesity a lot more than we have debated hunger. I think that's probably a good thing, but I think, on the other hand, it shows that there hasn't been this horrible hunger crisis under Republican rule. 
   Another point I want to say about this bill, the farm service agencies, right now farm service agencies, there are 58 of them that have no staff. The Chair and I have agreed that these should be closed down. I think that's a step in the right direction; 139 of them have one employee and 338 have two employees and 515 have three employees. 
   Now, I've heard it said about the VA that you can close down any veterans clinic you want in America as long as it's not located in a congressional district. Well, I guess the same is true with military bases, and it's true with FSA offices and other offices. We talk about wanting to balance the budget, but when it comes home to our own district, we all backpedal and say, no, we don't want anything closed. 
   These decisions aren't easy, but we have to be leaders on this and not shirk our responsibility. I think this committee kind of worked through it, and I'm hoping that we're going to continue to work through it as the bill moves through the process. 
   Renewable energy. There's so much right now in the rural areas from the subject of ethanol, biodiesel, cellulosic ethanol and other economies that we can go out and capitalize in and help bring alternative fuel to America.     
   In my home State of Georgia, there are about five or six ethanol plants. There are 121 of them nationally, but Georgia has on the drawing table right now to build another 80 ethanol plants just in our one State. That would put Georgia on the national leaders level. I am excited about that. Because if Georgia can do that, then certainly other States should be doing that; and I am glad that this bill puts a lot of investment into renewable energy. 
   On broadband and distance learning, I think we all have a commitment to that. Two things that the Chair and I have agreed on that are very important is, one, we don't want the government programs to be competing with the private sector. If the private sector is already there, why put a government program out there? And, number two, for the retired stockbroker who has bought his mountain house on the top of the beautiful mountains in Colorado, why should we care if his laptop is hooked up or not? I don't think we have to waste taxpayer money so that he can check his stock quotes while he is in retirement. 
   I also want to talk a little bit about a horse amendment that we have, some language in the bill that prohibits people who own horses from taking these horses across international lines. If you own a horse in America and this bill passes with the language that is in it, you will not be allowed to take that horse to Mexico or Canada for any purpose. 
   Now, I understand that there are those who don't want horses to be slaughtered. Most of them are people who have never owned horses, who don't understand horse owners or who are intimidated by special interest groups in Washington. But the reality is sometimes you have to put a horse down, and since we have a problem with that in America, as outlawed by this Congress or the previous Congress, then this bill does give some flexibility to those people. But, in trying to close that loophole, what the committee did is they said now you can't take your horse out of the country and you can't bring one in. It is a ridiculous part of the language, and I am going to move to strike it.  
   Another issue that I have some concerns about is drug reimportation. I think drug reimportation is a major policy shift, and I believe that we should have a vote on that. 
   I commend the Chair in reducing the number of earmarks. The earmarks last year in the bill were about 4 1/2 percent. We are starting out at about a 2 percent level. I think that is a great reduction not just in the dollar amount but in the number of earmarks. 
   And one other area that I was disappointed in that I want to point out is risk-based inspection. This is where USDA inspectors go to food-processing plants and, rather than dwell on all of them equally over time, they focus on the ones who are the bad actors, the ones who have the older equipment and the shoddy practices. They put more time there. It is a common business decision, and yet we are interfering with the USDA's right to do that. It is called ``risk-based inspection.'' I think it is very important to a good, clean, healthy food supply, and we have stopped RBI. I think that is a mistake. 
   But, overall, there is a lot that's good in the bill. I look forward to the debate. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the chairman pro tempore of the Rules Committee for an open rule on this. I think it is important, and we appreciate that. 
   I certainly thank the chairman of the committee, Ms. DeLauro, for her hard work on it, and I have had a lot of input on it. We've had a lot of good debate on this bill. So it is my intention to support it, but I do have some concerns about the rules which I will address later, but I wanted to go over the bill a little bit. 
   First of all, I wanted to get Members a little bit focused on the Ag overall picture. Number one, the whole bill is about $100 billion. We're actually debating $18 billion. There's another $79 billion in what we call around here mandatory spending, which is not mandatory, by the way. It is just that we don't want to go back to the bottom line and start all over again. That's what the farm bill's going to do or whatever, but I just wanted to point out, it's real important that the ag programs are actually about one-third of the entire bill, that there's a lot of nonagriculture, nondirect farm programs. 
   That's important because the rural community comes under such criticism that, well, why is the farm bill so big when less than 2 percent of our population are farmers? Well, the reason is, of course they feed 100 percent of us and we all eat their product, which is food. I wanted to point that out and then show you this mandatory versus discretionary portion of the bill. 
   The red portion we don't really debate; we don't control in the Appropriations Committee. That's what they do in the Ag Committee, and I don't think they did a very good job this particular year in all the parts of it because they didn't delve into some of this stuff. 
   The discretionary portion, again, is $18 billion. It's above last year's, and it's about a 3.6 percent increase over last year, or 5.9 percent. Because of that, it's going to be a veto target by the President. The Republican Party says the spending level is too high, and I think that we have to know that we can't pass this by a veto-proof majority, and so perhaps if we went back to the drawing board here it would be good. 
   The second point I want to make ties directly into this debate that's going on on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Now, this agriculture bill, should we pass it tonight or tomorrow, will go to the Senate, and it will sit, and unlike wine, it doesn't get better over time. It just sits, and what's going to happen, more and more people will delve in and more and more special interests will, and it will pile up with the rest of the appropriation bills. 
   It's a little bit silly. In fact, we're maybe like the little lab rats going round and round in a circle in hopes of getting somewhere when we know doggone good and well all that's going to happen in the Senate is this thing is going to sit. And yet, because of that, because of our urgency to pass Agriculture, we're going to ignore the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. And it doesn't make sense not to just stop a minute or an hour and get that done and then come back to Agriculture because it is not going to move. 
   There's some concerns also that I wanted to bring out when it comes to the Food and Nutrition Service. Now, my friend Mr. McGovern has worked very hard on hunger, and he has a sincere passion for that, which is important. But the charge that we have underfunded hunger in the past years under Republican control is really not accurate at all. 
   Here is the spending chart on food and nutrition programs since 2001, and as you can see, it goes up in a linear manner, and now under the Democrat rule it goes up about the same. There's not some huge deficit in hunger. In fact, I would say to you quite clearly, we spent more time talking about obesity than we did hunger, and I'm not saying hunger's not something that we all have a lot of concern about, but let's make no mistake. The spending on nutrition and food has gone up steadily under Republican control, as it has under Democrat control. 
   I want to say also, I don't think increasing food stamps participation is an achievement that the U.S. Congress should be patting itself on the back. We should move to getting people independent, not more dependent on government largess. We need to work with people to get them independent. And so often our poverty brokers in this world have a perverse incentive to make sure people don't become independent, and I think we need to be mindful of that on any government program. 
   The Chair has pointed out what we're doing on renewable energy, and that is something that we think the Ag can and should lead on with ethanol and biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol. We've taken great strides in this bill, and I am confident that we are going to have some great progress and great bragging rights on that. 
   One other issue that we're going to get into later is this overgrab on the horse regulation that, if this bill passes in its current form, you will not be able to export your horse or import a horse. That's not the business of the Federal Government, at least not in a constitutional sense. I believe that a horse is private property and that you should have the right to sell your horse to folks in Canada and Mexico, if you so choose, or take it to a horse show over there. We will debate that later, and I thank the gentleman and I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, in 2004, the United States of America spent $103 billion buying oil from non-democratic countries, such countries as Venezuela, as Iran, as Russia, and even ones who are our allies like Saudi Arabia, where some of that money finds its way into the hands of terrorist groups. 
   We are funding both sides in the war on terrorism. It is a national security issue. We have to get off Middle East oil, and we need to reduce our oil dependency. We import 60 percent of our oil today. 
   Congressman ELIOT ENGEL and I have introduced H.R. 670. The goal of it is to reduce our oil consumption by 20 percent in 20 years. It has overwhelming bipartisan support, both in the House and the Senate. 
   Now, if you don't buy that, there is another reason to focus on this, and it has to do with your pocketbook. Just think about the flexibility that we have out there in fuel choices, from ethanol to biodiesel to battery operated cars.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF ROSEMARY MUCKLOW -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the achievements of a friend of mine, Rosemary Mucklow. Rosemary is the long-standing executive director of the National Meat Association and has been somewhat of a legend in the meat and food business. Her dedication to the industry is evident by her business achievements, there are so many of them. 
   Rosemary was born in Scotland and went to work at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for the British Government before being hired as a secretary at the Pacific Coast Meat Association, which was later named the Western States Meat Association, and then renamed the National Meat Association. 
   In 1996, Rosemary received the E. Floyd Forbes award from the Meat Association for her outstanding service. She was honored again in 2002 by the American Meat Science Association for her ``commonsense leadership.'' She served on the National Advisory Committee on Meat and Poultry Inspection and was the vice president of the International HACCP Alliance. Throughout her career, she has highlighted the importance of information and education of the meat industry to improve standards, efficiency, and quality. 
   Rosemary will be retiring very soon, but if I know Rosemary, retirement for her won't mean just quietly fading into the sunset. She is going to be active, probably still in the association, and in the industries. 
   I had the opportunity to get to know Rosemary about 10 or 12 years ago when we, in the House Ag subcommittee of appropriations were passing the HACCP law. At that time we were moving from visual carcass-to-carcass inspection of meat and poultry to microbial testing, taking this to the modern technology. Rosemary knew so many people in the industry, and there was a lot of controversy, but she was able to get the people together to come up with the right compromises and the right push at the right time to get the thing from floundering. 
   She also was very active at a time when there was some Salmonella and E. coli issues that had threatened to close down the industry and push through, I think, very aggressive mandatory recall authority for the Secretary of Agriculture. Rosemary brokered some ``peace in the valley,'' you might say. 
   She's got the kind of enthusiasm that can only be called ``contagious.'' I met her through a man who is a sausage manufacturer in San Francisco named Al Piccetti, and the Piccetti family has also become friends of mine. And it seems like birds of a feather flock together. Rosemary's friends are good people. They have invited Libby and me to go visit them out in San Francisco, and we had a very nice time dealing with them. All the hospitality I would say that they have given us over the years and the friendship, those kind of relationships that in this business are rare to find. I will say this, I have no idea what Ms. Mucklow's politics are, if she's Democrat or Republican. In fact, the last time she was in Washington, she really prefers, for some reason, the west coast, but the last time she was here she said, Jack, I don't need to see you, I'm going to go see Chairwoman ROSA DELAURO because that's where the action is now. And she said that with a twinkle and a smile, and then she went up to go see ROSA. But she has that kind of good will that she can deal with both sides of the aisle and get the argument off politics into what is best for the American food consumer. What's best for the industry and the consumer has always been her goal. 
   I will say I don't even know what kind of activities she does on a personal level, but I know this, that whatever she is doing right now, she's doing it with a smile and a lot of fun and involving a lot of people. 
   She's the kind of lobbyist or industry advocate that keeps a good reputation for the industry that she represents because she doesn't cut corners, she doesn't do political things, she doesn't think in terms of backroom deals or power moves or anything like that, she wants to do what's fair and what's just for the American people, and has a broad picture far beyond her job or her industry or her association. 
   We're going to miss her kind of leadership, but I do hope that in her retirement she does not become a stranger. With that, I want to say thank you, Rosemary Mucklow, for your many years of advocacy for the American food consumer and for the industry. 
   Rosemary Mucklow, Executive Director, National Meat Association, Oakland, CA 
   Rosemary Mucklow is Director Emeritus of National Meat Association, (formerly Western States Meat Association) an Oakland-based trade association representing packers, processors, wholesalers, sausage makers, and other related firms in the U.S. meat and poultry industry. 
   Until 2007 she was the NMA Executive Director and held this position since 1982 when the Western States Meat Packers Association and the Pacific Coast Meat Association merged to form the stronger, broad-based organization it is today. Rosemary has been associated with the meat industry for over 40 years. 
   As Executive Director, Rosemary's responsibility's included the administration of the affairs of the National Meat Association. She continues to oversee the activities of NMA as Director Emeritus, and as part of her daily activities she maintains working contacts with NMA's members so that she remains fully informed about the effects on their businesses of government and market activities. 
   Almost daily, Rosemary advises members on the intricacies of the federal meat and poultry inspection laws, and other laws administered by the Department of Agriculture.  
   Rosemary has a reputation for ``telling it like it is.'' She is considered a formidable adversary in defending the industry when it's right, and she'll be equally straightforward in making corrections when it is not. In 1996 Rosemary received the E. Floyd Forbes award presented by the National Meat Association in recognition of her outstanding services to the meat industry. In 2002, she was honored by the American Meat Science Association for her ``common sense leadership in the areas of food safety and public policy.'' She was appointed to the National Advisory Committee on Meat and Poultry Inspection and elected Vice President of the International HACCP Alliance. She is an honorary member of the American Association of Food Hygiene Veterinarians. 
   Aside from her responsibilities as Director Emeritus of NMA Rosemary is a member of various research and industry related organizations. She is a Trustee on several Taft-Hartley Funds administering medical and pension benefits for union workers. She has worked to raise funds in the area of cancer research as President of the Peralta Cancer Institute and has reached out to assist disadvantaged people in the community. She is the President of the Berkeley City Club, as well. 
   Rosemary was born and educated in Edinburgh, Scotland and had various jobs unrelated to the meat industry before coming to the United States in 1959. She earned her Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Accounting at Golden Gate University, graduating in 1970. She resides in a cottage with a panoramic view of the Golden Gate and surrounded by a woodsy rose garden in Berkeley, California with two feline companions.  
   Jolley: Five Minutes With Rosemary Mucklow, Ret., NMA 
   Rosemary Mucklow is really going to retire this time, No kidding. Ms. Mucklow, the long-standing Executive Director of the National Meat Association and a legend in the meat business, took a first stab at retirement several years ago. It didn't take. After several fruitless months of searching for her replacement, the National Meat Association's board of directors threw in the towel and asked her to stay on a bit longer. 
   Her second retirement announcement, issued just a few weeks ago, included a surprise. The next Executive Director had already been chosen--Barry Carpenter, the recently retired Deputy Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service and one of the few with the gravitas to follow in the deep foot prints left by Ms. Mucklow. 
   Note: In writing this, I almost called Carpenter ``her replacement,'' a silly misnomer on my part. To be correct, she will be followed in the office by Mr. Carpenter. No one will ever replace her. 
   Retirement for Rosemary does not mean she will immediately take up knitting at some condo in Sun City. She won't even hide out at her home in the Berkeley hills. OK, she might do some more knitting, it's always been a hobby. But those needles are much sharper than the standard issue dime store needles--maybe they're those Addi Turbo 47 inch circular brass knitting needles with finely honed points--and they will still be used with great dexterity to prod an occasionally recalcitrant industry onwards. 
   In this interview, I asked her to construct a mini-hall of fame and induct an inaugural class of people she has worked with in her long career. It was an impressive list but short one name. In any meat industry hall of fame, her name will be listed at the top in recognition of the lengthy and positive impact she's had. 
   Let's spend five minutes with Rosemary as she prepares to slowly and reluctantly step away. 
   It's been said that retirement isn't for sissies and that's something you've never been accused of being. So are you really going to do it this time and what does retirement mean to a hyper-active, over-achiever like you? 
   On February 1, 2007, when Barry Carpenter accepts the position of CEO/Executive Director, my status with NMA will change to Director Emeritus. I expect to turn over the ceo responsibilities to Barry, and as we proceed through a transition time, to be able to focus my time and energy on many undone activities for which there has been very limited time. Retirement is a misnomer really, and because Barry will be recused from certain activities with his former employer, I will be an interim bridge for those purposes. I'm certainly not retiring to my cottage in the hills of Berkeley to knit full time! 
   In military terms, you seem to be doing a ``phased withdrawal'' from your duties at NMA. What will keep you busy as your time out of the office expands? 
   Oh, there are lots of things on the horizon! I'd like to visit and work with individual members more, I'd like to have the time to go through lots of history and big files that have accumulated over the years, and probably to do a little writing about the changes we've already seen, and what might lie ahead. 
   How about a short history lesson? How and when did you get started in the trade association business? A little background on ``why,'' too 
   I was hired by then Pacific Coast Meat Jobbers Association on February 1, 1961 as the secretary in a two-person office. Our major focus was collective bargaining on behalf of Bay Area meat jobbers and processors. There were a couple of changes in the man that I worked for that year, and we got through labor negotiations, and by early 1962 I had a new boss who was a lawyer and accountant. After the 1964 negotiations, he told me I was not good as a secretary, and why did I not go back to school and get educated, so I went to Golden Gate University and after five years received my BA in Accounting in 1970. 
   By that time, the boss was back practicing law, and in absentia, so I got to fill the void and apply what I had learned and we were in the years of implementation of the 1967 changes to the Federal Meat Inspection Act. We were innovative and energetic, I made friends with the bigger organization, Western States Meat Packers Association, and in 1982, under the leadership of Cal Santare of WSMPA, we merged Pacific Coast and WSMPA into Western States Meat Association. In 1996, because of broader interest in what WSMA was doing, we changed the name to National Meat Association. It's been an exciting and bumpy ride! 
   You've had the opportunity to meet and work with many of the legends in the business. Let's construct a mini-hall of fame here and induct the inaugural members. Who would they be and why would you include them? 
   First the man who hired me: Tom Morton, who went on to be very successful in the investment business. I should have followed him! 
   Don Houston, FSIS Administrator, was a good friend, and provided critical access for me to the USDA regulatory process. 
   Cal Santare, who believed that a woman could do it, when many of his cohorts didn't think so! 
   Al Piccetti, of San Francisco Sausage, a former President of PCMA, who encouraged me to reach for my dreams. 
   Ben Goehring, of Goehring Meat, another former President of PCMA and later of WMSA, who inspired me with strength and friendship. 
   Kathi Mosie, of Saag's Products, who never failed to be supportive. 
   Phil Bauer of Federal Meat, who had to fight for me on principle, and thus earned unpopularity with some associates. 
   Cal Faello of King Meat who went to the mat for me as a matter of principle. 
   John Duyn of Carlton Farms who helped me to make change from good old boys to the next generation. 
   Dick Lyng, whom I knew in California, who showed me by example how to be a better politician 
   Phil Olsson of Olsson, Frank & Weeda, friend, lawyer, counselor and absolutely straight arrow for over 30 years. 
   In the industry, many of the toughies reached out to be helpful to me, including Bob Peterson, Ken Monfort, and more recently Joe Luter. John Miller is a longtime friend, People like Bill Buckner, Dick Bond (whose first job was for one of the early WSMPA legends, Homer Glover), Rich Vesta, Bernie and Joe Clougherty, Gary Waldman, Terry Caviness, Dave Wood, Les Oesterreich, Warren Wilcox and Harvey Dietrich. In academia, I can never forget Russell Cross, Gary Smith, Jeff Savell, Roger Mandigo, Gary Acuff, and Elsa Murano and lots more. And Lou Gast whom I first knew at FSIS in the early 80s has come through over and over again. 
   Indeed, I have been blessed, and while there are many omissions from this group, my strength has come from the generosity and kindness of many, many people in this great industry. 
   You've accomplished a lot during your tenure at WSMA/NMA. What achievements stand out the most? 
   Running a trade organization is not like playing a football game. There are not winners and losers after a fixed amount of game time! 
   Some legal wins, such as the Supreme case on Salmonella Testing at the 5th Circuit Court was a powerful event. Also, the driving energy by NMA to get the U.S. Canadian Border open was a special ``win.'' 
   But the big win is the strong support of people for the goals of NMA and what it stands for, for the respect shown toward me and this organization for what it does to serve the needs and interests of the industry, and for the appreciation of members, large and small, for what we stand for and the efforts we make. 
   Using your many years of experience, let's look ahead. What does the future look like from your vantage point? Can you talk about issues that we can look at with pride as well as the issues that might create some problems? 
   I see lots of opportunities that lie ahead! The 21st Century will be a stimulating and exciting time for firms that pay attention to what consumers want to buy, rather than make a commodity product to ship out. 
   There is a huge amount of innovation going on as we speak in this great industry. I think we need to provide the next generation with relatively simple information about how to make food taste good and be safe, all at the same time. There are a zillion cookbooks, but in addition to easy meals for consumers on the rush, there is a need to demonstrate that good food is a catalyst for good friends and families to get together. I like it best when I hear that competitors can find common ground with each other in the marketplace. 
   No one is going to eat the same item over and over again. Variety, reasonable portion size, and good taste is very important, I think there are big opportunities for developing new niche markets, and trade organizations will be challenged to fairly represent their members interests in the upcoming debates. I think there are opportunities for  small Individuals to bring forward their idea, and it gives me the greatest pleasure to help small firms that have the dynamic energy to grow their market share with a good idea. 
   As Barry Carpenter prepares to pick up the torch, what advice do you have to give him? 
   Barry brings strengths to the leadership of this organization that are quite different to mine. He is highly respected for his capacity to understand this industry, and for honesty and integrity. I am thrilled that he will take over, and I will try not to get in his way as he leads with new ideas and creativity and builds on the strengths of NMA as we know it today. 
   NMA's member response services have created a new gold standard for the industry, for large and small firms. Our availability to assist and guide firms through the maze of regulatory requirements is legendary. I will continue to support Barry in any way appropriate and possible and am thrilled that the lengthy transition will give us opportunities to work together in a different way to serve the needs and interests of our great meat industry, and liberate me to think about new projects that can be valuable for the future of our organization.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AS AN INDEPENDENT MILITARY SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, 60 years ago President Harry Truman, through the National Security Act of 1947, created the United States Air Force and ended a 40-year association with the U.S. Army. This move signaled the dawning of a new age and placed airpower in its proper place as a vital element of our Nation's defense. 
   Airpower had proven its worth to President Truman and many others over those 40 years. From Military Air Balloon success in World War I, to Billy Mitchell's airpower demonstration off Virginia's coast, to the Doolittle Raids and the devastating bombing raids in World War II, airpower allowed our military commanders to fight for and defend our Nation as never before. 
   Creating a separate Air Force allowed our brave service men and women to fully concentrate on honing the skills and pushing the ever-expanding envelope of airpower. 
   In Georgia today, we have Air National Guard and/or Air Force Reserve units at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Robins Air Force Base, Savannah, Macon and Brunswick as well as active-duty units at Moody Air Force Base. 
   And whether it is C-130s from the 165th Airlift Wing or men and women from the 117th Air Control Squadron which just won the 2007 Outstanding Air Control Squadron award from the National Guard Association of the United States, each of Georgia's units and the outstanding men and women who serve in them contribute around the world fighting the Global War on Terrorism. They also provide a formidable force in the face of disaster here at home, as was seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when rescue helicopters from Moody teamed up with other Air Force rescue units to save more than 4,300 people from the disastrous and deadly storm. 
   Dobbins, Robins and Moody can all trace their beginnings to the Army and the 1940-1941 timeframe when the War Department was making preparations in case the United States went to war--which came to fruition on December 7, 1941 when the Japanese declared War on the United States and attacked Pearl Harbor. 
   Dobbins began as Rickenbacker Field, but was re-named in 1950 in honor of Captain Charles M. Dobbins of Marietta, whose airplane was shot down during the war near Sicily. 
   Robins is named after Brigadier General Augustine Warner Robins, one of the Army Air Corps' first General Staff Officers. The Warner Robins Air Logistic Center which preceded the base is also named after the General. 
   Moody is named after MAJ George Putnam Moody, an early Air Force pioneer killed in May 1941 while serving with the Beech Aircraft Company in Wichita, Kan. At the time of his death, the major was working on the inspection board for AT-10 transitional trainers which were later sent to Moody. 
   While each base has a rich history, Moody began a new chapter in its history just recently when the 23rd Fighter Group relocated to Moody and began flying A-10 missions in the skies over Valdosta. 
   The 23rd Fighter Group also known as the ``Flying Tigers'' was formed under the command of General Claire Chennault and was part of his China Air Task Force, taking over the mission of the disbanded American volunteer group ``Flying Tigers.'' Several of the original Flying Tigers flew with the 23rd Fighter Group in the China-Burma-India Theater, passing on their knowledge and experience. 
   Like Mitchell before him, Chennault was another early pioneer and controversial figure who made today's Air Force possible. He argued vehemently for the fighter plane in the 1930s--a time when the rise of the bomber aircraft had consumed the Air Corps experts and were the focus for their tactics. 
   In fact, it was his continued belief and passionate advocacy for the fighter that led to his isolation at the famed Air Tactical School and eventually drove him to become an advisor in China and the rest as we say is history. 
   Today we mark the Air Force's 60th birthday in order to reflect on its heroes of the past, and more importantly, to recognize the courage and sacrifice our airmen and their families make each and every day for our freedom. Quite simply, I salute you.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (COMBUSTIBLE DUST EXPLOSION AND FIRE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the ranking member and I thank the chairman of the committee, and my colleagues, Mr. Barrow and Ms. Woolsey, for their work on this. While I support many of the points of the ranking member, I believe that this bill is a step in the right direction and something that we are just going to have to push OSHA on. 
   The Imperial Sugar explosion, of course, was a very tragic accident, of which Mr. Barrow and I were involved in it. I actually was there the night that it happened and he and I went there for several days afterwards to look at the damage. I met with many of the families. It's a very sad thing. Sometimes in a situation like that it's hard to be objective in terms of what to support and what not to support, or what to change, especially since we don't know the exact cause of the accident; if any of the existing standards, for example, were violated, if a new standard would have prevented it, or if this is going to boil down to housekeeping, in which there would already be a violation and something a new standard or an old standard cannot address because the employer did not do what the employer is supposed to do, which would be to keep the workplace clean. 
   I share the goal of comprehensive worker safety, but sometimes the history of legislating it shows that if we move too quickly, then you might not get the goal that you want to do. Throughout its history, OSHA standards set in process has been governed by the Administrative Procedures Act. This generally requires a Federal agency to develop and draft proposed regulations, issue proposed rules and regulations in a transparent process that allows for comment and input from the stakeholders and incorporate any appropriate stakeholders' comments in the publication of the final rule. 
   The bill was improved greatly with the Woolsey substitute. That substitute moved more of the capital and equipment-intensive mandates to the final rule rather than the interim rule, including engineering, administration, workplace practices. It also moved the reference to the NFPA, the National Fire Protection Act, from the interim to the final rule, and making the language more flexible. Those were very good improvements. Lastly, it required that the 18-month final rule be made under the normal rule making process. 
   Now I understand that the chairman may offer further improvements during the floor debate tonight that may include making engineering controls required under the interim standard effective 6 months after the issuance of the interim rather than 30 days under the base bill in clarifying that the standard must be promulgated in accordance with normal OSHA rulemaking procedure including that that provides for the review of small businesses. 
   I think that that might a good step because the more input you get from the business community, the labor community, and the users, I think the better. That's why I offered an amendment that would have said that we should consider if there will be any job loss because of these rules or because of the interim rules. I was very disappointed that the Rules Committee did not allow my amendment to be considered on the floor because I think it would have been very helpful and something that certainly would have given bipartisan support to it.     
   One thing I also want to point out, OSHA can actually make rules themselves. The Assistant Secretary, Mr. Foulke, has stated, ``We have not ruled out the possibility of doing rulemaking, and that is an option for us still. But we are just trying to collect the data through the National Emphasis Program where we look at sites and determine do our standards actually cover what we need to cover? Or are there some holes in the coverage that we may need to address, and would a comprehensive standard address that.'' 
   So we need to remember that if this bill gets bogged down somewhere along the line, that OSHA itself probably will come out with some sort of rule modification which could be helpful. 
   We have talked about the grain standard being a good standard.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. The leadership of the committee has said that the grain standard works fairly well. But I want to point out that this took 7 years, so maybe the reason the grain standard is working so well is that it took a long time and lots of input to pass. I would hope that we could take the lessons of the grain standard and not have to wait anywhere near 7 years, but say, hey, that will has already been invented. Let's apply what we found on the grain standard to this. I am hoping that the chairman's amendment addresses some of those things, but I am also confident that the Senate is going to do it as well. 
   Let me close by saying I believe under these circumstances that the committee has done a good job. I think there has been some solid input from the minority, and the majority has been listening. I do plan to support the bill, but I do think we have a lot more that we could do to improve it.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for yielding. 
   I find today a lot of questions, a lot of unanswered questions, and a lot of half decent debate going on. 
   I wonder, first of all, why we didn't bring this bill through committee. Certainly if it is a good idea, it would have been something worth debating and perhaps some amendments. But under the new ``open rule'' Democrat Party, I understand we can bypass the committee and not have any hearings or amendments. 
   The next question is, why are so many people who were opposed to the Bush tax cut for the lower income going from 15 percent to 10 percent tax bracket, why are they now so compassionate to the poor? 
   And I have to ask, also, why are you stopping at $7 an hour? If it is good for the economy and good for the workers, as we keep hearing over and over again, why do we stop at $7 an hour, this arbitrary number? Nobody can make a living at $14,000 a year. Why not go to $8 an hour, $9 an hour, $10, $20 an hour? Heck, if it is good for the economy, let us go to $50 an hour. And if we had a committee hearing, maybe we could have some answers on that. 
   Question: If it is so good for the economy, why does the Congressional Budget Office rate it as a $5 to $7 billion unfunded mandate on our small businesses, which are the economic engines of the economy? How come the Hoover Institute estimates that it will actually get 20 percent of the minimum wage workers out of work because people will say you are not worth that much money? Those are questions that we don't have answers to. 
   Another question that I have is we keep hearing that the minimum wage hasn't been increased in 9 years, when, in fact, since 1997, 29 States have increased their minimum wages. We do not hear about that because I guess we are against States' rights in any form around here. That seems to be a taboo kind of thing. 
   But what is also interesting is that 85 percent of the people who make minimum wage are well above the poverty level. Why? Because 52 percent of the people on minimum wage are teenagers, 30 percent are part time, and 40 percent have never had a job before. In fact, if we want to take a real serious look at poverty, we need to look at the correlation between poverty and hours worked a week. The reality is so many people are working less than 40 hours a week. 
   The second point, very important, is marriage. If you want to get a lot of the children who are in poverty out of poverty right now, get the mom and dad to marry each other. 
   Now, that wasn't in the first 100-hour agenda. I understand. We are rolling out the moldy, oldie golden hits of Democrat thought. But let's get into poverty and let's have some real hearings.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California, and I want to say this legislation gets an ``A'' in politics and a ``D-minus'' in economics; an ``A'' is politics most people aren't going to notice that the very people who are pushing it are the ones who voted against the Bush tax cuts for the low-income bracket, reducing it from 15 percent to 10 percent. 
   It is going to be good politics because most people will overlook the fact that the majority of the Democrat Party are going to vote against affordable health care for the working poor. 
   It is good politics because most people won't notice that the Democrats didn't have a committee meeting which would have given them an opportunity to parade out all of these workers who they have been saying over and over again depend on Congress for their salary and wages because apparently they cannot earn more on their own, only Congress themselves can increase this. 
   It is going to be good politics for them because most people won't realize that, since 1997, in the last 9 years, that 29 States have increased the minimum wage, and that is a fact that keeps getting overlooked. 
   And it is going to be good politics because most folks know that union wages are going to be linked into this, and it is going to increase the wage salary for the union workers who support them so dearly. 
   But it is going to be bad economically. As I said, an ``A'' in politics and a ``D'' in economics because the reality is that most minimum-wage earners are part-time, and most are well above  the poverty level. Most are teenage workers: 52 percent under 25; 40 percent have never had a job before. It is an entry level job. 
   If the Democrat Party truly wanted to take on poverty, they would have to say, what is the relationship between marriage and the poverty level, and between hours worked and the poverty level. Because the truth of the matter is if people in poverty, if many of them would marry and many of them would work 40 hours a week, they would be out of poverty. It is not anything I claim to have the franchise on, the knowledge of, all of the information on, but it is an economic fact. I hope that we can have committee hearings on that and discuss that, because if we want to attack poverty, that is where we need to go.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (MINIMUM WAGE IS ARBITRARY NUMBER -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, despite vastly overwhelming numbers, I rise to address the House, and I apparently represent the entire body on this side of the aisle. 
   I want to say this to my Democrat friends, and I understand the vote here and I understand the politics of minimum wage, but why $7.50 an hour, $7.15, whatever it is? Why not $8? Why not $9? It is an arbitrary number anyhow. Maybe $15, maybe $20 an hour. It is an arbitrary number. If we are command and control, central government planning anyhow, why is $7 an hour sufficient? 
   In 1980, 15 percent of the workers in America were on minimum wage. Today, it is 2.5 percent. Who are they? Fifty-two percent are teenagers. Thirty percent are part-timers. And 40 percent have never held a job before. 
   Many studies show that when the minimum wage increases, small businesses who will be most affected actually decrease the number of jobs, thus hurting those whom we are supposed to be helping. 
   I would say to you that the reason most jobs do not pay minimum wage anymore is because the economy has moved the central government planning of Congress and the thinking of 1938 which set the law in motion to begin with. With that, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the debate today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, well, it looks like the Democrat juggernaut is rolling along, or maybe it is more like the first steps of fledgling toddlers stumbling through their day. 
   First was the embarrassment of saying we would have open and fair debates for all, and then the first rule, no amendments, no open rules, and no committee hearings, which of course led to the embarrassing ``Sorry, Charlie Tuna'' incident of exempting American Samoa from workmen's compensation. I have to ask my friends, why did y'all do that? What were you thinking? 
   But I also want you to know I am on the side of American Samoa on this one. I don't think it is fair to go in there and beat them up and tell them how they should run their economy, tell them what is best for them and tell them that Washington knows best on central wage planning. Wait a minute, though. That is what we did to the other States, too. 
   Well, as a matter of fact I don't think we should bring American Samoa into this. I think we should amend the bill, if you do decide to have a committee hearing, that is, and allow the other States to join American Samoa and set their own minimum wage. But then that would be decentralized planning.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  
   As I sit here, I am reminded of the story we have all heard about the guy who goes on the $100 cruise. He sees an advertisement for a $100 cruise. Like all of us, especially a guy like me, I have never been on a cruise, he goes down to the dock real excited about it and he gives the man $100. The man pulls out a two-by-four, hits him over the head, puts him on an inner tube and pushes him into the water. And he is cruising along. After a while he wakes up. He bumps into another guy with an inner tube and he is rubbing his head. Finally, the first guy says to the other guy, ``Hey, do they serve drinks on this cruise?'' And the second guy says, ``Well, they didn't last year.'' 
   Now, the point is, how vulnerable could you be to do this twice? How vulnerable would these students be to believe what they are hearing about an interest rate that, it is true, it does go to 3.4. It dips down to 3.4, and then it springs back up. 
   I only wish the stock that I owned in whatever my savings account is would dip down like that and then go immediately back up the way the Democrat Party is. 
   But this bill had no hearings. A broken promise right off the bat. We would have hearings, we would have amendments. There are no amendments, there are no hearings. 
   What happens when you have no hearings and no amendments? You can get to only what can be called the tuna fish clause. We know what the tuna fish clause is. That is where there is something embarrassing stuck in a bill that nobody quite understands. And I think Mr. McKeon over and over again has pointed out what the tuna fish clause is in this, and that is that the 3.4 percent interest rate is only in effect for 6 months, from 2011 to 2012. 
   Now, I want to explain to the folks who haven't been paying attention, when we passed the minimum wage bill the other day and we heard over and over again how it was going to help save the workers of America and how it was good for all, at the same time the very people who were telling us what a great bill it was had put in a scheme to exempt the tuna fish industry from American Samoa, the very people who are telling us this is great for all.     
   So it can be called the tuna fish clause. We are going to look for the tuna fish clause over and over again. 
   Now, one thing that we have not talked about is that universities have had a 35 percent inflation rate over the last 5 years. That is relevant because not everybody is going to go to college on a loan or on a scholarship, and so when you have a 35 percent inflation rate, you have got to say, well, what does that do to the rest of the student population. That is something the Republican Party and, frankly, the Democrat Party should focus on, what can we do to bring this under control. 
   The second thing is, there has been a commitment on this. Frequently, you hear about a poll that is taken that says 90 percent of the people of America believe in clean air. Oh, my goodness, 90 percent. Please tell me about the 10 percent who do not believe in clean air. So when you hear the guy standing on the dock with the $100 cruise, that this is good for education, of course, it is good for education. Who does not want more kids to get a college education? Because our kids today are going to be competing against kids from Tokyo, and from Moscow and from Beijing. 
   It is important in an international global economy that we have kids that are as competitive as possible, and that is why we have always worked on a bipartisan basis. I mean, think about this. In 1995, when the Republican Party took over the House, the Pell Grant money was $2,340. We increased it the next year to $2,470, and now it is at $4,050. We did not do that only with Republican votes. We did it with Republican leadership, but the Democrats were there with us. We think bipartisanship is very important. 
   In addition to that, we have together worked on Perkins loans, on college work student loans, on supplemental education grants. It is very important that we as a bipartisan body come together on education just like national defense issues, because education no longer ends at the water line. It goes internationally. 
   So when we hear over and over again that this bill will save a student $4,400 over the life of the loan, it is absolutely mathematically impossible, and maybe that is one thing we need more of, math education, so folks could tell a fraud when they see it. 
   In order for you to save that kind of money, the 3.4 percent interest rate would have to stay in effect for years at a time, but as Mr. McKeon said over and over again, it is only in effect from July 2011 to January 2012. That is the tuna fish clause of this bill. 
   If we had worked through committees on a bipartisan basis, regular order, hearings and amendments on the floor, we could get rid of the tuna fish clause in this, and we want to do that. 
   I am the son of a college professor, the brother of a college professor. I am the only one in my family who only has an undergraduate degree. I believe in higher education. Who does not believe in higher education? But I also believe in truth in representation and in bipartisanship. 
   I thank the gentleman.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   I am opposed to the amendment because I am opposed to the bill. 
   One of the great things about Congress, I say to people, is it is the ultimate place for those of us with attention deficit disorder, because we have the privilege on a day-to-day basis to go from health care, to war, to weapons systems. Which airplane is better, the C-5 or the C-17? To go to farm issues. How about the cotton program? Is it good? Well, should we model it after the peanut program? 
   Then education: college, primary, private school. Should there be prayer? Should we lower the student-teacher ratio? Indeed, the President of the United States, President Clinton, stood in this Chamber once and called for school uniforms. We were experts on that for the day. 
   Tax policy: Who should get tax breaks and who should not? Trade policies: Which countries are going to be the best to trade with us? Immigration. 
   The list goes on and on and on. But, unfortunately, our expertise does not continue with the demand and the issues. 
   And here we are talking about popcorn. I would say to my friend from California that 99.9 percent of the Members here have never been in a popcorn factory. I listened to my friend, Mr. Miller. He knows a lot about this. I am impressed that he knows mixing rooms and building walls and so forth, but I would say most of us do not. 
   That is why we have agencies and commissions like OSHA set up, because they fill in the blanks where we cannot be experts. They have scientists who go in and make rulemaking policies in a balanced way, nonpolitical and nonemotional. It is scientific. They go in there and say, before we go out and set a bunch of standards on the private sector, let's make sure that we have the experts doing the decisionmaking. 
   And yet here we are, the nanny-state of Congress. Nurse Ratched once more knows best, completely oblivious to the fact that one of the largest manufacturers of microwave popcorn just recently said they would eliminate this product from their bands, and another manufacturer did the same thing. And even OSHA on September 24 said they will move forward with various measures to address the hazards of the workplace. 
   I think it is interesting that we have set up OSHA to help us, and yet we have decided now that we know popcorn and we know best. 
   But I would say to my friend from California, your expertise is not matched by 99 percent of us. I would say Ms. Woolsey, being a great Member who does her homework, and Mr. Wilson and the staffers who are here, you all are popcorn experts in Congress, and that's it. There are no other popcorn experts in Congress. 
   I think we do have some experts on trade and on taxes and on military things, but even they have to rely on agencies and organizations to give them better information. Yet we are leapfrogging over this information. I don't know if it is political or what, but we seem to be in a big rush to forget the standards that should be set by the proper agency. 
   Later, we will have the opportunity to vote on the Wilson alternative that would give OSHA time to set a standard that would be, after a NIOSH study, based on solid scientific evidence. It seems to me that is a more reasonable and balanced approach to solving this problem. And we are not even convinced. The data doesn't even say this problem is as big and as urgent as those who are advocating this bill are. 
   So I recommend a ``no'' vote on this amendment, even though I know it is technical in nature. But I think we should ultimately vote on the Wilson amendment in support of it, and then I think we should pass the bill. But if the Wilson amendment does not pass, we should vote this bill down. Because Congress is not an expert on this and we should know our limitations and we should let the proper agencies with the scientists and the experts make the rulemaking on something so micro-technical as micro-popcorn.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (IRAQ WAR SUPPLEMENTAL -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to follow up on the debate which we have just temporarily postponed until tomorrow morning on the supplemental appropriations bill for the Iraq war, and I wanted to start off by reiterating the statement made by Mr. Shadegg of Arizona in which he said he knew of no point in history where a country at war declared an end date for when they would be getting out of that war, the point being that most countries fight wars until the war is finished, based on the war situation, and not based on a calendar and an arbitrary date at that. 
   I think that is very important as we have this vote tomorrow because we are, in fact, hurting our troops if we make the announcement right now to the enemy that by March of 2008 we will be leaving. We know particularly in the Middle East and in Iraq that in cities such as Tikrit and Fallujah, as we have been there the last 3 or 4 years, that whenever the enemy wants to, it can lay low and wait till our troop situation or troop level shifts, and then they come out of the woodwork. I think if we do announce that we are going to be gone in March 2008, no matter what happens on the field of battle, then that enemy is going to use that same tactic to just wait until the Americans are out of town. 
   If we do leave that country before the job is done, then what happens, Mr. Speaker, is it could cause chaos. A civil war could erupt, and a lot of people say, well, I do not care if a civil war erupts. But how do you know it is going to stay in the boundaries of Iraq? Why would not the Shiites in Iran, for example, get involved in it? We already know they are getting involved in supplying the Shiites in Iraq with things. We do not know what will happen in that volatile area. 
   What happens to our ally Israel? We know that the Arab countries want to wipe Israel off the map. Are we doing Israel any favors if we abruptly withdraw and arbitrarily withdraw from Iraq? 
   And what happens to the oil reserves? I know it is interesting, everybody likes to say no war for oil, but the reality is you cannot fight a war without oil, and you cannot run our economy without oil, and petrodollars can stir up a lot of trouble around the globe. Just ask Hugo Chavez in Venezuela what he has done with his petrodollars, street money, and here we would be turning over the second or third largest oil reserves in the world over to a terrorist anti-American state. 
   Think about this for a minute in that context. America drilling and tapping into all the reserves that we have, we control 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. We use 25 percent. We import 60 percent. If you wanted to declare war on America, you would look at our oil supply, as countries have always looked at the energy or food supply of any country that they have planned to invade. 
   I want to say this. I represent Fort Stewart. This week the 3rd Infantry Division starts on its third deployment to Iraq. General Lynch, the commanding general, just left on Tuesday. But back in Hinesville, Georgia, there are 318 memorial trees that have been planted in memory of 3rd Infantry soldiers who have lost their life in Iraq. I have gone to some of the ceremonies. It is a sad thing, but even as you leave the field, the memorial field, soldiers say, we want to complete this job. 
   I have visited soldiers in the hospitals in Baghdad and at Walter Reed and in Ramstein, Germany, in Landstuhl, and they all say they want to go back and finish the job. But I do not want to tell you that I can speak for the troops because there is thousands of them, and I always resent when people come here and say this is what the troops want, because the troops are just like the rest of America, we want a lot of things, and America is divided on this. 
   But I want to say to the Democrats, I think that you have done the right thing. This war has needed more oversight. I believe we as Republicans were remiss in not having more oversight. I think putting up goals in the form of what we would like the Iraqi Government to do, I think that that is fitting and proper, but I think to have hard and fast deadlines is unreasonable. 
   We, in this over 200-year constitutional government, cannot do things that we should do. Last year, for example, we were not able to pass a budget. We did not pass all of our appropriation bills. The important thing is the Republican Party, certainly as the majority party, we are guilty, but the point is we could not even do that in our own government. How do we expect the Iraqis to do it by an arbitrary date set? 
   So I recommend that we recommit this bill, hammer out some of the differences, and then bring it back to the floor in a different and improved product. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1591, U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and rise in opposition to the bill.  
   I want to say this: We have had a lot of good, sincere debates in the Defense Subcommittee of Appropriations, but one of the things that, in our honest disagreement about, that we have not talked about as much is the effects that the surge has already had. I wanted to bring up some statistics. 
   The 4 weeks prior to the surge which began on February 15, we had 1,440 civilian deaths; since that time, 265. That is a reduction of about 500 percent. 
   In terms of bombings, prior to the surge, we had 163. Then from February to March, it is down to 102. 
   Similar with car bombings, down 35 percent from 56 to 36. 
   The surge is already showing a significant impact. Two-thirds of the Iraqis polled by a British polling firm, 5,000 people which were sampled, the largest poll in the history of Iraq, two-thirds of the people say they are better off now than they were under Saddam Hussein. Seventy-three percent say they are not in a civil war. Al-Maliki, the Prime Minister's approval rating has gone from 29 percent in September to 49 percent now. 
   We are making progress. We are not defending the status quo. We are changing the course, and the Petraeus plan needs to be given time to work, and that is very, very important. 
   The second point that I want to make is there are so many extracurricular things in the $23 billion in spending that have nothing to do with the war in Iraq. Now, I serve on the Ag Committee, and I want to mention some of those. 
   There is a $100 million increase in the PL-480 program, but there is not a single word of it in the report as to why this is justified, why this is considered an emergency, $100 million. 
   Secondly, we have $25 million in there for spinach recall. The USDA did what they were supposed to do, but I want you to know you are setting a precedent for recall. We are not in the product compensation business on recalls. 
   Finally, we have $5 million in the bill because of a Canadian fish import issue. 
   All of these things are good, debatable topics, but they do not belong in an emergency appropriation bill. I think they should come back through the committee process on regular order where we can have a good debate and look at them on a separate piece of legislation.  
   While some of the provisions I support, such as the peanut storage and handling provision and some type of agriculture disaster assistance, this bill is not the appropriate place for them to be considered. 
   Title II-P.L. 480 Grants--The bill contains $100,000,000 above the President's request for Title II-P.L. 480 Grants. 
   There is not a single word of explanation in the report as to what or where the additional funds are to be used for. 
   The President's request included $350,000,000 of which approximately $150,000,000 would go to Sudan and for populations in Chad affected by the violence in Darfur; $30,000,000 for Afghanistan; $95,000,000 for Southern Africa; and $75,000,000 for the Horn of Africa. 
   Just last month the Congress included $1,215 billion for this program in the Joint Resolution to fund this program for the remainder of fiscal year 2007. 
   The bill provides $140,000,000 in additional relief for loses related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of which $25,000,000 would go to provide additional compensation to livestock producers and $100,000,000 would go to provide additional compensation for citrus producers--it appears that these additional funds are included in the bill only for the reason of doubling the $80,000 payment that livestock and citrus producers have already received, taking their payments up to $160,000. 
   The need for agriculture disaster assistance has been debated for the last several months. 
   While disaster assistance is clearly needed in some areas of the country, this bill provides $25 million for spinach producers who had losses due to a nationwide spinach recall last fall. 
   The FDA did what is was supposed to do, and initiated the recall to protect consumers. 
   This assistance is unprecedented, and there will be pressure put on this Committee to compensate producers whenever other food products are recalled. 
   Can you imagine the cost if we get in the business of compensating producers for losses that they incur because of food recalls? The latest list of some of the food recalls from FDA and USDA include: bread; peanut butter; corn chips; olives; oysters; milk; fresh cut fruit; summer sausage; ground beef; and the list goes on. 
   The reason foods were recalled is because they presented a health risk to the public, and the FDA or the USDA did what they were supposed to do. 
   The bill includes $5,000,000 for compensation to aquaculture operations who may have incurred a loss due to a restriction on imports from certain fish from Canada. 
   The emergency order, put on by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, on these fish from Canada was due to outbreaks or potential outbreaks of a destructive pathogen responsible for several large-scale fish deaths in the Great Lakes region--the reason APHIS put the order in place was to protect aquaculture in the Great Lakes states, and somehow $5,000,000 makes it into this bill to compensate for possible losses without any justification. Where did this number come from? 
   Finally, there are no funds for USDA to administer any of the disaster assistance provisions in the bill that total nearly $4,500,000,000. Members are already reacting to proposed FSA office closures that are occurring all over the country. This will only exacerbate the problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (CHARLIE W. NORWOOD LIVING ORGAN DONATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Thank you, Mr. Barton, and I thank Dr. Burgess for letting a noncommittee member go first. I appreciate the courtesy; and I wanted to thank Mr. Inslee for his help on this bill and all of the work and leadership by both parties on this. 
   If Charlie Norwood were here today, he would be sitting there and he would be embarrassed. He would be deflecting all of these sweet things that are being said about him. But if this bill was controversial and was having a tough fight, Charlie Norwood would be right in the middle of it and pushing it along and making sure it got done and standing up for the folks outside the 70,000-plus folks who are in line for an organ transplant right now. That is who he always answered to. 
   I remember the Norwood-Dingell bill on the Patients' Bill of Rights, how he did not appreciate the leadership in our party's position on it, so he went out and found alternative ways to get it done. And in that case, he cobbled together a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans to push his Patients' Bill of Rights because Charlie Norwood was a fighter, and he was always a fighter for a good cause. So it is fitting and proper for him to be recognized in this bill. 
   A couple of weeks ago I was at the University of Georgia, which is located in Athens, my hometown and in Charlie Norwood's district. And I met with Dr. Steve Stice. He told me he is doing a lot of work on stem cell, and he casually mentioned that the University of Georgia had cloned about 50 cattle and sheep. I could not believe they had cloned that many. 
   But as I listened to him and all of the technological breakthroughs that are happening in the world of science and medicine today, I think what lies out there in organ transplant, we have not even scratched the surface. There will be medical revolutions in the years to come because of the technology that is out there. 
   So our laws and what we are doing today is keeping the law current with the technology and with the science. That is why it is a good thing to do this. Think about Floyd Spence, our colleague from South Carolina, who had a lung transplant for 12 years, and our brave Charlie Norwood. Think about what they do; they educate the rest of us. 
   Our day in office for all of us will end. Either politically or biologically or for whatever reason, but what a great thing it is to have that service time in the House be used to hold a baton high that you can pass on to the next generation and have true national impact. That is what we are doing here today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Chairman, let me yield myself 1 minute, and maybe somebody will percolate and maybe they won't. 
   I wanted to make a comment. Mr. Hensarling had noticed that the earmarks were down. I think this is a good thing. I think that our job is going to have to be to make sure the earmarks stay down as this thing goes through the process, but I also think we need to be concerned about what can happen that will add costs to this bill. 
   It's interesting we just had a bill that had about 50 people vote against it. It was a popular bill that created a number of new programs, and I was thinking that so often on appropriation bill there's always a standard 100 to 150 people who vote ``no,'' and yet here was an authorizing bill, suddenly it's okay to spend money on an authorizing bill because it doesn't count. But on an appropriation bill, those same people who voted ``yes'' an hour ago will be voting ``no'' on the appropriation bill, except for Mr. Hensarling, who's pretty consistent on everything. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Chairman, I think I have one more in the wing. So let me again enlighten you with some of my wisdom, if I may yield myself 1 minute. 
   One of the amendments that we have been working on in this bill is the insistence that those who sell or contract to the Federal Government use Social Security verification. There's a program called the Basic Pilot Program, and we have that amendment in the bill. 
   I think it's important people realize that the idea is that if you're doing business with the Federal Government you should be in compliance with the law of the land, which is to have legal employees; and what this does is requires those vendors and sales corporations and contractors and subcontractors to show that they are in compliance by having Social Security verification. 
   I'm excited about this amendment. I think it's very important. President Clinton actually did the same thing February 13, 1996, by executive order; and I am hoping that if there's some problems with this amendment that as this bill moves through the process we may need to tinker with it a little bit but that we can keep the gist of it. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have no more speakers around, and I yield back my time.

   I want to say this is a major policy change. That is why we are here debating it. It is unfortunate we don't have a full Chamber. But the reason that I offer this amendment is because I think we should have the floor engaged on it, and we will have that opportunity tonight. 
   Number two, people are doing this. There are 1 to 3 million people who are buying Canadian drugs and drugs from other countries right now. If we are interested in safety, we will find a way to make this safe. This is a country that just invented the iFone, the iPod, the navigation system, and all this stuff. We can figure out how to make these drugs safe. 
   Finally, as Ms. Kaptur said, these are certified drugs made in the United States in most cases.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Chairman I yield myself 45 seconds. 
   Mr. Chairman, we are at a time right now when people are paying $3.10 for gas, $3.30 a gas. Gas is on the rise, and our options are limited. We are importing 60 percent of our oil. 
   It is ironic that on an Ag policy where 2 percent of the population is feeding all 100 percent, if we were importing 50 percent of our food, it would be a national security crisis, and yet oil, which is just as important, we are importing 60 percent of it. 
   During this time when we are in desperate need for alternative energy options, we should not increase the price of making cellulosic ethanol. And yet in the Ag bill, there was a clause that says if you are building an ethanol plant, you have to have prevailing wages, which drives up the cost of the plant and, therefore, drives up the cost of ethanol. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/4 minutes. 
   I wanted to say what we are talking about here is if a business goes and gets a loan, then the government, because it is a government loan, turns around then and basically dictates what they have to pay, and what they have to pay is a higher wage than it is in most communities. Otherwise, the Democrats would not be putting it in here. If this was about free enterprise, this clause would not be in the farm bill. 
   And my biggest gripe is that it is making energy costs go up because it is making the construction of alternative energy facilities higher. As Mr. King says, it is about a 20 percent bump in the cost of construction of a cellulosic ethanol plant. That's why I think it is a concern. 
   Who is going to pay for this? The consumers at the pump. And, in the meantime, there might be fewer alternatives. 
   In Georgia right now my good friend, Mr. Scott, knows we have three ethanol plants on the books, another two coming, and potentially 70 to 80 that will be built in the next 2 to 3 years. Now those are not all cellulosic ethanol plants, but why should we increase the cost of those? 
   I am excited about this because it does represent a new avenue in alternative fuels, and I don't think we should make anything increase the cost of that.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
   I want to say that I support this for two reasons. Number one, this bill will be vetoed by the President should it make it through the United States Senate, which is doubtful to begin with, but that's nothing we can control over here. But we know the President has sent out a veto message that the spending level is too high. 
   We have debated this in committee before. I offered a similar amendment that failed. But I think we need to be realistic. The bill that we're spending tonight is not realistic. 
   Number two, I want to point out something. This is actually not a 5.5 percent cut because it's not an $18 billion bill. It's really a $90 billion bill. However, because of what I would call negligence on the part of the House, practiced by Republicans and Democrats over the years, we have decided to put about three-quarters of this bill on automatic spending. We call it mandatory. Now, nothing is mandatory when you make the laws. Nothing is mandatory. So it's kind of lazy. It's just sort of ``spend as is.'' 
   And my friend from Connecticut has said that the gentleman from Ohio's amendment would actually take the nutrition and food programs away from children, yet most of them fall into this red category, which isn't even touched by his amendment. 
   His amendment is actually very conservative. It only affects about the $18 billion portion of this bill. And again, that's not where most of these food programs are, these critical programs. Now, I'm a believer that we should be debating both the red and the yellow portions of this bill and look at it realistically because this is a $90 billion bill, and the 5.5 percent only affects $18 billion. 
   And with that, I want to say that's why I think that it is important for us to always look into the authorizing side of a spending bill and the discretionary side. 
   I do support the amendment. And we have had this amendment, a similar amendment, in committee already. My friends on the committee have known my position on this. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, you know one thing that this Congress is not doing is sitting down and really trying to figure out where the Democrats and the Republicans agree on this energy challenge. ELIOT ENGEL and I 2 years ago sat down and wrote a bill called the DRIVE Act. We left off drilling and we left off cafe standards; and we asked, what is it that builds the most consensus? 
   That bill takes us off of Mid East oil by the year 2025. It is something that should come to the floor. It makes sense. It has a lot of commonsense things, like ending the tariff on imported Brazilian surplus ethanol. 
   Think about that for a minute. Brazil has surplus ethanol that they are ready to sell to us right now, and we have a tariff on it. It is absurd. That is just one component of the DRIVE Act that makes sense. And I request that we bring this bill to the floor of the House for a good bipartisan debate and hopefully a good bipartisan passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that this is a debate which so many of us feel passionately about on both sides. It is such a shame, though, that it was not allowed to go to committee. I hear over and over again how important this bill is and actually to both sides, proponents and opponents, yet no committee, no hearing, no amendments. It is a pity. I certainly hope that the Democrats do go back to their party's promise of last week and start opening things up. 
   Now, having said that, I wanted to make two points, and then I am going to extend my remarks. But there is no Federal law against embryonic stem cell research right now. Many people seem to think that this will allow something to happen that it doesn't. The debate is more about what types of lines. 
   Now, as you know, the President has approved research on 78 lines. Twenty-two of them are being used currently in Federal funding, and I have the list of where those 22 are, their locations, which I will submit to the RECORD.

The zeros entered in the ``Available'' column indicate that ``the cells failed to expand into undifferentiated cell cultures.''   
   Mr. Speaker, I also want to say that $200 million is being spent by private foundations and institutions on stem cell research, in addition to $39 million over at the National Institutes of Health; in addition to that $39 million, on nonhuman embryonic stem cell research, $96 million; on human nonembryonic stem cell research, $200 million; on nonhuman nonembryonic stem cell research, $273 million. This is very important. 
   The other thing that we keep hearing over again is that these are leftover embryos. In fact, of the 400,000 embryos which keep getting referred to, the RAND Corporation, which is nonpartisan, says only 11,000 have been designated for research, and of those they will probably yield 275 stem cell lines. 
   And why is that important? It is important because eventually you run out and then you start deciding to produce something. And I want to point out, England has already crossed this path. They have already voted on an H.R. 3, and today they are debating the hybrid stem cell creation of an animal-human embryonic stem cell. That is a debate going on in England today. So don't think that this bill will stay within the boundaries of the bill if it is passed.  
   My colleagues today will try to tell you that all of those against this bill are against science. That is just not the case. You can be pro-life and pro-science; the two are not mutually exclusive. To say we are anti-science is just a complete falsehood. 
   Stem cells are cells with the unique ability to divide and grow colonies of the specialized cells that make up the tissues and organs of the body. 
   Adult stem cells: unspecialized cells that can reproduce and mature into the specialized cells of the surrounding tissue. For example: Stem cells found in the heart can divide into more heart tissue cells. 
   Embryonic stem cells: unspecialized cells found in the early stages of an embryo that can reproduce and mature into the specialized cells of any organ or tissue in the body. For example: Stem cells found in the early stages of an embryo can divide into and create more cells of heart tissue, liver tissue, or any other tissue in the body. 
   Stem cells have been found in many tissues in the developed human body (adult stem cells), and are found in the largest quantities in the early stages of embryonic development in: the umbilical cord (cord cells), embryos (embryonic stem cells), and just this week, it was announced that stem cells have been discovered in the amniotic fluid (amniotic stem cells) that surrounds an unborn child in the womb. 
   A ``stem cell line'' is created by removing a cluster of cells from an embryo in its early stages of development. The embryo is destroyed and the cells are grown in a culture that under the right conditions will yield colonies of stem cells. Once the initial stem cells are isolated they can be manipulated to reproduce over and over again. 
   While the Democrats will try to make this a vote for or against embryonic stem cell research that is just a falsehood. There is no federal law against embryonic stem cell research. On August 9, 2001, President Bush announced that his administration would allow federal funding for research using the 78 approved lines. Of the 78 original derivations held to meet the August 9, 2001 criteria, there are now twenty-one embryonic stem cell lines available and in use.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, you know, it is time for the Democrat Party to lay out its plan for Iraq. I understand the echo chamber of liberalism is going to be teeing off on the President all week long. I understand that, because that is what has been going on for 6 months and, indeed, in some circles for a year. 
   There are 65 Members, in fact, of the Get Out of Iraq Now Caucus, and I actually have a lot of respect for them because they have a vision, they have a plan. The plan is: get out of Iraq. 
   Now there is no answer to the question: What happens then? What happens then when you have an American defeat internationally in the Middle East, when you turn over the third largest oil producing nation in the world to a terrorist state? What happens to the people over there who are pro-America or pro-democracy? They don't answer that question, and I understand that. 
   But for the other Democrats who are so enthusiastically piling on the President right now, and certainly I want to say as a Republican it has not been going well and we do need a new change in direction, but I would say to the majority party, put your plan on the table.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I wanted to say, I believe that the chairman of this committee has worked hard on this bill and done a good job, but I also know as a member of Appropriations that often things are thrust upon you as a committee member which may not have originated in the Appropriations Committee. I don't know if that's the case, but I would say here's four areas where we could go to come up easily with over 1 percent of this money. Four specific areas. 
   Number one is in the regulatory agencies. There have been increases above the request for the FTC, the FEC, the SEC and the CPSC, all agencies in which there is more money than requested. That's number one. 
   Number two, there's $300 million in election assistance for States, unauthorized. There's already $1 billion in unobligated funds from past appropriations bills. I did not like it when the Republican Appropriations Committee put this money out there for local election assistance because I don't think the Federal Government needs to stick its nose in that tent, because once the Federal Government gets involved in local State elections, it's a one-way street and we will have the federalization of elections. 
   The third spot. There's $80 million in unrequested SBA subsidy. Now, the particular program has been run unsubsidized. The folks borrow the money. They pay it back. We are now creating a new subsidy for the SBA, $80 million. 
   But the one that really bothers me the most is actually a presidential request. Now, my friend from New York has said no one has accused the President of being a big spender, but I will say to you, I agree with you. I believe the President has spent more money than the American people want him to and I believe we as Republicans spent more money than the American people wanted us to. And because I'm such a good friend of yours, I want to prevent you from making the same mistake. 
   The President has requested $300 million in the new campus at St. Elizabeth's for the Department of Homeland Security. I want my friends in the RSC to know this is a $3 billion, 10-year request to build a huge campus for the Department of Homeland Security. We did not fund this last year. We should all join together and say ``no'' to the Department of Homeland Security on this $3 billion campus which is sure to become worse than the CVC in cost overruns over time.

   Mr. KINGSTON. What this amendment does, Mr. Serrano and my fellow Members, it seeks to say that if you are doing business with the Federal Government, if you are a contractor building something or selling something to the Federal Government, then you should have a Social Security verification for your employees. This was inspired by two things: Number one, the fact that the American people have spoken. They do not want comprehensive immigration reform. They spoke so loudly and so well that even the United States Senate eventually heard their voices. 
   Now, we've heard their voices in the House and we have passed lots of immigration reform measures, such as fences, such as the REAL ID Act, some other things that we have put on all the bills on a bipartisan basis. What this says, though, is that if you're the contractor building the fence on the border, as we have had a real case, then you have to make sure that you have legal immigrants, legal people, working for you.     
   That's all it is. There are a lot of people who sell to the Federal Government in the school lunch program. There are a lot of people who work for the defense, a lot of people who work for these agencies, a lot of just different contractors who may have illegal aliens working for them on a Federal Government job, and the only thing that this does is says that those contractors have to be involved in the basic pilot program, which is a program in which technology enables these employers to check Social Security numbers for authenticity within about 90 seconds. 
   It's very simple, it's very clear. I hope that the gentleman will accept it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that we have to sustain this veto today. I think it's the right thing to do, because I think we need to go back to the drawing board on this. Number one, the President does have the constitutionally defined duty to fight wars, to direct the militia, particularly in a time of war, and I think that we are getting into a position where we have a lot of folks on Capitol Hill, perhaps as high as 535 of us, who think we can run the war more than the Commander in Chief. 
   I think we have to recognize that constitutionally the President has to do that. I think the President really has to veto this bill. It's as much for the preservation of the office as it is for his own personal views today. 
   I think, secondly, while the benchmarks themselves make sense, and there is a lot of bipartisan agreement on the benchmarks, there is also great division as to can these benchmarks be achieved by the dates outlined in the bill. 
   One of the things General Petraeus said to Congress last week is that the  new Government of Iraq, and keep in mind, this is the fourth election that they have had and the first permanent government, but one of the things they need, as much as anything, is our push. This bill serves to push them. But it also needs our assurance, our assurance that we will be with them through this process. 
   If you pointed out in 1870 would America be in a position to pass major civil rights legislation, we would not be at that point. The Government of Iraq might not be ready to bring in all the Baathists or to the level in which we would like to see it done by July or by October, and so I think that we have to give them a little more assurance that we're going to push you, but we're not going to pull the rug out from under you. 
   I think that we, on this committee, the defense committee, the Appropriations Committee, which historically is known for getting things done at the end of the day, often have friends say to me, as a Republican, but I often have the question asked to me, we know you're a Republican, and we know you can be partisan, but do you do things bipartisanly? 
   I am always proud to say, you know, the number one committee that I serve on, which I also think is the number one committee in the House, is a very bipartisan committee. Now, we will debate things, gun control, abortion, things, always are putting riders, environmental stuff, on our bill. Yet we clash about it in committee time and time again on ideological, principle-based positions. Yet at the end of the day, we know that the bill has to be passed, because if you don't get the appropriations train to the station, the government shuts down. 
   I think at this point, the Appropriations Committee can go back to the drawing board and come up with something that is still based in principle that both sides can respect. But it does put the troops forward, as we do have strong bipartisan basis to want to do right now, but it would also take care of some of the politics of Iraq and the diplomacy. For that reason, I think we have to vote to sustain the veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I am curious about this new day for the Democrat Party because in the budget that I have a little more control over or interest in, the Ag Committee, they have cut food stamps by $11 million. I want to make sure my Republican colleagues understand that. That is right. 
   We just heard from the Democrat leader that it is a new day and the Democrats, on their first day of this new day, have cut food stamps $11 million. 
   They have also, in this budget, cut conservation programs right and left. They cut, for example, the Equip Program. The Equip Program is a program designed to help farmers with conservation and watershed and water run off and nutrients going into streams. They cut it by $70 million. 
   On the conservation operations account, which is an account that helps farmers create habitat for wildlife, they cut that by $72 million. It helps with surface water retention so that we can reduce the impact of drought on farmers. They have cut that, again, $72 million. It also helps with nutrient management. 
   There is a small dams program that they cut by $74.2 million, which affects Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia, Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Oklahoma. And, Mr. Speaker, I am reading out these States so that the Democrat Members from these States can realize that they are, a vote for this bill is a vote to cut their own dams program in their own States by $74 million. 
   Now, we have also heard about energy independence. This account also cuts the biomass program in the USDA by $2 million. But don't think your taxpayers are going to get any of this money. Where does the money go? To the bureaucracy. The FDA, who only asked for a $20 million increase, gets $100 million under this omnibus bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Lewis, for the opportunity to speak on this bill. 
   I oppose the bill; and the reason why, Mr. Speaker, is I think it is very important for our constituents to understand. 
   Yes, there was a mandate in November as there had been a growing mandate throughout the year to get rid of earmarks. Now when my constituents supported the President's call to get rid of $18 billion worth of earmarks, what they thought he meant was reducing spending $18 billion. They do not want earmarks eliminated for the sake of taking them out of the hands of elected people and putting them in the hands of non-elected bureaucrats, yet that is what this omnibus bill does. 
   Now in the ag section, the total spending has gone from 100 to $150 billion down. That sounds like a good savings, some of it. You can argue, where did the savings come from?     
   One thing that was eliminated, $70 million in environmental quality incentive program, $44 million for conservation security programs. These are programs that help farmers, and they have a cost share. It helps farmers plan on environmental repairs, keeping nutrients out of flowing into streams, safe environmental practices on dairies like building lagoons, things like that. 
   The bill also eliminated $74 million in watershed and flood prevention, building small dams, and it eliminates $2 million from the USDA biomass program. Now at a time when we all want energy independence, eliminating the biomass program in the USDA doesn't make sense to me. 
   Also it eliminates $11 million in food stamp funding for the employment and training portion of food stamps. All important things. 
   But where does the money go? For one thing, it goes to the FDA bureaucrats. The FDA wanted about a $20 million increase. They get, under this bill, a $100 million increase, without a single committee hearing on it. 
   Again, though, it is not just that the FDA is getting money. It is that the taxpayers aren't getting money. Earmarks have been eliminated, but the money does not go back to the taxpayers. It simply goes to the bureaucracy. And that is why I think we should recommit this bill because we can do a better job.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, I rise and urge passage of H. Res. 684, congratulating Shawn Johnson on her recent national championship in women's artistic gymnastics. Just this year, Shawn has won the all-around competition at the Pan American Games, the American Cup, the national championship and the world championship. She has appeared on ``ABC World News Tonight,'' ``The Ellen DeGeneres Show'' and at a gala for Pink With a Twist, a group that fights cancers among women. 
   She has been honored with Shawn Johnson Day in Iowa, with the Longines Prize for Elegance, and as ABC's Person of the Week. All this for a 15-year-old, 4-foot 8, 88-pound high school sophomore who sometimes finds time to walk dogs at shelters and serves as a ball girl for her school's football team. 
   She never bothered to crawl, according to her mother, Terri Johnson. At 9 months old she simply arose and began to walk. At age 3, her mother enrolled her in gymnastics class ``just to channel all her energy,'' her mom said. I think it's important to point out that it was her mom who drove her so many times to so many practices, because with all great athletes, we have to acknowledge that the parents play such a great role in it. 
   At the age of 6, she showed up at Qiao Gymnastics in Des Moines, where Qiao was working. A former top gymnast from China, Qiao had come to the United States to study English at the University of Iowa. Although her first coach said that she had more raw strength than gymnastic ability, Coach Qiao saw her potential immediately and worked hard to nurture that talent. 
   This means long and busy days for Shawn. After school, she heads to the gym for a 4-hour workout, then home to do school work. Yet, she maintains a 4.0 average. Unlike traditional gymnasts, artistic gymnastics traditionally has not been a sport where 15-year-olds excel. It combines the disciplines of gymnastics and ballet, and few athletes as young as Shawn have been able to master it.     
   But through hard work, discipline and the ability and the tutelage of a good coach, she has already made her mark as one of the world's greatest gymnasts. With Pan Am, national and world titles behind her, Shawn now points towards 2008 to the summer Olympics to be held in Beijing. ``I think it would be cool, not only for me, but for him,'' she said, ``and I think it would be a proud moment for both of us.'' 
   What I want to say to my colleagues is this is a special young woman and one that I know everyone in Iowa has a lot of pride in, but everybody in the United States shares in that pride, and I urge passage of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Sid Flowers, John Sidney Flowers, was a good friend of mine. He was a friend of many people, as he had served in office for so many years in the State of Georgia. His wife, Nan, is a friend; his daughters Kay and Darcy have been friends over the years. It is just one of the great families that does so much for a community and makes a community what it is. 
   Sidney was actually the Solicitor General for Liberty County for over 32 years. This is the home of Fort Stewart, in Hinesville, Georgia, a military town where there is lots of turnover. You need people who kind of know the history of the community, and that was Sid Flowers. He did so much for so many. 
   There are many times when people said they would be eating with Sid Flowers, eating lunch, and a group of soldiers would come in who maybe were new in town, maybe not. There are thousands of soldiers stationed at Fort Stewart, and Sidney would quietly walk over to the cashier, pick up the tab for the soldiers, pay for their lunch, and then ask the cashier not to tell them who paid for it.     
   That is the kind of guy he was. 
   Sydney was actually elected as a Republican, and many people know 35 years ago in the State of Georgia, there was almost a nonexistent Republican Party. And to be elected as a Republican, you had to be a pretty good guy, probably somebody who could get elected in either party, and somebody who was liked and had support from both parties.

   One thing you can always count on in Washington is whenever we pass any legislation, it's always going to be in the name of the children, or the seniors or Mama or puppies or clean air or all things small and beautiful. In fact, the Speaker of the House the other day used the word ``children'' in her speech 44 different times, because politicians are always altruistic with other people's money. 
   Now, the SCHIP program was designed to help the working poor, not to help people who make $82,000 a year, who might not be rich, but they are certainly not poor. It is designed for American children. It wasn't designed for illegal aliens and yet the Democrats have thrown out the citizenship test. That's the last thing we need is more benefits for illegal aliens. 
   And then there will be 780,000 adults on this program. This is the children's health care program. While the Democrats will tell you, well, that's only 30 percent, it should be 100 percent children.

Well, although that vote passed the House, it failed in the Senate, and we know the surge did take place and the surge has paid off. Civilian casualties in Iraq are down 20 percent; 75 percent in Baghdad. IED attacks are down by 50 percent, and we've nearly doubled the number of weapon caches that have been discovered this year from last year. Lots of good progress has been made. 
   And I don't blame the folks who are against Iraq for pushing the bill back in January that they did. I believe that there's plenty of room for honest disagreement on this war. But at the same time, here we are now and we need to continue funding for that war. There is a $50 billion bridge fund. The President actually has asked Congress for $196 billion, but Congress has indicated $50 billion is all that we're willing to go at this point. But then there are some stipulations, some micromanagement of the war. 
   I hope that we can have this bill on the floor of the House and have an honest debate on it and keep the spirit of agreeing to disagree agreeably.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and wanted to point out that yesterday we passed Soap Box Derby Appreciation Day. And I guess that's fitting because that must be the Democrat idea to conserve oil and look for alternatives, because at the rate gas prices are going, we will all be driving soap box cars that are powered by feet. 
   Look at the gas prices. When the Pelosi regime took over the House of Representatives, gas prices were $2.33 a gallon. Now, they promised to reduce those prices; yet a funny thing happened on the way to the pump. It is now about $4 a gallon. Well, I guess if that's indicative of the promises that the Democrats keep and the way they deliver it, maybe it's right that yet again today we are ignoring any serious legislation that would address gas prices. 
   You know, it's interesting. It's been over 10 years since President Clinton vetoed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. Now, I want to put this in perspective for you. Remember, Alaska is twice as big as Texas. The reserve area is the size of South Carolina. The potential exploration area is about 2,000 acres. 
   Now, a word picture would be that if the Arctic wildlife reserve was a basketball court, the proposed exploration area is a business card. And yet, the radical extremists in the liberal community are afraid to drill there. 
   I just got back from a bipartisan trip to the Middle East. We met with oil ministries from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. And you know what they said?

   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, Winston Churchill said, ``The United States of America always does the right thing after it has exhausted all the other alternatives.'' 
   And what we are doing here tonight, through the Democrat Party, is exhausting all the other alternatives. 
   This bill is wrong for a number of reasons. First of all, the Democrat leadership promised to cut out the pork and nondefense spending and give us a clean bill. But this bill contains minimum wage legislation, children's health care appropriations, $31 million for milk subsidies, $460 million for food aid, much of that not even going to the  Middle East, $40 million for grain storage, $37 million for new computers for the FSA in Kansas City, $4 million for the Office of Women's Health, and $15 million for livestock subsidies. 
   What does this have to do with Iraq? Not a thing. 
   And yet some of this stuff may have a lot of merit and get bipartisan support. But why not bring it up on the proper pieces of legislation, not on a military aid bill? 
   It's interesting, one of the Democrat Senators actually justified the nonmilitary spending saying, ``But the Republicans did it.'' And I agree with her. She's right. We did it. And that's why we are in the minority. The American people are tired of these kind of shenanigans. 
   Let's pull these items out and have a debate on their own merits, not on the backs of soldiers in Iraq. 
   Let's talk about Iraq. The Constitution, article I, section 2, says, and I quote, ``The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States and of the militia of the several States when called into the actual service of the United States.'' 
   In other words, the President, as Commander in Chief, runs wars, not 535 arm chair generals on Capitol Hill. 
   But this legislation, or surrender document, usurps the President's constitutional prerogative. For this reason alone we should reject it. 
   And finally, let's talk about the gist of this surrender. Putting a timeline on a war is great if the enemy agrees with it. But for some reason, they never do. Never in the history of war has a country won by announcing their surrender date to the world. It's odd, it's reckless, and it won't work. 
   We should not micromanage this war. We should do as Winston Churchill said and do the right thing. 
   And I urge a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk a little bit about my dad. My dad is 89 years old. He has never owned a credit card. He has never even had a digital telephone. He doesn't have a computer. He doesn't have Internet. He is not interested in any of it. And yet, as removed as he might be from computer technology on a day-to-day basis, as it would appear in his personal life, the truth of the matter is, no one is isolated from high tech today.     
   His veterans payments, his Social Security payments, his bank transfers, his Medicare, all of this comes to him through computer networks. If anybody messes up those computer networks, my 89-year-old dad will not get the services that he needs. That's why this is so important today. 
   Today there are some 64,000 hacker programs that are available to consumers for free. In addition, there are 12,000 that if you pay $1,000 for them, you get 1 year's support. Support for a hacker program, can you imagine that. And America's computers are absolutely under siege. 
   I am proud that in 2002 Armstrong Atlantic University in Savannah, Georgia, began its Regional Center for Cybersecurity Education and Training. This was part of the G-8 Summit which was held in Savannah, Georgia, in 2004, and they played a key role in the law enforcement efforts surrounding the G-8. 
   Since then, Armstrong Atlantic University has taken on partners of Washington Group International and Bridgeborn, and they are offering all kinds of computer security training programs, from simulating and modeling to visualization, covert channels, cybersecurity and security of networks. 
   Why is this important? Now, Mr. McCaul said there are 200 million U.S. citizens connected to the Internet. It is even more than that. The numbers of people with access have increased over 182 percent from 2000 to 2005. In 2006, total nontravel-related spending on the Internet is estimated to be over $100 billion. That is a 24 percent increase over 2005. In 2005 the FBI has estimated that American businesses lost $67 billion because of computer crime, and that number of $67 billion in 2005 has moved to over $105 billion in 2007. 
   The United States is the location of 40 percent of the known command-and-control servers; and because of that, we are the target of attack after attack. Most of these are executed by botnets, which are a collection of broadband-enabled PCs hijacked during virus and worm attacks and seeded with software that connects back to a server to receive communications from a remote attacker. In other words, the botnets all work together to simultaneously and consistently and constantly attack computer networks, such as the Department of Defense, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Department of Energy. 
   In fact, in America our governmental computers alone get millions of attacks each and every day. It is something that we all should be very concerned about. The United States was the top country for malicious activity, making up over 31 percent of the worldwide total. 
   Personal information, for example, on veterans in May 2006 was taken home with a Veterans Administration employee, and 26 million veterans had their own personal information compromised simply because one employee took a laptop home. Now 25 years ago that may have required a truckload to carry that many files home. But just think about it, all he did was take a laptop home. And if the employee's house had not been broken into and the laptop stolen, we still might not have known about it. The Department ended up spending $200,000 a day just to operate a call center to explain to veterans how this might affect their service. Of course, there are class action lawsuits that have followed, and there will be a lot more discussion about that. 
   In September 2000, a 16-year-old young man in Florida intercepted 3,300 e-mails from one Department of Defense operation. He also stole 13 NASA computers. 
   In February 2001, Gary McKinnon of London took a poorly secured Windows system of NASA and the Pentagon and 12 other military operations and caused almost $1 million worth of damage by just basically playing around. 
   We know that in March 2007 Max Ray Butler, a 27-year-old computer expert  working as an FBI informant was indicted on 15 criminal counts for allegedly hacking into the U.S. Department of Defense Air Force and other computer-sensitive systems.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, it's interesting to hear the Democrats flail around for reasons that they won't put energy issues on the floor. I agree with the preceding speaker. Let's talk about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Let's talk about offshore drilling. We haven't moved a single appropriation bill because of the fear that we may have an amendment on offshore drilling. 
   Now the President has lifted his ban, and what we hear from the Democrats is it will take 10 years, it will take 20 years. It means two things: number one, they agree there's oil out there; number two, there's a discussion about how long it will take. 
   But my question to them is where are your electric cars? Where are your hybrids that suddenly are going to save us? Those are also going to be 10 years down the road. 
   We need to put it all on the table. We need to look at conservation, we need to look at alternative energy, and we need to drill. It is that simple. You have got to have a three-legged stool to answer the energy situation. And I don't know why the Speaker of the House is afraid to put it on the floor. That is right. There will not be a debate on it because the Democrats are afraid to put it on the floor. 
   I say let's have an up-or-down vote on all of these issues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Well, I will tell you what. Also, you and I know people across America will lose that family tax deduction for the children, which is very important. 
   But I wanted to get into the perspective of a business person, but the way I explain tax increases to school kids, it seems that maybe it should apply to some of these bureaucrats here in Washington, D.C. But yesterday I was speaking to a group called the People to People Exchange, a student ambassador program. And I asked for a volunteer. A young lady who had a job, a young girl who was, I guess, in about the ninth grade named Tracy, she works at Holton's Restaurant in Midway, Georgia. Tracy makes $5.50 an hour. So I got her up in front of the class, and this was an extracurricular thing. They were actually meeting on a Sunday afternoon. And I said, Okay, Tracy, so you work for 2 hours, $5.50 an hour. After those 2 hours, you bring home $11. And she looked at me like, You really are stupid in Washington, you know I don't do that. 
   I said, How much do you bring home? 
   She said, Well, it is about nine something. 
   So I said, Okay. Let us just say for 2 hours' work you bring home $9 and you send $2 to me in Washington. Now, what do I do with that tax money? 
   And, of course, these students know you pay for schools, you pay for roads, you pay for our military. And, Mr. Davis, you know Midway. You probably have eaten at Holton's Restaurant. It is right down from Fort Stewart, where you were stationed. Have you eaten there?

   Mr. KINGSTON. Well, they have a good fish and shrimp platter that is waiting just for you. It has got your name on it. 
   Anyway, I said to Tracy, Okay, for the $2 that we get from you that goes to the soldiers at Fort Stewart, goes to the schools, to the building, to the teachers, goes to the roads, goes to the police officers, you are okay with those things because we all agree we need them? 
   And she says, Yes, sir. 
   And I said, Okay. Now, if you know I could do it for $1.50, would you want that extra 50 cents or would you let me have it? Because, you know, if I had that extra 50 cents from you, I could spend money. I could go out and maybe improve some health care and take care of some farm programs. And who knows? I might even get a little bit more of the Federal Government dollars down to our part of the State. 
   She didn't like that idea. She felt like she could manage her 50 cents better than we could in Washington, D.C. And I serve on the Appropriations Committee, and I have to say for a high school girl, she is certainly accurate. She can manage her money better than we can manage her money. And yet we have this attitude in Washington that if something is going to happen, government has to be the one to initiate it. So we want the whole $2. 
   And the interesting thing that you have already underscored night after night is that if we let her keep that extra 50 cents, taking less of her $2 in taxes, what is she going to do? She and all the other millions of Tracys and millions of other people like the six Davis kids who will one day be working, they would go out and they might buy more hamburgers, more shoes, more clothes, more tires, more dryers, more washing machines, go out to eat more. And when they do, small businesses react by expanding. They increase their inventory. Then they have to have more people to sell their inventory; so they hire more people. Less people are on welfare. More people are paying taxes. And so the money comes into Washington, D.C. Small businesses win. People who are working win. And the government, at the end of the day, gets more revenue. That has been the case now with George Bush, Ronald Reagan, and John F. Kennedy. 
   Tax cuts, giving the people the right to keep more of their own hard-earned money actually brings in more revenue. Therefore, to let these tax breaks end and increase taxes on small businesses and on families across America is an absurd policy. And we have got to get folks motivated to realize that this is something that is going to happen unless people back home start raising Cain about it. 
   So I am glad you are doing what you are doing. And I wanted to yield back because I know we have some other speakers here, but I thank you for your leadership on it.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (SUPPORT THE DRIVE ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to speak about House Resolution or House bill 670, which is a bill called the DRIVE Act; that is, the Dependency Reduction through Innovative Vehicle and Energy Policy. 
   It is a bill that ELIOT ENGEL and I have cosponsored. It has almost an equal number of Democrats and Republican cosponsors, up to about 60. And its goal is to reduce your oil consumption by 20 percent in 20 years. What we did is sat down and said, how could we achieve that goal and do something for national security, something for the environment, and something for mom and dad back home and their pocketbook? 
   So we set out to try to stay true to those goals. We put fourth four things in it. To change consumer habits, we have doubled the tax credit for purchase of hybrids, flex fuel vehicles, and biodiesel, anything that would drive on something besides gasoline. 
   Secondly, we have sent a message to Detroit that we would like to see 80 percent of the cars made in 10 years be at least flex fuel so that Wall Street will also follow suit and invest in flex fuel vehicles and hybrids and ethanol, things like that. If Wall Street knows that the government is behind it and the market is going to be there, then the investment dollars will follow. 
   Too often what happens when the price of gasoline goes up, everyone rushes out and looks at alternatives; then when the price of gasoline goes down, everybody forgets all about it. We want to have a permanent investment stream from Wall Street. That is why it is a good method when you follow what we did with air bags, the air bag model. 
   Thirdly, we require the government to start scoring based on energy consumption. When the government goes out and buys fleets of vehicles, we want to know, are you buying innovative vehicles, flex fuels, hybrids and so forth. We believe it is important for the Federal Government to have a goal. 
   One thing I point out, which is not in the bill; but we deliver on Saturday, mail which is 30 percent of the volume that you have Monday through Friday, but we use 100 percent of the fuel. So it would make sense if you are in the business place to quit delivering mail on Saturday. 
   I understand that has some political ramifications, and thinking with our political minds instead of our business minds. I just say that is an example. Finally, we believe that a lot more research has to be done. But I want to point out, Mr. Speaker, that Toyota is already on their fourth-generation hybrid. 
   Unfortunately, many of the Detroit American motor companies are not that far along. But there is a lot coming down the pike. The University of Georgia, for example is making ethanol out of sweet potatoes, left-over Coca Cola and watermelon. There are all kinds of ways to make ethanol in addition to using corn. 
   These are the things that our bill does. You know, in Washington it is actually easy to agree to disagree. My friend, Mr. Miller and I, we have no problem disagreeing agreeably. But what we need to do is agree to agree, which is much harder. Because when Republicans and Democrats agree to agree, we make progress, and sometimes the interest groups that surround us from both parties really do not want that, because they are not as empowered as they are when we are fighting.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (SELECT INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT PANEL -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, I wanted to raise one premise that no one has talked about, and that is this blind belief in everything the 9/11 committee says, and apparently individual Members as well. 
   The 9/11 Commission was a bipartisan group of good people, some who served in the House. They are intelligent people who have been involved in public policy, but I am not aware that they were top-notch CIA or FBI or intelligence community members. I don't know of them having risen up through the ranks of the intelligence circles or the antiterrorism circles that makes them absolutely experts on everything on what is now a 2 1/2 -year-old report. 
   I wanted to bring that up because I think it is important when you consider that when the 9/11 Commission came out, this Congress on a bipartisan basis implemented 39 out of the 41 recommendations. We did not implement all the recommendations, but we had hearings on them and they were bipartisan and there was a lot of discussion, unlike what we have here today. What we have here today is a recommendation, a recommendation not made by the 9/11 Commission but, from what I am hearing, one Member wandering around the Hall said, Yeah, this is a good idea. Now, that is hardly the way to make a major step in the way we approach intelligence in the House. It doesn't make sense at all. 
   This bill today has not had a hearing. The Rules Committee did not hear of any amendments that could or would be offered or debated. I think, frankly, the thing that is ironic, and I have got to say as I see over there many of my very good friends, many institutionalists, people who have great respect for the institution, you know that on intelligence we have generally been bipartisan here in the Capitol. Certainly there are times when intelligence like everything else devolves into partisanship, but generally speaking we have  conducted this body in the wake of 9/11 itself in a bipartisan manner, and yet today we don't have that. We do not have those amendments which people could come together on. 
   So I just wanted to raise that because, as I sit as an Appropriations Committee member on the Defense Subcommittee, and I sit there and I listen to so many people like Mr. Obey, Mr. Murtha, Mr. Lewis, and Mr. Young, the folks I would consider the sage folks in the back room who at the end of the day do the pragmatic thing and put the best interests of the Nation forward, in this particular case that has not been allowed to happen. So I find myself a little perplexed by this because it has not been thoroughly vetted, and I am going to vote ``no'' on it because of the process itself. 
   Now, there are a lot of other issues that are important, and it is important to me that the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, the Homeland Security, of the Rules Committee, of the Intelligence Committee, and the Foreign Affairs Committee, and the Judiciary Committee are all resoundingly against this. 
   Madam Speaker, I have in my hand a ``Dear Colleague'' letter which I have read and reviewed, and I submit for inclusion into the RECORD that has been written by them, and I think the points that they have raised are very, very important.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats took over the House, the price of oil was $59 a barrel. Today it's $100 a barrel. 
   Now, I don't blame that on Democrats, but I have got to say that where is your energy bill? Where is your alternative fuels bill? I thought that in this green, ``don't leave a footstep'' or whatever it is the Speaker has promised that we were all going to be riding hybrids. But it has not happened under them. 
   I have cosponsored a bipartisan bill with Eliot Engel that does have tax credits for buying hybrids, flex-fuel vehicles. It gives the automobile companies tax credits for making more of them. It gives the gasoline stations money to transfer to be fuel stations so that they can sell biodiesel and ethanol and hydrogen, whatever it would take to get us off Middle East oil. But the Democrat Party has shown no interest in ending our dependency on Middle East oil, and that is a national security concern of all Members, and we need to do something about it. 
   I call on the Speaker to move a serious energy bill that addresses the high, soaring cost of fuel.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I want to say from the beginning I am supporting the Republican budget. And I do find it ironic that a Congress that just distributed a one-time $1,200 per household tax credit is now going to turn around and raise taxes by $3,155 per household. It doesn't make sense. And for that reason, I'm planning to vote ``no'' on the Democrat tax increase budget and support the Republican alternative. 
   But also I wanted to speak specifically about the earmark portion. I'm a member of the Appropriations Committee, and I realize that if you are a member of one party, you might not always disagree with the members of the other party. For example, if you are a Democrat right now, you might not be in complete agreement with the Bush budget. Likewise, if you're a Republican, should a President from another party get elected, you might not agree with their budget all the time. Therefore, it is important for equal branches of government to have a say-so in the construction of a budget. 
   Within that framework, it is often important that Congress have the ability to earmark. However, I want to say that, as a Republican, earmarking got out of control under our Republican watch. We know that for a fact. Any Republican who is denying that probably has his head in the sand. And I want to give Democrats credit. They have tried to reform earmarks. However, unfortunately, the reforms haven't been apparent, they haven't been given the credit, and they haven't been enough. We still have work to do. 
   Therefore, I am supporting the Kingston-Wamp-Wolf approach, which is to call for a bipartisan, bicameral select committee to review earmarks, with a moratorium for the time period that the select committee is in existence. And I know that ours isn't, the moratorium is lifted when they come back, report back to Congress. In this bill there's a 1-year moratorium. But I think either way you can take a step back and look, what is the process and how can we improve it? 
   Because as an appropriator, we are always focused on appropriations earmarks, and yet the infamous Bridge to Nowhere did not come from an appropriations bill. It came from a transportation bill. 
   In December 2006, we passed a tax relief bill that had, I think, over 100 different types of earmarks on it. But because it was a tax bill, they weren't defined as earmarks. We see the same thing in trade bills. I believe that all earmarks should be put on the table and the process should be reviewed. And that should include the White House earmarks. That is why it is important for us, on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, to take a step back and see what we can do to improve this. We all agree earmarks should not increase a budget but work within the existing budget limits passed by Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I want to commend the members of the Ag Committee on a  bill that is well put together in some parts. As the chairman knows, he has been very generous with his time, talking to me about the cotton section, the peanut section, and fruits and vegetables. I think there was a lot of good bipartisan support. I commend the committee for that. 
   Unfortunately, so much of this bill is not direct agriculture. So much of this bill, 60 to 70 percent, and this is true with all farm bills, it is the entitlement section, the school nutrition programs, there are a number of problems I have with that. 
   Number one, this tax increase is to support an increase in the entitlement section. It doesn't go directly to farmers or help the dirt farmer. It is not intended for that. 
   I have problems with the tax increase, and I do think it should have been gone through the Ways and Means Committee where it could have been thoroughly vetted and people could have decided what does this mean, because the truth of the matter is there are question marks on both sides. 
   The second thing, in agriculture appropriations we have had lots of hearings on the Indiana privatization of food stamps. I think it is a great program. I think reducing the government bureaucracy so that you can get more money to the people who need the food stamps, I think that is a good fundamental idea. I think it is one that President Clinton would have appreciated. It is searching for the third way. Not always a Democrat or Republican solution is adequate; you have to come up with something else. This is a hybrid program. This is a privatization program, and I know that is a bad thing for many on the fringe left, but I think most of us in the ag community will agree that it is a good thing. And yet this bill stops that. 
   The third thing is the special-interest payoff to the unions. Can you imagine, here we are at an energy crisis time. It is $3.05 if you shop all over town to find the bargain, and we are going to increase the cost of producing ethanol. We are going to say if you build an ethanol plant, you have to use the highly inflated union prevailing wages. It is a special payoff to the unions. We should not increase the price of producing energy during a fuel crunch. It is that simple. This bill does that. 
   Finally, one of the things that we all do, Republicans and Democrats, we want to balance the budget. We want to cut out the waste, as long as it is done in a different district than ours. 
   Now, the farm service agencies, there are too many of them. There are 58 that don't even have staff. This bill prevents them from being closed. We need to close some of the farm service agencies. Because of technological changes, we can do that without hurting the farmers, and yet this bill will prevent that from happening. One thing we are all hypocrites on is, hey, let's balance the budget; but, oh, not here where we have an opportunity to balance the budget. I think that is something that is ill conceived. I know there is bipartisan resistance on that, and it is very difficult for all of us. 
   I have four farm service agencies in my district that are being closed; and I tell you, it is tough. I hate to see any of them closed, but I realize in the big picture if you want to save money for the farmers for other programs, sometimes you have to make these decisions.

   This month the Third Infantry will start its third deployment to Iraq. And as they go over there, certainly they know what is going on in Washington in terms of the debate. But I think it is real important that we don't send a signal to our men and women in harm's way that what they are doing is irrelevant, that we can't win, and that because Bush might be a President whose policies aren't perfect that we need to withdraw. 
   In fact, I think what we should do is reaffirm on a bipartisan basis that we support the troops. We want to get them all the up-armored vehicles that they need, the Cougars, for example, blue tracking, the advanced night vision goggles. We should say on a bipartisan basis, we want to give them absolutely all the military hardware that they need to win the war. And then, in a separate debate, have the discussion of what an alternative is, where is the plan of the Bush critics and what is the price of pulling out. And I think we need to make that statement.

   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I wanted to say, Mr. Speaker, as I listen to this debate tonight, I am reminded of my old alley cat, Hercules. When I was growing up in Athens, Georgia, I had a mean, tough cat. He was an alley cat who basically adopted me. You know, we humans don't really adopt cats. Athens, Georgia, kind of a hilly, foothills Appalachian town with ivy bank. In the ivy bank, we had lots of cute little chipmunks. 
   Hercules, being tough and could be the bully, could be somewhat like the majority party in some respects in that he was the alpha cat of the neighborhood. He would catch chipmunks at will. He would usually kill them and  eat them, dispensing of them quickly. But every now and then, and it is an interesting thing about cats, it is not unique to my cat, but he would catch a chipmunk and he would toy with it awhile. He would just play with it. 
   You would think: Did he have a change of heart? Is he going to let this chipmunk go? No, he would just play with it awhile. 
   Well, that is what is going on tonight. We are hearing a lot of discussion, a lot of administration bashing about how cruel the White House is and a lot of lamenting about the Republican Party, and a lot of talk about compassion for the farmers and the rural communities and schools. There has been talk about the horrors of fire, drought and windstorm. 
   And yet as we look at the rule that is governing this bill, which would be known as H. Res. 387 in the House Calendar No. 59, introduced by Ms. Slaughter, of New York, if we turn to page 3, section 4, we read the fine print. And it says: ``Sec. 4.(a) In the engrossment of H.R. 2206, the Clerk shall-- 
   ``(1) await the disposition of H.R. 2237 and H.R. 2207; 
   ``(2) add the respective texts of H.R. 2237 and H.R. 2207, as passed by the House, as new matter at the end of H.R. 2206; 
   ``(3) confirm the title of H.R. 2206 to reflect the addition of H.R. 2237 and H.R. 2207, as passed by the House, to the engrossment,'' which as the Speaker knows and followed very closely, what this means is this is Hercules toying with the chipmunk. 
   It means there is not a disaster bill at all. It just means the majority party is toying with a disaster bill, because what happens, this goes right back to the President attached to the war funding bill. 
   Here is my point, Mr. Speaker. If all these things are true, why is the majority party toying with a disaster? We are right back where we started from. We have just jumped out from the war funding bill only temporarily for I guess some purpose of voting here, and I understand politics, you can't remove that from the House of Representatives, but the reality is we are toying with a disaster bill because we already know two things: All the gobbledygook on page 4 that the Clerk shall do means this bill gets rejoined with the military funding bill. That is a fact. 
   Number two, the President has already said he is going to veto the military funding bill, and one of the reasons is because of the extracurricular, nonmilitary items that are being added to it. 
   So what I would say to Hercules, if you were worried about that little old chipmunk, you really would let it go. And I would say to the majority party, if you really were sincere about disaster relief, you would separate it from this rule, this H. Res. 367 introduced by Ms. Slaughter of New York and say, you know, we are going to have an up-or-down vote on a straight, freestanding separate disaster bill so that the farmers and ranchers and people out west can get the relief that we have heard over and over again on a bipartisan basis that they need so badly.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's just say that the critics of the war, and I don't mean the Members of the House, but the critics in the general public who often say ``Bush lied'' and put up posters to that effect and they bring in Halliburton and Blackwater and bumper stickers that say ``No War for Oil,'' let's say all that is true, absolutely true, that everything was a trick to get us there, and just say we can agree with that, and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry never made the statements that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which, of course, they did make those statements. 
   But if all that was the case, regardless, we are there and we are there now. 
   I met with the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq today, and he said, in fact, the surge is working. And maybe he has a view that might be suspect by some. But I have also spent a lot of time this week looking at a report of indexes in Iraq put out by the Brookings Institute, which, as you know, is left of center. But they track the number of civilian deaths, the number of IED attacks. They track the number of newspapers and radios, economic and political progress. They track the benchmarks, revenue sharing, oil sharing, and elections and so forth. And in that there is a glimmer of hope that is important to know that there is some progress that is being made. 
   But I think between the Brookings Institute and the Prime Minister's report, there is a very bleak picture; but it is a picture nonetheless that progress is being made. 
   If you pass this legislation today, you wouldn't just erode that progress. You would sign a death sentence to people like this Prime Minister and his family. Now, I agree that the Republican Party probably lost the majority in the House because of the war as much as anything else, but for us that is just politics. It is a political death. For the people over there that we are helping, this is real death. What would happen to this Deputy Prime Minister if we pulled out, and what would happen to all the other Iraqis who have been there trying to take a step forward as Sunnis, as Shiites, as Kurds, trying to work together in a cooperative agreement? Do the proponents of this bill believe that Iraq would suddenly say to them, Okay, you all can go home; we are going to switch governments? If this passed, there would be more chaos and a civil war that we have never seen before in the Middle East, and it would spill over to other countries in the Middle East. 
   One of the things the Prime Minister said that Americans have failed to understand is there is a cultural shift going on in the Middle East right now, and it is not unique to Iraq, and that is that al Qaeda is becoming a mainstream group. Al Qaeda and an Islamic radical fundamentalist movement with sights on the West is growing. 
   If we withdraw from Iraq, it is victory to them. A defeat means it is not just going to stay in Iraq, but the momentum probably would go to Israel next. It would probably encourage the Iranians to get nuclear. Saudi Arabia would follow suit. They would need to have nuclear weapons, and Jordan. The good, the bad, and the ugly in the Middle East would happen. 
   The previous speaker said the troops did win the war. I agree. But we have not finished the war. We should vote this down and give Petraeus time, which is very much needed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I thank the chairman. 
   We just heard from the majority leader that this bill fully funds the troops. He is correct, it fully funds the troops; but it doesn't freely fund the troops. It is like giving a soldier a brand-new uniform and then shackling his foot to an anvil. And that anvil, Mr. Speaker, is politics. Our soldiers fight wars. They cannot take care of Iraqi politics. And yet this bill puts 17 different stipulations on that funding for our soldiers, to say that if these aren't taken care of, then you lose your funding. So it is not fully funding them, because it doesn't freely fund them. 
   We went to Iraq. We made some mistakes. We all on a bipartisan basis, from John Kerry to Hillary Clinton to George Bush, thought there were WMDs over there. There were not. We also thought that once they were liberated, that because of American presence and ingenuity and Saddam Hussein being deposed, that democracy would rise from the ashes. It obviously did not, much to the disappointment of everybody in the world community. 
   And I can say this as a member of the Defense Committee, we have had 4 years of almost ``happy talk'' from representatives of the Pentagon. It has been very disappointing. Representatives not of defense as much as from the political side of things. 
   But I know one thing that is true: since the surge, there has been a glimmer of hope that we have rounded a corner. But I want to say this: it is very important that Members understand that failure in Iraq means that it devolves into a civil war. It means that perhaps it emerges as an anti-Western nation state of terrorists with their hands on the second largest oil reserve in the world, and surely those revenues will not be spent promoting democracy around the globe. 
   It would also mean a decline in U.S. credibility, because if we lose, as the Senate Democrat majority leader Harry Reid has said, who wins? Well, al Qaeda wins. The nation isn't going to just quietly go on about their business. 
   It is imperative for us to support the Petraeus plan and vote this bill down.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (WELCOMING REV. ELLIOTT L. FOSS -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, Members of the House, it's a great honor today to introduce my friend, the Reverend Elliott Foss, to the chamber and to the folks who are our visitors today. Elliott has been a friend of mine for a number of years, almost going on two decades, in fact. Elliott was appointed the National Chaplain of the American Legion on August 30, 2007, by the National Commander, Marty Conatser. The appointment was made following the closing session of the 89th National Convention in Reno, Nevada. 
   He is a retired U.S. Navy Command Master Chief and Hospital Corpsman from the Submarine Division, and served during the Vietnam War and through the Gulf wars. Elliott attended Candler Seminary School of Ministry at Emory University. He also served as pastor to churches in Maine, Virginia, Connecticut, Florida, and Georgia. He is a Georgia resident and is an ordained Southern Baptist Minister and Chaplain, even though he has been the minister in four different Methodist churches in my district. 
   Elliott is a member of the American Legion Post 317 in coastal Georgia, where he serves as Post Commander. Reverend Foss also has served as the 8th District Vice Commander and as Post 9 Brunswick Commander. Chaplain Foss serves as the Department of Georgia Chaplain for now 7 years. He has held numerous leadership positions at the post, State and national levels during the past 11 years. 
   He and his wife, Arlene, reside in Kingsland, Georgia. I first got to know him when he was the chaplain of the Seaman's House and worked with people and sailors from all over the world and members of our own merchant marine. He is a great guy, a great man of the Lord, and we are very proud to have him as chaplain of the day today.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (BUDGET SCHOOL -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for yielding, and there are a couple of points I want to make. One is just now a lesson that we have simply learned or seen, I guess, witnessed, if you will. The Democrats passed a budget the week before we adjourned for a 2-week work recess, so it would have been 3 weeks ago. So 3 weeks the Democrat budget is passed, and it had in it $30 billion for AIDS money for Africa. 
   As we know, the President has been very passionate about getting AIDS support for the continent of Africa. Indeed, Africa has suffered a lot because of the AIDS problem. But the President called for a $30 billion expenditure.     
   Now, the Democrats called for a $30 billion expenditure as well in the budget 3 weeks ago, but something may have happened in their districts over the last 2 weeks. I suspect person after person who's paying $3.25 a gallon and who's concerned about the war and concerned about health care ignored that and said to their Democrat Member, you have got to spend more than the President has promised for AIDS in Africa; and don't just spend $30 billion, spend $50 billion. So, when we get back to Washington, the first thing the Democrats do is ignore the President's request, ignore their own budget, and go $20 billion on one vote on one line item expenditure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. That's correct. So, here we are, the first day back basically voting on anything of substance, we've already spent $20 billion over a budget that's only 3 weeks old. 
   Now, you had mentioned discretionary spending, and I want to make sure folks understand. Discretionary spending means Congress has agreed that year by year that level of spending can fluctuate. Now, that's opposed to what we call mandatory spending. And I use the term ``mandatory'' loosely because nothing is mandatory if you're the legislative branch that set laws. But we call things like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security mandatory spending, meaning, not just that we're going to spend a certain amount every year depending on a formula, but it also means, and I don't know if my friend from Tennessee or the other gentleman from Texas or Tennessee know this, but we don't have hearings on mandatory spending traditionally. 
   I'm a member of the Appropriations Committee. We spend a huge amount of money on Social Security and Medicaid, but we've never had a hearing on it. Every year we wrestle on some of the mandatory spending and some of the discretionary spending, but the biggest portion of the budget we don't do hearings on. And I think that it's time that we start talking about some of the mandatory spending if we're ever going to be serious about balancing the budget.

   Mr. KINGSTON. Well, I think, though, that when you're talking about spending, you have to look at everything. And when you have such a large portion on mandatory spending, and I think of it in terms of automatic spending, and I understand that Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare are sacred cows, that if you touch them politically somebody's going to twist your words around and say that you're trying to do something nefarious, but the reality is if you're ever going to balance the budget, you have to look at everything. And there are areas I know that we can do a better job on. 
   Now I'm on the AG Committee on Appropriations. Many people don't know this, and they always complain about how big the USDA is. Sixty-three percent of the agriculture budget is in welfare. Food stamps, the WIC programs, school nutrition programs, these are supplemental assistance programs to the poor. Now, I was here in 1996 when we reformed welfare, and it went from 14 million people who were on welfare down to 5 million people. That was a step in the right direction because you want to help those who truly need it, but you don't want to create a system where able-bodied people are able to game it and not work. 
   But what we're doing in AG appropriations is year after year making it a little bit easier to qualify for food stamps. We lighten up on the work requirements. We extend it to this group or the other. The WIC program is a child nursing supplement program. And Dr. Burgess knows well, it's a supplemental program for nursing mothers,  but you're eligible for age 6. Now, I'm a father of four. I know you're a mama, you weren't breast-feeding your children at age 6, I assume.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (DRILL NOW IN ANWR -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. I just returned from the Middle East. I went with a bipartisan group to Saudi Arabia, to the United Arab Emirates and to Kazakhstan and talked to the folks who have oil about what we can do internationally to bring the price down, bring the supply up, do whatever it takes to give middle class Americans some relief at the gas pump. It was interesting the response that I got. 
   Number one, I can tell you without question the Middle East is happy with the current gas prices. We all know that they are enjoying the wealth which we are transferring over there. But the thing that they said to us, How dare you come to Saudi Arabia, how dare you come to the United Arab Emirates, how dare you come to Kazakhstan and ask us to reduce our prices when you won't even drill for oil yourself. You won't even build refineries. Yet you want us to do something. You can do it for yourself. 
   Think about this, ladies and gentlemen. ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, is the size of South Carolina. The proposed drilling area is 2,000 acres. That is smaller than the average airport. Yet, for some reason, we are afraid to drill there. That is absurd. We need to drill now.

<DOCNO>Mr. KINGSTON. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4137, COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule so that we can amend it or offer an amendment on earmark reform. 
   As we heard the President last week speak about earmarks in the State of the Union, to my knowledge, no President has ever talked about something that's ordinarily a House and Senate procedure in his State of the Union comments. But in it he declared war, you may say, on earmarks. 
   Now, we believe in the prerogative of the legislative branch to put things in the budget and take things out of the budget. Indeed, the White House earmarks all the time. But the reality is, Mr. Speaker, we need to have a discussion on earmarks. We do need to stop the practice of air-dropping earmarks into conference committees, earmarks that haven't been debated, discussed, or had hearings held on them at the House or on the Senate level. I think that's the first step. But I think there is a whole lot of other things we should do. 
   For example, there are earmarks routinely in the transportation bill.     
   There are earmarks in trade bills, earmarks all over the place in any tax bill. We believe that earmarking should be reformed on all committee levels. We always talk about appropriations, but there are lots of committees that do it. If we allow for it, we will set up a joint bicameral, bipartisan select committee on earmarks that will come up with recommendations on how to do a better job with them. This would require, or we would urge, a moratorium on earmarks until the select committee comes back to Congress with recommendations. 
   But there are so many things that we could do that would improve this process: for example, financial disclosure on earmarks, does the Member have anything at stake to personally gain; transparency so that when an earmark is added on a subcommittee or full committee or floor level, transparency so that the earmark is put in and Members have an opportunity to ask why is that in there, who put it in there, what does it do and why should the people of Idaho have their tax dollars go to something that happens in Florida. We want to be able to have that debate. I think that that is so important. 
   And, again, there are tax loopholes that are basically industry-specific earmarks. Who puts them? At least with appropriations right now you know who puts them in, but on tax earmarks you do not. The White House does all kinds of earmarking, and we and certainly the press let them get away with it because for some reason they are the White House. But under the constitutional concept of equal branches of government, particularly when spending bills originate in the House, we have the right to earmark; but we should all be measured by the same yardstick. 
   The other thing that is important is what is the impact of earmarks on the budget. When you take an earmark out of a bill, it does not reduce the bill. Is that something that we should look at? There are all types of things that a bipartisan, bicameral committee could look at that would improve this process. So I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule so that we can come back and have this opportunity to vote on this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KINGSTON. Madam Speaker, last week the Capitol hosted a display of electric cars, hybrids like the Toyota Prius and various generations. 
   And there was one car that got my attention. It was an Auto-Cycle. It was a one-man car. It would go 75 miles an hour. And the owner of it did not drive it in from Ohio where it was made, but he said he could have. It goes 75 miles an hour. And if you have a car like that in town, you basically plug it in every day and you run all day long, and you don't use one ounce of gas. 
   I am a cosponsor of something called the DRIVE Act. It is a bipartisan bill cosponsored by me and Eliot Engel of New York. The idea behind it is to get off Middle East oil by increasing the incentive to buy hybrid cars, flex-fuel vehicles, electric vehicles, biodiesels, cars that run on ethanol, and a number of other alternative-fuel vehicles. We have the technology that's out there. 
   We are doubling, in the DRIVE Act, the tax credit for buying hybrids in such cars. I believe that this is a step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the DRIVE Act.
