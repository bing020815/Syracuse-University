<DOCNO>Mr. CRENSHAW. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to rise very briefly in opposition. I share the same concern that we all share about these unexploded ordnance sites. The safety of our citizens is important, and I think our subcommittee has recognized that by stating very clearly in very strong language that the Department of Defense should make this a priority, that we should get rid of this unacceptable backlog. 
   But I don't think we can take money out of the 2005 round of BRAC to solve the problem. That would be like robbing Peter to pay Paul. The 2005 round of BRAC has been put together. There is already some concern that it may not be fully funded, so if we take one penny out of that pot of money and spend it somewhere else, we could upset a very delicate balance. 
   We have to remember we have made a commitment to our men and women in uniform. For instance, I know in my community, they are building a $129 million hangar to house all the P-3s that will come down from Maine. If there is not enough money to do that, what happens to those planes? They are stranded. What happens to the sailors that are coming? They are stranded. 
   So while I share everyone's concern in dealing with this backlog, I think it is inappropriate and I think it is wrong to take money which would upset that kind of balance. We have to remember not only do we care about our communities, but we care about our commitment to our men and women in uniform. 
   Therefore, I would rise in opposition and urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CRENSHAW. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CRENSHAW. Thank you, Mr. Wamp, for yielding the time and thank you for your leadership on the subcommittee. And I certainly want to commend Chairman Edwards for all the hard work that he puts in. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have served on this subcommittee for as long as I have been on the Appropriations Committee, and I can tell you that there is never a time that I am more proud than when I am working with the young men and women in uniform. 
   I think we ought to note tonight that this is the first appropriations bill that we're taking up, and I think that speaks volumes about the priority and the commitment that we have in this Chamber to the men and women that wear the uniform. And this bill touches literally everyone, whether they are active duty today, as we provide money for new barracks, new training facilities, new hangars and airfields, and we improve our port facilities for the ships and the planes. It touches those that have served us in the past as veterans, building new facilities, veterans clinics, hospitals, even providing a suicide prevention line to help those troubled veterans as they come back and save, literally save, their lives. 
   And it also touches the people that are no longer with us because we have money in this bill to maintain and construct national cemeteries to give a final resting place for those who have served us, provide money for the monuments around the world to pay tribute to our fallen heroes. 
   But it also touches the lives of the family members of our men and women in uniform, day care centers we have talked about, quality of life issues. 
   So I would say this is a very important bill. It's a good bill. It serves those who serve us the most, and it deserves our support. So I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CRENSHAW. (CONGRATULATING HEISMAN TROPHY WINNER TIM TEBOW -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CRENSHAW. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. 
   I am very proud and privileged to join with my colleagues from Florida to sponsor this resolution commending Tim Tebow for winning the Heisman. As has been pointed out, it's the most prestigious award in college football, and it's the first time a sophomore has ever been awarded this. They have been giving this award for over 70 years, and never has a sophomore won it, but of course never was there a Tim Tebow before this year. 
   He has pointed out a lot of the statistics, the highlight I think is the fact that he is the first quarterback in major college football to throw for more than 20 touchdowns and also run for more than 20 touchdowns. He went on the rest of the year to win the Sullivan Award, the Danny O'Brien Award and the Maxwell Award. He was voted the AP Player of the Year. But I would say to you that, in spite of all those great athletic achievements, his strength of character maybe surpasses his athletic ability. 
   And just a word about Tim Tebow, the person, one of the reasons I'm so pleased to be here tonight is because his mom and dad, Pam and Bob Tebow, have been great friends of mine since we were together at the University of the Florida. I have watched Tim grow up. He is the youngest of five children. He has two older sisters, Katy and Christie, he's got two older brothers, Peter and Robbie. And when you grow up as the baby--even though he was a big baby, he was pretty competitive, looking after his big brothers and sisters. He worked on a farm. They live in Jacksonville, and he would go out and mow the lawn and pull weeds and fix the fence, and developed a pretty good sense of work ethic. 
   I think he would say to you today, Tim Tebow, as I listen to him talk, one of the reasons he has been so successful in athletics is because he understands that there are things in life that are more important than football. And I think because of that perspective, it has made him a better individual and also a better football player. But as has been pointed out, he spends a great deal of his free time going back to the mission field with his dad to the Philippines, where they started an orphanage. When he has time, he will go to hospitals and visit with young people today, who maybe have serious injuries. He has been a real inspiration to them. 
   And because of his deep and abiding faith in God, he sees his athletic ability as a platform so he can go into schools and go into prisons and go into churches and talk about his faith. 
   So I would just say that I want to add my words of congratulations to Tim Tebow and to his family. And not only has he been a great football player, but he has exhibited a great strength of character. I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution honoring him for winning this most prestigious award.

<DOCNO>Mr. CRENSHAW. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CRENSHAW. I thank the gentleman for the time, and I rise today in strong opposition to this resolution which says Congress disapproves of a war plan. 
   There are a lot of reasons to disapprove of this resolution, one of which is I believe that war should not be waged from the floor of this House. That is why we have one Commander  in Chief, that is why we have military leaders on the ground. They are in charge of conducting the war. And they have said we have made a mistake and we need a new direction, we need a new plan. And they have proposed that plan, and it is broad and it is comprehensive. It involves political considerations, it involves economic situations, diplomatic considerations, and, yes, it entails additional troops to go to Iraq. Yes, additional troops. 
   But it is a plan. And you can be skeptical and you can say it may be too little, it may be too late. Maybe it is a good plan but it won't be executed properly. But it is going to give us hope and it is going to give the Iraqi people hope. And, if anything, we ought to be here today trying to make that plan better, not debating a resolution that is nonbinding, that is symbolic, that means nothing, that says nothing, that does nothing. In fact, it has no useful purpose whatsoever, unless maybe it is to undermine the President or perhaps to demoralize our troops by saying to them, ``We have a new mission for you to undertake. Go to Iraq and try to execute this mission. But, by the way, the United States Congress doesn't believe in the mission, and we think it is doomed to failure.'' You tell me that that is not going to have a negative impact on our American soldiers. 
   Now, I know there are people in this Chamber that think the plan is doomed from the very beginning. You don't think it will work. And if that is your belief, you ought to do more than introduce a symbolic resolution and then stand here and pound the podium and hem and haw and make speeches and leap in front of the television cameras. You ought to do something that really means something. You ought to propose a resolution that says we believe it was doomed from the very beginning and we are going to do everything we possibly can to stop this plan. That is what you should do. 
   And if you don't think the plan is going to work, if you think it is doomed to failure, and you don't have a viable alternative strategy and you don't want to find a viable alternative strategy for winning, then you ought to go even further and you ought to stand up and say, ``We admit defeat. It didn't work. We are not going to fund the war altogether anymore. We are going to withdraw.'' 
   I will tell you one thing, the plan is there. It may not be perfect and, quite frankly, it may not work. I have got reservations myself. But it is there, and every American, Democrats and Republicans alike, ought to hope that this plan succeeds because it may very well be our last best chance to prevent a catastrophic failure in Iraq. And if that happens, the disastrous effect won't just be felt in Iraq, won't just be felt by the people of the Middle East, but quite possibly will be felt by all Americans alike.
