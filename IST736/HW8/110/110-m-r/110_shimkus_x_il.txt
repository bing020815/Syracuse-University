<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (SHOULD WE BE SURPRISED? NOT REALLY -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, it is 4:10 and we have finished the work of today. Should I be surprised? I wish I wouldn't be surprised. I was going to give the new majority a chance to get their sea legs in about 6 months to manage the floor so that we would work throughout the day, but I continue to get disappointed at our early departure hours from the floor. 
   I have got numerous dates from throughout the year where we have stopped work: January 11 at 3:26 p.m.; 17 January, 5:52 p.m.; 23 January, 2:40 p.m.; 4:23 p.m., 2:44 p.m., 2:28 p.m., 4:58 p.m., 3:01 p.m., 2:51 p.m., 3:21, 3:46. Yesterday I think we left work at 3:30. Today we leave work at 4. 
   The problem, Mr. Speaker, is that just because we are here more days a week doesn't mean we are doing any more work. Many of us who would like to be home to visit with our constituents or be home to visit with our families would say let's work in the evening, let's work at 6 p.m., let's work at 7 p.m., let's go to 10 p.m. By golly, let's go to 11 o'clock at night. Let's be brave. Let's be courageous. 
   We know there are many issues that the American public want us to address. We heard the concern from my colleague just before. But where are we? We're done for the day. No more business. Now it is just Members coming to the floor and speaking what is on their mind. What is on my mind is we ought to be about the business that we are sent here to do. 
   I understand the new majority, and I wanted to cut them some slack on the first 6 months. Five days a week. Let's work. That's fine. But now we're past that time. Now we should be able to say: The days we are here in Washington, let's work. Let's start at 10, let's go to 6, let's go to 8, let's go to 10. Let's get our work done and then allow 435 Members to go back to their districts to do their town hall meetings, to visit with their constituents, to take care of the business. 
   Not only that, but most of us live at home. Most of our families live in the  districts we represent. We can't be good fathers, good mothers, good parents when we are stuck here at 4 p.m., 4:10, nothing else to do, just wait for the next workday to begin. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, my simple point is, if we are going to work here in Washington, can't we please go back to working in the evening? I don't think that is too much to ask for.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Well, Mr. Speaker, high energy costs really affect this debate because high energy costs are causing people to make tough decisions where they can't meet their bill payments. 
   Just last year the cost for natural gas for an individual homeowner went up 5.9 percent. Just last year the price for home heating increased 37.2 percent. The cost for propane increased 22.2 percent. The cost for electricity increased 4.3 percent. Why? We have no plan. The Democrat plan to lower energy costs was no plan. 
   There was a plan. It did this: Crude oil was at $58.31 when the Democrats came into the majority. Today, $121. Yesterday it hit $122. I've been doing this for 4 weeks. It hasn't gone down; it keeps going up. 
   What has that done at the pump? When Democrats came into control, $2.33. What is it today? On average, $3.60. That's no plan. That's a plan to fail. That's higher costs. 
   If you want people to be able to meet their mortgage payments, let's lower energy costs. Let's lower the price of a gallon of gasoline.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Now bring in climate change. On average, climate change is going to add 50 cents to a gallon of gas. That would raise the price to $4.16. Nobody wants to pay that. 
   How can we solve this problem, Mr. Speaker? Let's go after our natural resources in the Outer Continental Shelf. Billions of barrels of oil, billions of cubic feet of natural gas right on the OCS. Democrats keep blocking the ability to get that. Let's do coal-to-liquid technologies. Go after our coal reserves, 250 years' worth in Southern Illinois alone, and turn that into liquid fuel. 
   Let's lower the cost for homeowners so that we don't have to rely on bailouts, we don't have to rely on government. My individuals want independence from government. They want independence on fuel costs. They want to pay lower costs. 
   Democrats can bring a bill to the floor. They promised it in 2006. We have yet to see it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I'm sorry that we're on the floor here today. This year I've yelled on this floor. I've cried on this floor. I've stormed off this floor. So today I decided to be the still, small voice in support of coal, in support of the internal combustion engine, and in support of national security. 
   Illinois alone is the Saudi Arabia of coal. If you want to decrease our reliance on imported crude oil, coal has to be in an energy bill. It just has to. And to deny that is a failure on public policy ramifications. 
   I here hold in my hand an internal combustion engine, much maligned on the floor and in the world today. It's 1.5 horsepower. It's lighter and it's easier to carry than 1 1/2 horses. And we have to imagine the benefits to this world that the internal combustion engine has caused, how it's uplifted the poor and the downtrodden. But this bill attacks the internal combustion engine. 
   And on national security, coal-to-liquid fuel and natural gas, the evidence is clear: the Department of Defense wants to relieve itself of reliance on imported crude oil. They are seeking support of coal-to-liquid applications for jet fuel. The United States Air Force is the number one consumer of aviation fuel. Our coal fields to our refineries, to our pipelines, to our jet planes is the way in which we can decrease our reliance on imported crude oil and protect our national security interests. This bill does nothing in that respect. Vote ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come down to the floor at the end of the week to just say if we really want to be sincere about bringing down the price of energy, we need to have an all-of-the-above strategy. 
   That is opening up the Outer Continental Shelf which we legislatively limited 25 years. That is bringing on wind and solar. We can use the revenues from opening the OCS to build wind and solar operations. We can use our vast resources of coal, 250 years worth of supply in the Illinois coal basin alone, turning that into liquid fuels creating American jobs. We also can continue to expand the use of biofuels. 
   The great thing about the Republican proposal is that it is all of the above. We are not willing to say ``no'' to everything. We want everything to come on board, to bring on more supply and lower the cost of liquid fuel for the cost of electricity, and we want these fuels and these commodities to compete. In the competition, we will have lower-cost fuel and energy so we can have a manufacturing base left in the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (HONORING ANATOLE MILUNAS -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, it is great to be back in session and back in Washington. I look forward to a very interesting new Congress. 
   One of the great benefits of being a Member is the opportunity to talk about our national treasure, which is our citizens. We just lost one who became a good friend of mine, doesn't live in my Congressional district, is from the state of Illinois, name of Tony Milunas. 
   Now, Tony, is the story of a lot of post World War II era emigres who came from the former captive nations, the former Eastern Bloc countries that immigrated here, became active citizens, not only supported this great country, served in the military, but also was very involved in the 50 years of totalitarian ruling of the Eastern Bloc countries and helped bring freedom to those countries. With that I am going to give a little background on Tony and mention how he was very important in my life. 
   Anatole Milunas, ``Tony,'' as we knew him, was born August 3, 1936 in the City of Sauliai, Lithuania. During World War II, he left Lithuania to escape the second Soviet occupation and the subsequent 50 years of terror. While in exile in 1946, he finished high school and began studying for a degree in technology in Darmstadt, Germany. 
   After he immigrated to the United States, he continued his schooling and graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois. During the Korean War, he served in the United States Army, stationed in Germany as a translator and adviser to a staff officer. 
   He actively participated in the presidential election of President Ronald Reagan and President George Herbert Walker Bush, and has been a strong supporter of the Illinois Republican Party. From 1979 to 1985, he was a chairman of the Lithuanian American Republican National Federation, and from 1994 to 2006, Mr. Milunas was the chairman of the Lithuanian American Republican League in Illinois. 
   He died December 23, 2006. He left a widow, Dana, and two sons, Vytenis and Rimas, two good Lithuanian names, their families and many relatives here in Lithuania as well as friends and so many associates. He leaves behind a lasting legacy. 
   Now, I met Tony way back in 1992 when he looked at the family name of politicians running for office, and my colleagues here, who I have served with for many years, know that I have focused some of my extra time on Baltic issues, which is Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Not because I have a strong Baltic number of citizens in my district, and, in fact, it is very little, but Shimkus is ethnically Lithuanian. 
   Tony, seeing that name said, and being Republican, says, oh, I found a guy who will help me remember the persecution of the Baltic countries and help bring freedom, NATO enlargement, EU ascension to the Baltic countries. 
   He adopted me, in essence, and he encouraged me to not only be involved here on the floor, but really be involved in what for me is four generations removed. He is one generation, I am four generations. 
   Tony gave me this photo back on October 18, 2002, to the Honorable John Shimkus, we are proud to have you as an honorary member while we continue the Reagan legacy, Lithuanian Republican League of Illinois, Anatole Milunas. This is a photo of President Reagan when he is campaigning in Chicago. Now I am a down-stater, I am more by St. Louis and what we call southern Illinois. This was a picture Tony was very, very proud of. This was at an ethnic festival, then candidate Reagan was there. Tony handed him this bumper sticker that said, ``I love Lithuanians,'' and here is President Reagan holding this up. 
   As we know, it was President Reagan that was in Berlin and said, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall, which is all part of the fall of the Soviet empire and the freeing of millions of people in what we call the captive nations. 
   I was glad to play a small part in the movement to enlarge NATO and bring in the former captive nations that love democracy and freedom, willing to take and pay the sacrifice, transform their militaries and be true allies. 
   One of the reasons why I was able to do that is because of the mentorship, the friendship, the love, the compassion of this U.S. citizen who was born in Sauliai, Lithuania, who came to this country with nothing, lived the American dream, was a great citizen, but had an appreciation for his homeland.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, it's a curious debate that we have in these 1-minutes. Democrats are bringing to the floor unemployment insurance and they will bring to the floor helping people with heating costs and cooling costs. 
   The real job creation engine would be American-made energy with a couple of provisions. Since 1994 on votes on the floor of this House, on ANWR exploration, Republicans have supported 91 percent of the time, House Democrats have opposed ANWR exploration 86 percent of the time. 
   On coal-to-liquid technologies, House Republicans have supported that 97 percent of the time. House Democrats have opposed taking American coal, American energy, turning it into liquid fuel. They have opposed it 78 percent of the time. 
   On oil-shale exploration, House Republicans have supported it 90 percent of the time. Democrats have opposed 86 percent. OCS, Outer Continental Shelf, House Republicans have supported it 81 percent of the time since 1984. House Democrats have opposed it 83 percent of the time. On refineries, building new refineries, House Republicans have supported 97 percent of the time, House Democrats have opposed 96 percent of the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I come down to offer this amendment with respect to myself and my colleague, Anna Eshoo. She is tied up in an Intel briefing, or she would be down in support of this amendment. 
   We both cochair the E9-1-1 Caucus in which, in 2004, we passed on this floor an authorization of $1.2 billion over 5 years to help our first line responders roll out ENHANCE 9/11 in a 50 percent grant program with our public safety officials. Under Republican control over the past 2 years, and now under a Democrat-controlled appropriation budget, we have yet to see our first dollar from the appropriation process committed to ENHANCE 9/11. 
   So the basic premise of this amendment is just to get started. There is $1.2 billion authorized. This is the third year with no dollars appropriated. We are asking for a shifting of funds of $5 million to make this happen. Again, this amendment is supported by the National Emergency Numbering Association, which is commonly referred to as NENA; and APCO, which is the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials. 
   We all know the stories about people who expect that when they dial 9/11 on a cellular phone that not only will someone answer that, but people will know where they are. I represent rural southern Illinois, parts of 30 counties. It is one of the largest congressional districts east of the Mississippi. You can go off in some area and folks may not find you until it is too late. 
   So the whole emphasis behind ENHANCE 9/11 is to use technology, work with the land line companies, work with the cell companies, work with the public service answering points of PSAPs, or we call them the E9-1-1 call centers, and in so doing, make sure that we move our country forward to be able to identify folks when they call 9/11 on their cellular phone. Again, I would venture to guess that almost everyone voted for ENHANCE 9/11, cellular identification authorization amount $1.2 billion over 5 years. 
   So it is time, my colleagues. Congresswoman Eshoo and I just want us to start. I think the public service, the first line responders and the public safety communities really want us to at least show some good-faith effort by finally releasing some dollars. That is the intent of this amendment. 
   I see there is some activity on the other side. I was hoping that the chairman would pay attention, because I am going to call, obviously, for the voice vote, but because of the way that it is worded, I will not call for a recorded vote, but I would like for him to be receptive to moving this provision, especially when it is brought in a bipartisan manner with a major member of the Commerce Subcommittee and the Telecommunications Subcommittee. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. And I appreciate it. I know the gentleman is a big supporter of coal. And we did bring to the Rules Committee an amendment that would amend the language in this bill to allow some of this money to go to contract with the Department of Defense so they can move on coal-to-liquid provisions. 
   You know there are really three avenues to expand coal-to-liquid technology: one is forward contracting for the Department of Defense; one is a tax provision; and the other one is a collar provision that we are working on. And if we could have gotten some provision in this bill, because there is going to be money available to move directly, we have got to get that first coal-to-liquid plant built, then the others will come. And I think that is what our disappointment is.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, again, I enjoyed my comments with my colleague, but I know my colleague from Washington State who just left would not mention coal. My folks from the west coast will not mention the benefits of coal, and we have a lot of work to do. We are going to continue to move it forward, and this was our opportunity to be helpful. 
   I want to talk about section 199. And I know my colleagues on the other side like to talk about the Big Oil guys, but let's talk about the Little Oil guys, the ones in southern Illinois. In southern Illinois, we produce about 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day amounting to $574 million minus about one-eighth of that to royalty owners. These are small mom and pop operations of marginal wells, you know, those wells that you have to put energy in to get the crude oil out. 
   Section 199 has three primary purposes: exploration, that is a good thing. Production, that is a good thing. Refining, that is a good thing. Three good things to help address our reliance on imported crude oil from overseas. 
   Illinois crude oil, being delivered from Illinois soil up to the surface area so that it can meet our fuel needs, the attack on section 199 in this bill to a small mom and pop oil producer in southern Illinois in 2008 will be a $200,000 tax increase. In 2009, it will be a $300,000 tax increase on this small marginal oil producer. This is money that she, a woman-owned business operation, cannot use to expand, employ, provide health care benefits to. This is all money that is going to come out of the bottom line in her ability to expand and find new oil reserves and resources in southern Illinois, and that is why I am going to vote against this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, if you want to decrease our reliance on foreign energy--exploiting our coal reserves is one way. I offered and amendment through the rules committee that would move some of the revenue from this tax increase to allow DOD to forward contract and purchase CTL fuels. 
   But this bill will make it more difficult to recover what oil we have left in Southern Illinois. 
   In Southern Illinois--we produce around 30,000 barrels of crude per day amounting to $574 million minus about 1/8 of that to royalty owners. These are all small mom and pop operations and marginal wells. 
   The smaller oil and gas producers in my district rely on Section 199 deduction as it lowers the effective tax rate on manufacturing income that comes from exploration, production and refining. 
   One small producer in my district, for example, estimates that depending on the timing the Democratic repeal would go into effect, they would lose $200,000 in 2008 and around $300,000 in 2009. Now this is $500,000 that a small oil and gas producer in rural Southern Illinois cannot use to improve the efficiency of their business, buy new equipment, hire new employees or even use to pay health insurance cost of their current employees. 
   Regular order would have allowed a committee to hear some of these concerns so that adjustments could have been made to eliminate the unintended consequences of this bill--or maybe they aren't unintended. 
   Amortization of Geological and Geophysical (G&G) expenses, another provision that they are trying to repeal today--was passed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, because it allows producers to affordably use a technology to examine, without drilling, the best spot to drill for oil or gas--this is also an environmentally friendly practice--without it they would have to revert to drilling all over an area to find an optimal drilling point. 
   The cost of this Geophysical exploration is around 20 to 30 thousand dollars per square mile of exploration--so simple math shows you that this is a significant investment that is being made by the industry, taking that away will lower production and efficiency, making the U.S. less competitive in the world market. 
   We need to develop policies that make it easier to produce affordable domestic energy. 
   And, again, we did that in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that is why expansion is starting to happen today. Expansion with petroleum refineries, with ethanol refineries, with clean coal generation, nuclear generation, expansion of the areas where we can explore for new energy sources. 
   Here are some numbers: Over 500 million of new ethanol production and nearly 30 new plants; 500 million gallons of new annual ethanol production online; 25 new nuclear reactors planned; 2,000 megawatts of new wind power online; 120 new coal-based facilities in various stages of planning; and 2 million barrels of oil daily that can be replaced by clean, synthetic fuel from coal by 2025. 
   Raising taxes in this bill will in fact do more harm to the little guys--the guys that are spread across the U.S. diversifying where our domestic petroleum and gas come from. And will not help us reduce our dependence on foreign sources of gas and oil.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, legislation is like making sausage. When Henry Waxman and John Shimkus come to the floor on an energy bill that we grudgingly will support, that is probably newsworthy in itself. 
   A couple of things. First, congratulations to Mattoon, Illinois, that has been named as the FutureGen site for the next generation of coal-fired clean emissions plants. I want to put that on the record. 
   The benefit of this bill is the tax increase is out of this bill. That is a plus. That is less cost to the American consumer. The RFS is out of this bill. That is a plus for the consumer. The RFS was unable to be met and would have been costly to the consumer. The RFS could have been better. It could have been an alternative fuel standard which brought in coal-to-liquid technologies that I have talked numerous times on the floor about, taking coal, using fossil fuels, turning it into clean-burning liquid fuels. That is a fight we will have to bring to the floor another time. And the CAFE language is an acceptable compromise that industry supports. 
   The world will continue to demand more energy, not less. We have to focus on more supply. That supply comes from coal. It comes from natural gas. It will come from nuclear power. While this bill doesn't measure up to the demands that we need in the future, it is an acceptable start. 
   With that, I will support the bill, but continue to come to the floor talking about the importance of bringing coal, nuclear and natural gas portfolios to the energy debate; coal-to-liquid technologies, which takes a natural resource; a U.S. refinery to fuel our war machines of the future, whether that is aviation fuel, whether that is diesel fuel; clean-burning technologies that are available today. The majority is going to have to wise up and know there has to be more supply in the energy debate.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague from North Carolina for the time. 
   I want to commend my colleague, Congressman Costello, for bringing this forward, and of course my colleague from Chicago, Chairman Davis, for helping get this bill on the floor. 
   In Southern Illinois everyone knows Ken Gray. In this environment it's always hard to figure out with past Congresses, but he is admired and adored and lovingly called the ``Prince of Pork'' for a couple of reasons, probably a lot more than I even know since I'm a youngster to this institution, but for helping President Eisenhower pass the Federal highway transportation bill, which brought the interstate highway system, and then lobbying diligently to make sure that those routes came through Southern Illinois. 
   And although Southern Illinois continues to struggle along the interstate routes that are part of my district and part of Congressman Costello's district where there are jobs and economic activity, they are around the hubs of the interstate highway system. So he does get great credit for that. Also, a major lake, Rend Lake, is there that provides water for much of the communities of Southern Illinois. And that was all part of his due diligence and his activity. 
   I also like the story, being a veteran, of Ken Gray lying about his age, going into the war, and then serving honorably in World War II and being awarded three Bronze Stars for his service. 
   He is quite the character. People who know him and have served with him can tell you some quite colorful stories. He has welcomed me in the institution as a colleague. I look to him for advice and counsel when I get into the deep part of Southern Illinois. 
   I think this is a fitting tribute. I thank my colleague, Congressman Costello, for bringing it forward. I implore and ask my colleagues to support the naming of this post office.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up with my colleague from Texas since we are talking about e-mails, and I, in essence, concur with him. The number one message we are getting back from our constituents is high energy prices. And when the historians go back to reclaim our files to write some analysis on what this Congress did at its hour of need and we make sure they can pull our e-mails, they are going to find us inundated with ``energy prices are too high,'' and then they're going to look at the record and ask, well, how did Congress respond? And for the first 18 months of this Congress, and we only have about half a year left, we have done nothing. 
   This is the problem: $23 a barrel when Bush came into office, $58 a barrel when the Democrats assumed the majority. I didn't check the market today yet. As of yesterday, it was $140 a barrel. What we are saying here is the trend line is bad, and what we are saying is the trend line is not sustainable  if we want a middle class in this country, if we want people in rural America to live in rural America. 
   In rural America I represent parts of 30 counties of Southern Illinois. We have to drive many miles to get to health care. We have to drive many miles to get to our primary schools, our secondary schools. We have to drive big trucks because we're hauling seed, we're hauling feed, we're hauling livestock. They're working trucks. They can't operate on an electric engine, a plug-in type of vehicle. Now, that may be good for some parts of the country. It's not good for rural Southern Illinois. 
   So here we are on the floor just back from a week at home, the 4th of July break, thinking that it's time to roll up our sleeves and work to help address the concerns because we know they are going to take a while to fix. It's not like we can snap our finger. A lot of times we get asked, what can we do immediately? What can we do immediately? One of the answers is to lower the Federal gas tax. That's something we can do immediately. What is another thing we can do immediately? Well, the public has to conserve. The individual has to do something immediately, and they're doing it. We are driving fewer miles today but we're paying more. Does that make sense? Drive less, pay more? That's as bad as drive small cars and wait for the wind. The other policy is drive less, pay more. That's not a good energy policy. 
   So we're ready to come back. We're ready to be open. We are ready to be accessible. Compromise on this floor. Bring some supply to the debate. Bring some efficiency. Bring some renewables. Let's strike an agreement.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. There is a great example of that, Mr. Speaker. My friend PETER ROSKAM from Chicago, he has a bill called the Vision Act, which uses the royalties of the Outer Continental Shelf, uses the Federal money and then plows it into renewables--solar, wind, electric--because it's all going to cost money. 
   So here's the problem. Here's the solution: The Outer Continental Shelf, coal to liquid, solar, wind, renewable fuels. All the above, that's our policy. American-made energy translates into American-made jobs, which lowers prices for everyone. And the point should be made. It's the middle class, the lower middle class who are exponentially harmed by higher energy prices. They can't afford the new technology. They can't afford the new cars. They have to buy the used car off the lot that gets poor gas mileage because they are trying to make ends meet. 
   We are on the right side of this issue.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, another great opportunity, and I will mention it in 1 minute. The United States has the largest reserve of recoverable coal in the world. Why not take that coal, create United Mine Worker jobs recovering the coal, build a coal-to-liquid refinery, turn that into jet fuel, gasoline, diesel fuel, build it in the central part of the country where the coal fields are so it's not disrupted by the storms in the gulf coast, pump it to our airports so that they have a competitive product versus crude oil jet fuel so that we don't lose our budget airlines. 
   Four budget airlines have got bankrupt. Four budget airlines. That means ticket takers, stewardesses, pilots, baggage handlers now without a job. Why? High energy costs. And we come to the floor with a national historic trail and protecting e-mails and 15 suspension bills.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, here is the problem: When President Bush took over as President the price of a barrel of crude oil was $23. When the Democrats became the majority, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58. Today, it's hovering around $140 per barrel of crude oil. All we're trying to do on this side is bring forth some solutions. We're doing that today with a discharge petition on one such technology, coal-to-liquid technologies, H.R. 2208. It's not my bill. It's my Democrat colleague, RICK BOUCHER's, bill. 
   The United States has the largest coal reserves in the world, 250 billion tons of recoverable coal. China has invested $24 billion in coal-to-liquid technologies. We, in the United States, have invested zero. The largest reserves, zero investments. 
   This is how it works: We operate a U.S. coal mine, U.S. jobs. We build a coal-to-liquid refinery, U.S. jobs. We have liquid fuel to compete with crude oil fuel, we pipe it in a pipeline, U.S. jobs. We go to our aviation industry with jet fuel. All these budget airlines are going broke because of high cost fuels. This is ``a'' solution, not one, but one of many.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, in a press release on April 24, 2006, then Leader Pelosi, now Speaker Pelosi said, Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down the skyrocketing cost of gasoline. In an op-ed penned by my friend from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel), he claimed that their success is because Democrats realize the anxiety of stagnating wages, the cost of health care, education, and even gasoline and vowed to address their concerns. 
   Well, they addressed their concerns. Gas prices are up. When the Democrats took over, gas prices were $2.33. Now they are $3.53. We call this the Pelosi Premium. Add the 50 cent gas tax for climate change, consumers would be paying $4.03. And when gas prices reach $4 this summer, add 50 cents for climate change; we will be paying $4.53 for a gallon of gas. 
   That's not the type of change that the suburbs in America bargained for when they allowed Democrats to get this Chamber.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, this is a small business bill. Let me tell you why this is relevant. The biggest challenge to small businesses in America today is the high cost of energy. Let me say that again. The biggest challenge to America's small businesses today is the high cost of energy. 
   Here's an article from a paper: ``Independent Truckers,'' they're small businessmen, ``Join Strike.'' Why? Over $4 a barrel for diesel, $4 a gallon for diesel fuel. They can't operate. You wonder why food prices are going up? Gas prices are too high. 
   What has the Democrat majority done? Nothing. 
   This is a great opportunity to bring all our collective ideas, put legislation in front of the American people, and say let's vote on bills that will affect and lower the cost of gasoline. 
   Now, the Democrats should be happy about this because Speaker Pelosi promised in April of 2006 that the Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices. In 2006. We're still waiting for the plan. 
   In fact, there is a plan. The plan is this: The plan is for the barrel of crude oil to go up. When the Democrats took the majority, it was $58 a barrel. What is it today? It's $117.36. When you have no plan, you plan to fail. 
   You want to help small businesses? Bring an energy bill to the floor that brings on more supply. 
   Look at what it has done at the gas pump. You've heard the terminology: ``Pelosi premium.'' The price of a gallon of gasoline when the Democrats took over: $2.33. What is it today? It's $3.53. Add to that climate change legislation, Chairman Dingell wants to bring to the floor 50 cents in additional cost to a gallon of gas. Right now that would be $4 a gallon. And we know when we get to the summer driving season, it's going to be $4. Add 50 cents: $4.50 a gallon. What do the Democrats bring to the floor? They bring nothing to the floor. Nothing. 
   Do we have plans? Actually, we have a bipartisan majority if the leadership would bring a bill to the floor. We have a bipartisan majority, most of the Republicans would vote for it, we'd get 40 or 50 Democrats, to move more supply, more supply like opening up the Outer Continental Shelf, more supply like coal-to-liquid technology, more supply like expanding nuclear power, more supply by going after the oil shale, more supply by going after our marginal oil wells. We can bring more supply. 
   We're the only industrialized nation in the world that doesn't use its resources. That's why we import all this crude oil. We don't use our resources. Coal to liquid, in Illinois alone, 250 years worth of fossil fuel. We could turn that into liquid fuel.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, this short-term extension is important. It's just too bad that we couldn't extend the low cost of energy that we had 18 months ago. Eighteen months ago the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58.31. Today it's $128 a barrel, a $70 increase. 
   What's important to small businesses is the cost of doing business. And the increase in energy cost, the increase in liquid fuel cost, the increase in electricity cost, bears a disproportionate share of the cost today, more so than 18 months ago.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I will debate this issue. This issue is about supply. I don't care who's responsible. This issue is about bringing more supply into the market. When a barrel costs $128 versus $58, this is what you get: You get gas prices that were at $2.33 when this Congress got sworn in to prices today that are $3.80 because we will not expand our supply. 
   Now, if you add climate change, my friend from Oregon is a good friend of mine, and I know he's concerned about climate change and global warming and a cap-and-trade system, conservatively, that's going to add 50 cents to a gallon of gas to comply with climate change. So today the average price $3.80, plus 50 cents, $4.30. 
   Now, I think yesterday in Chicago without the climate change gas tax increase, it was $4.50 a gallon. 
   So the debate is when are we going to say that it's okay to do these things? When is it okay that we can take coal and turn it into liquid fuel? When is it okay to go off the Outer Continental Shelf and harvest those billions of barrels of oil, those trillions of cubic feet of natural gas? When is it going to be okay to say let's continue to move aggressively in cellulosic and biofuels, coal-to-liquid, OCS, wind, and solar? 
   In 20 years, we're going to increase our electricity demand by 50 percent. We have to bring on more supply. We have to bring on more baseload supply because in rural America, which I represent, in over 30 counties it takes 2 1/2 hours to drive from one part of my district to another. We don't have mass transit. We don't have light rail. In fact, it's an agricultural economy. It runs on big diesel trucks to haul the cattle, to haul the horses, to haul the hay. Diesel prices have doubled. 
   And so because of that, what we're trying to say is it is time that we start addressing and bring this to the floor. The chairwoman herself said in her opening statement, We have brought policies here, this Congress, to lower the cost for small business. That's kind of like the Speaker's promise in 2006, We've got a plan to lower gas prices. It didn't happen. It went up.

   We've got to expand nuclear power. We've got to expand coal-fired power. We've got to turn coal into liquid fuels. We've got to bring on more supply. Yes, we can do it. I've got it here. In fact, Illinois is going to be a great wind power State.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. And because I'm enjoying this type of debate, I will concede the dollar price. 
   But let me tell you why, if we had our own resources, if we were drilling our own oil, isn't it criminal that we're relying on imported crude oil to fund our energy needs? Wouldn't it be better to use American dollars to drill on American soil in American land on American OCS? Then we wouldn't have to worry about the dollar, because an American dollar is an American dollar is an American dollar. And we wouldn't have to worry about our trade imbalances because we import all of this crude oil. 
   Now, to point two, the speculators. Do you know why they're bidding the price up? Because we won't open supply. They're taking a position that I am going to bid this up, and you know what? Those dummies in Congress, they're not going to open up more supply. So what I hold is going to cost more in the future. It's a futures market. It's risk management. They're betting about our inability to go here. Billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. We won't go there. They're betting against us going there.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I'm from Southern Illinois. It's the Saudi Arabia of coal, 250 years worth. Fifty percent of our electricity that we generate today is by coal. We could also use that coal as the South Africans have done for 40 years. The Germans did it in World War II. Take that coal and turn it into liquid fuel.  
   We have had four budget airlines go broke. Why did they go broke? They couldn't afford the price of aviation fuel. How did South African airlines fuel their jets? Coal-to-liquid technology. Taking South African coal, turning it into aviation jet fuel. That's what our competitive advantage is. Our advantage is using our natural resources. Not assuming that our natural resources are an environmental hazard. 
   That's our policy. Don't go after our natural resources. It's an environmental hazard. Most countries say go after your natural resources; it makes you stronger. It makes you more competitive. It lowers the cost of doing business. It creates jobs. Look at the jobs that would be created here in southern Illinois. Build a coal mine, that creates jobs. Operate the coal mines, that creates jobs. Build a coal-to-liquid refinery, jobs. Operate the coal-to-liquid refinery, jobs. Build a pipeline, American jobs. Low-cost fuel, American jobs. 
   For every dollar a barrel increase on aviation fuel, do you know how much it costs us taxpayers? $60 million just to fund the Air Force. 
   So this policy of no supply hurts the taxpayers. And we have to pay for it. We had the authorization bill of the Coast Guard. For every dollar increase in diesel fuel, do you know what it cost the Coast Guard to operate and make sure our shores are protected? $24 million for every dollar increase.

   I know we all focus on crude oil a lot, but an all-of-the-above energy strategy would also address coal. There's two provisions, Congressmen Boucher/Shimkus coal-to-liquid bill, which would help incentivize coal being turned into liquid fuel. That would help decrease our reliance on imported crude oil, make our country safer.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, in 1997, a Republican-led Congress passed the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, a program that combines the best of public and private approaches to delivering vital health care coverage to low-income children across the country. 
   Today this program provides coverage to 6.6 million children and has lowered the insurance rate by nearly 25 percent. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle decided not to include us in crafting the reauthorization of SCHIP. In addition, it included many other provisions affecting Medicare, without any input from the minority. 
   The legislation put forth by the Democrats has many problems, and I have serious reservations on how they propose to fund this legislation. Specifically, there are proposed funding streams in the bill passed out of the Ways and Means Committee that seek to take money out of end-stage renal disease programs by establishing policies that are shortsighted and ill-advised. 
   As currently structured, this proposal takes funding from among the sickest patients in the Medicare program, those who have end-stage renal disease, and reallocates it to a massive SCHIP expansion. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I was pleased to learn that Chairman Dingell was prepared to offer an amended version of the CHAMP Act that did not include any end-stage renal disease cuts, and, as indicated by CBO score sheets of Chairman Dingell's amendment, that do not include entries for any end-stage renal disease provisions. 
   It was unfortunate that the bill was discharged from the Energy and Commerce before amendments could be offered to strike these cuts, but I wholeheartedly agree that we should not be making cuts to end-stage renal disease, which treats some of the sickest patients in Medicare, to fund SCHIP expansion. 
   As the CHAMP Act currently stands, my concerns with end-stage renal disease are twofold. First, the bill proposes to disrupt the market-based average sales price reimbursement system that Congress worked hard to pass in the Medicare Modernization Act. This average sales price payment system was first implemented in the physician setting in 2005 and the end-stage renal disease setting for all drugs in 2006. 
   This system has been a great success across the board, and moving to reimbursement rates of ASP plus 6 percent has demonstrated significant savings. In fact, the Office of Inspector General estimated annual savings of $1 billion because of the shift from the old average wholesale price system to the ASP system in 2005. 
   Starting in 2006, the average sales price system includes drugs used to treat anemia in end-stage renal disease patients, as well as all other end-stage renal disease drugs. MedPACs have noted a decline in end-stage renal disease drug spending since the implementation of the average sales price, and when looking at erythropoietin stimulant agents, which are biologics used to treat anemia in end-stage renal disease, specifically it is clear that the ASP has resulted in a reduction in the price of Medicare, which had previously paid for these biologics going from $10 under a statutory rate in 1994 to 2004.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Starting in 2006, the average sales price system included drugs used to treat anemia and end-stage renal disease patients as well as other end-stage renal disease drugs. 
   Additionally, there are provisions in the bill that propose to institute a statutory price control rate. It would be a mistake to change a system that has reduced prices for this medicine by 6.8 percent since the average sales price-based reimbursement system was implemented in January of 2006; 9 percent compared to what Medicare paid for the drug back in 1994 under a statutory price control rate. 
   This market-based system is working to drive down prices for Medicare in Congress, and Congress shouldn't try to fix something that's not broken. Most importantly, I also question how a cut in payment would affect patient care. A payment cut may create financial incentives to reduce or ration clinically beneficial drugs. 
   Dialysis providers may reduce their costs by providing fewer services and drugs, transferring patients to another setting of care, or discharging patients more quickly.  
   Mr. Chairman, in 1997 a Republican-led Congress passed the State Children's Heath Insurance Program (SCHIP)--a progam that combines the best of public and private approaches to delivering vital health coverage to low-income children across this country. 
   Today this program provides coverage to 6.6 million children and has lowered the uninsured rate by nearly 25 percent. 
   Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle decided not to include us in crafting the reauthorization of SCHIP and in addition, included many other provisions affecting Medicare without any input from the minority. 
   The legislation put forth by the Democrats has many problems, and I have serious reservations on how they propose to fund this legislation. 
   Specifically, there are proposed funding streams in the bill passed out of the Ways and Means Committee that seeks to take money out of the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) program by establishing policies that are shortsighted and ill-advised. 
   As currently structured, this proposal takes funding from among the sickest patients in the Medicare program, those that have ESRD, and reallocates it to a massive SCHIP expansion. 
   As a member of the Energy & Commerce Committee, I was pleased to learn that Chairman Dingell was prepared to offer an amended version of the CHAMP Act that did not include any ESRD cuts as indicated by CBO score sheets of Chairman DINGELL's amendment that do not include entries for any ESRD provisions. 
   It was unfortunate that the bill was discharged from Energy and Commerce before amendments could be offered to strike these ESRD cuts, but I wholeheartedly agree that we should not be making cuts to the ESRD, which treats some of the sickest patients in Medicare, to fund SCHIP expansion. 
   As the CHAMP Act currently stands, my concerns with the ESRD provisions are two-fold. 
   First, the bill proposes to disrupt the market based Average Sales Price (ASP) reimbursement system that Congress worked hard to pass in the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA). 
   This ASP payment system was first implemented in the physician setting in 2005, and the ESRD setting for all drugs in 2006. 
   This system has been a great success across the board and moving to reimbursement rates at ASP+6 percent has demonstrated significant savings. 
   In fact, the Office of the Inspector General estimated annual savings of $1 billion because of the shift from the old Average Wholesale Price (AWP) system to the ASP system in 2005. 
   Starting in 2006, the ASP system included drugs used to treat anemia in ESRD patients, as well as all other ESRD drugs.  
   MedPAC has noted a decline in ESRD drug spending since the implementation of ASP and when looking at Erythropoeitin Stimulating Agents (ESAs), which are biologics used to treat anemia, in ESRD specifically, it is clear that ASP has resulted in a reduction in the price Medicare had previously paid for these biologics--going from $10 under a statutory rate from 1994-2004 to $9.10 today for one of these ESAs--EPOGEN. This is a 9 percent drop which represents real savings. 
   Additionally, there are provisions in the bill that propose to institute a statutory price controlled rate that would distort the market and ASP system by establishing a cap which restricts Medicare payment at a statutory rate of $8.75 or ASP+2 percent, whichever is less. 
   It would be a mistake to change a system that has reduced prices for this medicine by 6.8 percent since the ASP-based reimbursement system was implemented in January 2006 and by 9 percent compared to what Medicare paid for the drug back in 1994 under a statutory price controlled rate. 
   This market-based system is working now to drive down prices for Medicare and Congress shouldn't try to fix something if it's not broken. 
   Most importantly, I also question how a cut in payment would affect I patient care. A payment cut may create financial incentives to reduce or ration clinically beneficial drugs. 
   Dialysis providers may reduce their costs by providing fewer services and drugs, transferring patients to another setting of care, or discharging patients more quickly. 
   So when we are looking for ways to save money, a reduction in reimbursement levels could actually result in unintended consequences, such as increasing the number of ESRD patients who are hospitalized. 
   Published studies show that patients who are under dialyzed or who are suffering from anemia are more likely to be hospitalized. 
   Increases in hospitalization due to dialysis payment changes could end up being very costly to Medicare and taxpayers. 
   This is just bad policy rationale. 
   I am also concerned with a provision that would move to a fully bundled dialysis composite rate--that is bundling drugs and other separately billable services into a composite rate--for large dialysis providers beginning in 2010, and for all other dialysis providers by 2013. 
   Since passage of the MMA in 2003, CMS has tried to design and test a fully bundled payment system and has been unsuccessful. 
   I believe that CMS must be given more time to study this issue and complete the bundling demonstration authorized in the MMA that it has been working to implement to ensure that all of the complex factors that go into a bundled payment are accounted for and that patient care and access are not harmed under a bundled payment system. 
   Again, bundling may create financial incentives to reduce or ration care resulting in worse health outcomes. 
   An insufficient Medicare payment could cause facilities to close their doors or result in poor patient outcomes. 
   This underscores the need to test a bundled payment through a demonstration first before implementing. 
   Congress and CMS should be fully informed on how to protect patient access and quality before implementing bundling system-wide. 
   Although I am committed to the reauthorization of SCHIP I cannot support these types of cuts to Medicare. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Democrats' SCHIP expansion in its current form.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I start a period of time in which we're going to take opportunity to talk about SCHIP. 
   I strike the last word to speak about the expansion legislation that was pulled from the Energy and Commerce Committee. Reportedly, it will be on the floor later this week, and I would like to highlight the damage it will do, if enacted. Specifically, I'd like to take this opportunity to speak about the very popular Medicare Advantage program. 
   In Illinois, there are 1,715,548 Medicare beneficiaries. Of these, 145,600, or 8 percent, have selected to receive their health care coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, there are over 6,000 Medicare beneficiaries in my district that are currently enrolled in a Medicare Advantage program. 
   One of the most troubling things I have heard about the Democrats' bill is actually from Peter Orzag, who is the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. The Director said that under the Democrats' bill, Medicare Advantage enrollment would fall by approximately 8.2 million currently to 5.5 million in 2012, a reduction of 33 percent from current enrollment levels. 
   Medicare beneficiaries are among this Nation's most vulnerable citizens, and access to comprehensive high-quality affordable health care is imperative to their well-being. As we well know, the population of the United States over age 65 is growing rapidly. The average Medicare beneficiary is likely to have two or more chronic illnesses. Medicare beneficiaries should have choices for their health care coverage similar to those available to individuals under age 65. We should allow them to choose plans that best meet their unique health care needs and to help them coordinate their care, manage their illnesses, and reduce their out-of-pocket costs. 
   On average, beneficiaries that choose a Medicare Advantage plan in Illinois are receiving over $60 in extra value each month from their plans. This extra value comes in the form of savings on cost sharing and out-of-pocket protections and on lower part D premiums, or additional benefits like coverage for vision and hearing. Beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage plans report better access to care, more usual sources of care, and more likelihood of seeking care when needed than beneficiaries in traditional fee-for-service operations. 
   CMS has recently reported that beneficiaries in fee-for-service with no additional sources of coverage have more difficulty getting care and are less likely to have usual source of care than Medicare Advantage enrollees. 
   All Medicare beneficiaries have access to a Medicare Advantage plan that does not require cost sharing for screenings for breast cancer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer. Recently, CMS has reported that Medicare Advantage enrollees are more likely to receive preventative services, such as immunizations, mammography, and screenings for colorectal and prostate cancers. 
   Critics have implied that the Medicare Advantage program is contributing to the solvency problems facing the Medicare trust fund. However, these critics fail to recognize the extra value that Medicare Advantage plans provide that address the real drivers in increasing program costs. Medicare Advantage plans help control the volume and intensity of services used by beneficiaries in Medicare part A and part D by coordinating care, improving health outcomes, and monitoring enrollee usage. 
   Medicare Advantage generates savings in the part D program by helping to drive down the average premium paid by the government and beneficiaries, and by reducing Federal expenditures for beneficiaries eligible for low-income subsidies. 
   Critics have further distorted the facts by offering information that claims to suggest a ``fairness gap'' between Medicare Advantage payments and the other providers. In fact, Medicare Advantage payment rates increase in direct proportion to the Federal Government's estimates of increases in per capita costs in the fee-for-service program. 
   Some critics suggest that legislators must choose between providing comprehensive health coverage options to Illinois seniors through the Medicare Advantage program or providing coverage to Illinois uninsured children through SCHIP. Both programs play a crucial role in serving vulnerable populations. We should focus on devoting adequate resources to both SCHIP and Medicare Advantage, while working to maintain and strengthen all components of our Nation's health care safety net. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (HONORING RAY LaHOOD AND JERRY WELLER -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I, too, am honored to be here tonight just for 5 minutes to talk about two of my colleagues, two of my mentors, two of my friends who helped me as a new Member of Congress. They both served seven terms, finishing their seven terms, 14 years. One's about 10 years older, one is the same age. 
   Both represented--well, JERRY had parts of Cook County, Chicago in his first district, but mostly south of I-80 guys, which brings in a different dynamic in Illinois politics, which is rural, small town, agriculture interests.     
   I'd like first to spend time to talk about Jerry and his fight on the Ways and Means Committee primarily--most of us know him for eliminating the marriage penalty, and that was before Jerry got married. So it was no conflict of interest. He wasn't in doing things for himself. 
   And since that time not only did he save--I mean the basic debate that he made was this. Marriage should not be penalized under the Tax Code, and that position he fought hard and long for, and it has maintained itself until the loss of the majority here. And that marriage penalty is threatened unfortunately by Democratic control of Congress, and hopefully, they will make that permanent, and it will be a tribute to you, Jerry, if they do that. 
   Not only does he have a lovely young bride, a congresswoman, Zury Rios Sosa from Guatemala, but a lovely daughter, and I can't even pronounce her first name, Marizu Catherine Weller, and Jerry has been proud to show these pictures around. We understand why Jerry now has chosen a different path in life. He's got a lovely bride, a young daughter. This is not a very great profession for families. It's very challenging. And no one casts any disappointment on Jerry Weller choosing family over a profession here. 
   Jerry's been a confidante and friend. Our staffs are very close. My chief of staff worked in his first campaign. JERRY has been very helpful to me. He knows that. I'm honored to call you a friend, and I look forward to working with you for many years to go. 
   Ray LaHood. These guys are like two polar opposite-type guys. Ray's come up through the political system as a staff director for Leader Bob Michel, a State rep himself, a man of the institution. Shocking that he would decide to leave because he loves the institution so much. Ray is close friends with former Speaker Denny Hastert. He's a guy that you always know where Ray stands, and he's not embarrassed to tell you, and he's not embarrassed to tell his constituents when they agree with him and when they don't. 
   Ray has a unique ability to confront those in opposition with him forcefully and firmly. Some of those attributes I've tried to take on because sometimes you have to confront those who attack your values and your position. You've got to attack it front on. You don't want to be coy. You just want to tell them what it is you believe and why, and that's what Ray has always brought to the table. 
   Ray and I have had our own fights, but our friendship and loyalty has lasted through the time of our service. He's also finishing his seventh term, that means 14 years as a Member of the House, many years with Leader Michel, probably 30-plus years in Federal service that he's done for this great country. 
   A man from Peoria, born, raised there, lives there, went to school there, again a southern Illinoisan who tries to balance the interests of rural America and agriculture interests with some of the big, monumental issues of our time. He proudly represented Caterpillar, which the home office is in Peoria, and made sure, as Jerry Weller did, the importance of trade to both our agricultural community and manufacturing sector, especially Caterpillar. 
   These are good friends, mentors to me, mentors when I was doing stuff right and mentors when I was probably going off the track and I needed some direction to stay focused on the responsibilities as a Member of Congress. Jerry was always there to help me do that. Ray definitely was, also. I appreciate that. 
   We're going to miss them, but they have chosen to pursue other pursuits. We want to honor and recognize that, and I want to thank them publicly for their service.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Well, thank you, Judge. You're a friend and a colleague, someone that helps us share a laugh and a joke. We also know of your powerful oratory ability when things need to be said. I don't know if I have seen you so emotionally engaged in this tribute to your colleague and friend. I think that is probably one of the best tributes you can give someone. So it was noticed by me. And I know it was noticed by your colleague. And I know she appreciates it. 
   I'm going to take a few minutes just to tie two things together. We had this great financial crisis. 
   This financial crisis is based upon two events. One is the subprime financial mortgage issue that has worked its way through Wall Street. The other one is high energy prices. And these two things have really put a damper on the economy. 
   We've had some great successes in this Congress with this CR that just passed. After a good couple of months about fighting over the oil and natural reserves in this country, we won. The OCS moratorium has been lifted, and the moratorium on oil shale has been lifted. 
   Now what am I talking about? I'm talking about that we, as legislators, especially on the Outer Continental Shelf, which are these areas here, the red, since 1982, we said we're not going to allow any Federal money to be spent to lease areas for exploration and recovery of oil and gas, thus depriving the country of the revenues from those areas and depriving those countries from the jobs that would be created. And so we, with the consistent drumbeat, have, for this time, for this short time, have won that fight. Also here, we see three mountain States in which we also put off-limits recovery exploration of oil shale. Oil shale can be turned into liquid fuels. We said we're not going to allow any Federal money to be spent to allow that to happen. In the continuing resolution, these moratoriums were taken off the books so that now, we know it still takes years, the Federal Department of Mines and Minerals are going to have to go through the regulation and accept the request and do that action, but at least these things can start. And when we're exploring for oil and gas and starting to recover that, we're using oil shale to turn into fuel, we've got a couple of things happen. We bring on more supply. 
   Now I'm not one that says we're going to drive prices down to prices that they were a year, a year and a half ago. But I will say what we do want to do at a minimum is stabilize energy prices. And hopefully we can drive them down. But we do need to stabilize them, because the middle class, the poor and rural America are those who are hurt the most by high energy prices. And it hurts our ability to buy goods and services, and it depresses our economy. 
   It didn't take very long for the ink to dry on the CR, the continuing resolution, when rumors started coming out from the Democratic leadership saying, we were just joking, as soon as we come back, we're going to replace that moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf, thus depriving us of the oil and gas in those areas and depriving us of those revenues that can be generated to help grow our economy. So I'm just putting my friends on the other side on notice. We're going to do what we did in this Congress next Congress. And we're going to hold them accountable. And we're not going to allow them to take these areas that we have now opened and open it and allow them to use it for this political short period of time to get re-elected and then come back here and close it. If they think they had a fight this year, wait until next year. We are going to sharpen our swords, and we're going to be ready to come back. And I think it's going to be much more difficult for them to make the case that they should close these areas up. 
   So I want to come down here tonight, obviously a great competitor in the political arena and public policy is the majority leader, Steny Hoyer. Actually most of us really like the majority leader. But his quotes today say, we're going to do this first order of business, we're going to close these areas up. And to the majority leader, I just say, we're ready to go and fight for this in the long haul because it will be good for jobs and the economy and lowering the energy costs for average Americans. 
   So Judge Gohmert, I appreciate your allowing me to share some of your time tonight. I look forward to the conclusion of this Congress. And I'm even looking more expectantly to the next Congress as we try to continue to use all our natural resources that we have. We won on OCS. We won on oil shale. We have a long way to go on coal. We still have the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We have great places that we can recover oil, gas and coal and make this country more energy independent. And I know with your help we're going to be able to that.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Well I do want to highlight the fact everybody talks about the trade deficit, and what is the biggest impact on the trade deficit is our purchasing of energy from foreign countries, especially in this era of high energy prices. This $700 billion number that you're referring to is a transfer of wealth from Americans to some of our friends, Canadians, they are our largest importer. We import from them. They are a large exporter of energy to us, and Mexico, but we also transfer our wealth to places where we're not sure about our relationship. We know Venezuela is not our friend. We have an interesting relationship with Saudi Arabia. One day we're close, and the next  day they may be funding our enemies. They fund our enemies through oil revenues that we're paying. 
   There is a better way. And that is to become more energy independent. And what I like about this debate, and I think you are alluding to it a little bit, is when we are recovering oil and gas and oil shale and I would say coal in other places, the government receives royalty payments for that exploration.     
   Congressman Barton, the ranking member now of Energy and Commerce, has proposed, hey, if we are going to have to do this great outlay of money to stabilize the economy, we have a place we can go for revenues. Great idea. Let's have a pay-for. These would be great pay-fors. 
   Now, that hasn't really been resolved in this debate, but I still have always historically on the floor talked about the jobs that are created when you look for, find and then recover oil and gas in the OCS and the oil shale. And, of course, I am talking about that because that was part of the continuing resolution. Those are the provisions. 
   In fact, the majority leader of the Senate in the CR wanted to strip this portion out. In fact, he is trying right now, to say, oh, the House was wrong. They shouldn't have eased the moratorium on oil shale. I want to put that back on. 
   I don't think he is going to be successful. But the fact that in the Senate they want to do that and in the House they are talking already about doing the OCS, what does that do for the average consuming citizen of this country, and what signal does it send to the futures markets? It says, well, is the government serious about opening supply, or are we not? 
   We Republicans are serious about an all-American energy policy that brings in all our natural resources. Are our friends on the other side just playing a cruel joke on the country, saying yeah, we said so now, but, man, wait until January. We are just going to take it right back. I hope it is not a cruel joke, because it will cost my constituents a boatload of money, our schools, our hospitals, our jobs. 
   Again, we need to continue the fight that we started early this spring, through the summer, through the end of this Congress.

   But he wanted to come back. He wanted to participate in this debate, because he knew the history of this. Sometimes you think, oh, it is just the young firebrands. But he knew what we were doing, and because he had experienced the story you just told, he said I wanted to be part of that, because I want to set the record straight of what happened and why, and why we need to use this great resource that we have available for our energy security and for jobs and the economy.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, my coal Democrats, who have promised me that they would take one vote in this Congress to advance coal, and we have not seen it. And my colleagues will want to attack the oil, but the best way to get off of imported crude oil is to use coal. 
   There is nothing in the Democrat bill that advances coal use; nothing, zero--no oil shale, no coal, no oil sands, nothing. It's not a comprehensive plan.  
   We can turn coal into liquid fuel. That's what our Department of Defense wants. We can turn coal into clean burning electricity. That's what the environmentalists want. But is there anything for coal in this bill? No. 
   If you vote for this Democrat bill, you are voting against coal. It's our largest resource that we have in this country. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. We do not use it fully, you all know it. Speaker Pelosi hates coal, hates it, and that's why it's not in this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's great to be on the floor tonight, coming back from a week's break, and I'm sure everybody is coming back with the number one issue on their mind, which is high energy prices. If they are not, they were traveling overseas and they were looking at the gas prices overseas. I mean if they were home, I don't think you could find anyone who wasn't talked to about high energy prices. 
   I learned a couple of things. I did a couple of radio shows. One, I just think because many of us have been talking about this issue for so long, we have to be careful that we don't become a little energy arrogant and continue to help educate the public on the basic economic principles of the law of supply and demand. That is what we are basically addressing tonight, and it's really difficult to understand how what students are taught in a basic economics course at the college level is not understood here on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   The other thing I learned on a radio show yesterday, a person called in and said, When are you guys going to talk about drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf? I wanted to reach through the wires and grab that caller and say, What do you think we have been doing for 10 weeks straight on the floor of the House? 
   I want to encourage my colleagues to not give up, not lose hope. We have got to continue to talk about this. So I appreciate you grabbing the time, allowing us to come down on the floor. 
   I was going to ask how many folks have signed. You said 191 have signed the petition. I know we have some Democrats who have signed it. I saw one before the break. We know that we would like more. We know the challenges that they are under not to do that. But I think come election time, as we get closer, we have a production majority here on the floor of the House. I know it. I know who they are. If we can get a bill to the floor. 
   I wish my colleague, Mr. Roskam was here. I was up in Chicago with him today. He talked about the gas price in Wheaton, which is his hometown, his home area. But we had to drive to the airport. We drove past gas stations, $4.47 in the Chicago area. That is not including climate change, which would add another 50 cents. So you're already over $5 a gallon. That is what we are looking at. Because here's the basic problem. I have tried to be a little less rancorous in my debate. 
   When the Democrats took over, $58. Today, it's $140. When President Bush came in, it was $23 a barrel. All I am saying when I hold this chart up is the trend line is bad. It doesn't matter where you go, whether you go when Bush got sworn in or whether you go here when the Democrats took control or whether you look at the price today, that trend line is not positive, and it disproportionately hurts middle class, the lower middle class, rural, small town citizens of our country, which I represent. 
   I represent 30 counties in southern Illinois. We have to drive long distances to get to health care, we have to drive long distances to get to our schools. We have to drive long distances to get to our work. You know what? The poor can't afford the Priuses of the world right now. The poor are purchasing used cars off the lots because that is the only thing they can afford. So if that is the problem, the question is: What is the solution? 
   My colleague from Georgia did a great job. All of the above. Let's open up the Outer Continental Shelf, let's use fuel from coal, let's go wind and solar, let's do the renewal fuels. The great thing about our position is, and I got asked numerous times, Well, what about solar? I said, Great. What about wind? I am going to have a big wind generation field in my district. I'm happy about it, excited about it, and pledged to do all I can to help. 
   So I say, Bring it on. Any idea we have to help decrease our lives of imported crude oil by bringing on more supply, decreasing--we talked about conservation. Our citizens are conserving now. They are forced to conserve because of the high cost. So we are driving less miles this year than we were last year. Driving less miles and we are paying more. That is kind of the Democrat energy policy, drive less, pay more. I don't like that.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Well, you know the best way for a bill to get passed and signed into law, especially with a Republican President, is to work through the committee process. A lot of this would start in my subcommittee, the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, chaired by a good friend of mine. In fact he is a cosponsor of the Boucher-Shimkus bill. 
   If allowed, we could move an energy security bill that would really address what Americans want, which is to decrease our reliance on imported crude oil from those countries that are enemies of our state or unstable; focus on North American energy, that means the deployment of all our energy resources; continues our great relationship with Canada and Mexico; do the renewables, do the efficiency standards, and move. 
   So the answer is no. All the bills have come to the floor without any committee hearings. The only thing we have been able to do is offer motions to recommit. We have done that numerous times on alternative fuel standards, which would bring in coal-to-liquid. We have done that on other generation issues. Of course, they are more of a party-line vote, and they all fail. 
   But historically, in votes that have been cast on this floor since 1994, the facts just speak for themselves: 90 percent of all Republicans support more supply; 90 percent of all Democrats do not support more supply. They vote against more supply, they vote against refineries. But there is 10 percent. The Speaker pro tempore is a friend of the fossil fuel area, I understand. They are there. We just need to help them help us help the country.

One is because that is there for our national security in case the sea lanes get closed. Since we don't have enough production on our own, like the farmers would say, it is like eating the seed corn. If you eat the seed corn, you have no seed to plant for the next year. Foolish. Foolhardy. A scary proposal. Versus moving in the discharge petition we will talk about coal-to-liquid technologies. 
   Better than to pump out the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, let's develop gas from our own coalfields. There is 250 years worth of supply in Southern Illinois. There are American jobs mining it, American jobs building the refinery, American jobs operating the refinery, American jobs building the pipeline to American jobs, wherever that goes. Whether it is diesel fuel, gasoline, or whether it is aviation fuel, we can do it. 
   Don't do something silly, which is take the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, pump all that oil out of there, and then you are done. You have no reserves.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (AMERICA NEEDS TO DEVELOP ITS OWN NATURAL RESOURCES -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I want to thank my colleague, and I appreciate it. 
   A couple of things I want to highlight. When he talks about supply, we have a 250 years worth supply of coal in this country, 250 years that we can have access to. And according to the Federal Government, there is enough oil in deep waters many miles off our coast and on Federal land to power more than 60 million cars for 60 years. So your point about supply is important and a critical portion of this debate, and really what separates Republicans from the Democrats as we fight about these energy costs. 
   We believe that when you bring more supply to the public that's demanding it, prices will go low. Speaker Pelosi promised, on April 24, 2006, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down the skyrocketing gas prices.'' Well, they have a plan, but the plan was just the opposite of what she envisioned. Here's a barrel of crude oil, $58.31 when she became Speaker of the House; the price today, $115.92. That, as I stated on this floor numerous times, that is bitter change, that's negative change. Change is not always good. This is bad change. This is change that was promised by the current leadership in the House.  
   Now, how does that translate into the fuel for the soccer moms in the country? Well, when the Democrat majority came in, the price of gasoline at the pump was $2.33. Today, it stands at, on average, $3.65, a huge increase. Again, negative change based upon what was promised by the then Democrats in the minority. What they said, what happened when they got into the majority, they promised change. This isn't the change that we bargained for. 
   And just because I like to bring in the aspect that energy is the item that affects every aspect of our lives, as I said last week, in the Coast Guard Authorization bill, for every dollar increase in diesel fuel, it costs our Coast Guard $24 million. For every dollar increase in a barrel of crude oil, it costs our United States Air Force $60 million. For the sake of the taxpayers we ought to be demanding more supply. 
   And BILL, you know the coal-to-liquid opportunities that are up in your neck of the woods, and how the Air Force is pleading with us for energy security, for the ability for them to project their cost, and really for national security. Isn't it crazy that our military is dependent upon foreign sources of energy to run our war machines? Not only is it crazy, it's scary. And I would make the argument that it's negligent on our part to keep our military financially reliant on imported energy and really militarily at risk, where we could, in essence, be blackmailed with the threat of controlling those supplies when we need to move our war machines. 
   Add to this, I always like to add this on this chart, $3.65 is the price. Guess what happens when we moved to climate change? Chairman Dingell of the Commerce Committee is the only intellectually honest person who started talking about climate change, and he said, ``for us to address climate change, it will require an additional 50 cents per gallon of gas.'' So now if we've got, on average, $3.65 and we add 50 cents for climate change, that means right now, before we get to the summer driving season, people will be paying $4.15 for a gallon of gasoline. That is bitter change. That is change that the public did not agree to when Speaker Pelosi made her promise in 2006. 
   And this highlights what you were talking about. Here's a comic. And you know when issues start getting into the media and the folks start making fun of public policy in America that you've really got a point that's resonating. ``We demand you energy companies do something about these high prices.'' Isn't that what we're hearing our friends from the other side of the aisle? Okay, energy companies, do something. Can we drill in ANWR? Forget it. How about offshore? Are you crazy? Clean coal? Out of the question. Nuclear power? You're joking, right? Well, don't just sit there, do something. 
   And what do we hear from the other side of this building? What we hear is, which is laughable, let's add more taxes to the energy companies. Now, where in the history of this country, when you've added more taxes do you get lower prices? I would challenge anybody on the other side of the aisle to show me any time in history where we added more taxes and we lowered the price of a good. You know what? They can't do it. It's ludicrous. 
   And then they also say, I know what, we're going to force the people who are selling us the oil, we're going to force them to drill and produce more oil when we won't even do that ourselves. How crazy is that? 
   So as my colleague, Mr. Sali, pointed out, we have options, we have solutions. We mentioned many of them. One is, take our natural resources in coal, over 250 years of coal resources. Now, I would rather have the good midwestern Illinois coal-basing coal that you have to go underground, not stuff you can get off the surface like in some of the western States, but here is a picture of a western State. Grab that, build a refinery, refine that coal into a fuel, stick it in a pipeline, send it to our Air Force bases, or send it to our airports. How many recent budget airlines have just gone bankrupt? At my count, there's four. Think of all the job losses. Think of all the health care now that's no longer accessible to those families. Why did they go bankrupt? High jet fuel costs. 
   One solution would be this; and the great thing about this is, American jobs in the coal mines, American jobs to build a refinery, American jobs to operate the refinery. These are good-paying jobs with good benefits. 
   American jobs to build a pipeline. And of course, these are American jobs to fly the airplanes and operate the airfields or protect us. 
   So with that, I would like to yield to my colleague from Tennessee (Mr. David Davis).

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Thank you. 
   And I have a few comments. Immediately after you mentioned Mac Thornberry's bill, I also signed onto the No More Excuses Energy Act. 
   The school bus folks were in town today, and what I have really gotten an appreciation of over the past year is, as I said earlier, how energy costs affect everything. 
   Look at the cost to the local school district, who is paying for the school buses to pick up the kids. The prices of diesel fuel are double. It's not planned in the budget. How are they going to meet these costs? Many will have to go back to the voters of the local control school that we have, and they're going to have to raise taxes to pay for it. There's no benefit to that for the kids. I mean they're still driving the same buses. That is a lost opportunity for money to go in a different direction to help educate kids but now has to go to fund the transportation system to get kids to school. 
   So I appreciate those comments.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. And it's silly that we're not going after our own resources and our own supply when Russia is attempting to grab vast chunks of the Arctic to claim its vast potential of oil and gas and mineral wealth to fuel their country's economy. And actually, as we know, and I've got a friend from Michigan who knows this, they use energy to extort and impose their will on the free governments of the former captive nations, and they use it as an extortion tool. And they're going after resources and we don't. It's crazy. 
   Russia and China have overtaken the United States in dominating the global energy industry. China's building 40 nuclear plants. China opened a new domestic energy reserve in 2004. China is increasing offshore energy production. In fact, China is in league with Cuba to go after Outer Continental Shelf oil 50 miles off Miami, 50 miles. We can't go there, but we're allowing the Communist Chinese access to the gas and oil reserves on the Outer Continental Shelf. And there's much, much more. 
   It is ludicrous that we are the only industrialized nation in the world that does not go after and use our own resources. How crazy is that? It's time we stopped. And I hope the public is getting significantly angry enough that they are going to demand that this House does something to open up reserves. 
   Now I'm joined by my good friend and colleague KEVIN BRADY from Texas.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague. 
   There is something about the American character. We believe that America is strong because we have this value of rugged individualism, that we believe in self-reliance. And what galls Americans in this debate is that the Democrats are demanding increased oil production everywhere but in America. I mean the Democrats demand increased oil production everywhere around the world but America. And when they do that, they are creating jobs everywhere in the world except in America. 
   Here's the result of their ``no'' policy: When they came in, $2.33 per gallon of gas. On average today, $3.65. You add to that a 50 cent global warming tax, and we would be paying at the pump today $4.15. The barrel of crude oil, the feedstock, when this Democrat majority came in, $58.31. What is it today? It's $115.92. 
   There's a 250-year supply. And by far the least expensive fuel we have in coal reserves across this country, the largest coal reserves of any country in the world, is right here in the United States. And according to the Federal Government, there's enough oil in deep waters many miles off our coast, and on Federal land--that's not on the coast, that's just on Federal land--to power more than 60 million cars for 60 years.

   There's a great op ed today in the Washington Post by Robert Samuelson. I want to read the first paragraph: ``What to do about oil? First it went from $60 to $80 a barrel, then from $80 to $100 and now to $120. Perhaps we can persuade OPEC to raise production, as some Senators suggest; but this seems unlikely. The truth is that we are almost powerless to influence today's prices. We are because we didn't take sensible actions 10 or 20 years ago. If we persist, we will be even worse off 
   in a decade or two. The first thing to do is start drilling.''

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague for coming. In reality, and I taught high school for a couple of years, and when you don't make a decision, you have made a decision. Even though you don't have a policy, you in fact have a policy. 
   Our debate is that when the Democrats promised us, when Speaker Pelosi promised us, and I quote, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices''; and when Majority Leader Steny Hoyer promised, ``Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with his gas prices,'' well, they sure did more. They just burdened struggling citizens with higher gas prices. Democrat Whip JIM CLYBURN said, ``House Democrats will have a plan to help curb rising gas prices.'' 
   When you don't have a plan, the plan that you have is a plan for failure. This is a planned failure, $58 to $115. Facts are hard things to dispute. Gasoline prices, $2.33, $3.65. That is Speaker Pelosi's plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices. They are skyrocketing gas prices but they are not being brought down. They are continuing to go up.  
   So Monday we had truckers driving around Washington, D.C. protesting the high cost of diesel fuel. I have got independent truckers going bankrupt. In fact, I brought to the floor in the last couple of weeks a picture of a local strike of independent strikers protesting the high cost of diesel. 
   My friend, Congressman Brady, highlights the fact that many small town, independent, self-employed people are not making any profit this year because the profit they had planned, it's all going into pay the high cost of gasoline. This is failure. 
   We would hope our colleagues on the other side would recognize this failure and come to the floor and help us fix this. But their solution is demanding on other countries more drilling when they won't demand drilling in our own country. And then they have this convoluted idea that if you tax people, that is going to lower prices. I challenge them anywhere historically to show me a time when you have raised taxes and prices have come down. 
   In fact, I have got the perfect colleague to come up here and talk, a CPA and accountant. He has probably seen a lot of small businesses, probably seen a lot of tax burden come onto businesses. I am not sure those tax burdens have ever lowered the cost of that company doing business. But I would like to welcome Congressman Conaway from Texas.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I appreciate that. And I have tried to segue a little bit of the climate change debate. We mentioned it here with Chairman Dingell. To be intellectually honest, a carbon tax would be a way to go. He says 50 cents a gallon. So if the average price today is $3.65, you add 50 cents a gallon, Americans will be paying $4.15 a gallon. Now, even in the cap and trade program, really cap and trade equates to 50 cents a gallon. And we just want folks to be intellectually honest and be clear, so the public has to understand. 
   An issue out today, politicians beware, the issue tied for last, climate change tied for last on a list of domestic priorities for President Bush and Congress in a 2008 survey from the Pew Research Center for the people in the press, lagging behind influence of lobbyists, moral breakdown, et cetera. Last. But California just passed a 20 to 30 percent increase on the electricity bills to deal with climate change. So if we want lower energy prices, we need more supply. 
   Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I'm going to count to 10 and make sure I'm calm and deliberative. I do appreciate my friends on the other side. 
   Throughout the process in our committee, numerous times I've heard the promise that we will have coal provisions in the Greenhouse Gas Bill this fall, and I think we kind of heard it again today. I am skeptical. I am a doubter. I don't believe it will happen. That's why I'm upset about the bill today. 
   We just heard Education and Workforce people talk about jobs. I'll talk about jobs; coal-to-liquid jobs. One coal-to-liquid refinery that produces 80,000 barrels of coal-to-liquid, a thousand jobs, 2,500 to 5,000 construction jobs, 15 million tons of coal per year, and up to 500 coal mining jobs. Those are real jobs with great benefits and great wages. 
   Energy security. We have our soldiers deployed in the Middle East, and they've been there for a lot of reasons for many, many years. I think it was Carter who said the Persian Gulf region was an important national security interest. Why? We know why. Crude oil. How do we decrease that importance of the Persian Gulf region? We move to coal-to-liquid technologies, our coal fields to a coal-to-liquid refinery, through a pipeline to fuel our aviation assets that the Department of Defense really wants. 
   What is wrong with this bill? Everything. No soy diesel. No renewable fuel standard. No ethanol. No renewable fuel standard. No coal. No alternative fuel standard. Nothing on nuclear energy. No expansion. There is no supply in this bill. Defeat this bill.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about natural gas for a few minutes. Natural gas is a major commodity product in a lot of what we do in our country. I think this chart basically shows that as the price of natural gas goes up jobs go down. We are not competitive with countries around the world on natural gas. 
   Look what we have done and what we continue to do in this bill. It is amazing how our major coastal States want to drive us to energy efficiency, they want to use electricity, but they don't want us to use the natural resources off their coast. 
   This is a map of our country. It shows all the areas in red that are off limits for natural gas exploration. So we have the States of Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont; we have the great State of California, Oregon, Washington State. Guess what? It is okay if we use natural gas, but don't get it from our Outer Continental Shelf. 
   What do they do in this bill? They put a big ``don't get it from'' the mountain States any more. So we continue to want to use electricity, we continue to want to use natural gas, but you know what, we don't want to explore for it. That is why I am concerned about this bill. 
   I have great friends, and I appreciate the efficiency debate. Light cars, light bulbs, it could be a little bit of help.     
   But if we don't move with a renewable fuel standard, if we don't use coal in an alternative fuel standard, if we don't continue to move on ethanol, if we don't expand nuclear options and hopefully move to a hydrogen economy, we're kidding ourselves. We have to do both. To come to this floor and say that this is going to decrease our reliance on imported crude oil and this is going to make us safer is not correct. 
   Vote against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, upon conclusion of this debate, I will be offering the motion to recommit. 
   The motion to recommit will require the House conferees to adopt the House position, which was supported in a motion to instruct conferees on this floor only 2 days ago by a vote of 258-167, 69 of them being Democrats, including nine Science Committee Democrats. 
   For fiscal conservatives, this would require the conferees to insist on the overall House authorization level, which is $20 billion less. For the second part of this motion, it would require the House conferees to again support the previously adopted House position with regard to giving priority grants to expand domestic energy production through the use of coal-to-liquid technology and advanced nuclear reprocessing. 
   Again, this was the exact motion to recommit of 2 days ago. 
   I have heard the debate of my friends: if we want to have a blueprint to where we want to go, we want to go for energy security. We are going to take up a bill on the House floor in a day or two that has no energy production. So how are we going to go advance science research, the next generation, if we don't have priority grants in nuclear reprocessing and coal-to-liquid technology? 
   We heard the debate. We know that people want to go to coal-to-liquid technologies, but we don't know if it's going to work. We don't know if we can sequester. We don't know if we can refine it less than the barrel of crude oil. That's what this energy is for. Energy security. 
   Let's get our best minds on this, but the conference report pulled it out. That's why I will offer the motion to recommit. 
   Two things on coal-to-liquid, I could talk about nuclear reprocessing all day. It should be in this bill. But I want to focus on coal-to-liquid technology, economic security, national security. 
   Look what coal-to-liquid does, are 80,000 barrels, 1,000 new jobs, 2,500 to 5,000 construction jobs, 15 million tons of coal per year, up to 500 coal mining jobs in one coal-to-liquid refinery. 
   Talk about national security? Here's national security for you. Are you tired of our reliance on imported crude oil from the Middle East? If you are tired of it, then you go to coal-to-liquid technologies. You take our coal that's under our ground. You move it up to a refinery that's not on the gulf coast, that's in the Midwest, or wherever there are coal fields in this country, you refine it, you put it in our pipelines, and as this shows, you know where it goes? To our jet fighter planes, to our jet cargo planes. 
   The Department of Defense is crying for us to provide jet fuel for them through this technology. But, no, we can't do it. 
   Here you got a science bill, you want to give grants to help us move in the next generation, you pull out nuclear reprocessing, and you pull out coal-to-liquid technology. You are going to bring to the bill an energy bill with no energy. That's why I am moving this motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and my good friend, Congresswoman Tauscher. 
   This is a tough bill, and I appreciate it being brought to the floor. People know I come here heartfelt because of my 25 years connected with the United States Army. I don't like to throw that out. You know that. An Army Ranger and Army paratrooper, still an active reservist, but I have become frustrated that we are losing sight of why we have a military. 
   The mission of the United States military is to fight and win our Nation's wars. Now, many people don't want us to have a military, I understand that, but I think the best hope for democracy and freedom in the world today, even in our work with NATO, is a strong, powerful, committed, professional United States military, and we work on that with our NATO allies. 
   The mission of the infantry is to get close with and destroy our enemies. Destroy our enemies, to go after them and fight them and send down the message that we're going to fight you until you leave us alone. 
   Now, there are folks on the other side who don't want us to have that. I am one that thinks it's necessary to have in this country. So I don't think we're in conflict. I do think that we have lost some faith in our leadership in the military. I still have it. I still think our career military officers will make the tough call to deploy and use their troops. 
   I'm going a little bit slower than I hoped because I'm talking from the heart, but more than just the officer rank, it's the career enlisted leaders. In the Army, it's the command sergeant majors all the way up, from the commanding down to the first sergeant in the company. You have to believe that they will raise the issue about whether their troops cannot perform the mission. That is part of who they are. And when you fight in the trenches and you develop that bond that makes you an effective fighting force, how dare they not think about their soldiers first. I think they do. 
   I believe in the military. I think their heart's right, and our volunteer military is the best on the face of the earth today. I know we want to keep it that way. 
   I'm not sure this is the right way to go, but I just wanted to come down and talk from the military's perspective.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for your time and the speedy movement of this resolution, and it's timely with the President's trip to Europe. 
   A few things of note. I continue to follow, as the chairman knows, the occurrences in the former captive nations, the European Union countries, and mostly the Baltic countries, and it seems like we can never get to forgiveness. It seems like countries always go back to another point in time to address their grievances. 
   I've been on the floor numerous times to talk about Molotov-Ribbentrop, and we've debated that and we've voted on that resolution. We forget about Roosevelt's land lease deal that was very helpful to the Soviet Union at that time, and as the chairman's correct, we also forget about the sacrifices made by the Soviet Union in winning World War II, especially on the Eastern  front. So his concerns are well-founded and very much appreciated by this Member. 
   There was great hope after the fall of the Wall, as I served on the German border during the Cold War era, that this would bring a new time for Europe, a time of prosperity and peace, the rule of law, democratic institutions. And that's why we continue to be frustrated by the current involvement, because when there is peace and stability and the rule of law, the people prosper, people on both sides of the boundary lines. In this case the Estonians and across the border, the Russians, they would both benefit from peaceful relations and coexistence. 
   But we just can't get there yet, and so that's why I'm very appreciative of bringing this resolution because the decision by the Estonian government to move the memorial, as the chairman said, probably not proper in his estimation, I know that it can be said that it was done with dignity, with consultation and moved to a place in a military cemetery and given all the respects offered. 
   But having said that, what a free and independent country, a decision it can make, doesn't justify the result. Again, that's why going back to the comments of, can't we just forgive and can't we just move forward, the great nations do not have to bully small neighbors. Great nations can stand side by side with their smaller allies and their neighbors to help them develop and grow. 
   And what we see from the Russian Federation is just the opposite. We see them continually harass and bully their neighbors. Their neighbors have made choices that we expect free and democratic countries to be able to make, and just because the Russian Federation are unhappy with that it does not give them the right to bypass the rule of international law. 
   So this issue, as has been discussed earlier, the result of the movement of the statue led to riots within Estonia by ethnic Russians and also problems in the capital of Moscow, and as Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said, any impartial observer would say that there was a move by the government to specifically not stop them, and there is great evidence that they helped encourage this ability to be thugs and bullies to ambassadors and government representatives of free and democratic countries. 
   That's why I'm very thankful that the committee seemed right to bring this resolution speedily to the floor. As cochair of the House Baltic Caucus, I've been heavily involved for 10 years with NATO expansion, the EU expansion and the energy disputes. 
   Estonia is one of our closest allies and friends in Europe. They have been an integral part in our war on terror in having troops in Afghanistan. 
   That is why House Resolution 397 is so important. The U.S. House of Representatives must stand with our Estonian friends and refuse to let them be bullied by the Russian government. The intimidation that President Putin is using against our allies in Eastern Europe is simply unacceptable. 
   Again, I'd like to thank the chairman for bringing this to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, as many people who have observed the House floor over the past month, I have continuously come down to address the high cost of energy and the importance of bringing the supply issue to this debate. 
   One of the things that we have been successful with, which is now under attack, it was once a success story, was E-85, ethanol and the entire debate of bringing more supply to this debate. 
   This motion to instruct highlights the importance of E-85 fueling stations and developing that. For example, in my home State of Illinois, I am very fortunate. We have 171 E-85 fueling stations. In my congressional district, I can go all throughout my 30 counties and fuel up with my flex-fuel vehicle E-85.     
   There are States in the Union that cannot. An example, Maine, we couldn't get any information on. Rhode Island has zero, Vermont has zero, Delaware has one, where other States, like Minnesota, has 346. 
   One of the issues of more supply is also more supply locations. When we move to new fuels, as other people talk about, if we move to a hydrogen economy, we are going to need hydrogen-fueling stations, and that's all part of the importance. 
   This motion to instruct says let's do what the Senate did on the farm bill, and let's talk about developing an E-85 infrastructure around this country so we can help decrease our reliance on imported crude oil. Why? Because everything we talk about on this floor revolves around energy and the high cost of energy, especially for the producers of our food. 
   For example, manufacturer inputs have increased 14 percent in 2008 on top of a 12 percent increase last year. That's inputs to grow our food. Corn fertilizer costs $140 per acre for 2008, compared to $115 price in 2007, contrasted to $63 per acre from 2001-2005. 
   What is driving up high farmers' input costs? No additional supply. A lot of fertilizers are affected, all buy natural gas. As we continue to restrict our ability to go after more supply, we push up the input costs, which drives up the price for food and this whole debate. 
   I can go through all the huge increases that our farmers have had to do. DAP, prices rose from $252 per ton in January, 2007, to $752 gulf price. Urea rose from $272 to $415, muriate of potash rose from $173 to $252. We can just go on. It's a huge, huge increase. 
   Now we don't want to come down to the floor without bringing alternatives and solutions. What's the solution? The solution is more supply. 
   Look at what's happened. It's not disputable. Under this majority, crude oil has gone from $58 a barrel to $123. I come down almost every day. This price has not gone down. This price continues to go up.  
   We have had promises made by Democrat leadership. In 2006, I quoted them before, Speaker Pelosi saying, ``We have a plan to drive down energy costs.'' Majority Leader Hoyer who just spoke: ``We have a plan to bring down energy costs.'' JIM CLYBURN: ``We have a plan to drive down energy costs.'' 
   The reality is, energy costs have gone up, not down, $58 a barrel to $123. What has that done for us at the pump? When the Democrat majority took over, the price for a gallon of gasoline was $2.33 on average. What is it today, on average, $3.66. 
   Put in climate change tax, 50 cents, $4.16 is what we would be paying today with climate change. That's not a plan. In fact, it's a plan to fail. If you don't have a plan, you plan to fail, and that's the difficulty of our farmers getting into the field. Diesel costs have doubled, rising the price. Ethanol gets blamed. Ethanol gets blamed because energy costs to get the corn out of the fields has gone up. You want corn prices down? We have got to lower this. 
   We have got to get back to the day of $58 a barrel crude oil. We can't get there with no plan. We can't get there by every week saying we have got a plan, and there is no plan. 
   There is a plan. We have brought them onto the floor numerous times. What can we do? One is use our great natural resources on coal in this country, 250 years worth of coal to be used using coal-to-liquid technology. Get coal from our underground, build a coal-to-liquid refinery, pipe it, in this case, to an Air Force base, pipe it to a commercial airline. We have lost all these airline jobs because of high costs. This is what we do. 
   Guess what you can make: Diesel fuel. Diesel fuel. What is the farmers' major input? Diesel fuel, because that's what goes in the tractors when you have got to plant the corn. That's what goes in the tractor when you have got to harvest the corn or the beans, and diesel fuel has cost. Truckers are going on strike. Independent truckers are going on strike. 
   A lot of these independent truckers are hauling the beans, hauling the corn to the elevator. Without a plan to lower cost of energy, you plan to fail. Coal-to-liquid is a solution. 
   What is another solution? See all this red area? We don't have Alaska on there. Off-limits. Off-limits for natural gas. Off-limits for crude oil. Let's open up these areas. The environmentalists will say, oh, no, we can't do that. One of our major areas for crude oil and natural gas is the gulf. 
   Guess what happened here? Katrina, big storm, devastated New Orleans. A major oil spill in the gulf? No, no major oil spill. 
   We can do it cleanly, we can do it efficiently, we can bring more supply to the market. You want to know how to lower prices for the farmers? Lower energy prices. 
   But what's our policy here? Can we drill in ANWR? 
   ``Forget it.'' 
   What about offshore? 
   ``Are you crazy?'' 
   Clean coal? 
   ``Out of the question.'' 
   Nuclear power? 
   ``You're just joking.'' 
   Well, what are we going to do about the high price of energy? When you have no plan, you plan to fail. My farmers, who are getting accused for high prices, have high prices because we have high energy costs, and we have high energy costs because we won't get to supply. 
   That's why we want ethanol to succeed. That's the only thing we have done to bring more supply to this debate. 
   If we don't address the high input cost, what's going to happen is this fuel-food debate is going to go crazy. I was at the hearing. Guess what, there is a call to roll back the ethanol renewable fuel standard. 
   Now, that really helps our energy independence, doesn't it? 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I appreciate your yielding. 
   I was one of the few Members who actually talked to the President registering my disgust, frustration and anger. I will say it is now up to my friends on your side of the aisle, both in the House and on the other side of the Capitol to help move on a strategy to keep Future Gen on track. 
   We have a strategy. We are working in a bipartisan manner. Coal is critical to our national security, low cost fuel. I am begging the legislative leaders on your side, which they can do by putting Future Gen legislation on must-pass legislation, funding it, and Future Gen can stay alive. But I am not in the majority now. I am glad you mentioned it, and I call upon your side to make it so.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I want to commend my colleague from Colorado. I'm an aggie. I don't serve on the committee. And the agricultural sector is one of the few sectors that we have increased supply. So I do this with all due respect. 
   My concern is that when we disincentivize the E85 fuel stations, the cellulosic debate, which is the next bridge to get us to the RFS standard that we passed in December, we can't get there without RFS, without cellulosic. And we're sending a bad signal when we have States without any fueling stations and we have States that do. And so that's what brings me down. 
   And I'm glad my colleague from New York talked about nuclear power. The former head of Greenpeace now supports nuclear power. The former head of Greenpeace now supports nuclear power. 
   Coal generating electricity is 50 percent of our electricity generation in this country. 50 percent. Nuclear's 20. Our demand's going to increase 30 percent in the next 20 years. 
   Texas tried wind power. They had brownouts. Zack Wamp is right. We need more supply. This is what China's doing. China is building 40 nuclear plants in the next 15 years, not one. We haven't done one in 30. China's going to build 40. 
   China's invested $24 billion in large scale coal liquification technology. China is rapidly expanding its refining capacity. One of the reasons we compete is because we had low cost power. We don't have low cost power anymore. Those days aren't here. Renewable fuels aren't going to fill the gap that we have. 
   So we have to do, as Zach said, all of the above. In a column, Robert Samuelson said, what to do about oil? The first thing, start drilling. It's the easiest, quickest thing we can do. Unless you want to put up with this. Unless you want more, and, you know, you're a rural farm boy in Colorado. 
   I try to remind people here that in rural America we like big trucks. We have to have working trucks. We can't haul a horse trailer with an electric engine, with a four-cylinder engine. It won't go anywhere. We need powerful trucks. We need trailers. We need working trucks. 
   That's fossil fuels. That's diesel. We can't pay these gas prices anymore. And we're going to. Don't get me on climate change. All I want is transparency. 
   If we're going to tax the American public they need to know they're going to pay 50 cents more a gallon. And my charts are way over. 
   Why can't we go here? Why? Why can't we access these areas to get natural gas? Anhydrous ammonia, the Number 1 commodity input, natural gas. 
   And what has your majority done? You put areas off-limits. We've got areas in your State in the last year we put off-limits. We didn't bring on more supply. 
   Great solution. China's doing it, taking coal, gasifying it. When you gasify it you can burn electricity. You can capture the carbon. It's a clean way to do it. We can't do it. 
   For every dollar increase in a barrel of crude oil, do you know how much the taxpayers have to pay to fund the Air Force? 60 million additional dollars. Our Air Force is the number one jet fuel user in the world. They're begging for help. It's crazy. 
   We are relying on imported crude oil. Our national security depends on aviation fuel, and we are constrained by imported crude oil. Don't you think it'd be better to use our known natural resources to help our Air Force to fly our planes? 
   Coast Guard authorization bill, $1 increase. $1 dollar increase in Coast Guard authorization diesel added $24 million to the cost of the Coast Guard to protect our border.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. These are input costs. You know the diesel price has doubled. I mean, my farmers, when they plant the corn, they're in a tractor. When they harvest the corn or the beans, they're in a tractor. It's run by diesel fuel. 
   There's an attack on ethanol today. I was in committee today, I mean, 2 days ago, let's stop the RFS. It's the only thing that we have. And why is it under attack? Because input cost to production of commodity grain has gone up because we can't get low price diesel fuel. 
   When we harvest the corn we take it to a grain elevator. We do that with a big diesel truck, a big tractor trailer. We have independent truckers striking. They drove around here a couple of weeks ago, big signs. We can't afford the high cost of diesel. 
   And we know costs get passed on. What's some Democrats' response? Oh, we've got a great idea. Let's tax the energy companies more. 
   My challenge is, when have we ever raised a tax that's lowered the price to a consumer? And I've challenged people; give me one example where we raised the tax and costs went down. No one's challenged me. And I'm sure people will look at that. 
   Another thing is let's demand that the people we're reliant on, pump more crude oil. Oh, that helps us not become reliant on imported cried oil. Let's demand that the people who are providing us oil pump more. That's why I'm so frustrated with this. I hope you understand. We need to lower prices.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. So you go through all of this and say it's not even some of the above. They'll put in, especially when it comes to drilling, and they'll say well you can drill in these specific areas. 
   But as one of my colleagues, Congressman Shadegg, has pointed out, I think in Alaska and some other areas, where 487 leases were issued, every single one of those leases has been challenged multiple times through the process by radical environmental groups to make sure that no drilling takes place. Those folks know that we can open this up, but because we've created these environmental standards, the radical environmental standard, no drilling will ever take place.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I think as we talk about this, and I hope our colleagues join in. I come from the great State of Michigan and we're struggling. Last month, we were at 8.5 percent unemployment. My expectation is that now with what's happened at the national level that unemployment rate is going to go up. 
   But as we struggle with these energy costs, it has absolutely hammered jobs. It has absolutely hammered the automotive industry and these types of things, and the refusal of our colleagues to deal with this issue means increased unemployment and increased hardship for a State like Michigan. 
   And you know, our Governor came out recently and said I can't believe that Michigan may be in play in this election, and it's kind of like, excuse me, Republicans are going to do very well in the State of Michigan because Democrats in Washington have refused to deal with the issue of energy. And if people want to take a look at what America might look like under a Democrat administration all the way through, take a look at Michigan. 
   Michigan, our Governor came up with a brilliant strategy of saying, you know, we've got the highest unemployment rate in the country. You know what we ought to do? To attract more business, to attract more investment to the State of Michigan, let's raise taxes and let's make sure people don't understand exactly how much or where those taxes are going to be raised because we think that will get people to  come to our State and get them to invest and create jobs. 
   Now, we live on a peninsula. People don't come to Michigan naturally. If they want to do and invest in Michigan, they've got to be going down the expressway in Indiana, and depending on whether they're going east or west, they've got to make a left turn or a right turn. And I'll tell you, they're not turning into Michigan anymore because they're looking at Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and all of these States, and they're saying these are pretty good States to do business in. And if we take a left turn and go up into Michigan, we're going to be paying more in taxes. We will just kind of stay on the interstate and do business here. 
   But that's what, you know, we're facing with a Democrat leadership that not only won't deal with the energy issue, but will raise taxes because they believe the best way for America to be competitive on a global basis is not to grow American industries but to tax American industries and to tax the American citizen so that we can feed this beast in Washington.

   Here is the price of a barrel of crude oil when President Bush came in: $23 a barrel. Here's the price of a barrel of crude oil when this Democrat majority came in: $58 a barrel. Today it's at $103. We can't sustain that. We can blame everybody we want, but this is a problem we can't sustain. 
   Drill, baby, drill. Here's the Outer Continental Shelf. They want to only to do 20 percent, maybe. They can't even get an agreement on what they want. This whole area should be open for exploration recovery of oil and gas in our country to help decrease our reliance on imported crude oil and lower prices, and they don't have a clue. They'll continue to say ``no'' to oil and gas exploration. 
   They won't even address coal as part of the solution. Coal is the greatest resource we have in this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, it is great to have a chance to be on the floor to talk about energy and the lack of movement from my colleagues on the other side. It's not the first time I've been down here, it's not going to be the last, and I seriously doubt that the provision that will be brought to the floor will be an all-of-the-above, comprehensive plan. 
   It will be a smoke screen, it will try to have some cover for votes for November, but it will not be the all-the-above strategy that we are demanding on the floor of the House. 
   There will not be a provision on coal in this bill. Coal is our most valuable resource we have in this country. There will not be a provision on oil shale. More energy than any other country in oil shale. We will not deal with opening up the entire Outer Continental Shelf. We will not use the revenues to fully expand the grid or go into all the renewables. 
   We would like regular order. We would like the chance to move a bill through the committee. I serve on the Energy and Air Quality subcommittee; I serve on the Energy and Commerce full committee. The 2005 energy bill that you all had attacked went through regular order. It went through your committee, it went through my committee, it went through the Science Committee. It went through all the committees; it was cobbled together on the floor; we had amendments on the floor, and we voted. 
   Democrats attacked us for the majority of the majority rule of the floor of the House. Well, we're going to turn that around, because now it's just a majority of one: It's whatever Speaker Pelosi decides, that will be the bill on the floor. And she is dissing you all. She's not allowing you all to have any  input into the legislative process. It's whatever she says goes. And you just can't deny that fact, because it is not going through any regular order. 
   So when you attacked the 2005 energy bill that went through the subcommittee, went through the full committee as being written behind closed doors, there is no more closed doors than what you are doing and proposing to do in this bill, and it is a shame and it is an insult on the legislative process. 
   Let's see if we address coal-to-liquid. There are two provisions you all could put in the bill right now to make us more energy independent. 
   You could put long-term contracting Department of Defense, who are asking for coal-to-liquid applications for jet fuel, long-term contracting, and we would have coal-to-liquid refineries being built with American jobs today. 
   You could take a Democrat bill, the Boucher coal-to-liquid bill. You could put RICK BOUCHER's bill in this, quote/unquote, comprehensive energy bill, and we would have coal-to-liquid refineries being built in this country within a year. 
   But it won't be comprehensive because you're going to not address coal, the greatest resource. We have more coal reserves than any country on this planet. So you can't really say you are going to have a comprehensive energy plan when you don't address coal. 
   The other thing that you will not do is open up the Outer Continental Shelf. You may open up 5 percent more. This whole red area, you have seen it numerous times, off-limits. 
   We're going to call your bluff. We're going to shut down this government on the CR because we're going to defeat the moratorium. So you can pass all these energy bills you want. You know you can't conference it with the Senate. You know it's not going to go to the President's desk. It's a fig leaf. It's a farce. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. 
   What we're going to do is we're going to wait till the spending bill comes to fund government, and then we're going to call your bluff. Are you willing to shut the government down and keep off-limits billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas? And if you're willing to do that, fine. We'll do that before the election. We'll go back and we'll hold you accountable at the polls. 
   Do you know why you can't bring a comprehensive bill that comes through regular order? Because Nancy Pelosi loses, and it's her bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (THE STATUS OF ENERGY IN THE WORLD TODAY -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, it was a pleasure to be down here listening to the special orders of my friends from the various States, and especially my friend from Connecticut, Mr. Courtney, and I understand his compassion and concern. But I will tell you that if we don't get a handle on these energy costs, people aren't going to have the money to do the things they want to do with their families on a day-to-day basis. So we have this time tonight to talk about energy and our energy status in the world today. 
   We started doing this last week on a bill that came to the floor that we are going to finish this week, the Beach Protection Act of 2007. We took that opportunity to talk about that. But we ought to be addressing some of the pressing concerns of this country today. 
   We hear the term that America, and rural America, is bitter. It is a big phrase today and over the weekend. They are bitter. They are bitter about high energy costs, and they are bitter about the fact that this Congress is not doing anything to address the supply part of this debate. 
   More supply means lower costs. That is basic economics 101. Anyone who has gone to have a bachelor's degree, and even some good high school programs teach economics, it is a simple supply and demand equation. So we are going to talk about energy tonight. My focus is going to be on supply, how we need more supply. 
   We also hear a lot this year about change. We want change, and everybody wants change. But, you know, change is not always good. Here is an example of change. 
   Since the Democrats got in the majority, when they first got sworn in, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58.31. Today, the price of a barrel of crude oil is $111.15. I would say that is bad change. That is not good change. So change is not always good. This is negative change, and it flies in the face of promises from my friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   The Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi said on April 24, 2006, about 2 years ago, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down the skyrocketing gas prices.'' Well, that was almost $60 a barrel less ago, and $1 and change per gallon of gas less.     
   Majority leader STENY HOYER said, October 4, 2005, ``Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices.'' 
   Well, they did. They did. What did they do? They raised their gas prices. You want to talk about not being able to pay for dental care? People are using their money to get to work. 
   In rural America, we drive long distances. Rural America doesn't have the access of buses. Rural America doesn't have the opportunity to take the Metro or light rail. 
   Those who are driving distances to get to work are harmed exponentially greater. Democrats proffered lower gas prices. What do we have? We have higher gas prices. All we are asking them to do is keep their prices. Help them lower the price of gasoline, but they won't do it. Do you know why they won't do it? 
   They won't do it because they really hate fossil fuels in this country. They hate crude oil, and they hate coal. They hate crude oil, and they hate coal. 
   They hate fossil fuels, so to address high prices, what we have to do is bring on more fossil fuels to the market, and they won't do it. That's why we are not going to have any relief on gases. 
   Constituents ask me, what are you going to do to lower prices? What are you going to do, Congress? I just shake my head, and I said the only thing that's going to happen is prices are going to go up because demand is going to continue to go up, supply is going to stay the same, and you are going to have higher prices. 
   Democrat Whip JIM CLYBURN, Democrat from South Carolina, said ``House Democrats have a plan to help curb rising gas prices.'' Jim got it wrong. ``No'' is not an energy plan. They had no plan, and when you have no plan, you plan to fail, and what do you get? You get higher prices. 
   We know we are going to have $4 a gallon gas this summer sometime. We know it. In fact, the newspapers are  starting to raise this issue, ``$4 gasoline seen possible this summer,'' the Buffalo News, April 9, 2008; price at the pump likely to reach $4, the Washington Times, April 9, 2008; ``$4 Per Gallon Gas Creeps Closer,'' Fox News, Denver, Colorado, April 9. 
   We know we are going to have $4 a gallon of gas. How do we stop that from happening? We have to bring on more supply. I have some friends here to join me, but I am going to finish with one solution that has bipartisan support, and that's coal-to-liquid technologies. 
   There are a lot of ways we can address this debate and this issue, but let me just pitch one to you. The Illinois Coal Basin, and I am from Illinois, I am biased, the Illinois Coal Basin is basically the State of Illinois and the southwestern part of Indiana and the western part of Kentucky. That's all a big coal field. 
   Under the ground there is as much fossil fuel energy in coal as Saudi Arabia has in oil, 250-year's worth. We have been mining and using it for generations. In fact, I am fourth-generation Lithuanian American. My great grandfather immigrated to my home town of Collinsville, Illinois, where I still live. What did he do? He worked in the coal mines. My grandfather worked in the coal mines. 
   In southern Illinois, we have coal mines and we have mine workers. We have an abundant natural resource. 
   Now, we know coal can be used to generate electricity, but I am not talking about generation of electricity right now. What I am talking about is liquid fuels, the stuff that we need to put in our cars so we can get to work. How do we lower the price of gasoline in this country? That's where coal-to-liquid technology comes in. 
   We also had these budget airlines, three of them went bankrupt, one is on the verge. What's one of the problems? The high cost of aviation fuel. 
   All those people are unemployed. They don't have a job. They are going to be a burden to the safety net. They are not going to have dental care which was provided by their employer. But now they are unemployed because of the high cost of jet fuel. 
   How do we bring liquid fuel back to the arena that the budget airlines and the soccer mom, who is shepherding those kids around in the minivan, can afford to do that. We bring on more supply. One option is to use our vast resources of coal in this country and use that technology that goes back to World War II, the Fischer-Tropsh technologies. 
   Synthetic fuel, Sasol, the South African oil company has been using it for decades. It just got permission to use synthetic aviation fuel for the British commercial air fleet. 
   We have not a single coal-to-liquid plant in this country. The premise is simple, you have a coal mine. This is surface mining, mostly western coal here. In Illinois it would be below surface. 
   At that location you build a coal-to-liquid refinery. First of all you have jobs, jobs in the coal mine. Then you have jobs that build a refinery. Then you have jobs to operate the coal mines and jobs to operate the refinery, good-paying jobs with good-paying benefits and dental care. Then you have a pipeline so you don't have to address the transportation of this fuel, and you pipe it to the major metropolitan areas of this country, or you pipe it to the air base. 
   You know the number one aviation fuel user in the world, you know who it is? Our United States Air Force. They are begging for this opportunity. They are held captives to imported crude oil and the high cost of jet fuel. 
   We can do it here. We know what Katrina did to the refineries in the gulf coast, it shut a couple of them down, causing price spikes, causing dislocations. 
   Well, what's the benefit of this technology? You don't have to have it on the gulf coast. You are not importing the crude oil. You can build one in southern Illinois. You could build one in Wyoming, in Montana. You could build one in Kentucky or Ohio or West Virginia, right where the coal is located, close to the pipeline that connects to our major metropolitan areas, available, low-cost fuel to turn into jet fuel, gasoline, aviation fuel, diesel fuel, things that are causing great concerns and problems in our country today. 
   We have got bills to do this. Many Members do. My bill, I am the primary cosponsor with Congressman Rick Boucher, a Democrat from Virginia, on a price-collar provision. There are provisions for long-term contracting. There are some other marketing provisions out there where we could do this, we could send a signal to industry. 
   We want to do this, we want to have these up and running in 5 years. We want to help decrease our reliance on imported crude oil. We want to lower the cost of fuel. This Congress could do it. I guarantee you if we did it, this administration would sign the bill. 
   It's up to Democrats who made promises in 2006 that they had a plan to lower the price of gasoline. You read the quotes. I read the quotes to you, Madam Speaker. 
   You know the promises that were made. You know the promises that were not kept. In fact, not only were the promises not kept, we have done worse. You didn't lower the cost of fuel, we raised the cost of fuel. We didn't lower the price of a barrel of crude oil. 
   When Speaker Pelosi got sworn in, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58.31; today, $111. Now I did this part of the speech last week, it was $110. It has gone up $1 just since Wednesday. 
   With that, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from New Jersey, Congressman Garrett. I thank him for joining me. I yield you some time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (THE STATUS OF ENERGY IN THE WORLD TODAY -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague for coming down to the floor. As he was speaking I was thinking, and of course I started by talking about two buzz words that are out there because of this politicized season. I think we need to merge them together. 
   What we have from the Democrat majority on energy policy is bitter change. Bitter change; $58 a barrel for crude oil to $111 per barrel of crude oil; $2.40 for a gallon of gasoline to $3.50. We have bitter change, not good change, bitter change because there is no energy policy. 
   First there are the grand promises made by the Democratic leadership which I quoted earlier and will probably quote again. No change, bad change, bitter change. It is unfortunate because it is our citizens who are feeling the burden. 
   I started this last week again during the healthy beaches discussion. It is amazing as I was looking at the stories over the weekend flying home and flying back today, a whole bunch of articles. ``Truckers feel the crunch of high diesel prices.'' This one is better. ``Independent truckers join strike.'' It has tractor-trailer rigs, shut them down, on strike. Try $4 a gallon; bitter change to the independent truck driver. There is no energy policy. When you have no policy, you have a failed policy. 
   Another article, ``High fuel prices mean high costs.'' There is a lot of blame being given to the agricultural sector because of the high cost of food, but the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City said over the past three decades, rising labor and energy costs have boosted that share steadily from 67 percent in the 1970s to 80 percent today. 
   The Federal Reserve Bank also estimated that a 10 percent gain in energy prices could contribute to 5.2 percent increase in retail food prices. And, John Urbanchuk in an article ``The Relative Impact of Corn and Energy Prices in the Grocery Aisle'' on June 14, 2007, said rising energy prices had a more significant impact on food prices than did corn. 
   Bitter change; no energy plan. The Democrats failed to bring supply into the energy debate. We can pass efficiencies and renewables, but the reality is it is only nibbling around the edges. The Energy Information Agency projects a 30 percent increase in demand in electricity by 2030, a 30 percent demand increase. And we are nibbling around the edges. People think we are going to do it with solar panels and wind turbines. They can help. We would like to have them. In fact, I just heard Illinois is one of the largest States to try to employ wind power. But it is not going to meet our demand. Energy prices are going to go up, and when they do, the average American citizen, especially in rural America, pays a disproportionate burden because we have to travel long distances to go to work. We don't have the commuter rails and the bus services. What we have is our truck. And we like our trucks. 
   I am going to talk about electricity generation. I have spent a lot of time on liquid fuels, but I am joined by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Sullivan) and so I yield to him at this time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (THE STATUS OF ENERGY IN THE WORLD TODAY -- (House of Representatives - April 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague, and especially for again returning the focus to the national security dynamics of this. 
   The United States Air Force is the number one consumer of aviation fuel in the world. What are they asking for? They want a safe, reliable supply of aviation fuel. Reliable. The only way they are going to get a reliable supply of aviation fuel is if that aviation fuel is produced by a commodity product where we are not relying on importation. That goes back to this debate on coal-to-liquid technologies. 
   Again, just in the Illinois coal basin alone, 250 years worth, as much energy as Saudi Arabia has in crude oil, just the Illinois coal basin alone. We are not talking about the Wyoming-Montana coal basin or the West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky region. We are talking about the Illinois coal basin has as much energy as Saudi Arabia has in oil. 
   So as we go back to the coal-to-liquid debate and we are talking about national security, and we need to have the fuel to fly our war machines, coal, locally discovered, developed, brought to the surface, with a coal-to-liquid refinery, built by the building trades, operated by organized labor and our boilermaker friends, high-paying wages, good benefits, not on the coastal plain, in the Midwest, pipeline to, and this chart just happens to show an F-18 Tomcat, a United States Air Force fighter plane.     
   Our Air Force is asking for this for national security, a reliable source of jet fuel, and we continue to delay. 
   What's the other world doing? What's the other countries, other world doing? 
   Well, Russia is attempting to grab a vast chunk of the Arctic to claim to its vast potential oil, gas and mineral wells to fuel that country's economy. Russia's going after fossil fuels. 
   Well, what's our other friends doing? 
   Brazil, Russia, India and China have overtaken the United States in dominating the global energy industry, according to a study by Goldman Sachs. 
   What's the Chinese doing? China is building 40 nuclear plants in the next 15 years. 40. We'll be lucky to have one. One. No carbon emissions in a nuclear power plant. Zero. 
   I think that's the biggest frustration that a lot of us have from our friends on the environmental left. They don't like nuclear power. They don't like coal. They don't like crude oil. We're trying to find out what they like. 
   China is planning 40 nuclear power plants in the next 15 years, and I pray that we have one. I would be ecstatic to have four. There's no way we'll have 15. There's just no way. The United States has not licensed one nuclear power plant in 30 years, not one, due to my friends on the other side's continued opposition to nuclear power. 
   We could bring nuclear power legislation to the floor in this Congress. And it would have bipartisan support. All the Republicans would support it. Well, we might lose about three. And I bet we could grab 40 Democrats that would support it. I bet we could have a bipartisan majority vote on coal-to-liquid technologies. I'd bet it'd be the same. We'd have all the Republicans minus a handful, and we'd get about 40 Democrat votes. But this Democrat leadership will not bring a bill to the floor that addresses the supply debate. 
   China opened new domestic energy reserves in 2004 and has planned to increase production by about 8 billion barrels by 2010. 
   Democrats refuse to allow American workers to produce American oil. In fact, in the energy debate last year, not the final bill that passed, but the two that didn't get signed into law, they put another area of natural gas off limits. 
   We need increased supply. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that if you want lower prices, you have to have more supply. We don't get any help. 
   China's increasing offshore energy production to reduce its own dependence on foreign oil. Let me say that, because I've got some friends over there who live on the coast. China is increasing offshore energy production. In fact, we know just 50 miles off of Florida, 50 miles, it's not a U.S. energy company or a U.S. energy exploration to go after the oil in the Gulf 50 miles off Miami. It's China. China has better access to our oil reserves on the Outer  Continental Shelf than we have. Isn't that crazy? 
   China's increasing offshore energy production to reduce its own dependence on foreign oil, growing that production at an average of 15.3 percent per year, with plans to make offshore oil production China's largest source of oil by doubling production by 2010. 
   And we know what happens any time we talk about offshore exploration, a counting of gas and oil reserves, just trying to figure out what's there we have a fight. 
   China invested $24 billion in large scale coal liquification technologies. Oh, that sounds familiar. Coal-to-liquid technologies. 
   The United States, what are we doing? Zip, zero, nada, nothing. 
   What's China doing? China invested $24 billion in large scale coal liquification technology. We can't get a vote on that on the floor. China's expanding its natural gas infrastructure by constructing pipelines. We can't get a pipeline bill moved. 
   China rapidly is expanding its refining capacity. Democrats have repeatedly voted against expanding American refinery capacity. In fact, one of the huge problems we have, which I find is really--I think people understand that we import crude oil. We're relying on imported crude oil and that's bad. 
   What the public, I think, would even get angrier at is we import refined product. We import gasoline. So not only, we lose the refining jobs. It would be better for us to import the crude oil and refine that crude oil, or at least we'd have our friends in the refining industry, many of those bargaining unit employees would have jobs. But we are importing refined product. Criminal negligence. 
   China is ambitiously developing its nuclear power industry with plans to spend approximately $50 billion on 30 additional nuclear reactors within the next 15 years. China is planning on constructing many new large scale hydroelectric projects over the forecast period, including the 18.2 gigawatt Three Gorges dam project, which is scheduled to be operational by 2009. 
   In fact, we're tearing down dams. We're not expanding hydroelectric power. 50 percent of the electricity we use is produced by coal in this country. 50 percent. 20 percent by nuclear power, 20 percent by hydroelectric, and the rest the others. 
   I'm going to move to the concern. With no plan to address this problem, which is the escalating costs of crude oil, again, when Speaker Pelosi took over, $58 a barrel, crude oil. 
   I'll be honest. Bush took over it was $27. I always say that. Bush it was $27, Pelosi, $58, now $111. With all the promises, and maybe I'll just read those one more time as I end. 
   But the basic premise is, under Democrat leadership of the House, the average American is paying more. We're paying more. We're going to pay more in taxes. We know that. But this isn't a special order on taxes. This is a special order on energy. 
   We're paying more at the pump. Here's the reason why. The high cost of a barrel of crude oil, we're relying on imported crude oil. One solution would be technology. Another would be to move into electric cars. But guess what? Electric cars need an electric supply. They'll need nuclear power plants. They'll need coal generating, coal, then the electricity generation plants buy coal. There's going to be, we have to have something to charge the batteries to allow these battery-run cars to run. 
   Let's talk a minute about global climate change. We know that the public is paying more at the pump when the Democrat majority promised lower prices. That's a given. 
   We had a hearing in the subcommittee last week. My issue to the panelists was, the American public, they need to understand that if we address global climate change there is going to be a cost. 
   Of course, some on the environmental left said no. We're going to have all these efficiencies. We're going to have all these new jobs. It's going to be a wash. 
   Well, it's funny, flying home, an AP story on the 12th, the State of California is going to put on the electrical bill, a 25 or 30 percent surcharge on customers' electric and gas bills for global climate change. So your electricity bills are going to go up. Gas prices are up. Electricity prices are up. You're 
   going to pay more in taxes. 
   This is bitter change, bitter change, not good change. Bitter change. Bitter change for the average American who all they want to do is go to work and pay their bills, take care of their family, try to save some for the future. They can't save with these high energy prices. 
   And you saw the independent truckers, the article I held up. 
   If we could have effective change, let's assume that we do all we can as Americans to lead the way, go through all this pain. Do you really believe that our Chinese friends, after I gave all the stats on what they're doing, are going to comply with an international agreement? Not only do I not believe it, they've told me no. And I've mentioned this in many committee hearings. 
   In fact, the senior Chinese official said twice to two of my Democratic colleagues' questions when they said, if the United States led, would you agree to an international agreement to coal carbon? 
   And their answer was, you all have had, well they didn't use you all. That's kind of a Southern Illinois thing. They said, you have had 200 years to develop a middle class in your country using fossil fuels, and it's our turn. That doesn't sound like a country that wants to address carbon debate in an international arena. 
   So should Americans, should we go through all this pain on global climate change, and have no gain? Do we go through all this exercise, all these job dislocations, all this pain, for not one single benefit? 
   And if we do, you know, I just want us to be transparent with our citizens. Intellectually honest. Chairman Dingell said, you know, if we want to be honest with the American people, what we should do is put 50 cents additional tax on gasoline and take that money, and address our carbon debate. 
   Well, that works great. That now takes $3.50 a gallon of gas, which people are outraged about, and brings it up to $4. And it's going to get to $4 without the additional 50 cent tax. But at least it's intellectually honest, saying that there's going to be a cost. 
   The California Public Utility Commission is honest. 25 to 30 percent increase on your energy bill for climate change. Great. 
   Well, it wasn't a front-page story. It was, I don't know, I ripped it up. I think it was, like, the Business Section, like D6, way in the back. So I'm not sure if it made the front page of the California papers, but that's what their public utility commission has agreed to do. 
   All pain, no gain. The public needs to know the cost and be prepared to assume the cost. 
   All I see in this debate on energy is bitter change, bitter change for the working men and women of this country. This is contrary to the promises made. 
   April 24, 2006, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi said ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' Bring down skyrocketing gas. They weren't even skyrocketing then compared to what we have now. Now we've got skyrocketing gas prices. 
   Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, ``Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices.'' 
   Y'all did more? You raised gas prices even more. 
   Democratic Whip JIM CLYBURN said, ``House Democrats have a plan to help curb rising gas prices.''     
   No energy plan is a plan to fail. We go from $58.31 a barrel of crude oil to today, $111. 
   Now, I got these on little, kind of like a Blue Dog type of thing. I got this on a moveable type of a number system here. So that if it goes up, I can add. If it goes down, I can adjust. But the reality is, the spread, under the leadership of this House, has only gone up. And I believe, and the economists today believe, it will continue to go up. 
   We can do better. We can do better. I talked to many of my friends on the other side. I actually voted for CAFE language. That was a hard thing for me to do. Helped expand the renewable fuel standard. Brought biodiesel and ethanol into the national energy debate. That's all good stuff. Energy Star provisions. Electricity savings provisions.  We want the deployment of solar cells. We want wind power. As I mentioned earlier, Illinois could be at the forefront of electricity generation by wind. 
   What we do know, Texas had to call their high electricity users when their wind turbines stopped turning because the wind stopped blowing. That's the challenge of renewable energy. Instead of having a consistent base-load energy, and in this country it's undisputed that coal is the primary commodity product that produces 50 percent of the electricity generation in this country. The electricity we're using in the Capitol building tonight is produced by coal. The electricity on the Capitol grounds is produced by coal. 
   There are some of my friends on the other side that would like us to not use another ounce of fossil fuels ever in this country. I am afraid of those days because those days will only occur when there's another worldwide recession. And you want to see the pain and the agony and the frustration on the middle- and the lower-middle class of our country, wait till there's no jobs. We won't be putting carbon in the air. That will be good for some people, but we won't be employing our citizens either. And that will be a shame. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me this time. I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Garrett and Congressman Sullivan, for joining me in a plea to my friends on the other side that, as we continue to talk about energy, we don't disregard the supply debate. That's got to be part of the solution. It just has to be because just so much of the electricity that we use today is based upon 50 percent coal, 20 percent nuclear, 20 percent hydroelectric. They have to be part of the mix. It's my plea that, as we move forward and try to address the high cost of electricity and liquid fuel, we remember the great resources that we have in this country and have a plan to use them.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, imagine my beloved St. Louis Cardinals were playing the much-despised Chicago Cubs. The Cardinals are up by five, finishing the top of the ninth. Is this a cause for celebration? Is this a cause for victory? No. 
   Unbelievable as it may seem, the Cubbies score five runs in the bottom of the ninth to throw the game into extra innings. There, the score remains until 1 a.m., five innings later. However, at the top of the 15th, the Cardinals fail to field a batter. The entire team has left the stadium. It seems that they are more worried about next day's 1 p.m. game at home than finishing the game at hand. 
   Who wins? We know, it's the team that stays on the field. Arbitrary deadlines and a date certain accept defeat before the conclusion of the contest. It is in our national security interest to continue to take the field and support a moderate Arab state. Leaving prior assures a loss for us and a victory for our opponents, which will lead to another extremist Islamic state.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (SSI EXTENSION FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I too join with our leader and all in the Chamber in support of this legislation. I actually have great respect for the ranking member here. We have had our fights, but I know he is a man of sincerity. 
   We are on the floor just to highlight the other challenges faced by those people who we are trying to help. SSI payments do not go far enough when we are under a regime of high energy prices, and, as I talked about in the last bill from this article here, gas prices confine sick people. 
   Again, as a former high school teacher on how a bill becomes a law, we should not be dancing in the well of the floor on the passage of a bill, nor should we be disappointed, those of us, with the outcome. The process still goes forward. Hopefully there will be a conference. 
   Hopefully there will be changes and we bring more supply to this energy debate. Because if we don't bring on more supply, and in my aspect coal-to-liquid technologies, the tar sands from Canada, we get a real bill that addresses where the oil is off the California coast, which is 50 miles less, not 50 miles out, and then we take those royalties to move into renewables, clean solar, wind, all of the above, we are going to have to continue to revisit all these spending regimes on social services based upon high energy costs. 
   So we come down here respectfully with the matter of the bill. It is needed. It is supported. We are all going to vote yes. But also to highlight the fact that there is much more to be done on the energy debate. And I am not one that says we are going to drive prices down to $1.50 a gallon. I never make those proclamations. What I would like to see is stabilization, instead of the swings that we will see. 
   I would also like to see us not be held captive to Mother Nature by having all our main assets in hurricane alley versus disbursed around the country, and in my case the coal-to-liquid refinery aspects, which would be very, very helpful. 
   This article says, ``Gas prices confine sick people. Some have to cut back on traveling, treatment such as dialysis, or chemotherapy.'' If that is what not having an energy plan that can be signed into law is doing to our most needful, then we have not done the right thing.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Miller, thank you for the good work on this. I'm planning, as many of us are, to be highly supportive of it. 
   I just want to bring to the attention of the Chamber an article that was in USA Today, September 4. We're talking about disabilities here and the disabilities act, and also remind people, as a teacher of government and history of 4 years, the process of how a bill becomes a law. 
   We had a vote last night that passed a bill. It has not yet become law. In essence, we still have done nothing to ease the energy crisis, and this article highlights ``Gas Prices Confine Sick People.'' Some have to cut back on traveling, treatment, such as dialysis or chemotherapy. The picture here is a visit to a Lou Gehrig's, ALS, clinic; and one of the quotes is saying, ``People are going to depend on us more because their friends and families can't afford to transport them in their cars.'' 
   When we've been fighting so hard for an energy policy and energy debate, many times I would come to the floor to say energy is a variable in everything that we do in our society. It's a variable in the cost of doing the job here as we use power to generate electricity, air-conditioning, and, of course, communications. It's a part of the educational environment as we find schools having to adjust transportation schedules on diesel fuel. It is a critical portion of how we can meet the needs of the disabled. 
   And one of the places they point out here is in Sacramento, the disabled individuals can't get services because they can't afford to drive to reach the services. Again, this is not me. This is USA Today on 4 September. Pretty big article. 
   We have to move a bill that the President will sign. We have to have a comprehensive policy that brings in all the above. I personally like coal. I personally like renewable fuels. I personally like nuclear power. I personally like oil shale, and I like oil sands. I like wind. I like solar. 
   If we do not have a comprehensive energy policy that helps stabilize and bring costs down, we can pass all the pieces of legislation we want to in the world but the disabled are still going to be harmed, especially in areas that I represent, which is rural southern Illinois, where to get a job, get health care, you have to drive a long distance.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, leaving the Capitol last night, I came across a sign on the Seventh Street Bridge overpass that said, ``Democrats, get a peace plan.'' 
   Clearly, someone felt that this nonbinding resolution does not get us any closer to peace, and some, myself included, would argue that this resolution takes us further away from our goal of securing the peace. Retreat, surrender, leaving, disengagement, that is the view of some politicians in Washington, DC, making decisions on combat operations overseas. If there is any clear comparison to Vietnam, this legislation is it. 
   Here is the Republican plan for peace, victory. In the 1980s, it was a peace through strength that was a military I was proud to serve in. Our last best chance for victory is by supporting the decisions of the commanders in the field. Their current request is to reinforce the Iraqi military and police who will take the lead in military action against all insurgents and al Qaeda in Iraq. 
   We are to ensure reconstruction continues to empower Iraq's security forces and newly elected leadership to be prepared to fully assume their destiny, and to leave, when asked, by a sovereign country of Iraq. 
   It is our national security interest to support moderate Arab states. Moderate Arab states that are democratic observe the rule of law, support women's rights, and are allies with us in the war on international jihadist terrorists. We have an opportunity for Iraq to be a moderate Arab state and an ally. 
   However, we can be assured if we leave early that the radicals will take over after an ensuing and huge bloodbath and will forever be an enemy to the United States. During the buildup to the Iraqi constitutional elections, I wore a flag pin representing both Iraq and the United States of America. 
   As I have traveled about my district in the past weeks, I have put the pin back as a sign of solidarity with a sovereign and free Iraq. What this resolution does is sever this alliance. This commitment emboldens our adversaries. It tells the world we are unable to go the distance and keep our commitment to do the right thing. 
   Well, I will not accept defeat, and especially from political armchair quarterbacks. The military commanders in the field have asked for reenforcements. This appeal may be our last best hope for a free democratic Iraq willing to be able to protect their citizens and support us in the war on terrorism. 
   Are we politicians sitting safe and secure in Washington, DC, going to say no to this request? Surely not. 
   Throughout our history, a debate such as this has occurred on the floor of the House and across the Nation. Monday was the 198th anniversary of the birth of our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln. At his tomb I read this quote from the Gettysburg Address, which I believe is applicable today. ``It is for the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who have fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain ..... '' 
   Instead of fighting, we are arguing amongst ourselves. We ought to commit our country to finish the task at hand. We should be united in the cause and to pray to God, the Creator of all, to bless our efforts here, the efforts of our military, the government of Iraq, her people, and, yes, even our enemies. 
   I want to end with another quote from Abraham Lincoln. In his farewell address to Springfield as President-Elect, he said: ``Today I leave you; I go to assume a task more difficult than that which devolved upon General Washington. Unless the great God who assisted him shall be with me and aid me, I must fail. But if the same omniscient mind, and Almighty arm that directed and protected him, shall guide and support me, I shall not fail, I shall succeed. Let us all pray that the God of our Father may not forsake us now. To him I commend you all. Permit me to ask that with equal security and faith, you all will invoke His wisdom and guidance for me.'' 
   May God bless our President and military leaders. May God bless our men and women in uniform who volunteered to protect our Nation from harm, and may God bless the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (AMERICA'S ENERGY PROBLEM -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague, and it's great to be here tonight. We did a press conference last week addressing some of these concerns, and it's good to follow up with a Special Order tonight. 
   At the press conference, we really highlighted the issue of when our friends on the Democratic side took over the majority, crude oil prices were at $58.31 per barrel of crude oil. And when we did the press conference of last week, the crude oil price was at $96.65, the price of a barrel of crude oil. 
   Our issue was that when you have no energy plan, you have, when you can't plan, you have, this is the default energy policy of this country. The price escalations, as my friend from Texas, the difference about the price escalations now is that many times when we saw the run-up of these, the costs for a barrel of crude oil in the past, it was based upon some national emergency, Katrina, pipeline disruptions, maybe a refinery fire. What's different about the price escalations today is that it's all demand related. So if you, as many of us have, have taken Economics 101 in college, maybe in an MBA program, the simple law of supply and demand. If you have high prices, and we'd say we have high crude oil prices and we're quoted today at $91 a barrel, you would think that that would then encourage people to go into the business to explore new means of recovery of crude oil so that they would bring more supply into the market so that you would lower the prices. 
   But the policies here in Washington not only prohibit that, but they discourage any investment, because when people bring capital to the market, they assume risk. And when you assume risk, you assume the opportunity of losing it all. And most people in the investor community and the business community, all they want to do is if they're going to assume risk, they want to try to get a return on that investment. 
   So last week we had close to $100 a barrel of crude oil, in California $5 a gallon of gas. Now, this is before we even talk about a global warming debate and a 50 cent per-gallon tax. 
   And as I said last week, so what you now have is we have European prices for liquid fuel, but we don't have European distances. I always remind my friends, those that want to, well, why shouldn't we have as high gas prices as they have in Europe? Well, that's because you can put all of Europe on the eastern seaboard. We don't have the distances that our European friends do where they can drive across their country in 2 1/2 hours. I can't drive across my district in 2 1/2 hours from one point to another from the far west to the far east. So that's a problem that we have in this debate. 
   So what we would like to see, we've already moved some energy bills on the floor. They're mostly efficiency oriented, the light bulb and the light car tires. But what we need to do is we need to focus on bringing on more supply, and that should be an energy policy. 
   When you have no energy policy, the energy policy of this country is $96 a barrel crude oil. That's the default energy policy of this country if you do not bring on significant amounts of increased supply. 
   So what kinds of supplies? All my friends here on the Republican side, one thing we have in common, although we will talk about different types of supply, is that we're all supply people. We all know that you if want to lower costs, you've got to bring more supply on board. And so that's kind of the commonality of the focus, because when you have more supply, you have lower cost. When you have lower cost, that's lower out-of-pocket cost to the individual consumer. 
   And the consumers are going to start complaining when they're at $3 a gallon of gas, $3.50, especially around Christmastime because they're going to be spending that extra money at the pump versus going to the store. Then you have an oversupply of toys at the store. We all know about the focus on, you know, the Christmas shopping period. High energy costs will diminish and dampen the ability of our consumers to have a good Christmas shopping season. So that affects the manufacturers of all the things that we would like to buy for our loved ones at Christmas. 
   So how do we address the supply concerns? And again, all of us are going to be involved with that. One thing that I've always pushed for and always encouraged us to take, look after, is an alternative fuel standard. 
   When the President was here for the State of the Union address he said he would sign an alternative fuel standard. An alternative fuel standard would talk about things like corn-based ethanol. It also would address stuff like  soy diesel, soybeans crushed and mixed with petroleum diesel, which is obviously the soybean portion, or the beef tallow or the reformulated cooking oil or all things that are renewable. 
   And then, obviously, we have coal. And now in Illinois alone and in parts all over this country, we have a 250-year supply of coal in the Illinois coal basin. 
   Now, coal can be used for a lot of things. Coal can be used to generate electricity. When we have this energy debate, we focus, sometimes we all lump it together, and sometimes I like to split it apart: part of it would be electricity generation; the other would be liquid fuel. 
   It would surprise people if they knew that 50 percent of the electricity generated in this country comes from coal. In fact, the lights in this building and the lights at the Pentagon and all the electricity that we use here in the Capitol complex we can point to not only our own power plant, which uses coal, but one right across the river that also provides electricity. 
   Now in this country, we're pretty much independent on electricity generation. Fifty percent coal, 20 percent hydro, 20 percent nuclear, 10 percent the other one. The concern we have is the liquid fuel debate where we are highly dependent on imported crude oil. And hence, because demand goes up, we have $96.65 a barrel crude oil. 
   A no energy plan is a plan to fail and a plan to increase crude oil prices. So while we're trying to work with our friends across the aisle and the leadership of this House, I mean, there's a lot of my friends who I call fossil fuel Democrats who understand the importance of fossil fuels in this country and understand the importance of making sure that we bring more supply in the fossil fuel arena to this debate. They have been tampered down by the leadership. 
   But we hope in this Special Order, we hope from the press conference of last week, and we hope from the anger and angst that the driving public's going to see by escalating prices, that we'll start at least start making the point of you can't always say no if you want to have an energy policy. You can't always close up supply. You've got to make sure that where you know you have available resources, you then take the opportunity to go in those arenas. Like we want to exploit the Illinois coal basin for electricity generation and for liquid 
   fuel. We do not want to shut off areas by which we can bring in more natural gas reserves or other type of fossil fuel research. 
   So for my colleague from Texas, for planning to execute this Special Order, I appreciate the time that he has allotted me and want to let him know that I'm going to continue to be on the watch trying to drive home to the American public the importance and the need for a sound energy policy that, yes, talks about some efficiency issues, but as important, in fact, I think more important, talks about really bringing more supply to the debate so that we can at least maybe hold prices steady. 
   I'd like to see us move to start lowering prices so that the consumers of this country have more spending power, the manufacturers in this country will have that as a net plus in their competitive advantage, which is low-cost power. And I feel that the inability of the Democrat leadership of this House to move effectively on the supply end will cause great distrust, dissatisfaction, and danger for the energy security position of this country.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I want to ask my friend from Pennsylvania a couple of aspects on the chart. The first one, when we talked about the tax, under this current Congress, how many times have the Democrats gone to that same pot of money for PAYGO issues of other bills that have come to this floor?

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (AMERICA'S ENERGY PROBLEM -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I know there is at least three times, and I'm being told four, using this same pot of money to justify the PAYGO, the new spending that they brought on. 
   The other thing that we really need to have here and talk to the American public about is that the Energy Information Service, what we don't have depicted is, what is going to be the future demand? And the future demand is going to double. So with your great chart of all the portfolio there, it's kind of confusing because the public might think, well, as we look at that, that everything is going to stay pretty much the same. But the reality is demand is going to go up exponentially. And if you have the same amount of supply and the demand goes up, then you see $100 a barrel crude oil, $120 barrel crude oil. And that's why, as we have come here to talk about supply, we want to bring more supply to the 
   table. And we know we have friends on the other side of the aisle that believe the same thing.  
   I'm working with Rick Boucher. And you mentioned coal-to-liquid. Just imagine this, we have 250 years' worth of coal in the only coal basin. So you have the coal underneath the ground, you build a coal mine, right on top of it you build a coal-to-liquid refinery somewhere in the Midwest or somewhere in Pennsylvania where there is a coal field, and then you connect it to pipelines that we have today. Then you limit the risk. The risk we have now is, if we're not going to build new refineries, we're going to build refineries and expand existing refineries, and we have so many down on the gulf coast, we have them in Louisiana, we have them in Corpus Christi, we have them in Houston, we have them in all these areas where they are really at risk, and we dodged a bullet this year, of major storms that take these refineries offline, depending upon the severity of the storm. So for national security sake, to have a diversified energy portfolio, John, you said it numerous times, diversification. When you have an investment portfolio, you want diversity for security. 
   We've got to have a diversified energy portfolio. And for our friends on the other side to say no to coal, no to oil, no to nuclear, yes to solar, yes to wind, and it's such a small portion of what can really affect the cost, it's really sending a terrible signal to our constituents that the salvation is in renewables when we all agree we want a diversified portfolio. We want to bring them on. But if you do it at the risk of the other major sources of supply, you do great harm to this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I mean, you bring up a good point. And I would like to focus on that for a minute. Because now you're going from 12 coal fire plants or electricity generation plants to three. And one of the reasons why the building trade and many in organized labor are in support of a new supply provision, because look at what you've done, look at all the jobs to build these plants, and then look at all the good-paying jobs to operate these plants. 
   I don't know what Texas plans are, but I can see them very well, governments south of the great State of Texas citing a power plant and selling power across the border into Texas. And then who gets the jobs? It's like the same, my friend from Pennsylvania, we talk about natural gas all the time; if we're not willing to have a liquefied natural gas port built inside this country, where are they going to go?     
   Where are they going to go? To the Bahamas. Or they are going to go to other places where when they build the port facility, they build the liquefied natural gas, and then they pipe it in to this country. Who loses the jobs? We lose the jobs. So that is one of the frustrating things of this debate. 
   There are two main issues. We always talk about energy security because we address it in the national security component of how do we keep our Nation safe, how do we stop from being extorted by foreign rogue countries, and how do we keep our economy from falling in disruption should there be a strike in the sea lanes. 
   But there is also another security debate that we have talked about, and that is financial security, financial security for this country, and what really strikes individual families is financial security for the families. When you have these types of price escalations, when you don't bring new major supply to the economy and you put all your promises on a small portion of renewables that won't even meet the future demand increase, then what you are doing is, you are going back to $96 a barrel of crude oil. And that is the no energy plan that we are talking about. And all we are saying to our friends, and again, I have many of them. I work with them on the committee all the time. My fossil fuel Democrats, now is the time to make sure that fossil fuel  is a huge, is a part of this debate. And my friend from Pennsylvania is right. We are not saying it has to be the whole thing. We are all comers here. I have got my corn here. I have got my soybeans. I have my coal. I have got marginal oil wells in southern Illinois, marginal oil that we can use and recover, and we are still recovering oil from southern Illinois. Bring on the wind, bring on the solar, but we want to bring everything in. The more supply we have, the lower the cost, the Nation will be better off

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, democracy and the rule of law is something that we have cherished in this country for over 200 years. And it is part of our responsibility to not only strengthen and preserve that in our country, but support those countries who are fighting for democracy and freedom. 
   Many of you may be thinking that this talk is about Iraq and Afghanistan. It is not. It is addressing the last dictatorship in Europe, which I am fortunate to have a relationship with based upon a niche I have developed in working with former captive nations and Eastern European countries. 
   The country of Belarus has been in a dictatorship for many years. And I am here today to call attention to the arrest two nights ago of an opposition leader, Vintsuk Vyachorka, by the KGB police. Yes, the Belarusian police still go by the KGB, under the direction of the Belarusian dictator, Alexander Lukashenka. 
   Vintsuk Vyachorka was pulled from his home in the middle of the night, only to be brought up on non-existent charges that will likely land him in jail for at least 25 days. 
   Madam Speaker, it is my belief, along with many others who have been monitoring the unraveling civil liberties of Belarus, that this arrest is merely the beginning of a series of arrests that the dictator, Mr. Lukashenka, is going to try to use to intimidate opposition leaders into abandoning a large protest on March 25 in honor of Belarusian freedom. 
   I say that we need to stand together today and say that we will not sit by and watch idly as Mr. Lukashenka uses his power to intimidate and scare the Belarusian people. 
   I am holding up a wrist bracelet, and many kids have been wearing these now in the United States for a couple of years. It is very simple. In Belarus, you can get arrested for wearing this. In fact, young people are pulled off the streets, intimidated and harassed. So today I bring this on the floor to show my solidarity with the Belarusian people, for those who are seeking freedom, a return to democracy and the rule of law. 
   I will not be silent, and I know the world community will not be silent until the last dictatorship in Europe changes its ways and becomes a democracy and enters the community of free, democratic countries in Europe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, it is, in essence, the third day in the legislative schedule when I come to the floor to talk about energy prices. 
   When this Democrat majority took over the House, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58 a barrel. Today, it hovers around $111 a barrel. 
   In 2006, the Democrat leadership promised lower gas prices. What we've seen, in reality, is higher gas prices. We've seen negative change, which has caused bitterness in rural America with the high-increasing cost to travel around rural America. All we're asking is for a plan to bring on more supply. 
   I have been in this well numerous times in this Congress to talk about coal-to-liquid technologies. We shouldn't limit it to that. We should talk about expanding renewable fuels. We should talk about the outer continental shelf. We ought to talk about ANWR. We need to bring more supply to lower the cost of fuels because the average American citizens are tired of paying these high gas prices, and it hurts the economy of this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I want to thank my colleague for yielding, and I appreciate all the work he's doing to raise these issues. 
   I'm going to take a different tact tonight and respond to an e-mail that I got from a constituent in my district. And most of the e-mails we are getting are pretty angry about the high costs of fuel and energy. This one is asking  for answers and debating some of our points; so if I might, and it's an e-mail that I usually don't get very much because he claims he's a tree-hugging constituent of mine. So I want to take this time. 
   He says: ``There has to be a better way to go than this. I would rather pay more at the pump than risk poisoning the oceans and nature preserves up north any further with additional drilling.'' I want to address two of those points. 
   There are people who are willing to pay more. But there are people in this country, the poor, the middle class, the lower middle class, who can't afford to pay more, and that's what is frustrating in part about this debate. We know that there are people who, because they are very wealthy, live in splendid homes, can afford to pay whatever the price to bear. But we know in our congressional districts those people who are making tough decisions or families who used to be able to travel away to their kids' sporting events and now have decided not to do that. So it's affecting everyday family life. So I get the point that some people can. I will tell you that the vast majority of Americans can't afford to pay more. 
   And the other issue I would like to address on this is when energy costs go up, costs for everything go up. This whole food/fuel debate is really a food/energy debate. When a kernel of corn gets planted and then gets harvested and goes through the process and then goes all the way to the grocery store, it's going to travel about 1,500 to 2,000 miles. Now double the cost of diesel fuel, and you could see the escalation of food prices. So although someone may be able to pay more at the pump, they are also paying more at the grocery store. They are actually paying more in taxes as we have to heat and electrify government buildings and all those processes. So I get the point that some people can pay more. The vast majority of Americans can't. 
   And I will tell you the ones in my district in rural America, I have got some very proud, independent, tough people who can get through anything, but they live in small counties away from major cities, and to get to work, to get the food, to get the health care, they have to drive long distances. 
   He also says: ``Wouldn't more funding for alternative fuels and infrastructure go a long way?'' And our response would be all of the above. We want that. But when people say let's just put more funding into these things, what that means is that if you're not finding a way to recover that revenue through oil and gas exploration, where does that new revenue come from? The new revenue to advance alternative fuels, the new revenue to increase infrastructure all will come on the backs of individual taxpayers. So now you're laying more energy costs on them; then you're laying more taxes on them; then you're getting to a point where, you know, this country was founded on tax revolt, taxation without representation, and these energy costs are a new tax burden on the middle class that they are revolting from, and they are looking to us for help. 
   I wanted to talk to him about the alternative fuel standard. Most of us know about the renewable fuel standard, talking about biofuels, ethanol. But we have numerous times come to this floor on the alternative fuel standard, and alternative brings in other types of fuels. You have a chart up there of the Outer Continental Shelf. If we were to bring on more supplies of natural gas, we could take that natural gas, turn it into liquid fuels, and that could be part of a new alternative fuel supply which is cleaner than conventional gasoline. 
   Many people know that I'm from Southern Illinois and I deal with coal. Taking coal and turning it into liquid fuel should qualify as an alternative fuel, not relying on imported crude oil, not exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf, not up in Alaska. It is right in the middle of our country, safe and sound from hurricanes, and if they would close the sea traffic, our own coal reserves would not be affected by that. 
   He ends up by saying that we should be working harder and smarter. And I think our position has been we do because what we want to do is we are not saying no. Our problem is this: This trend line from $23 to $58, when the Democrats came in, to $145 is not sustainable. I think that's accepted throughout this country, and I think it's public opinion. 
   So the question is what do you do about it? And you have offered a lot of options. And I like this. I have got the same chart here, the Outer Continental Shelf. We heard today that there is more pollution in the ocean and on the beaches based upon boaters and the normal seepage of oil and gas undersea than there is through oil and gas exploration. So, in fact, oil and gas exploration could take the pressure off the crude oil that's trying to seep to the top of the surface; so it could be at least helpful. 
   Then you get the revenue. This is working smarter. We get the revenue from the folks who are in the Outer Continental Shelf, and you take those dollars, and you move that into wind and solar and alternative fuel technologies, efficiency standards, plug-in hybrids. We're for all of the above, and when you go through all of the above, you're talking about American jobs. 
   GM announced a major layoff today, thousands of jobs. Why? High energy prices. Airlines are laying off thousands of jobs. Why? High energy prices. 
   Here is the coal-to-liquid provision, where we're talking about taking U.S. coal, building a coal-to-liquid refinery, refining that into a liquid fuel, putting it in a pipeline in the United States, taking it to our airports. We can produce jet fuel from coal. South Africa has done it for 50 years. 
   Finally, another option is the renewable fuels under attack. Biodiesel by soy or reformulated cooking oil, ethanol. Hopefully, we move to the cellulosic arena where we're out of the corn kernel and we move to really the trash of the trash. We can get there, and I say to my constituent who wrote, and I will probably reply with an e-mail, that we can get there by working harder and smarter using the great resources. 
   We are the only industrialized nation in the world where we see a natural resource and we say, ``Ah, an environmental hazard,'' instead of saying, wow, now we are placed in a strategic national advantage to compete against the world in manufacturing goods and services. We can take the royalties from that and we can help to decrease our reliance on imported crude oil. 
   That's the future we are working for. It's a future of job creation for all America. It keeps us competitive around the world. And the first start is to allow us to start recovering the oil and gas reserves in this great country. 
   I appreciate your leadership. I signed your petition. We're having a lot of fun helping to educate ourselves and to educate the American people, and I appreciate the time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this time to be able to address. I want to commend East High School in Denver, Colorado. As a former civics teacher myself, I concur with my colleague from Colorado of the importance of teaching government and the processes of how we should do things here in Washington. Hopefully they're giving some real world examples of what we do and what we fail to do. An  example of what we fail to do is energy policy in this country. 
   Historically, since the Bush administration came in, crude oil was at $23 a barrel. When this new leadership came in in the House, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58, now it stands at $145 a barrel. What we're saying here on this side of the aisle is that the trend line in this energy debate is bad, and we have to address this. That's why we've come to the floor--unfortunately we have to do it in times like this--to raise awareness that there is a plan to get away from this reliance on imported crude oil. And that answer is, do all of the above. Do all of the above: Expand our renewable portfolio; push for efficiencies; open up the Outer Continental Shelf; explore and recover gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I was in a hearing today addressing expansion of nuclear power. Move to coal-to-liquid technologies. 
   Now, what's interesting about this floor, this bicameral legislative body that we have, we have a House and a Senate. The Founding Fathers, as ``We the People'' would teach, identified the House as the body that should be most outraged and be the most responsive to the public needs and demands. It is the House that's supposed to take up the clarion call when the public is angry and frustrated at their government, and it is the House that's not doing that. We're acting like we're the Senate. We're sitting back and doing nothing. We're trying to take some long-term provision instead of moving aggressively to address the energy crisis in this country. 
   And the people are behind us. Numerous polling is highlighting this debate. A new IBD/TIPP poll says 64 percent of Americans support Republican-led new American energy production efforts. That's not good enough? I had a telephone town hall meeting last night to my district. Three different callers referenced this poll number: 76 percent of Americans say we need more drilling, we need more supply. 
   The Founding Fathers, in the formation of this new Constitution that we have, would say it is the House that should be taking up this call. We're the ones who are supposed to be responding to the 76 percent of Americans, saying, ``we hear you. We're going to aggressively move to open up more supplies.'' 
   Seventy-six percent, just over three-quarters, support immediately increasing oil drilling in the United States, more than seven in 10. And from Democrats, 71 percent of Democrats hold this view. So the populist issue that should be raised in the House is not being heard. A CNN opinion research poll, 73 percent of more than 1,000 Americans surveyed from June 26 to June 29 said they favor offshore drilling for oil and natural gas in U.S. waters. Los Angeles Times poll, 68 percent; when all registered voters were asked whether they support increased exploration for oil and natural gas, 68 percent responded in the affirmative. In a Rasmussen poll, 67 percent. According to Rasmussen, 67 percent of Americans support oil drilling off the Nation's coast. And 64 percent think it will lower gas prices. 
   Is anyone on the floor of the House listening to this? Sixty-seven percent. Seventy-six percent of the public want us to drill. They want us to look at our natural resources not as an environmental disaster, but as a strategic national interest. 
   Reuters: Most Americans support more U.S. oil drilling, some 59.6 percent of Americans surveyed in a poll. In a Gallup poll, 57 percent support drilling. Now, why is this important? Here's a news story from my congressional district, Wayne County Board. The Wayne County Board has approved covering a shortfall in the county sheriff's gasoline budget with money from the county's Public Safety Tax Fund. Members urged the sheriff to cut costs anywhere possible and to curb any unnecessary spending the remainder of the fiscal year. Why? High energy costs.     
   A transfer of funds will take place near the end of the current fiscal year. 
   Sheriff Jim Hinkle has announced that dramatic measures have been taken to curb gasoline consumption in his department. This is in a rural county. One major community, rural. The sheriff covers the entire county. He has initiated two-man patrols and has mandated that officers perform 2 hours of stationary patrol. I think that's an oxymoron. How can you patrol and be stationary? But energy costs are causing rural sheriffs to make a decision which does not have sheriffs driving the county roads. He has initiated two-man patrols and has mandated that officers perform 2 hours of stationary patrol with their engines turned off during each 8-hour shift. 
   Friends, we don't have to be in this position. Mr. Speaker, we can aggressively address these issues. The House should be the body. My colleagues on the other side should be welcoming this. We're doing what the Founding Fathers intended us to do. We are the body that should be throwing stones when the Federal Government is not hearing the cries of the public. And the cries of the public are we have got to address this problem. And how do we do it? 
   A current debate is the Outer Continental Shelf. We only drill and explore on 15 percent of the Federal lands in the Outer Continental Shelf, and that is the western gulf. What is off-limits by mandate by us by Federal law, we said no, you cannot go on the West Coast, you cannot go on the East Coast, you cannot go on the eastern gulf coast, thus depriving our country of billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. 
   We can change this today with a vote on the floor. In fact, yesterday the President said have at it, I will not stand in the way. Now it's up to us to address the Outer Continental Shelf, bringing on more supply to lower gas and oil prices. That's what this line here has. 
   Other options is when we do that, we'll get royalties, we will get Federal money, and we can expand wind and solar. The great position about our side is we are for all of the above. We want more renewables. We want more efficiency standards. We want more supply. We want more energy to lower prices. 
   Also I have talked about earlier coal-to-liquid technologies. Taking American coal, American jobs, mining that coal, bringing it to the surface, building a coal-to-liquid refinery, refining that coal into liquid fuel and using it for aviation. The bill coming to the floor next is honoring Nelson Mandela. South Africa is a leader on coal-to-liquid technologies. South African Airlines, that's how they operate their fleet. 
   And then, of course, the renewable fuel issues with biodiesel, soy diesel, ethanol, cellulosic. And the one solution is to bring on more supply. 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this time to be able to talk about we the people and addressing the important educational aspects of our Founding Fathers. Having taught civics for 4 years at the high school level, I agree with my colleague from Colorado we can't teach the Constitution and the process more than we do today, but we have to lead by example here on the floor of the House. We cannot continue to bring regular order bills on a suspension calendar so we are not allowed a chance to amend, debate, and argue this out in front of the American people. 
   This is the first in a long time that the Republican side has been so right on a populous issue that the public wants and that we're right on our votes, that we welcome any chance, and, unfortunately, the only chance we have to do it is on suspension bills like we have today. 
   I want to thank my colleague from New York, who is a great friend and a colleague, for putting up with my ranting and raving. I want to thank the ranking member.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Battling charge, that's what I like. Finally we get to talk about supply. 
   Mr. Speaker, for 18 months I have been coming to the floor to talk about the importance of bringing more supply to our economy so that prices would go down. 
   Finally we have it, and I want to thank you for making the point. If you want to lower the cost, you've got to bring on supply. 
   It was $58 a barrel when your majority came into power, $58. What is it today? It's $126. 
   What has it done? I'm glad my friend talked about gas prices. It wasn't George Bush who promised to lower gas prices. It was Speaker Pelosi in 2006, Steny Hoyer in 2006, Jim Clyburn in 2006, who said, ``We have a plan to lower gas prices.'' That's their quote. I have said it here 20 times here on this floor. ``We have a plan.'' 
   They've got a plan all right. It's not to lower gas prices; it's to raise gas prices. 
   What has happened to a gallon of gas? It was $2.33 when this majority came in. What is it today? It is $3.77. Now my colleague from Massachusetts brings on climate change for a 50 cent additional tax per gallon of gas, per the chairman of the Commerce Committee. We would be paying $4.27 for a gallon of gas. That's not the type of change we need. We need to bring on supply. 
   I thank you for finally coming to the floor and recognizing that if we bring on just some barrels more supply, you guys say we're going to lower prices 5 cents to 25 cents. Well, let's multiply that by bringing on a million barrels of crude oil into our supply. Where do we get that? We can get billions of barrels of crude oil from coal-to-liquid technologies right in the heartland, right in Southern Illinois, Fischer-Tropsch Technology, established in the World War II generation, currently developed by a South African oil company. 
   And one of my personal favorites is the Outer Continental Shelf. Billions of barrels of oil on the eastern seaboard, on the western seaboard, on the eastern gulf coast. Trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. 
   What's your policy? Let's don't go there. Oh, yes, let's settle for a little bit of oil out of the SPR and claim great victory for lowering prices when we could have billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas if we just went to the Outer Continental Shelf, if we just went to the eastern gulf, if we just used coal-to-liquid technologies, a bipartisan bill Congressman Boucher and I would like to take. 
   We are the number one coal country in the world. So let's don't settle for a half step. This is good. We can do much better.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, we just took an interesting vote on the floor a few minutes ago, and that was to stop filling the SPR and make sure there's 70,000 barrels on the market. The projections by my friends on the other side is that this will affect the cost from 5 cents to 25 cents per gallon. 
   Just think what putting a million barrels of crude oil into the market--and we can do that by bringing on more supply. 
   I've been on the floor numerous times to talk about coal to liquid technologies. We have 250 years worth of coal in the Illinois coal basin alone. Turning that into liquid fuel. 
   Of as great importance is the Outer Continental Shelf, billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, off-limits based upon policies enacted here in this House. And if 70,000 barrels will do 5 to 25 cents a gallon, just think what a million barrels of crude oil. 
   We have one problem. We haven't built a refinery in 32 years.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, from Congress Daily AM on Monday, 21 April, the heading was: Florida delight as talks intensify behind closed doors on several issues. Members negotiate behind the scenes to finish a farm bill conference and plan their maneuvers for moving a war supplemental bill and more possible tradeoffs to move a Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Funny. No talk about gasoline, no talk about the high energy prices. The number one issue affecting consumers today and the pocketbooks of mom and dad and driving kids to events is the high cost of gasoline. 
   When this majority took over, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58.31. Today--actually, this is wrong--it was updated at $117. It did get to $118 a barrel. When you don't have a plan, you plan to fail. I would hope that the Democrat majority would, in their negotiations, talk about how they are going to address the high cost of energy in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (DENOUNCING THE GOVERNMENT OF BELARUS -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, March 25, approximately 7,000 citizens of Belarus gathered together in commemoration of the 89th anniversary of the short-lived Belarusian National Republic, which was formed on March 25, 1918, when Belarusians proclaimed their independence from the Russian empire. Unfortunately, only 10 months later, the Red Army entered Minsk, quashed this democracy and set up the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. 
   On Sunday, the brave men and women of Belarus gathered together to commemorate their ancestors' drive for democracy and independence almost 90 years ago and express their own desire to live in free and democratic Belarus. This group had planned to assemble in October Square in central Minsk to start their peaceful march towards the National Academy of Sciences. However, participants arrived at this public square to find it blocked by riot police, and trucks and busses were forced to split into several groups. 
   One group decided to march to the Sport Palace and reassemble there. When they got to that destination, they were met by a large number of policemen warning that if they did not leave within the next 5 minutes, special measures would be taken against them. Several minutes later, the first clash between the police and protesters took place, with several people beaten and arrested. Former presidential candidate Aleksander Milinkevich and his wife were among those hit and knocked to the ground. 
   Finally, the group managed to break through and march to the National Academy of Sciences, where they were able to meet up with the rest of the group; and a rally was held. Participants included young people and families with children. They shouted slogans, sang songs and waived red and white Belarusian flags and banners which read ``Freedom to Kozulin and freedom to political prisoners.'' 
   While speaking to the crowd, former presidential candidate Aleksander Milinkevich declared that ``Democratic Belarus will prevail, as truth and God are on its side. Under the weight of its lies, this regime will fall, but we should give it a push with our strength, our loyalty and our love for the homeland. We should do this in a peaceful manner, as Belarusians don't like violence. We are peaceful people and have not shed anyone's blood. It is our blood that has been shed and our people are in prison.'' 
   Yet in spite of the peaceful nature of a crowd and Mr. Milinkevich's public assurances that the pro-democratic forces carried a message of peace, the police continued to try to break up the rally. Police set up loudspeakers which continually interrupted the rally speakers, warning the group that their actions were illegal, that they had not received permission to hold a rally at the National Academy of Sciences, and if they refused to leave, physical force would be used against them. Forty people were arrested on March 25th alone. Many people were also beaten with police batons. 
   Leaders of the pro-democratic forces in Belarus, Anatoly Lebedko, Alexander Milinkevich, Victor Karnyenka and Valentina Polevikova, were among those hit by security forces' batons, with Ms. Polevikova suffering a head injury. 
   What is additionally disconcerting is that 60 additional activists were arrested on March 23rd and 24th in the lead-up to the rally in a shocking incident. Prominent pro-democratic activist and mother of two, Krystsina Shatsikava, was abducted by unknown men and forced into a car at 4:30 p.m. on Friday, March 23rd. She was later brought to a mental hospital in Mogilov, where she said that she had been tied to a bed and given an unknown injection at the hospital. She was finally released today. The young woman was a prominent activist following the fraudulent presidential elections in March, 2006, and had repeatedly declared her intention to participate in the March 25th rally. 
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I find it appalling that 7,000 peaceful protestors gathered together to commemorate an anniversary of national independence and freedom, only to have their voices crushed once again by the current regime of Aleksander Lukashenko. 
   I denounce the government of Belarus for its actions against these peaceful protestors and demand that they release all the activists who were jailed for their participation during the leading up to the March 25th rally. 
   I also, along with our European colleagues, once again urge the government of Belarus to allow its citizens to exercise their right to assemble peacefully and express their views freely.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I also want to commend the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, who is really interested in transportation issues, a good man of heart, and I applaud your leadership. 
   Mr. Chairman, this authorization bill brings 1,500 new Coast Guardsmen. We're proud of their service. 
   My debate, my concern, over the past 2 weeks, obviously, is energy and the increased cost of bringing on the 1,500 new Coast Guardsmen in addition to the burden on the government. It would be better if we had lower energy costs to help meet those needs, but we don't. We have higher costs. 
   Of course, the Coast Guard uses aviation fuel too, quite a bit of it. So does the United States Air Force. For every $10 over a barrel, it costs our Air Force 600 million more dollars out of the budget. We know the burden on the Coast Guard helicopters. We know the cost to the Coast Guard ships that are diesel run. For every dollar increase in diesel fuel, it costs the Coast Guard $26 million to operate. 
   And this is the kind of the charts I have been using over the past 3 weeks and will continue to use this ad infinitum until this country, which is the greatest country on the face of this Earth, does what other developing countries do: that we go and explore and use our own resources to meet our own needs. 
   We know that we are dependent upon imported crude oil. Shame on us. Shame on us when we have the ability to meet our energy needs. 
   And this is what happens: When this majority took over, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58.31. Today it dropped a dollar from last week, $116. That's the problem. What's the problem at the pump? From $2.33 to $3.55. Bringing climate change legislation, 50 cents of additional tax on gasoline, we would be paying $4.05. 
   What's the solution? One, use our abundant natural resources in our country, coal-to-liquid technologies. In Illinois alone we have 250 years' worth of energy just waiting to be brought on line, turned into liquefied fuel, lowering the cost of diesel to our Coast Guard, saving the taxpayers money. But we won't move on any bill that brings on fossil fuels and expansion of fossil fuels on this floor. Shame on us. 
   What's another solution? The Coast Guard protects our coast. Look at the red area over there: the Outer Continental Shelf, ripe for exploration development, natural gas, crude oil. But, no, it's off-limits. We can't get there. 
   Think about Katrina. The Coast Guard performed admirably. 
   You know what we forget? Remember that big cloud that rolled up? Tell me the major ecological damage based upon all those oil platforms in the coast. Can you name one? No. Not a single one because we can do it safely. So we can do it safely in those areas. We should not have to burden the taxpayer with $26 million of cost for allowing crude oil prices to go up. We shouldn't do that. And that's why it's important to lower our prices.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan outlined crucial actions we took in the last Congress to improve the use of telecommunications technologies, and I appreciate those efforts, especially as co-Chair of the E911 caucus. But our work for Homeland Security was not confined to the telecommunications arena. 
   One of the most important issues Congress faced last year was creating a program in the Department of Homeland Security to protect chemical facilities from terrorist attacks. The challenge was to ensure that our Nation's chemical plants could appropriately secure their facilities by providing technical guidance and oversight by the Department of Homeland Security but without being overzealous and allowing DHS to take over the daily management of these facilities. 
   We needed to prevent terrorists from using our domestic disclosure laws from obtaining roadmaps to our chemical plants' vulnerabilities. Congress also clarified the distinct reach of existing environmental and public health laws versus homeland security and chemical plant securities. 
   While the more conscientious members of the American chemical industry already had a head start on Congress by developing rigorous security standards on their own, Congress has now ensured that good security standards govern all significant chemical players, not just the conscientious leaders. 
   DHS's chemical security program is not about using the threat of terrorism as an excuse to drive American chemical factories offshore. Its purpose is just the opposite: to make certain that chemical facilities continue to be safe for these workers and communities, to ensure the viability of employment in the chemical industry for American workers, and to guarantee that all Americans can continue to enjoy the benefits of these plant products. 
   As Chairman Barton said last year, America does not become safer with greater levels of regulation. It just becomes more regulated. 
   DHS has recently proposed regulations to carry out this new chemical plant security authority, and those regulations closely follow Congress's intent in hammering out the compromise. 
   I look forward to working with the Department to ensure that the program gets underway and measures up to the task that Congress gave it in the Fiscal Year 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (THE PRICE OF OIL -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, energy security is national security. When President Bush was sworn into office, a barrel of crude oil was approximately $27 a barrel. When the Democrats took over the House, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58, a $31 increase. 
   Since this Democrat-controlled House has been in power, the price of a barrel of crude oil has gone from $35 to today $110 a barrel of crude oil. 
   Now, what's the solution? The solution is more supply. Democrats continue to block Outer Continental Shelf exploration. They continue to block oil exploration. They continue to block coal-to-liquid technologies. 
   More supply brings lower prices. If you know basic economics supply and demand, you know that if you have a high demand you need more supply. 
   Until we bring more supply back into this debate, the only thing we could  tell our consumers and our constituents is be prepared for more price spikes. Energy security is national security.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (HIGH ENERGY PRICES -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, it's great to be back in the Chamber with the microphones on and with the lights fully ablaze and with our guests in the gallery and with cameras rolling. 
   For the past 5 weeks, I along with 135 of my Republican House colleagues have been on the floor, talking to our guests in the Chamber, talking about the number one issue facing America today, which is high energy prices. It was a very good exchange and a chance to not only talk about energy and where we're at and where we need to go in the future but also to visit with many of our guests here in Washington, D.C. 
   The major premises that we had when we left on the 1st of August are still true today. We have no comprehensive energy plan or policy. Even though gas prices might be stabilizing, they're stabilizing because the economy is going down. Eighty-four thousand jobs have been lost, all directly related to high energy costs. Think of it. In the aviation industry, in the transportation industry and in the automobile industry, those jobs have been lost because of high energy prices. So here is what we've been talking about over the past year. 
   Here is the problem. The problem is, when President Bush came into office, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $23. Actually, when I came into office, it was $10 a barrel. When the Democrats came in in January, it was at $58. Today--and I update this daily--the price of a barrel of crude oil is $104.13. 
   All we're trying to say here from our side of the aisle is this is not a good trend. This is not a direction in which we want to continue if we want to have a thriving economy, one that all of the people of our country can benefit from. I represent rural America. I represent 30 counties of southern Illinois, and it's really those in the rural communities who have to drive long distances to get to work, to get to school, to access health care; there's no public transportation; they're working in the fields; they drive big trucks. They're the ones who are harmed, I think, exponentially greater than those in major metropolitan areas. So this is not a good trend. 
   So what is the solution? One solution is to bring on more supply. On this chart, we identify some of those supply options that we have in this country that we fail to access, and I had a bigger chart earlier. One that we hear a lot about is the Outer Continental Shelf. We only drill and explore in 15 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf, and we don't want to just up that to, maybe, 30 percent, which are some of the proposals coming from the other side of the aisle. We want to open up the entire Outer Continental Shelf. We want all of the above. We want to open up the eastern gulf. We want to open up the eastern seaboard of the Atlantic. We want to look at what's on our west coast. We want to make sure that there are billions of barrels of oil and the trillions of cubic feet of natural gas we can find and that we can access so we can help bring on more supply, U.S. supply. When we do this, this is U.S. energy and this is U.S. jobs, which is what this country needs. 
   Another resource that we have is coal. The United States has more coal reserves than any country on Earth today. In Illinois alone, we have 250 years worth of recoverable coal. We should access that for electricity. In Illinois, 70 percent of our electricity is by coal-fired power plants. Nationally, as a whole, 50 percent of all electricity is generated by coal. We can take coal and turn it into liquid fuel, thus competing with gasoline, thus competing with diesel fuel, thus competing with aviation fuel by having a new commodity product to compete with crude oil. We can move to solar and wind. That's part of the solution. That is more supply. We can look at renewable fuels like biodiesel and ethanol--ethanol from corn, ethanol from cellulosic feedstocks. 
   The big debate here is: What do you do with the Outer Continental Shelf? Here is a bigger chart. All of this red area is off limits by our design here in the House of Representatives. We have said annually for the past 30 years ``no'' to going after oil and gas in those areas. We are at a crisis time. This debate which will be on this floor is: Do we open up a little bit more or do we open up the whole thing? My position and that of the majority of people in my country is ``all of the above.''

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I got a magazine from a good friend, a former colleague of ours, Chris John, who is now the president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association. All of our colleagues got this magazine. I want to quote from his introduction in this magazine: 
   ``The path of the Washington Democrats, with a few notable exceptions, is to repeal tax incentives and possibly levy other taxes on the industry, with the money going to the development of alternative fuels. This will do nothing to lower gasoline prices or increase crude oil supplies. In fact, enactment of such a plan would discourage new investment in exploration and production in the United States and send those dollars overseas.'' 
   Now, Chris is a good friend and a former colleague, one that we all trust and appreciate his service. He is right on this issue. We should not drive our investment in oil and gas exploration overseas by burdening them with new taxes.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I feel sympathy for the folks paying these high gas prices. Here is a problem: On average, $3.98, take in climate change 50 cents and we'll be paying $4.48 a gallon. 
   Here is the solution: Outer Continental Shelf, which is off-limits by appropriation bills; moving coal-to-liquid technology, which has been blocked here on motions to recommit; expanding renewable fuels, which has been helpful, but still is not the panacea. 
   The New York Times, which is not one of our best supporters, says the counties were motorists spend the highest percentage of their income on gasoline tend to be poor, rural areas, which is what I represent. That is why I am on the floor monthly now talking about gas reaching $4 a gallon, refinery expansion delayed because of environmental attacks, the clean gas, $4 increase in price of natural gas bills. 
   Our consuming public cannot stand these high prices any more. Our manufacturing base cannot. We have to bring on more supply.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I appreciate Congresswoman Matsui managing the time. We've worked very hard on clean diesel issues and the like, so this is really appropriate to this debate though, because Amtrak uses big diesel engines. And what's happened in the Amtrak debate that we haven't heard yet, hopefully we'll hear it later on is, like, one of the biggest threats to Amtrak is the high cost of diesel fuel. In fact, the fiscal year 2007 budget for fuel was $125 million for Amtrak. The fiscal year 2008 budget for fuel for Amtrak is $215 million.  
   Now, how are we going to pay for that? I know how they're going to pay for it. They're going to raise prices on these commuters. And there are some commuters who use Amtrak. But again, I'll quote the New York Times article that says ``the counties where motorists spend the highest percentage of their income on gasoline tend to be in poor, rural areas.'' Amtrak doesn't go there. We don't have commuter rails. We have working trucks. We have big trucks. We haul feed. We haul beef. We haul pork. We need working trucks and they drive a large distance. 
   That's why this energy debate is critical. And here's the problem. All we're trying to do is bring, what's the problem, what's the solution. What's the problem. What's the solution. 
   Here's the problem. January 2001. $23 a barrel. January 2006, after the Democrats took control and promised to lower fuel prices, that's right here, where are we today? $123 a barrel. 
   What does that do for gas prices? From $1.45 to $2.33 to over $4 a gallon for gas hurts rural America, hurts my district.     
   Don't come to the floor without a solution. The Outer Continental Shelf, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, billions of barrels of oil. We have in this Congress and Congresses of the past said ``off-limits.'' We're not going to explore this area. We're not going to recover. 
   Very similar to our position on ANWR. A position a size of the State of South Carolina. A drilling platform the size of an airport. And we are not going to drill there for billions of barrels of oil. President Clinton vetoed that in 1995. Had he not, that oil would be flowing to our country today. 1995 he vetoed the bill. President Carter put it off-limits for oil and gas exploration. That's why ANWR was originally set aside, but, no, we have that off-limits. 
   What is another solution? Coal-to-liquid technologies, diesel fuel that could help lower the price for Amtrak can be produced by taking U.S. coal, American energy, and turning it into fuel. 
   We're going to come to this floor talking about, oh, unemployment compensation.

Let's build pipelines to get this fuel to the Amtrak station to put in the diesel engines, and let's help our budget airlines not go bankrupt because of the high cost of fuel.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I always love following my friend from Massachusetts. 
   You know, most countries view their resources as a strategic advantage. But we in this country in the majority view our resources as an environmental hazard. This motion to instruct is critical. If we can get a million barrels out of ANWR at today's prices, do you know how much money goes into the Federal Treasury? $192 billion. Go tell that to your Blue Dogs who are holding up emergency supplemental bills because of PAYGO. 
   That's just ANWR. Let's talk about the other resources that we have. 
   Here is the reality. It wasn't President Bush that promised in 2006 that the Democrats have a plan to lower gas prices. That was Speaker Pelosi. In fact, she made the same mistake today. She claimed numerous times that the ag bill would lower prices, gas prices. 
   Now, I voted for it. I'm an ethanol guy. I'm a cellulosic guy. But if we don't bring more supply into the market, we're not going to lower prices. The demand from China and the demand from India and the demand from Europe just overwhelms us and is overwhelming the market. It was $58 when this majority came into power, $125 today. 
   I haven't used this for a while, but the Pelosi Premium, $2.33 when you came into the majority, Speaker Pelosi said, We're going to lower gas prices. $3.77 today. Chairman Dingell is here. He's pulled this bill off the table, but climate change would add 50 cents a gallon. $4.20 is what we would be paying under climate change and current gas prices. 
   What's the solution? The great Outer Continental Shelf. Billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. There are. You can't deny it. The eastern gulf, off-limits by appropriation bill. Not resources bill. It's an appropriation bill that puts this off-limits. It's the OCS off the western coast. Billions of barrels of oil, trillions of cubic feet; we can't have it. 
   What would we do with the $192 billion from ANWR royalties? Let's go and take American coal, United Mine Worker jobs, let's build coal-to-liquid refineries, operating engineer, building-trade jobs. Let's build pipelines. Major organized labor jobs. And let's use it to lower the cost of jet fuel so we don't have the aviation industry going bankrupt. $192 billion would go a long way to do the solar, to do the wind power, to do everything we want to do. 
   We want more supply, not less. Environmental resources is a national advantage for our country, but we won't take use of it.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I want to thank my colleague. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the best things we can do for the family farmer in this economy is to lower energy costs. And that's why I'm coming to the floor because I am excited about my colleague's previous question to bring on more supply. 
   Now, I was pleased to see that my friends on the other side have accepted the supply debate, and we did that yesterday with great acclamation, saying that bringing in 70,000 barrels of crude oil onto the market would lower gasoline prices, your quote, not mine, between 5 cents to 25 cents. 
   Well, just imagine if we brought a million barrels of crude oil onto our market, a million barrels from U.S. territory. And I think that's what my colleague is going to bring in the previous question, because 1 1/2 years ago, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58. Today the price of a barrel of crude oil is $125.09. I'm telling you the public is starting to wake up. I'm hearing it from soccer moms. I'm hearing it from labor individuals. They understand that the cost of energy is too high. The price of diesel has doubled. 
   In an agricultural country, my farmers are trying to get their corn in. It's been really wet. And it's diesel fuel. Diesel fuel has doubled. We've got small local truckers going on strike because they can't afford to fill up the tractor-trailers because diesel costs are too high. Why are diesel costs too high? Because we won't open up any supply. 
   I think the previous question will be an opportunity to open up supply on U.S. soil, and maybe we will get a chance to talk about opening up supply on the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   You all agreed to it. Supply will lower prices, based upon our vote yesterday. But that was 70,000 barrels. Our challenge is to bring a million barrels, locally produced crude oil and natural gas. Because we can't sustain these high prices. We can't sustain them in the family farm. 
   And that's why I'm excited to be here today to continue to raise this debate on the price of a barrel of crude oil. 
   Another thing we could do is take our locally produced coal----

We want to address the Outer Continental Shelf, both on the east coast and the western seaboard and the eastern gulf. We want to address coal-to-liquid technology, where we take coal underneath the soil or on our upper plain, build a refinery, U.S. jobs; operate a coal mine, U.S. jobs; build a pipeline, U.S. jobs; and lower the cost for jet fuel so that we can have U.S. jobs.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chairman, it's great to be down here to talk about healthy beaches again. 
   I spoke on the rule. The first colleague on the other side talked about oil wells and how they endanger healthy beaches, so it gave me an opportunity to continue to talk about the failed Democratic policies on energy and the continued increase in the cost of energy in this country and the continued future plan for energy increases in the decades to come.  
   It's a simple economic debate, supply and demand. We need more supply. The failed Democrat policies will not bring more supply to this debate. 
   How does it relate to healthy beaches? I will tell you how it relates to healthy beaches. What is the most damaging thing to a beach, an oil spill. 
   How do oil spills occur? They occur when we have these big super tankers traveling all around the world trying to feed the demand. We want to stop oil spills, and the best way to stop oil spills is to develop our own resources, redevelop our own oil wells. In southern Illinois, in Texas, on the Outer Continental Shelf, a lot of the places we have oil, the Democrat majority continues to put them off-limits. 
   What happens? Prices go up. Here is an example. We have seen this chart before, and I imagine we are going to see it a lot the rest of this year, except there is going to be a change. Every time we see it, the price of a barrel of crude oil is going to continue to go up. 
   When this majority, Speaker Pelosi, took the oath of office, swore us all in, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58.31. 
   What is it today? Actually, this is wrong, they didn't update it. This was from a couple of days ago. I think it raised, got to $114, $114 a barrel. When you do not plan, you plan to fail. The Democrats have no plan. They said they had a plan, Speaker Pelosi is quoted, in a quote on April 24, 2006, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' 
   I have a plan. The only plan was to increase gas prices, not lower them. 
   Here is a quote from Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on October 4, 2005: ``Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices.'' You are doing more for the people who are struggling with high gas prices, you are making it more difficult. 
   We have, as I have used the term before, bitter change. Why are folks bitter in America? Why are folks bitter in rural America? Because we are paying high gas prices because we can't get supply. 
   You bet we are bitter, because in rural America we drive the long distances to get to work. We are the folks who don't have buses, we don't have light rail. We have got a lot of rural Members here, and we need big vehicles to haul our beef and our pork and our corn to the refineries. We need trucks. 
   I brought down pictures yesterday of independent truckers going on strike. Why? Diesel oil is up over $4 a gallon. 
   When you don't have a plan, you plan to fail. What's the solution? Coal-to-liquid technologies. It's not imported. Coal field, U.S. refineries, U.S. jobs, lower price fuel. That's a solution. 
   What's another solution? These are all the areas Democrats have put off-limits for exploration. Look at it. You know what is even worse, what you all tried to do in the last energy bill, you tried to take a big chunk out of Colorado and say we are not going to explore there either. 
   Supply and demand, the simple basic economics. We have higher demand, you don't allow a supply, we get higher prices, over $1.02 a gallon for gas since the Democrats went into the majority. You know what? 
   It's going to continue to go up. You have no plan. How are we going to get these prices lower? ``Oh, let's tax the oil companies.'' That's really going to bring prices down. You know what that's going to do? It's going to raise prices and you are hurting the people you say you support. 
   You are hurting the middle class, you are hurting the lower middle class. This also translates into electricity, translates here into your great debate on climate change. John Dingell said let's address climate change by adding an additional 50 cents a gallon for gas.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Chairman, I'm glad we are talking about healthy beaches. As I said earlier, one of the most damaging aspects about healthy beaches is an oil spill, and one way to limit the risk of oil spills is to become more self-reliant, and I know my colleague would appreciate it because he does a lot of renewal, and it's great work, but renewable alone can't fill the future demand. In fact, it really only nibbles around the edges. 
   I'm also glad we're opening up the discussion to climate change because the reality is is that climate change will cost the American public, and it's going to cost us big bucks. And those of us on our side who are willing to go into debate just hope that there's some honest discussion on the real costs needed. 
   I'm not a big cap-and-trade guy. I think it's a game by which we're going to play with the consumers hiding the real cost. Chairman Dingell, intellectually honest, said, let's add 50 cents a gallon to gasoline to help pay for the climate change cost. He's at least being intellectually honest because he's going to go and help the debate saying there is going to be a cost, we're going to have to pay for it, let's add 50 cents to a gallon of gas. Now, a gallon of gas is $3.50; that would make it $4. We know it's going to get to $4 this summer. That means a gallon of gas will be $4.50. That's the challenge. 
   The California Public Utility Commission on electricity generation said, let's add a 20 to 30 percent surcharge on our electricity bill. That's the cost we're going to incur to comply with climate change. 
   So, again, we're asking that there be a great debate on climate change, and as we're going to bring in money to help address this, that the people who are going to have to pay these costs know that there's going to be costs. And again, Chairman Dingell is being intellectually honest. The Public Utility Commission of California is being intellectually honest. And we are going to address that. 
   Because here is the problem. When the Democrats took office, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58 a barrel. Now what is it today? I think this is actually wrong. It's $114 a barrel. $114. 
   Now, I came down here on a 1-minute this week, got some clips. Here is a clip from my district, Independent Truckers Join Strike. Independent Truckers Join Strike. You want to know why the aviation industry is going bust, all of these low-cost airlines? High fuel costs. 
   So if we want healthy beaches, and we don't want oil spills, we have to develop the resources that we have. We have a solution. One that the Democrat majority is unwilling to bring to the floor; although if they did, we would pass it. I could guarantee we would pass it. And that's using great natural resources in the only coal basin, the high plains of Montana, Wyoming, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio. We know we have coal under the ground, and we know that we can turn that coal into synthetic fuel. Low-cost fuel, abundant supply, and we know that we can refine this coal using biomass and carbon sequestration cleaner than current crude oil refineries. 
   And where are our crude oil refineries? They're on the coast. Most of them are in the gulf coast. That's a great place to protect our healthy beaches, by having all of these refineries on the coast. And we saw what Katrina did. Katrina caused a disruption in cost. Katrina caused obviously outages in these refineries. This would give us the opportunity to have refineries located in the heartland with the commodity product of coal right there. 
   Dig the coal, American jobs; build the refinery, American jobs; refine the oil into fuel, American jobs; put it in a pipeline to the aviation industry, American jobs. What is clearer than that? It's a great success. But we can't get that moved to the floor. So what do we have? No supply, $113 a barrel. 
   Now I have read the quotes from the Democratic leadership. They had a plan in 2006 to lower gas prices. I have read the quotes. No one has disputed them. And guess what? You have only raised gas prices. And guess what is going to happen this summer? Gas prices are only going to go up higher. When you have no plan, you plan to fail.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, it is really simple: If you want to help rural small town poor individuals in this country, we have to get the price of gas down. Here is the problem: January 2001, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $23. When this majority came in, it was $58. Now it is $134. What does that translate into? From $1.45 to $2.23 to $4.07. Add climate change, 50 cents additional. $4.55, if you calculate climate change. 
   What is the solution? The solution is all of the above. Outer Continental Shelf exploration and recovery, coal-to-liquid technologies, solar and wind, renewable fuels. We need to do all the above, and you all need to help us. 
   We need to bring a bill to the floor that brings on more supply. We are willing to work with you. More supply is the only thing that we can do to bring down the cost of fuel which will help middle- and low-income Americans. We ask you to join us.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (ENERGY SUPPLY AND DEMAND -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, it is great to be on the floor today. You know, just because it's said on the floor doesn't mean it's true, and there are a lot of people who've discussed things today and who've discussed things throughout the debate, and so let's start talking about facts. 
   I've been on the floor numerous times to talk about energy, and I've softened my discussions. I used to talk about the Pelosi premium. I've kind of gone away from that because, really, the problem is a problem of supply. So I go back to the Bush administration, to January 2001, where a barrel of crude oil was $23. You know, I just want to be honest. I want to talk about supply and demand. I want to get away from the partisan wrangle and address what we really need to address--lower gas prices--which is to bring on more supply. As we talk about these bills that are going to come forward this week, they do nothing for supply, and we'll talk about why that is. 
   Then when this new majority came in and since Bush has come in, the price has doubled to $58 a barrel. Now, I didn't have time to update today's crude oil price, but as of Thursday of last week, it was $136 a barrel, which is over double the $58. The trend line is negative. The trend line is not a positive thing. So the debate is how do we change the trend line. How do we get to a price where we at least stabilize the price of a barrel of crude oil? Then how do we help that effect the lowering of gas prices? 
   I live in the bi-State area between St. Louis and Illinois where it's $4.17 a gallon. So, even if we're assuming the promise of the Speaker that we drop it by 50 cents on speculation, we're still paying $3.85 or $3.75. I mean it is still way too high for people in rural America to get to work, to go to school, to get in the fields. Diesel prices have doubled. It's way too high. Even if we assume the promise of speculation at 50 cents, which I reject, that's still way too high. We need to bring on more supply. This is a problem. 
   So, when you have a problem, you need to start really addressing credible solutions, not scapegoating, not trying to find blame. What do we need to do as a country? We've brought this to the floor numerous times. As for the Outer Continental Shelf, I think the public is now there. The national polls are clear. The Outer Continental Shelf is over 50 miles off the coast. You can't see it from the coastline. 
   What is more hazardous to our beaches and to our tourism are super tankers that are bringing crude oil from around the world, super tankers that are then having a wreck or are having a disaster where that crude oil is then washing to shore. The exploration off the east coast, off the west coast and off the eastern gulf of billions of barrels of oil that are trillions of cubic feet is not debatable anymore. It is accepted, in principle, by the American public. It was put off access by this Congress years ago. 
   This year, through the appropriations cycle, we can change this. We can say: Let's encourage our business and industry. Let's go into the Outer Continental Shelf. Let's explore for oil and gas, wind and solar. The great thing about the Republican policy is that we want everything, more of everything. We want wind. There's going to be a big wind generation facility built in my district, and I welcome it. We want solar. I want to encourage tax incentives for people to put solar cells on their homes. All of the above is a solution. 
   If you'll look to the far right, I have a bigger chart of fuel from coal. The Germans did it in World War II with the Fischer-Tropsch technology. We can do it today. In Illinois alone, there are 250 years of BTU ability, the same as Saudi Arabia's. Then there are renewable fuels. In December, this Congress passed an expansion in renewable fuels, hoping cellulosic comes on. Add  that to corn-based ethanol, to biodiesel and to soy diesel. All of the above is our solution and is American made. 
   The great thing about this: American jobs exploring the OCS, American jobs building the wind and the solar panels, American jobs mining the coal and refining the coal, American jobs in the farm fields across America. 
   In an era when we are concerned about jobs and the dollar, it makes sense to invest in America, in American energy sources and in American jobs.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, let's talk about being put over a barrel of oil. In 2001, a barrel cost $23. When this majority came in, it was at $58, and now it is over $136. The trend line is bad. 
   I don't understand why we want to limit our ability to explore all the available energy resources. Why not go after the leases we have. Why not open new leases. Why not go in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Here is the OCS, off-limits by our mandate. We did it. The Congress said we can't go on the west coast. The Congress said we can't go on the east coast, and the Congress said we can't go on the east gulf. That is foolish at today's prices. 
   Let's use America's natural resource of coal. In Illinois alone, we have as much Btu as Saudi Arabia has in oil. Let's encourage coal-to-liquid technologies. Let's use solar and wind, and all of the above energy sources, man-made energy resources with American energy and U.S. jobs.

<DOCNO>Mr. SHIMKUS. (REPUBLICAN ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank my colleague for the time, and I thank Mike Conaway for his great comments. And it is important that we are here tonight, and it is important that we continue to push this issue, especially as we are coming close to the time when we adjourn for what we call our district work period, which is for layman's term it is really the month of August, and it will go to the first week of September. We will be back in our district. Members will be traveling around the world on the congressional delegation tours and events. 
   But one of the main premises that we are trying to address this week is just stating the position that we should not leave. We should not adjourn and leave Washington until we have at least one vote on increasing supply. 
   We have been talking about bringing on supply as part, not the totalitarian solution, but as part of the solution, and we have been down here 3 months straight pretty much and continue to drive the message. And in the People's House, the House of Representatives, this is the body that you are supposed to hear the outcry of the citizens. You are supposed to hear the pain and the agony, as my colleague from Texas stated. And you are supposed to transform those cries for help from the citizenry to at least a debate on the floor and hopefully a vote to address these issues. 
   I too did a tele-town hall meeting last night, and an independent trucker called me up. And you know what he was saying. He is saying, I can't make it. I can't make ends meet. I used to be able to make a good income for my family and provide for them. But now with the doubling of the cost of diesel fuels, I don't know, we need help. And his response, and I think we have been helpful in moving the debate nationally, is we need to bring on more supply. 
   So I would like to just go back to the basics real quick, where we came from, where we are at and where we are headed. And because my debate has been over a period of months, I have softened the debate as far as the real partisan rancor and just talked about the facts. 
   So I go back to when President Bush got sworn in. The price of a barrel of crude oil was $23. Now, when I came in, elected in 1996, came in 1997/1998 we were worried that the price of a barrel of crude oil was so low that it was going to close the margin wells in Southern Illinois. It was down to about $10 a barrel. 
   So here we are at $23. The new majority comes in January 2006. The price of a barrel of crude oil is $58.31. And today, I think this is correct. If it is not, it is close. $123.67. 
   And then the basic of this chart is just to say, you know, the trend line is not good. It doesn't matter if you start in January 2001, it doesn't matter if you start back in January of 1997, January 2001, January 2006, or today, this trend line is not good, and it is not sustainable for the people that we ought to be standing up for on the floor of the House here, and that is the middle income, lower middle income individuals who are disproportionately hurt by high energy prices. 
   The poor, they are not going to go out to the new car dealer and buy the Toyota Prius. If they are lucky, they are going to scrape some money together, they are going to go to the used car lot, and they are going to get whatever they can afford to get them to work. That is what the poor are going to do. 
   And when we cause this increase in the price of a barrel of crude oil, which translates into an increase in gasoline costs, we hurt the people that we are trying to protect, which is the poor, the middle class, and in my aspect of my district, rural America. 
   Rural America is disproportionately harmed greater because in rural America you have to drive many miles to get to your schools. You have to drive many miles to get to your health care. You have to drive many miles to get to your job, and so that is the difficulty. 
   Now, here is the problem. Here are some solutions. And part of that solution is what my colleague from Texas said, Americans for American energy. American energy translates into American jobs. In a time of low economic development, wouldn't it be great to use our own resources to create American jobs using American energy? 
   So we have a couple of things here. Of course, parochial interests are always important. We have 250 years worth of recoverable coal in the United  States. We have as much Btu, British thermal units, of coal in the Illinois coal basin as Saudi Arabia has in oil. We use coal; 50 percent of all of our electricity is generated by coal in this country. But we can also use coal to turn it into liquid fuels. 
   Wouldn't it be great to have a competitor at the pump to gasoline, based upon crude oil, so that there is some competition between the liquid fuels competing for lower prices, better quality, better service? 
   And we do that by taking a coal field, American jobs, building a coal to liquid refinery, American jobs to build the refinery, American jobs to operate the refinery, a pipeline, American jobs to build the pipeline, to the airports of the world. You can take coal, you can turn it into jet fuel. 
   Why do we have four budget airlines have gone broke? Why is American Airlines charging $15 a bag? Why are our airline tickets going up? It is all because of the high price of fuel. And if we incentivize coal using fissure trope technology into jet fuel, we would not have the loss of these aviation jobs that we have today. And that is a trickle-down aspect, because when people are unemployed they are not going to the store. They are not going to go to the movie theater. As my colleague from Texas says, they are going to make decisions whether to go to vacation or send people to camp or just stay at home.

Our part of the debate is American energy, all-of-the-above. Part of that all-of-the-above is the great use of a great resource.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. And part of the debate is, you know, we are one of the few major--it doesn't have to be a major country. Most countries, when they see a great resource that they have available, they say, yahoo. We have a strategic advantage because we can create low cost power which will help our manufacturing base, which will help create jobs. 
   We see a national asset like coal and we say, we have an environmental disaster here. And there is no way we are going to use this. And that is the fallacy, not just in coal, but it really involves any of the fossil fuel arena, whether it is our OCS, or Outer Continental Shelf, whether it is the billions of barrel of oil, the trillions of cubic feet, it is the inability to look at that as a strategic national advantage and look at it like an environmental hazard, by the Democrat leadership, both here in this House and in the other body, that is stopping our ability to take advantage of the resources we have involved in this country. 
   And the country is now awakened, and they know that we have these resources, and they are really confused as to why we are not taking advantage of them.

   We get it. We are going to do it in an environmentally safe and sound way. But we want to bring other commodity products to help make our energy needs.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I will just be brief. And I thank you for the question. 
   And there was a time when you just grabbed the coal and threw it in and you burned the coal. Pretty dirty, pretty sooty emissions, and that goes back to the advance of the industrial age. 
   Then they developed crushing and pulverizing the coal and sweeping it up in oxygen to burn it a little more thoroughly. It still has, if you're a climate change person and carbon person, that still you have the carbon emissions. 
   Now, the carbon emissions are not toxic. It's not like nitrous oxide, it's not like SO  
   2. It's not like particulate matter. It's not an issue where people are going to point the finger and say, Oh, you're causing a disease by these emissions. Carbon, it's naturally occurring, but there are some people who have problems with that. 
   So the best way to address that is to go back to technology that was developed in World War II. It's Fischer-Tropsch. Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. It's almost like kind of a joke. It's Hans and Franz, Fischer and Tropsch, who developed the technology to take coal, synthetically, and gasify it or turn it into liquid fuel. And when you gasify it and you burn it, you burn it cleanly. And in that extreme, you can pull off the carbon in a more economic manner.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I have got a lot of other colleagues that want to talk. I will finish with my last poster here. 
   We've talked about the coal-to-liquid. But here is what the current debate here is on the floor. What about the Outer Continental Shelf? We have all of these available locations. We only explore off of 15 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf. That means 85 percent is off limits by a legislative fiat by us. 
   If we explore there and when we recover oil and gas, those companies pay royalties to us, and those royalties can go to solar and wind, they can go into renewable fuels. My colleague from Tennessee mentioned cellulosic and the debate on biofuels. 
   What we want is American-made energy creating American jobs, an all-of-the-above position, so that these energy events compete, and that's what I like about it. They compete for our attention based upon offering lower prices. When you have a one-fuel policy like we have today, you have no competition. You're held hostage to the imported barrel crude oil, and we need to break away from that. 
   I want to thank my colleague from Texas and make sure that my other colleagues have plenty of time.

   This bill, as written, does not use the 15-year accepted word of ``alternative.'' By leaving this out, the bill discriminates not only on coal-to-liquid technologies that produce low sulfur diesel and aviation fuel, but also natural gas and hydrogen. 
   This motion to recommit improves this bill and does not limit science, research and development to not only biofuels but coal-to-liquid, hydrogen and natural gas.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I'd like to thank my colleague from Georgia. And, you know, we're fortunate still, in today's high energy prices, to be able to use aviation. Aviation fuel is up. Budget airlines are broke, four of them so far. Baggage handlers are out of work. Ticket takers are out of work. 
   And part of the problem that America's facing is the high price of energy. And this is not a new debate that we've had since I've been here. And it's interesting how the votes have come down since 1994. And I think the public would really find them astonishing that on almost every production bill, production means producing something, almost every production bill, whether it's Outer Continental Shelf, whether it's oil shale, whether it's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, whether it's coal-to-liquid technologies, Republicans vote 90 percent of the time in support of production, and my friends on the other side, the Democrats vote 90 percent of time in opposition to production. 
   So since we've had this fight for many, many years, almost decades now, it was Jimmy Carter who set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas exploration. It was President Bill Clinton who vetoed the ability to explore the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 1995. Had he not done that, that oil would be here in our country today. 
   So now we find ourselves in a dilemma. It's Economics 101. It's supply and demand. Limited supply, increased demand, higher prices. 
   Here's the problem. January 2001, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $23, just 7 years ago. When the new majority came in in January of 2006, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58.31. This was not acceptable. I didn't like this. That's why we passed, in between this time, the 2005 Energy and Policy Act. And on this floor, that bill had the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in it. Of course it went to the Senate and it went there to die. And they pulled ANWR out. 
   Today the problem has grown by exponential amounts. Today the price of a barrel of crude oil is $136.39. So I'd like to keep this debate simple. This is a problem. So what is a solution? 
   And we're going to hear a lot, we've heard a lot of solutions from the other side. None of their solutions talk about bringing on more supply. 
   And we've had some great victories this week. FISA, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, funding of the troops, no restrictions, GI bill expansion, great victories that came about through bipartisan compromise on this floor, bills that will get signed by the President. And we're all pretty pleased with the work we did this week. 
   We can do that with this. There is a congressional majority that would vote for more supply. There's only one hang up. It's the Speaker of the House will not let these bills on the floor. 
   So you have done a great job, and I used my 1 minute, Congressman Westmoreland, to sign your petition. And I want to challenge and encourage all my colleagues, in a bipartisan manner, to come down and sign this petition, this pledge. And I hope the constituents from all over the country ask their congressmen have they signed this pledge. 
   The pledge is pretty simple. I will vote to increase U.S. oil production and lower gas prices for America. And there I am, right there, just signed it.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. It doesn't have to be. This is not a difficult process. 
   Now, since I signed the pledge, the question is how do we do this? 
   Well, we know how we do it. These red areas on this map is called the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS. You hear it talked about on this floor a lot. These areas, which is the West Coast, all the West Coast, all of the East Coast, and the eastern half of the Gulf of Mexico, are off limits, off limits. We can't research it, we can't investigate it, we definitely can't find and produce oil and gas. And we know there's billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, and we don't have access to it because of our policies in this, on this, in this building on an appropriation bill, not even an authorization bill. 
   And we're going to get a chance to get appropriation bills on the floor, and we're going to raise this issue when this bill comes to the floor, and we're going to challenge our friends on the other side to say, you know what? It's time. This is too much. We need to open up the OCS, the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   What's another solution? 
   Well, I live in the State of Illinois, and geologically, the State of Illinois is, if you go down far enough, it's a big, huge field of coal. It's called the Illinois Coal Basin. We have as much energy, BTU, British Thermal Units of energy as Saudi Arabia has of oil. 
   You hear my friends on the other side, they're worried about Iraq; they're worried about the Middle East; they're worried about our reliance on imported crude oil. You know, if we were in the OCS, if we were using our coal and turning it into liquid fuel, we wouldn't have to worry about the Middle East. 
   But since we are denied the opportunity to go into the Outer Continental Shelf, we have to have energy. It's their own policy that's forcing us to be involved in these international arenas. You know, I'd like to tell those folks, take a hike; we don't need you. And we have our own energy here.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. And people can follow this. You have a coal mine. Good, high-paying jobs. You build a coal-to-liquid refinery. It's not a crude oil refinery. 
   It's its own coal-to-liquid refinery. It was done in World War II by the Germans. It's known technology. U.S. jobs building the refinery, U.S. jobs operating the refinery. 
   Then you build a pipeline. U.S. jobs. And you ship it to airports and military installations. You know, for every dollar increase in the price of a barrel of crude oil it costs our United States Air Force $60 million because we are the largest consumer of jet fuel in the world? 
   And that goes directly to our taxpayers because we have to fund our war machines to protect this country and just to train. 
   So coal-to-liquid technologies is another way for me to support your call for pledges. 
   Well, we've got another option here. I love talking about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I already mentioned President Jimmy Carter. I already mentioned President Bill Clinton. 
   And I've got a little park in my hometown of Collinsville, Illinois called Woodland Park. Maybe it's not even a square mile. And I can understand if the folks in my hometown say, well, we don't want you drilling in that little park. I don't want people drilling in that little park either. 
   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the size of the State of South Carolina. The drilling platform would be the size of Dulles Airport. 
   Put it in perspective. Take a football field and put a postage stamp on that football field. That is what we're talking about as far as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and we know we have billions of barrels of oil there. That's not disputed. And it's just a matter of, if I'm going to support your pledge, I'm going to support more supply. 
   And again, you know, I know I've got a lot of good friends on the other side. I call them ``fossil fuel Democrats.'' They believe in it. They understand the importance of it for job creation and manufacturing and being competitive. And given the opportunity, we would have their vote. I mean, there's 10 percent of them at least I know. I bet there's about 40. Once we get that on the floor, any of these bills, I bet we can get about 40 Democrats' votes.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. And what I like about this debate is what we're talking about is we want American-made energy. And when you have American-made energy, you have American jobs. And when you have American jobs, you have American taxpayers. And when you have American taxpayers, they're funding the local schools, they're funding the local park districts, they're funding the local counties and the States. 
   When we say no to energy production in the United States, we're saying no to jobs. We're saying no to our tax base. We're saying no to our schools. In fact, when we say no to production, one of the biggest challenges many school districts are going to have is paying for the increase in diesel costs for the bus companies to pick up kids to go to school this fall because diesel prices have doubled. And that's true across the board, in any job, because everything, this building has an energy variable. And as energy prices go up, the costs to keep the lights on go higher. Taxpayers have to pay more. 
   And the only way that I get frustrated with this is because it doesn't have to be this way. It does not have to be this way. And I would challenge my friends on the environmental left, give us some standards. Give us some, tell us how clean is clean? We will meet those standards.     
   But it's a moving target. There's no certainty. No one wants to invest. In fact, there's some people who say we're done with false carbon fuel. We're done with coal. We're done with crude oil. We're going to go all wind, we're going to go all solar, and we're going to be able to meet our electricity demand. And those who follow the market and the electricity demands in this country know that that is impossible because most of these people say no to nuclear. 
   That's why when we started this debate about 18 months ago, ``no'' is not an energy policy. You can't say no and say you have an energy policy, and that is unfortunately what we have on the other side.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. And the lights in this building that we enjoy and the air conditioning in this building that we enjoy is produced from a coal-generating plant. Fifty percent of all electricity in this country is produced by coal. And it's not a dirty word. It is the lowest cost fuel. It provides the highest standard of living. And why do you think India and China are rapidly moving, China building a coal-fired power plant every 2 weeks? Because they want their country and their people to move into the middle class, and they're going to do it through the use of fossil fuels. And that's what has made our country great. And that's their target, and they're not going to be concerned about climate as we know they're not. 
   I want to thank my colleague for letting me join him in his special order. I have got to now use the great benefits of technology and travel and fossil fuel use and get on my plane and get back to the great State of Illinois.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I come in support of this legislation, and have come to learn that this nanotechnology has great opportunities to help us in the whole energy debate. I think nanotechnology can help in the solar powered cells. I understand that nanotechnology might be able to help taking light energy and turning it into hydrogen, which is important. It can be very important in addressing the long-lasting battery issue debate which will move us to plug-in hybrids sometime in the future, which we all realize is an important aspect of what we need to do to get to energy independence. And, green nanoenergy, which is important in this whole climate debate. 
   I also hope that nanotechnology can address some of the other pressing scientific needs: The issue of maybe reprocessing nuclear spent fuel. Maybe taking the carbon dioxide and splitting the carbon from the oxygen and addressing the climate change so we can use fossil fuels in a process that is going to be helpful. 
   But we are still in the Buck Rogers era. We need to move in that direction. The question is, what are we going to do now? The question is, at this time, in this debate, what are we really going to do to immediately affect the high cost of energy on our constituents? I have been on this floor quite a bit, as we all know, debating this. I have heard my colleagues on the other side, and I am softening my rhetoric out of respect for my friends and I have actually changed some of my charts to address issues raised in the debate. 
   So what is the primary problem that we have today? The problem we have is the escalation of crude oil prices in this country, from $23 when this administration came into the office, to $58 when the new majority came into the House, to $123 today. 
   Now I am not trying to be partisan, I am just trying to be factual. That is what has happened to the barrel of crude oil prices and what has happened to the cost of gasoline. Well, it has gone up similarly in this response. So the question is, how do we address this problem if we believe in economics 101 and supply and demand? 
   One way we could do it is opening the Outer Continental Shelf to oil and gas exploration. We have legislatively put off-limits through the appropriation process a prohibition, in some areas not to even do research to see if there is any natural gas or oil there, but we have said ``no'' to all these areas in red, that we are telling our public we do not want to look for oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf deep sea floor exploration 50 miles off the coast. We are saying ``no.'' 
   Our debate is pretty simple. At a time of high costs of a barrel of crude oil, $123.85 a barrel, how can we not? How can we not go and look for our own resources? What we want, what we are asking for is American-made energy, American-made energy to decrease our reliance on imported crude oil in places that are not stable, in the Middle East, in Venezuela, that are holding us captive. We know there are resources there. 
   Let me talk about another great opportunity that we have. In Illinois, the Illinois coal basin is basically the whole geography of the State of Illinois, and of course the chairman knows a lot and is very supportive of coal use in America. It also is Western Kentucky and the southwestern part of Indiana. We have as much coal in energy output as Saudi Arabia has oil just in the Illinois coal basin. So the question is, why aren't we using it to decrease our reliance on imported crude oil? Why aren't we using coal in turning it into liquid fuel? Look at the benefits we have of coal fields: American made energy. A coal field in America, American jobs mining that coal, American jobs to build the coal to liquid refinery.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I thank the gentleman. 
   American jobs to build the pipeline. American jobs to operate our aviation industry. In fact, this plane here is a fighter plane, because the United States Air Force is the number one purchaser of aviation fuel in the world.     
   For every dollar increase in a barrel of crude oil, you know what it costs our Air Force? $60 million. That's $60 million that doesn't go to training. That's $60 million that doesn't go to equipping. That's $60 million that doesn't help in meeting the budgetary demands. 
   Let me just finish on this point. Let's assume we access these and we have oil and gas. Or let's assume we're in ANWR and we're getting the oil and gas and we're getting the royalties. At today's prices, do you know how much money would come to the Federal Treasury at today's prices from ANWR? $192 billion. Do you think that would help the nanotechnology budget? I think it would help extremely. Move us from a decrease in our reliance on imported crude oil, American-made energy, new science and technology, green power; and that's kind of what this debate is all about.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Reclaiming my time. But all those issues that you addressed, if we had American-made energy, if we weren't relying on imported crude oil, you know, why does the cheap dollar affect our price? Because we're buying crude oil overseas. If we were producing our own crude oil in our country, the dollar wouldn't matter. 
   The speculators, you know the speculators. What are they betting? I love this debate. They are betting that we're going to do nothing. 
   You want to go after the speculators? Bring on more supply. They're betting that this barrel is going to go up, not go down.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I want to thank the chairman for the time. With a minute left, I may not be able to yield to you, David. I would be happy to most times. 
   This is the problem. $23 to $58 to $123. You only address that by bringing on more supply. We have oil and gas in the Outer Continental Shelf, and we need to be there. 
   I've got margin oil wells. I've got oil all over the State of Illinois. Do you know why we don't drill on every acre? Because you're not going to find oil on every acre. 
   Why are leases not put out? Because there may not be oil there. In fact, on the Outer Continental Shelf on the Atlantic coast we won't even inventory it. Last Congress we said no to inventory what we might have on the Eastern Seaboard. 
   All I want to do is bring down crude oil prices. The only way you do it is bringing on more supply. It's clear from the votes over the past 12 years, Republicans want to bring on more supply. Democrats, the vast majority of them, do not. All we're asking is that we have some that want to do that.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. I apologize to my friend from New Jersey because, if we are not talking about the number one issue in America on the floor of the House, then what are we here for? Science and technology is critical to decrease our reliance on imported crude oil. Science and technology will bring us to a new era where we don't have to rely on the energy supplies of the past. So I concur, and I support this resolution, and I'm glad people are debating it. 
   But you know what the people in America are debating. You know it. Everybody was home during the last 10 days. They're talking about this, and this is what we ought to be doing. You mentioned in your discussion that we don't have the funds. Well, if we went into ANWR, which is the size of the State of South Carolina and had a drilling path that formed the size of Dulles Airport or a football field and put a postage stamp on that, we've got the revenues. Just with the royalties from ANWR we could fund science and technology. In fact, we're going to have a resources bill on the floor that's going to address at least the pay-for, which was a method to address Mr. DeFazio's issue on leases.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Yes, you may. I'm just going to debate. 
   If we had the resources from the royalties on oil and gas exploration in the outer continental shelf or if we had the resources from the royalties from ANWR, we would have the money to be able to segue into a national debate on solar, on wind, on biotechnology, on the nanotechnology. There is a whole pot of money out there. A lot of people in America think that we have no fossil fuels, no energy resources left in this country. So this is the problem. I mean you kind of identified it, but when a barrel of crude oil is $23 in January 2001 and in January 2006 it goes up double and now it's up double again, that's the problem. 
   We have to have a long-term and a short-term strategy. Our debate is the science and technology. That's a long-term debate. But what do we do about easing the cost of the high food prices, which is in direct correlation to energy costs? We're talking about schools. What is the number one problem in schools today? Diesel prices for school buses has doubled. Energy costs for heating and cooling are doubling. That goes to the local taxpayer. So we ought to be talking about this.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, these are real e-mails from veterans, active duty members, and National Guard and Reservists: 
   ``John, my son, a Marine gunny sergeant embedded with the Iraqi Army around Rimadi, called a few weeks ago. I asked him if he knew about the President's plan for more troops. He hadn't heard about it, but his only comment to me was `We can use them.' Please support the President and the troops. It may be our last, best chance to win this thing. Winning is the imperative. Semper Fi.'' 
   And another: ``We have to let our generals be generals and wage this war as only they are trained to do and have hope that the announced troop buildup will be the final key that is needed by the Iraqis to build a secure, united country.''     
   We have to hope that it is not too late for the U.S. to make a difference in Iraq.'' 
   Another: ``We need to send the message to our troops that America wants them to succeed in Iraq by giving the buildup a chance to succeed.'' 
   Still another: ``My fellow Guardsmen are ready. We will do whatever is asked of us. Please ensure that the resources, funds and equipment continue to flow. Supporting the troops means giving us the means to do our job.'' 
   And another: ``We also need to stay in Iraq and put forth the necessary will and resources that will allow our strategy to succeed.''  
   And another: ``Moreover, our troops need more open rules of engagement to do their job effectively.'' 
   Another e-mail: ``Elections have consequences, and for our recent election the consequences have been a major setback in the war on terror and a greater threat to terrorist attack at home.'' 
   Still another: ``Like Vietnam, our enemies view us as not having the stomach to fight a protracted war. If we withdraw, however, the credibility of the U.S., our military, and our assurances would be lost for years, probably decades.'' 
   Another: ``The overwhelming response among officers is we must stay and finish what we have started. Many of these officers have built strong relationships with local Iraqi and Afghan citizens who want to raise their family in peace.'' 
   Another: ``We do in fact have many more Iraqi Army and National Police units moving into Baghdad and many are effectively partnering with U.S. units.'' 
   Another: ``They did pass their budget for 2007 last week,'' sooner than the U.S. Congress, incidentally, ``and have made some progress with other legislation, which indicates they can work some political compromises.'' 
   I will end with this: ``I would hope that your colleagues would be able to continue to support what we are doing, because it honestly does have a reasonable chance at success.'' 
   These are real communications with real soldiers, Active Duty, in Iraq, National Guardsmen, reservists, and veterans throughout our country who say there is no substitute for victory. We have to win this campaign. It is in our national security interest to support moderate Arab states.  
   John, my son, a Marine Gunny Sgt. imbedded with the Iraqi army around Rimadi, called a few weeks ago. I asked him if he knew about the President's plan for more troops. He hadn't heard about it, but his only comment to me was: ``We can use them!'' Please support the President and the Troops. Maybe our last, best chance to win this thing. Winning is the imperative. Semper Fi! 
   We have to let our generals be generals and wage this war as only they are trained to do, and have hope that the announced troop buildup will be the final 3 key that's needed by the Iraqis to build a secure and united country. 
   We have to have hope that it's not too late for the U.S. to make a difference in Iraq. 
   We need to send the message to our troops that America wants them to succeed in Iraq by giving the buildup a chance to succeed. 
   The main effort is really the political reconciliation and the security of the population is the key precondition to that. The language and some action from the Iraqi government and Army leaders have been good in the past several weeks. The next several months will be critical--probably decisive--and I believe there is reason to be realistically hopeful. 
   I believe that what we are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan supports the NSS. What I have heard in the debate is that we no longer have a security interest in Iraq. What part of out NSS is to support moderate Muslim governments? Another part of the NSS addresses humanitarian rights, to include rights of women. 
   My fellow Guardsmen are ready. We will do whatever is asked of us. Please, ensure that the resources, funds and equipment, continue to flow. Supporting the troops means giving us the means to do our jobs. 
   We have not had a failed Iraq policy--we have just had overly optimistic expectations of how fast the Iraqis would be able to establish a stable government and a unified country that functions in a manner to our satisfaction. 
   Ironically, we want the Iraqis to pursue a unity government and national reconciliation, but we don't do that ourselves. The partisanship that we are seeing here in the U.S. is no different that the partisanship that we are seeing in Iraq. 
   We also need to stay in Iraq and put forth the necessary will and resources that will allow our strategy to succeed. Imagine a Super Bowl football team quitting the game in the third quarter simply because they were behind. The premise is so absurd it is inconceivable so too would be our quitting a war to protect our way of life simply because battlefield conditions are not going perfectly. 
   Moreover, our troops need more open rules of engagement to do their job effectively. This is war, and they are soldiers, not police officers. The U.S. and Iraqi governments must expect civilian casualties and collateral damage. It's unavoidable. The irony in this matter is that most Iraqi people would welcome the increase security. 
   Elections have consequences. And for our recent election, the consequences have been a major set back in the war on terror and a greater threat to terrorist attack at home. 
   Like Vietnam, our enemies view us as not having the stomach to fight a protracted war. If we withdraw, however, the credibility of the U.S., our military, and our assurances would be lost for years, probably decades. 
   The Iraqis are watching all of this, and they can see which way the wind is blowing. They know if we leave either the Sunni insurgency or the Iranians 
   would likely come in, and their newly gained freedoms would be lost. This reality shapes the thoughts and actions of all Iraqi officials, from Prime Minister al-Maliki, down to the police officers on the street. 
   Many Americans are in denial about the threat from radical Islam. Unfortunately, it may take another 9/11 before they wake up. God help us if one of our cities gets nuked when that happens. 
   The overwhelming response among officers is that we must stay and finish what we started. Many of these officers have built strong relationships with local Iraqi and Afghan citizens who want to raise their families in peace. They feel we have given our word as a country that we will stand by them. I agree with this sentiment. 
   Lincoln/Sherman figured out that to truly defeat the south, he had to march to Savannah to convince the locals that it was not worth continued conflict. WWII had similar actions for resolution like Hiroshima. While these were waged against conventional forces, Congress must understand that the current conflict is more than between insurgents and U.S./Coalition forces. 
   If we do not have the will to do this hard work, we need to get out now. We cannot continue to try to get the job done with the minimum force. If anything we should send more than we think we need. Our focus on being liberators has caused us to misjudge what is needed. You cannot liberate until you have gained control. We never got there and must do so now. 
   Speaking of which, my two cents. The most basic job of government is to protect its citizens. If the Surge is properly designed to do that, then it is a good idea. I say give it a chance, even though it should have been that way to begin with. From my experiences in Desert Storm '91, I firmly believe that most people, Middles Easterners included, just want to protect their 
   family, practice their religion, and have an opportunity to prosper. 
   We have to be able to go after all the killers regardless of who or where they are. The Iraqi follow-on forces then have to maintain the peace, not bring in their individual hatreds to the power vacuum. Helping them secure their borders from fighters through Jordan and Syria and equipment from Iran is also critical (Navy and Air Force tasks with limited ground support?). Getting the ``Rule of Law'' established will eventually replace the need for ``Self Protection'' (Militias). 
   The biggest hurdle is at home. If the media continues its selective reporting (failures only), then even if its an unqualified success on the ground, it will be perceived as a loss at home due to its depiction on TV and Press reports. Tying Iraqis to a yardstick measuring success or failure seems to be a good idea. 
   Press the Senate not to pass the latest Resolution limiting support--it is just a grand standing event for presidential hopefuls. 
   We do in fact have many more Iraqi Army and National Police units moving 
   into Baghdad and many are effectively partnering with U.S. units. 
   They did pass their budget for 2007 last week (sooner than the U.S. Congress, incidentally) and have made some progress with other legislation, which indicates they can work some political compromises. 
   Everyone is forced to telescope political, economic, and security reforms that would normally take 7-10 years into 7-10 months. 
   So the question that you are debating is whether or not $100 billions (less than 0.8% GDP) and tragically, probably 700-900 U.S. soldiers' lives is worth a 50% chance of preventing a national security crisis that will set back U.S. policy for decades. 
   If you are the parent or spouse of one of those soldiers who may die, it is GD probably not worth it. But if you are a national leader, I would hope that your colleagues would be able to continue to support what we are doing because it honestly does have a reasonable chance of success.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague bringing up the issue of energy and the connection of energy to this bill because that is what we intend to do here today. 
   The irony behind this debate is that Americans really appreciate healthy beaches; but what they are really mad about is high gas prices. I have three kids, 15, 13 and 8. My wife is driving them all over the world to attend every event that kids do today, and the soccer moms of the world are outraged over the price of gas that they are paying. 
   And what has this Democrat majority been doing to continue to affect the price of gas, we just heard it, let's take more assets off the ability to explore. We just heard it from my colleague who just said no more exploration for oil. Where is the plan that the Speaker touted would lower gas prices? That was over 700 days ago. We want answers. We want this majority to do something about the high cost of gasoline. 
   We have truck drivers prepared to strike over the price of diesel, $4 a gallon gasoline is on the horizon, and this majority is doing nothing, nothing. 
   Here is the energy plan: When you have no energy plan, you plan to fail. When this majority took over, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58. What is it today, $110 per barrel. That translates into a gasoline price of originally $2.33 a gallon to now, $3.34, $3.50, $3.75, and $4. At $3.44, that is a $1.01 increase since this majority took over. Where is the energy plan to lower gasoline prices? The Speaker's plan means that you pay more in energy costs in this country. 
   The beaches that are affected in this legislation, Great Lakes, the coastal beaches, guess what, if I want to take advantage of these healthy beaches, I would have to drive about 285 miles to get to the Great Lakes. I would have to drive a lot farther, almost 745 miles to get to the gulf coast. Last year the cost to Chicago would be about $53. This year the cost is $76. We lose discretionary income when we allow gas prices to go up. 
   Another connection, to go to the great State of Florida to take my family on a vacation, that would have cost me last year $138 to drive. This year, $200 to drive. Do you think that is not going to affect the economy of the Florida coastal areas? Do you think that is going to halt our folks going to your State, my friend from Miami, to enjoy these great, healthy beaches. My folks can't afford to drive to these beaches to enjoy them anymore. 
   And what is the Democrat plan for gas prices? Silence. Nothing. The only plan is the plan to fail. The only plan is higher prices. Here it is: $58 a barrel when you came in, $110 a barrel today. 
   Let me give you some quotes. Speaker  Nancy Pelosi said on April 24, 2006, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices.''     
   Well, these skyrocketing prices aren't going down, folks. Speaker Pelosi's plan is to have skyrocketing price increases for gasoline, not decreases. We got it wrong. 
   It's this whole change mentality. Change is good. Change can be bad. The change in this majority has been bad for the cost of energy in this country. 
   And what are we doing? We're talking about healthy beaches. Healthy beaches. We ought to be talking about the price of gasoline. We ought to be talking about the price of diesel fuel. We ought to be talking about the price of electricity generation, nuclear power, clean coal technology. But no, healthy beaches. I hope my folks can enjoy and benefit by these healthy beaches.  
   It's been days since Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, ``Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices.'' Mr. Majority leader, what did you do? You raised prices. You didn't decrease prices. You raised prices. Everyone knows that prices have gone up. 
   Truckers are going to strike over record diesel prices. Diesel this week was at an average of more than $4 a gallon in Oregon and Washington, and nearly $4.12.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. In California, according to the American Trucking Association, if a trucker is filling up a 300-gallon semi, that bill could top $1,200. 
   We want to talk about competitive nature. We want manufacturing jobs in this country. Energy prices are killing our ability to compete in the world economy. It's killing our ability to get or product to the ports to ship them overseas to be competitive. It's killing our ability to manufacture the goods using innovation and technology, because that requires energy. 
   No energy plan is a plan to fail. Change is not always good. This is a change that the Democrat majority has brought us. $58.31, the price of a barrel of crude oil upon the assumption of the leadership here in this chamber. Current price today, $110.61. I have those on Velcro tabs so I can just keep following that price as it keeps going up. 
   Sometimes a barrel of crude oil is hard to follow. People don't know what it translates into. Well, I translated it earlier, from $2.33 a gallon, to, on average, $3.34 a gallon, and we know it's going to hit 4. We know it's going to hit 4. And when it hits 4, who are they going to call? They're going to call us. And what are we going to say? We're going to say, ``Oh, the Democrats promised a plan in 2006 to lower prices.'' They're in the majority now. Let's see their plan. 
   A failure to plan is a plan that fails. You have no plan. We're increasing our costs. The economy is hurting, and we bring healthy beaches to the floor. Healthy beaches. High energy costs. 
   And my colleague who just followed me talked about excluding exploration of energy. She tied this debate to energy. She understood the importance.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Democrats have voted, not once, not twice, but four times to raise energy taxes on the 110th Congress. 
   There's a debate in the State of Illinois to lower our gas tax. Why? So the average American citizen can afford to do the job. In rural America, when we have to drive long distances, this directly affects the pocketbook of every citizen in rural America. Every citizen. They're going to drive 20, 30, 40 miles just to go to work. 
   Talk about the inner cities and the traffic congestion, the people who are idling, they're going to end up paying more. 
   Four times the Democrats have said we're going to change the gas price debate here in America and we're going to lower prices. We know that that hasn't worked. Not only have they added insult to injury, they said not only aren't we paying enough in gas prices now, but we want to put more taxes on gasoline. Shoot, $3.50 is not enough. Let's get to 4. Let's pay $4.50 a gallon. Let's pay higher energy costs. 
   And what do we see? The periodicals and newspapers, the print media are starting to understand. In the Buffalo News, April 9: $4 Gasoline Seems Possible This Summer. 
   There used to be a time when Americans got outraged at $3 a gallon. Well, we've sensitized them to over $3 a gallon. They were promised by the Democrat majority they would lower gas prices. They've increased gas prices. Now we have to get prepared for $4 a gallon. 
   What's next? 
   No energy plan is a plan to fail. The Washington Times: Price at the Pump Likely to Reach $4. Fox News, Denver, Colorado: $4 Per Gallon Creeps Closer.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Friends, healthy beaches are important. We all want to benefit from them. I'd like to take my family to a beach. A lot of my constituents like to go there. But if they can't afford the gasoline in the minivan to get them to appreciate these healthy beaches, for what benefit? 
   The Democrats, when they were in the majority, promised us, I've got the quotes, they promised us lower gas prices, lower gas prices. I read the quotes. Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, I've got one from Jim Clyburn. Lower prices. 
   What do we have? Higher prices? And it's about time you started accepting responsibility and do something about these high prices.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I would understand my colleague would be upset about speaking. I would understand why you would be ashamed about talking about healthy beaches and not addressing the real concerns of America which is high energy costs. 
   I've been on the floor numerous times, motions to recommit over the past year and a half to talk about energy crises. One the big things I've talked about is coal to liquid technologies. 
   You know what? It was your colleague who stepped on the floor and talked about we don't want oil exploration off the coast. We don't want more crude oil supplies. 
   Well, I have a solution that would help keep our beaches healthy. Let's use coal to liquid technologies. Let's mine our vast abundant resource of coal right here. Let's build a coal to liquid refinery. In fact, Sasol, the South African energy company, just announced that the Brits are going to buy synthetic aviation fuel. 
   You know, we had all these aviation industry folks just go bankrupt, these low cost airlines that could get to these healthy beaches. You know one reason why they went bankrupt? The high cost of aviation fuel. Those are jobs gone. Those are the inability of me and my family on a low cost airline to appreciate these healthy beaches. 
   Well, I have a solution. They've been to the floor on motion to commit coal to liquid technology. Get our coal, refine it in to liquid fuels, put it in a pipeline and ship it to our commercial and military aviation. 
   I've been using this chart for a year and a half. Has this majority moved on decreasing our reliance on imported crude oil? Negligibly. Zip, zero. Maybe on the RFS. I voted for it. I appreciate that. 
   But doing anything to expand our ability to get our own resources, no, we're here talking about healthy beaches. We don't want to talk about crude oil exploration. We want to talk about pristine beaches. We don't want to talk about that we're paying $110 per barrel of crude oil when it was $58 when you all came into the majority. Translates to a dollar more in gas. It's going to reach 4.

   Mr. SHIMKUS. So we have some options. We can be here spending all day talking about healthy beaches while our businesses and industries fall further behind, fail to compete because of high energy costs. 
   I haven't even got involved in climate change. Climate change is going  to bring additional cost to your gas tank, to your electricity. In fact, the only one who's been intellectually honest about this is Chairman Dingell. What does he say? Fifty cents a gallon more to comply with climate change. 
   Now, if we want to do that, then let's vote on it. But you know what? You won't do it because it'll take that $4 a gallon a gas and move it up to $4.50. 
   Guess what? People are going to say, let's re-evaluate this. Let's understand if all the world nations are going to comply. Do we want all this pain, all that job dislocation, all these higher energy costs and no benefit? 
   If India and China do not comply, we get no benefit. All pain, no gain. All pain, job dislocation, higher energy costs, no gain. We ought to insist, before we go into any climate change agreement, that India and China sign on the dotted line verifiable that we know they're going to comply. 
   You know what? I've talked to them. They're not going to do it. They are not going to do it. 
   So why assume these costs? Why burden the American consumer? Why deplete our hotel and tourism industry by people not being able to get there, either through airlines who have failed or the ability to drive the long distances to get there. 
   This majority has had no plan to address. Well, they have. They've promised, lower gas prices, 2006. This Democrat majority promised lower gas prices, lower gas prices. What do we have? Higher gas prices. And no plan to mitigate. 
   You know how you mitigate it? You bring on more supply. And you all won't do that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I come in support of the legislation. I served, as many people know, in the United States Army for 5 years actively, 23 in the Reserves, a West Point graduate, great respect for George Washington, who established the fortifications there at West Point, the longest active military installation in the country. Of course, this constitutional Republic owes a great debt of gratitude to the French, and it is unfortunate we have to use discussions on this to come to the floor and exercise our rights of freedom and speech to talk about a new Declaration of Independence. So with respect to the chairman, I hope he will indulge me. 
   When we talk about the day-to-day and we talk about around the Fourth of July, America knows that we are held captive to imported crude oil as energy and that we have to break away to become energy independent and free. There are a lot of ways that we can do that, and I believe there is a huge consensus in this Congress today. Unfortunately, that consensus is not being allowed to be brought to the floor, and that is why we have to use legislation like this to exercise our ability for free speech to talk about pressing concerns. 
   We all know the problem, and I have tried to change my debate and discussion away from the basic partisan aspects to just the realities. And the reality is when President Bush became president, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $23. I highlight it here. I don't shy away from that fact. When the Democrat majority came in, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58. Yesterday, I haven't checked the spot price today, but yesterday's price was $140. And all I have said on this floor now for about 12 weeks is that this trendline is bad, this trendline for our economy, for our middle class, for our lower middle class, for rural America, is not sustainable, and that we have to address this. And we can. We can address it in a bipartisan manner on this floor. There are a lot of things we can do. 
   We have tried on this floor numerous times to bring alternative fuel standards, the debate of using American coal, the largest recoverable resource we have. We have the largest recoverable resource of coal as any country in the world in coal. People don't understand that, but we do. The Germans developed technology in World War II to  take coal and turn it into liquid fuel. Wouldn't that be helpful today in the high energy prices, to be able to take something that we have a lot of and turn it into liquid fuel to help us become more independent from the importation of crude oil, especially from dangerous places around the world, places that really don't like us and we really would like to not have to be there. 
   So when we talk about becoming energy independent, we would like to say we are always going to need some, so we have got North American allies, the Canadians, a great source of imported fossil fuels, Mexico, a great supporter of fossil fuels. Using that, using our own coal reserves and our other resources, we could become independent from imported crude oil from other places. 
   We are independent on energy for electricity. We produce in our country the electricity we need. So we can be independent. We are not independent on the energy we need in liquid fuel. 
   One way we do this is with our great coal reserves. I am from Illinois, 250 years worth of recoverable coal. You go to a coal mine, you build a coal mine, American jobs. You operate the coal mine, American jobs. You build a coal-to-liquid refinery, American jobs. You operate that refinery, American jobs. You actually have a tax base developed for our local schools. 
   You build a pipeline from these refineries to maybe the local airport. Four budget airlines are bankrupt. That means baggage handlers, ticket takers, pilots, planes sitting idle because they can no longer compete with the high aviation fuel. Well, you can make aviation fuel from coal-to-liquid technology, 
   The United States Air Force is the number one aviation fuel user in the world. Every time this barrel of crude oil goes up $1, it costs us, the taxpayers, $60 million just to pay the aviation jet fuel bill. They are asking us to do this. If we want to become energy independent, as we are speaking about the independence of our country, being free from foreign oppression, being free from foreign influence, we have to become energy independent. 
   Another way to do this is the Outer Continental Shelf. Great resources, billions of barrels of crude oil, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas, just waiting to be explored and recovered. These areas here in red are off limits by a dictate imposed by Federal legislators 25, 30 years ago, in a spending bill. We said in a spending bill you can't go off the east coast. You can't go in the eastern Gulf. You can't go on the west coast. It is off limits. So a way that we could become more independent, energy independent, would be to use our vast coal resources and to open up the Outer Continental Shelf. I have another chart here I forgot to bring that talks about wind and solar. 
   But the great thing about the Outer Continental Shelf is this: When we allow industry to look for, find and recover this, it is my understanding they have to pay us for that, and how they pay us is in royalties. So if we are going to use money for solar and wind and renewable energy, what a great place to get the pay-for. 
   I got a lot of Blue Dogs, they have been fighting the battle on pay-fors. What a great pay-for, to become energy independent by using the available oil and gas reserves, bringing more supply to the market, lowering the price. 
   It is all gain. There is no disadvantage to using our coal resources and creating jobs. There is no disadvantage to opening up the oil and gas reserves off the Outer Continental Shelf. And really there is no disadvantage into going into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an area the size of the State of South Carolina, a drilling platform the size of Dulles Airport. To put it in perspective, take a football field and put a postage stamp on there. 
   When you hear people talk about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, it is not like Woodland Park in my hometown of Collinsville, Illinois. That might be a little bit disruptive if you are drilling. It is not disruptive in an area the size of the State of South Carolina. 
   So the frustration for me as a member of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee and the Energy and Commerce Committee is we can't even have this debate in the committee. If we could have this debate in the committee, if we could move a bill and get it to the floor, we could use that time to debate energy. But, unfortunately, we have to use this time on a historic trail that helps us remember where we come from, helps us remember our national heritage. 
   We have obviously the portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette right here in the Chamber. Remember when we have had trouble with our French friends, they were here when we needed them and were instrumental to this Republic, and we need to thank them. Anything we can do as a history teacher to remember history and strengthen it for future generations, I am for. 
   I just hope what we want to do in the history, I hope we are willing to do the same thing for future generations for energy independence. And I challenge my friends to bring on the environmental restrictions. We can meet them. But we have to have a whole portfolio. I am willing to join you, if you all let me. 
   With that, I would like to thank the ranking member for the time.
