<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (EXPAND OUR NATION'S EXPORT MARKETS -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of expanding our Nation's export markets. Last week Congress was challenged to implement the proposed free trade agreement with Peru. It is a challenge we need to meet. 
   The agreement laid on the table will create significant new opportunities for American farmers, ranchers, businesses and consumers by opening new markets and reducing trade barriers. 
   Nebraska's agriculture producers, manufacturers and service providers deserve more access to foreign markets. Last month I hosted a forum on the importance of exports for Nebraska and the United States. 
   Trade supports nearly one in five jobs in Nebraska, and Nebraska exported $2.8 billion worth of agriculture products in 2005. 
   Opening new export markets has long been a priority of mine. It goes without saying that agriculture markets are tremendously important to my district and the Nation as a whole, and I hope to help Nebraska's products continue to compete in the global marketplace.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise also with a heavy heart to express my condolences to the families of the victims that were tragically gunned down yesterday in Omaha. It is amazing, as Mr. Fortenberry pointed out, how cruel the world can be, and I only hope that we will come together and look at the root causes of these sources of violence, as we look at the violence that affects basically a rural area of our country, the Heartland, as many would call it, that none of us can escape some of this violence. 
   As we pull together, I know that perhaps we can learn from what happened yesterday. But, again, I want to especially express the condolences that I feel for these many victims who actually have roots across Nebraska. 
   With that, I yield my time to Mr. King of Iowa.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (OFFSHORE EXPLORATION VERSUS LEASES -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I'm glad that President Bush turned up the heat on Congress when he lifted an executive order barring offshore energy exploration off almost 90 percent of U.S. coastlines. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have to say that raising the decibel level of the debate in this Chamber does not solve the problem. A good, comprehensive, broad-based energy supply is what solves the problem. Instead of acting to help consumers with high gas prices, Congress still has not taken up legislation which will actually help fight rising gas prices even as the price at the pump rockets past $4.11 a gallon. Instead, we hear the other side of the aisle about use-it-or-lose-it current policy, that oil companies are sitting on 68 million acres, or maybe even more, of land which could be used for energy exploration. 
   We need to ask ourselves the question then, Why would anyone in the private sector want to engage in even greater expenses then in acquiring more petroleum resources for the American people? 
   But even a Democratic colleague of mine said, ``You can't produce on every acre or even every 100 acres. I think those numbers come from people who don't understand the business.'' 
   We can do better; we should do better, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The feedback I get from individual workers in my district, they believe that stronger laws are needed to protect the secret ballot election process in the workplace. H.R. 800 would strip away this right from workers, and this is simply unfair. 
   Removing secret ballot elections is unfair to individual workers because it opens them up to retaliation. By having to publicly express support for or against any measure, this legislation would leave workers vulnerable to coercion and intimidation, and I cannot in good conscience support it.  
   Secret ballots actually enhance collective bargaining. Because I believe a worker's right to a secret ballot should be protected, I am cosponsoring the Secret Ballot Protection Act. This legislation would guarantee individual workers the right to secret ballot elections and ensure them the right to freely choose whether or not to join a union. 
   I urge my colleagues to stand up for individual worker's rights, to protect the secret ballot, and to vote against H.R. 800.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (REPUBLICAN TAX CUTS REDUCE THE TAX BURDEN ON AMERICANS -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express some thoughts and concerns about taxation. Certainly, as taxes are due today, I know that post offices around the country are well staffed, up to midnight. It is interesting as I have paid my taxes in the past, kind of pushing it up to the last minute, to see everyone else who pushes up the payment of their taxes to the last minute. But the fact is, it does take place. 
   But I rise today to very briefly reflect on what today means. Certainly I realize that paying taxes is a necessary function of a civilization, but I also rise to express my concern that some tax policies that have been working over the past few years are in jeopardy. The tax relief packages offered by President Bush and certainly those in the House and Senate who supported tax relief have done good things, in fact, great things, in terms of revenues to the Federal Government, but I would say so in terms of revenues to the household budget even more importantly. 
   We in Congress cannot utilize what we call ``dynamic scoring,'' the reflection of what lower taxes can do in terms of tax revenue. I understand that. I think it is unfortunate. Be that as it may, we are faced with some tough decisions, decisions impacting the budget long term, and I wish to speak of my concern for the long term. 
   I have learned over the years that government spending compounds once a new program is started. We have to be very mindful of that. We have to be mindful that as we look down the road, we have to come up with ways to cover the expenses of new programs. That is why I believe we should be careful when we talk about adopting new programs. 
   When it comes to the tax burden in general, certainly April 15th, and now the 16th, speaks volumes not only in the 3 1/2 months it takes to prepare taxes owed from the prior year, but we often hear about ``tax freedom day.'' Preliminary research tells us most recently this year's tax freedom day is actually April 30. It takes a full 4 months, on average, for Americans to earn enough money in their household to pay their Federal income tax. 
   Now, throw on top of the Federal income tax State income tax, and in a State like my State of Nebraska, property tax, it is a heavy burden in Nebraska, and sales tax, plus the other  fees and taxes associated; and I just think it is important that we reflect on this. 
   We heard earlier about financial literacy. Yes, we have an issue with credit card debt, for example. But I think that it would serve us well to make sure that for consumers and citizens of all kinds, that we teach them about the tax burden, tax freedom day, and not just paying taxes by April 15th or 16th, but more so what it might mean to take some of those dollars paid in taxes and perhaps invest those.     
   And it is interesting, as we look at our economy in general, what available capital means to a business, to an individual. 
   I am inspired to hear of individuals who wish to start a business but for the available capital. When we look at what available capital can do in a house, whether it is a project around the house or whether it's a small business incubating, I think that we should look at various ways we can avail capital to our citizens, primarily through tax relief. 
   It is absolutely vital that we always keep this in mind, especially as we constantly need to look at growing our economy. And that it is not just coincidence, as some might suggest, that tax relief actually led to job creation and increased revenues to the Federal Government. I don't believe that that's just coincidence. I believe that that is through fashioning good tax policy and allowing individuals, individual taxpayers, to keep more of what they earn because when they spend those dollars, they spend them more wisely, and those dollars are leveraged into actually greater Federal revenue so that we can provide for those who cannot provide for themselves.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTERNATIONAL GEOPHYSICAL YEAR -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 76, honoring the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year. In 1882-1883, the first International Polar Year counted 12 participating countries, with 13 expeditions to the Arctic and two expeditions to the Antarctic to study the geophysical attributes of the polar regions. 
   In order to expand research opportunities beyond the polar regions, in 1957 and 1958, organizers changed the name of the third International Polar Year to the International Geophysical Year. Beginning in March of 2007 and running through March of 2009, the fourth International Polar Year celebrates the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year. 
   In the United States, not only NASA, which is highlighted in this resolution, but the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Energy are all actively participating in the fourth International Polar Year and the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year. 
   The International Geophysical Year brought about the launching of the first artificial satellites and successful scientific collaborations that continue today. The current International Polar Year and 50th anniversary celebration of the International Geophysical Year seek to encourage and challenge the young men and women in scientific and engineering careers to bring about fundamental advancements in many areas of science and technology. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 76.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 252, which honors the 45th anniversary of John Herschel Glenn, Jr.'s historic mission as the first American to orbit the Earth aboard the Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7. This was truly a landmark event in our human space flight program. These early successes captured the minds and imaginations of people around the world and were an inspiration to all Americans at a time when we were the underdog in a technological race with the Soviet Union. 
   Prior to his service with NASA, John Glenn had already received numerous honors for his military service during World War II and the Korean War. He set a transcontinental speed record in 1957 by completing the first flight between Los Angeles and New York at an average speed greater than the speed of sound. 
   John Glenn was selected as one of the original Mercury 7 NASA astronauts in 1959 and logged over 218 hours in space. After retiring from the space program, John Glenn continued to serve his country as a distinguished Member of the United States Senate for 24 years. In 1998, John Glenn returned to space after 36 years as a member of the crew of the Space Shuttle Discovery, serving as a subject for basic research into the effects of weightlessness on the body of an older person. 
   John Glenn is truly an American hero. I am proud to support this resolution honoring such a prominent American citizen, military veteran and astronaut. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 252.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise to add my whole-hearted thanks and admiration for the skill  and effort shown by the five individuals we are honoring here today. Since 1901, the Nobel Prize has recognized the world's finest minds in the fields of physics, chemistry, physiology and medicine, literature and peace. In 2006, five American scientists were chosen for this prestigious award. These five men join 763 previous men and women and 19 organizations recognized at the pinnacle of their fields. 
   Roger Kornberg received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his studies on transcription, a fundamental cellular process that uses information encoded in genes to produce proteins. Dr. Kornberg's award comes 47 years after his father, Arthur Kornberg, received the 1959 Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine. In 2006 that prize was awarded to Andrew Fire and Craig Mello for their influential work on RNA interference, a process that uses RNA to control the production of proteins. 
   John Mather and George Smoot share the Nobel Prize in physics for their pioneering work in cosmology, discovering fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background that help explain the formation of galaxies, stars, and the Earth itself. 
   Drs. Roger Kornberg, Andrew Fire, Craig Mello, John Mather, and George Smoot deserve our thanks and sincere appreciation for their efforts supporting the greatest innovation economy in the world. Without men and women like them committed to the often arduous task of scientific discovery, we would not enjoy the economic prosperity that has graced our Nation. 
   This resolution signals this body's commitment to supporting and strengthening the scientific enterprise. While this resolution, unfortunately, does not match the $10 million prize awarded to these Nobel Laureates, we can do better by ensuring that we support funding for the science and technology efforts of the Federal Government. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 316.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, it is my hope that we can come together and agree on an Iraq emergency supplemental that provides the resources our troops need without tying the hands of our generals and forcing them to adhere to unrealistic timetables. 
   Last week in a Chicago Tribune editorial, they stated: ``President Bush will veto the war spending bill approved by Congress this week because it contains a timetable for withdrawing U.S. combat troops from Iraq. He is right to do so.'' 
   With a new commanding general on the ground and the surge strategy still ramping up, our troops deserve this chance to make progress, and we are starting to see signs in Iraq that things are modestly improving. 
   I urge my colleagues to support a clean supplemental and to encourage patience as we heard 4 years ago before we even went to Iraq that this would be a long time coming, that our ultimate goal in accomplishing victory in Iraq would take some time. We need to listen to those comments, and, again, I urge patience.

   The Turing Award, established in 1966, is given annually by the Association for Computing Machinery to individuals whose work has been of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field. Fran Allen is richly deserving of this honor. She is also the first woman to receive the award.  
   Fran Allen exemplifies the dedication and innovative spirit that has brought this country to the forefront of science, technology and commerce. As a researcher for IBM for nearly 45 years, she played a key role in building the high-performance computing world we live in today. 
   Her work on optimization of parallel processing has impacted all of our lives, for example, by setting the stage for today's computer systems that forecast our weather and analyze DNA sequences. 
   I would like to particularly commend Ms. Allen for her dedication to supporting and mentoring young men and women in her field. I note that after her retirement from IBM, she kept an office and has continued her work mentoring future leaders in computer sciences and, hopefully, future A.M. Turing Award winners as well. 
   As this Congress looks to improve our Nation's competitiveness and looks to provide for the next generation of scientists, engineers and business men and women, we should consider the great example that Fran Allen has given to us.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (CELEBRATING NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our Nation's agricultural producers. U.S. agriculture is innovative, adaptive and certainly responsive. I am here today to celebrate National Ag Week which ends tomorrow, as well as celebrate National Ag Day, which we celebrated on Wednesday. 
   It goes without saying that agriculture is tremendously important to my district and the Nation as a whole. I hope you join me in celebrating everyone who works so hard to provide nutrition for the world. 
   I represent one of the largest agriculture districts in the country. My district ranks first in the value of sales of grains and oil seeds, second in total value of agricultural products sold, and first in cattle and calf inventory. According to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture, my State ranks first in the Nation in commercial red meat production as well. 
   In 2005, agriculture industry cash receipts contributed more than $11 billion to Nebraska's economy. Over 20 percent of all Nebraskans are employed in farm or farm-related jobs. Every dollar in agriculture exports generates $1.48 in additional economic activity such as transportation, financing, warehousing and production. Cash receipts from farm marketings contributed more than $11 billion to Nebraska's economy in 2005. 
   As impressive as those facts are, I do want to make sure that the rural way of life is enhanced and certainly encouraged to grow. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I look forward to helping draft the reauthorization of the next farm bill before it expires in September. My goal is to create a workable, comprehensive package which will strengthen American agriculture and provide long-term stability for our Nation's producers. Any attempt to make major reforms of the current farm program must be in the long-term interests of American agriculture. We know that we need good, sustainable policy. Taxpayers appreciate that, markets appreciate that, and we can achieve that with a good, hearty discussion. We must also aggressively pursue new markets and break down barriers to trade with other countries. 
   In doing so, we must remain mindful of other aspects of rural life, and that is, the shrinking communities throughout Nebraska and other rural areas. I serve as a member of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Rural Development, as well as the House Rural Caucus, and I know we must do all we can to strengthen and protect our rural communities, the backbone of our values and way of life. I look forward to helping create strong, sustainable world economies and responsible tax policies to encourage economic development for these areas. 
   As a member of the House Science and Technology Committee, I am also putting a priority on expanding modern technology in our district to support new and existing businesses, attract new employers and make our rural communities more competitive in the modern economy. 
   So what are we really celebrating this week? National Ag Day is a day to recognize and celebrate the abundance provided by agriculture and our Nation's agriculture industry. Every year, producers, agriculture associations, corporations, universities, government agencies and countless others across America join together to recognize the contributions of agriculture during this week. 
   This year, National Ag Day was celebrated on March 21, 2007, the first day of spring, and National Ag Week of course runs through the rest of the week. Ag Day was first celebrated in 1973, and this is the 34th year of celebrating Ag Day on the first day of spring. I am proud to have this opportunity to make these remarks to take part in this celebration. 
   The Agriculture Council of America hosts the campaign on a national level; however, awareness efforts in communities across America are as influential, if not more, than the broad scale effort. If you are interested, I recommend checking out www.agday.org, once again www.agday.org. The Web site has a tremendous amount of information, and I thank the ACA for letting me use their information here today. 
   Ag Day is about recognizing and certainly celebrating the contribution of agriculture in our everyday lives. The National Ag Day program encourages every American to understand how food and fiber products are produced, to value the essential role of agriculture in maintaining a strong economy, appreciate the role that agriculture plays in providing safe, abundant and affordable products. 
   Why do we celebrate agriculture? Certainly, agriculture provides almost everything we eat, use and wear on a daily basis, but too few people truly understand this contribution and certainly may not 
   appreciate it as we should. 
   This is particularly the case in our schools where students may only be exposed to agriculture if they enroll in the very specific and related vocational training. By building awareness, the Agriculture Council of America is encouraging young people to consider career opportunities in agriculture. 
   Each American farmer feeds nearly 130 people, a dramatic increase from 25 people in the 1960s. Let me repeat that: each American farmer feeds nearly 130 people and certainly a dramatic increase from the 25 people that each American farmer fed in the 1960s. Quite simply, American agriculture is doing more and doing it better; and as the world population soars, there is an even greater demand for the food and fiber produced in the United States. 
   From a team of horses in the early 1900s to tractors with the power of 40 to 300 horses today, American farmers provide consumers with more and certainly better quality food than ever before. In fact, one farmer now supplies food, as I mentioned earlier, for about 129 people very specifically in the U.S. and abroad, compared to just 25.8 people in 1960.  
   The efficiency of the American farmer pays off in the price American consumers pay for food as well. The United States consumers spend roughly 9 percent of their income on food, compared with 11 percent in the United Kingdom, 17 percent in Japan, 27 percent in South Africa, and 53 percent in India. That is a pretty good deal. 
   This great value is due in large part to improved equipment efficiency, enhanced crop and livestock genetics through biotechnology and conventional breeding, and advances in information management. 
   All Americans are asked to enjoy and admire the wonders of American agriculture as National Agriculture Day is celebrated on the first day of spring as it was this last week. 
   Today's farmers work nearly 3 1/2 times more land than their predecessors from the 1900s. Their needs are different, the crops are different, and the rules governing production practices are different. Most American farms are still family farms. Today, almost 99 percent of all U.S. farms are owned by individuals, family partnerships, or family corporations. Less than 1 percent of America's farms and ranches are owned by non-family corporations according to the Census of Agriculture. 
   Biotechnology certainly increases capacity and product quality. It is another factor in efficiency of American farmers in their ability to provide more and certainly higher quality food and livestock. Biotechnology provides benefits similar to traditional plant and livestock breeding but does so in a more controlled environment and with faster results. 
   Advancements made in plant biotechnology provide consumers with better quality products in many areas, and those benefits are just beginning. 
   There are many products in the biotechnology research pipeline that will provide better livestock feeding, resulting in leaner meat for consumers. Many of these same products will lessen the environmental impact of livestock production by reducing waste and/or the chemicals found in animal waste. 
   Pharmaceutical companies are actively working with farmers to develop crops that can go directly from the field to pharmaceutical production, eliminating some of the processing steps that occur in today's operations. This research will significantly reduce the costs required to produce many life-saving drugs. 
   Research and technology advancements have also resulted in new uses for commodity crops like corn, soybeans and various grains. Use of products like ethanol and soy diesel will reduce American dependence on fossil fuels and improve air quality throughout the United States and the world. Ethanol is the largest industrial use of these commodity crops, but soy diesel and other uses are emerging every year. 
   When it comes to ethanol, America's farmers do not just produce fuel for our bodies. Crops such as corn and soybeans are used to produce fuel for our vehicles. Renewable fuels contribute to a cleaner environment, reduce pollution and reliance on foreign oil and contribute to the stability of the world farm economy by creating commercial markets for crops. 
   With the record production of 2.81 billion gallons of ethanol in 2003, 1 billion bushels of corn and 12 percent of the grain soybean crop were used to produce fuel for our vehicles. In 2003, 73 ethanol plants were in operation in the United States, several in my district and in Nebraska. In fact, according to the USDA, one in every 10 rows of corn went into ethanol production in 2003. In both his 2006 and 2007 State of the Union addresses, President George Bush called for making renewable energy sources a national priority.     
   His recent call for 35 billion gallons of renewable fuels, including ethanol and biodiesel, has led to crop producers and customers alike asking how we will meet the challenge without disrupting traditional markets. 
   The demand for corn, for ethanol production grew rapidly in 2006, and it will grow rapidly again this year. That has caused concern among corn and other end users, including the livestock industry and importers, like Japan. There is no question that a big transition is taking place. As producers will have to react more quickly to the market, so will our customers, the livestock industry, importers and ethanol industry. 
   There are new markets for ethanol 85, or E85, as we call it. Ethanol today is largely a blend component with gasoline. E85 is a mix of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. The ethanol blend adds octane and displaces toxics, which helps refiners meet Clean Air Act specifications. There are about 600 E85 refueling stations across the country. New market opportunities include E85 and ethanol fuel cells. Today there are millions of flexible fuel vehicles capable of using E85, but they make up less than 3 percent of the total U.S. motor vehicle fleet. 
   A valuable coproduct of ethanol is dried distillers grain solubles, a high-protein feedstock. A bushel of corn used in the dry-grind ethanol process yields 2.8 gallons of ethanol, 17 pounds of carbon dioxide and 16 pounds of distillers grains. Wet grains go to dairy and cattle rations; dry goes to hog and poultry, or when it is shipped. A majority of DDGs is fed to beef and dairy; however, swine and poultry consumption is increasing, although a very small percentage can be used now as the feed industry gains a better understanding of how best to utilize that product in those rations. 
   According to commodity specialist companies, dairy accounted for 45 percent of 2005 distillers grains consumption in North America, while beef accounted for 37 percent. Swine accounted for 13 percent of the North American distillers grains use, while poultry made up 5 percent. 
   In the 2005-2006 marketing year, 8.35 million metric tons of distillers grains were produced. In 2006 and 2007, more than 10.8 million metric tons will be produced. By 2011 and 2012, the industry is expected to produce more than 20 million metric tons. 
   The supply of distillers grains has a displacement on the corn feed market. In 2005 and 2006, distillers grains displaced an estimated 3.89 million bushels of corn from feed markets, making that corn available for other uses. 
   Ethanol and biodiesel are just the beginning. Research continues to find new uses for agriculture commodities and waste. For example, livestock manure is being used to create electricity. Commodities such as soybean and canola are being developed as lubricants to replace petroleum-based products. Corn starch is replacing petroleum-based plastics. It's exciting to see these advancements. 
   American agriculture can also be celebrated for its effort in environmental conservation. Farmers and ranchers provide food and habitat for approximately 75 percent of this Nation's wildlife. The current farm bill has provisions for farmers to create environmental habitats that will ensure protection of the land and water resources of this country. 
   Farmers use computer and satellite technology to map the fields for production inputs. This increases yields and reduces crop inputs like fertilizer and crop-protection chemicals. With today's technology, farmers are better able to match seed production characteristics and production practices to soil type and climate conditions. The result is higher yields with lower input costs for more efficient use of chemicals, fertilizers and tillage. Ultimately, that results in more food at a lower cost for consumers. 
   Today's farmers understand the importance of improving the quality and quantity of food available to the world. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, it is estimated that there will be 7.5 billion people in the world by the year 2020. We currently are at 6.2 billion. It's agriculture's job to find a way to feed those people. 
   Advancements in crop technology, equipment technology and information management will make that possible. American farmers and others involved in the agriculture industry have met and will continue to meet this challenge again and again. World population growth is creating needs for food and fiber, obviously. World population is at 6.2 billion today, and expected again to reach 7.5 billion by the year 2020. There will be millions of new mouths to feed, many of whom rely on the United States' food production to meet this need.  
   The United States is best positioned to meet this growing need, as agriculture is America's number one export. Again, agriculture is America's number one export. About 17 percent of raw U.S. agriculture products are exported yearly. 
   U.S. farmers and ranchers produce more than 200 raw commodities yearly for domestic and export markets. One-fourth of the world's beef and nearly one-fifth of the world's grain, milk and eggs are produced in the U.S. 
   Through research and changes in production practices, today's food producers are providing Americans with the widest variety of foods ever. Research and advancements in biotechnology are now in the marketplace with tastier fruits and vegetables that stay fresh longer and are not damaged by insects. Consumers derive health benefits from changes in farm production, including less fat in meat, longer-lasting fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as tofu, a soybean product which has been shown to reduce the risk of some cancer and heart disease. 
   Certainly technology leads the way in today's agriculture protection. Precision farming boosts crop yields and reduces waste by using satellite maps and computers to match seed, fertilizer and crop-protection applications to local soil conditions. Sophisticated global positioning systems, as we call GPS, can be specifically designed for spraying herbicides and pesticides. A weed detector equipped with infrared light identifies specific plants by the different rays of light they reflect and then sends a signal to a pump to spray a preset amount of herbicide onto the weed. 
   Biogenetics is another technology that is being utilized in crop production. A particular trait is implanted directly into the seed to protect the seed against certain pests. Artificial insemination of livestock is producing more and certainly better meat supplies. 
   Farmers are utilizing four-wheel-drive tractors with up to 300 horsepower, requiring fewer passes across fields, saving energy and time. Huge combines are speeding the time it takes to harvest crops. That leads to more efficient use of energy. 
   With modern methods, 1 acre of land in the U.S. about the size of a football field can produce 42,000 pounds of strawberries, 11,000 heads of lettuce, 25,400 pounds of potatoes, 8,900 pounds of sweet corn, or 640 pounds of cotton lint. America is producing not only more food, but certainly higher quality and lower costs. 
   Two out of every three bushels of corn in the world originate in the United States. In 2001, 45 percent of the world's soybeans were grown in the United States. 
   American consumers spend the lowest percentage of their annual income on food, just 9.3 percent. Nearly 19 billion pounds of pork, the most widely eaten meat, were processed in 2001. Cotton is by far the most dominant fiber produced in the United States, and, as you know, is used for apparel, home fabrics, as well as industrial uses. 
   Fertilizer and pesticides contribute to increases in production, as crop-production products have tripled the output of resource-intensive food like cooking oil, meat, fruits and vegetables. Crop-production products have doubled the production of world food calories since 1960. Without synthetic crop-production chemicals, American farmers certainly cannot feed the world. 
   Farmers are good stewards of the land's environment as well. Farmers and ranchers are the first environmentalists, maintaining and improving the soil and natural resources to pass on to the future generations. Farmers use reduced tillage practices on more than 72 million acres to prevent erosion. Farmers maintain over 1.3 million acres of grass waterways, allowing water to flow naturally from crops without eroding soil. Contour farming, planting crops, which is planting crops on hillsides instead of up and down, keeps soil from washing away. About 26 million acres in the United States are managed this way. Cattle ranchers and others control water run-off with sod waterways and diversions, erosion-control structures and catch basins. 
   Just as urban families recycle grass, newspaper and aluminum, farm families have practiced recycling for a long time by applying manure to fields to replace nutrients in the soil. Food service food scraps are used to make animal feed. Agriculture land provides habitat, again, for 75 percent of the Nation's wildlife. 
   Let's discuss the profile of the farmer. More than 3 million people farm or ranch in the United States. Individuals, family partnerships or family corporations operate almost 99 percent of U.S. farms. Over 22 million people are employed in farm or farm-related jobs, including production agriculture, farm inputs, processing and marketing, and wholesale and retail sales. 
   According to the 2002 Census of Agriculture, 50 percent of the farmers are 55 years of age or older, up only 3 percent from 1997. The average age of the principal operator is 55.3 years. Forty-one percent of U.S. total land area is farmland. In 1900, the average farm size was 147 acres, compared to 441 acres today. 
   The top five agriculture commodities are cattle and calves, dairy products, broilers, corn and soybeans. U.S. farmers produce 46 percent of the world's soybeans, 41 percent of the world's corn, 20.5 percent of the world's cotton and 13 percent of the world's wheat. 
   Let me repeat that, because I believe that we are losing sight of how important these markets are. U.S. farmers produce 46 percent of the world's soybeans, 41 percent of the world's corn, 20.5 percent of the world's cotton and 13 percent of the world's wheat. 
   Farmers and ranchers are independent business people who provide for their families by growing and producing food and fiber. Farmers and ranchers are producing meat lower in fat and cholesterol. This has resulted in retail cuts that are 15 percent leaner, giving consumers better value for their dollar. For example, a pork tenderloin now has only one more gram of fat than a skinless chicken breast, one of the true fat lightweights, so to speak. Also much leaner beef cuts are being produced much more now than 20 years ago, resulting in 27 percent less fat reaching the retail case than in 1985. 
   Research and advancements in biotechnology are now in the marketplace with better fruit and vegetables that stay fresh longer and are not damaged by insects. A new technology called precision farming boosts the crop yields and reduces waste by using satellite maps in computers to match seed, fertilizer and crop-protection applications to local soil conditions. 
   As the amount of mechanization and horsepower and farm machinery has increased, the time needed to complete tasks has decreased. Combines, these huge machines used to harvest grains such as corn, soybeans and wheat, have dramatically changed agriculture. In the 1930s, before the machines were available, a farmer could harvest an average of 100 bushels of corn by hand in a 9-hour day. Today's combines can harvest 900 bushels of corn per hour, or 100 bushels of corn in under 7 minutes. 
   The efficiency of U.S. farmers benefits the United States consumer in the pocketbook. Americans spend less on food than any other developed Nation in the world. On average, again, in 2004, Americans spent only 2 percent of their disposable income on meat and poultry compared to 4.1 percent in 1970. 
   I think it's important, as we reflect on all of these numbers, it can be a little overwhelming. But it's important to reflect the importance of agriculture, as we look at National Agriculture Week, and certainly as we look to the future. Hopefully we can learn from our past, the policies that, perhaps, discourage trade or policies that come down in a Draconian manner on farmers and ranchers. I will get to more of that in a few minutes. 
   Meanwhile, I would like to yield to my friend from Iowa, as he would like to discuss American agriculture as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (CELEBRATING NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King). I appreciate the fact that you speak to the future. As we look at so many of the aspects of agriculture, I think sometimes we forget about the future and how far we have come. 
   We have water challenges in Nebraska. And it is interesting, in the middle of about a 7-year drought, I don't think enough credit is given to the better practices that have been engaged in Nebraska relating to irrigation, that we are seeing record amounts of yields, record yields amidst about 50 percent reduction in irrigation. 
   Now, there are also those critics out there, they tend to be critical of the fact that there aren't return flows from the former flowing of irrigation perhaps that many would consider waste. But it is interesting that as farmers become more and more efficient, they are also criticized along the way, and I think that that is unfortunate. When you talk about energy, it is absolutely vital that we realize that, even amidst corn prices that are strong, we have unprecedented costs of inputs especially related to energy, whether it is the fertilizer or whether it is the diesel for the tractor. 
   And that is what makes me nervous about these urges to regulate industry even more, that it will drive up the cost. And not only electricity for the consumer in their residence, but it will drive up the cost of energy, as we see it on farms and ranches. And that will drive up the cost of food, plain and simple. And as I stated earlier, we have come a long way in terms of producing food in an affordable format. 
   I was reading through, and I noticed part of the essay contest winner from the Ag Council of America, and this is the 2007 winner, LaTasha Cote, a 12th grader from Myrtle, Missouri Couch High School. And students from 7th to 12th grade submitted original essays of 450 words about the importance of agriculture in the United States. Under the theme, ``American Agriculture in 2025,'' students were encouraged to focus their essays on the potential landscape of American agriculture in 2025 based on where we are today and the opportunities that lie ahead. And Ms. Cote read her essay to industry representatives, Members of Congress, Federal agency representatives, media and others in a celebration of agriculture; and let me share with you just an excerpt: 
   ``The alarm sounds off at about 8:00 a.m. A young man reaches over to turn it off, gets up, jumps in the shower, eats his breakfast, and then heads out the door toward the milk barn. There is no rush to get to the cows because they have already been milked. 
   ``He begins to check the computer system to see the amount of milk produced from the third milking of the day. Immediately, a very precise chart pops up and gives the percentage of milk given per second, the amount of butter fat, and accurately tells the farmer the exact weight of the milk. 
   ``Wait, where is the reality check? Well, there isn't one. This is only one example of how far the industry in all farms has come since the year of 2007.'' 
   And I haven't had a chance to read the entire piece, but I wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate Ms. Cote and every student who submitted an essay in the contest. I think that it may be even sooner than 2025 when we see these things come about, but it is great to see young people looking to the future. 
   As we look at the big picture of agriculture, certainly globally we always think of trade, and I think the unfortunate situation with the closure of our beef, the rejection of our beef in many cases to Asia, but it does I think send a message to the larger issue of where we are at with livestock in America. It is interesting that we do find ourselves with a bit of a shortage of grain to feed our livestock.     
   And as we try to address this shortage, certainly, I think it can be best if the government stays out of the way. But when I hear concerns of this and the livestock industry, perhaps, getting a little worried, it worries me, too, because the livestock industry has been absolutely crucial to economies of rural America. And the fact that these economies are not, I think, appreciated like they should be, it is interesting to note how further regulations of the recent past have led to many livestock operations having to become much, much larger. And as they become much larger, certainly, others become concerned about the livestock waste. 
   And it was encouraging to me last year to finally see some understanding that we don't want policies that force the producer to get larger. We want them to have the options of getting larger should they pursue that. Should they feel comfortable with their current status, that is fine, too. 
   It is interesting, though, as we see large operators, small operators, middle-size, medium-size operators, we have to realize that I believe our fundamental responsibility is to create opportunities. Government can create opportunities, not through a check necessarily, but we can create policy opportunities so that the little guy has the option of getting larger and can prosper and pursue the economic dreams that they wish to. 
   And the gentleman from Iowa certainly pointed out the fact that there are a lot of promising scenarios out there. As I go across the Third District of Nebraska and I visit operators, whether they are small or large, it is so encouraging to see people engaged in the economy. And as they are engaged, whether it is at a beef cattle processing plant or a pork processing plant, or an ethanol plant, or whether they are even creating biodiesel in their garage, I think there is just tremendous opportunity, and that I believe it is my responsibility to maybe not protect that opportunity, but to expand that and to make sure that every producer, every taxpayer has that opportunity to grow and, hopefully, make a greater living, and the government won't take it all away from them, and they can reapply that through available capital back into the economy.  
   And if the gentleman from Iowa would like to participate, go ahead.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I thank the gentleman from Iowa. As I wrap this up, I certainly want to thank the gentleman for really focusing on the future, and I think the sky is the limit when we can focus on the benefits of agriculture and perhaps the things we take for granted. 
   But as we talk about the future and younger generations engaging in agriculture, I find it unconscionable that the so-called death tax, or, in a more technical sense, the estate tax, would go back up to 55 percent, and that a subsequent generation on a farm or ranch would have to come up with cash to inherit that farm or ranch. That is sad. That is un-American. I think it is insensitive to taxpayers, and I think it has an immense disregard for the future and economic impact that that would have. 
   I think too many people think that only certain departments of the grocery store really come from agriculture, as we would think of it. But the fact is it is involved in health care, whether it is pharmaceutical, surgical sutures, ointments, X-ray film, latex gloves, gelatin for capsules and heart valves, or with construction, lumber, paint, brushes, tar paper, other things. And I could go on a list that would take much more time than I can consume here today. 
   But the fact is, we have come a long way, and we can go a lot further as we focus on opportunities, as we look at the fact that we need each other. Farmers need consumers. Consumers need farmers. And in between those entities, there is opportunity, whether it is processing, whether it is research. I think we can go a lot further than we have already come as we look to the future.     
   Again I would like to thank the Agriculture Council of America for providing a lot of this information and the very hands-on approach that they take and certainly look forward to working with them as I serve the people of the Third District of Nebraska and as farmers of the Third District of Nebraska and farmers and ranchers continue to feed the world. 
   Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, recently Congress passed House Resolution 590, supporting the goals of Domestic Violence Awareness Month while raising awareness of domestic violence throughout our country. I am here to voice my support for everyone impacted by this horrible nightmare. This is an issue which affects millions in urban and rural areas alike. It crosses economic lines, geographic lines and ethnic lines. No segment of our population is immune. One out of five women and one out of 14 men have been domestically assaulted at some point in their lives. 
   In my home State of Nebraska, there are more than 5,800 protection orders needed for those living in fear of violence. Domestic violence is an issue which too often is swept under the rug or ignored. So as part of the Domestic Violence Awareness Month, I am wearing a purple ribbon to raise awareness about the crime of domestic abuse as we work toward ending this violence.

   The bill unveiled yesterday would tie our military leaders' hands at the very time they need our support the most. Some want to set a date certain. The reality is the only certain part of this plan is that President Bush has threatened to veto the bill, and critical funding for our troops would be needlessly delayed. 
   This plan is dangerous, and I would urge all of my colleagues to oppose this war funding proposal. Even Members of the majority party are reacting negatively to the proposal, as well they should. 
   Everyone agrees that we must make progress in Iraq. We also agree the Iraqi Government must step up and improve the situation. What the Republicans are going to stand against is tying the funds our soldiers need to do their jobs to benchmarks thought up by special interest groups.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, it is vital that we work to protect grazing on public and private lands. In fact, communities throughout the United States depend on it. 
   Millions of acres of lands within the NLCS have grazing. The NLCS is a direct threat to grazing for these several reasons. This is not by accident. Advocates who testified in support of H.R. 2016 list grazing as a ``threat'' to NLCS lands. 
   This bill, in fact, directs the Secretary of Interior to manage NLCS lands similar to the National Park Service. This is a problem because there is no grazing on National Park Service lands. Outside groups will use this to drive off ranchers through lawsuits. This is harmful not only to ranchers themselves, a very difficult industry at this time, but to the communities in which they reside. It is also harmful ultimately to the American consumer. 
   I urge others to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2016 and encourage a balanced policy as a result.

   We heard about de-escalation and when that might be appropriate, when it may not be. But I can tell you that this resolution does not accomplish de-escalation. In fact, it does not even support the troops on their way as we speak. It only supports the troops who have served or are currently serving. 
   Madam Speaker, in my conversations with constituents, with soldiers, with those closest to the situation, they see hope, they see hope in a change of strategy. We know that the status quo is not what we need to do, and that is why a change in strategy is certainly in order. 
   I don't pretend to be General Patraeus, and I hope that none of us pretend to know more about the situation than General Patraeus. 
   I am concerned when we hear that this resolution is the first step for cutting funding. Why don't we just put that resolution up right now?

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great concern for our economy. I rise because we hear about the debt and certainly my concern is that if we are not careful, we will make the debt even worse than it is now because an economy can turn south with overtaxation. Right now we are headed to tax increases that concern me a great deal. 
   In Nebraska, the average tax increase per taxpayer is almost $2,400 a year as proposed. More than that though, I am concerned about small businesses, farmers and ranchers who face tax increases whether it is the estate tax or other taxes. 
   When I have a small business person come up to me and say, we need to do something about the estate tax, the death tax because it will devastate their business, that gets my attention. 
   My concerns are that we have available capital in our economy because, with available capital, we see good things happening, whether it is investing in the stock market or whether it is expanding a small business or whether it is putting money away for a child or grandchild heading to college. The fact is, available capital does great things, and that is why I rise with extreme concern about our budget because the budget calls for a tax increase, and that is what concerns me so much because tax increases are bad for economic growth. Tax increases lead to a downturn in the economy. 
   I not only believe we can do better than this proposed budget, but we must do better.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (UNITED STATES-PERU TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Herger and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for leading, I think, a terrific bipartisan effort. 
   I rise today in support of expanding our Nation's export markets by passing the bipartisan Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. The agreement will create significant new opportunities for American farmers, ranchers, businesses and certainly consumers by opening new markets and reducing trade barriers, leveling that playing field. 
   More than two-thirds of current U.S. farm exports to Peru will become duty free immediately. This trade agreement gives U.S. farmers an advantage over competitors. For example, U.S. exporters of wheat and white corn currently pay a 17 percent tariff in Peru, while Argentina pays only 3.4 percent and controls two-thirds of Peru's market. 
   You eliminate the 17 percent tariff and give U.S. grain exporters a leg up. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, U.S. agriculture exports could exceed $705 million, an increase of over 1,000 percent from current levels. In addition, Peru has committed to recognize the U.S. meat inspection system as the equivalent to its own, thereby allowing imports from facilities approved by our own USDA. Peru has committed to specific sanitary and phytosanitary terms, removing barriers to imports of U.S. beef, pork, poultry and rice. 
   Opening export markets has long been a priority of mine. Earlier this year I hosted an export seminar which drew forward-thinking individuals from across my district. They recognized just how vitally important access to foreign markets can be to our economy. 
   In 2006, Nebraska's agriculture exports worldwide were around $3.3 billion. A total of 1,125 companies exported goods from Nebraska in 2005. Of those, 877 were businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Despite high tariffs and other barriers on most agriculture products, including beef, corn and soybeans, U.S. exporters shipped more than $209 million in agriculture products to Peru. 
   Nebraska would benefit from this free trade agreement which provides U.S. suppliers with access to foreign markets and levels the playing field with our competitors. As the Omaha World Herald newspaper put it in today's edition, ``Greater trade opportunities hold clear benefit for the Midlands. In terms of Nebraska's economic interests alone, tariffs would be sharply reduced on the State's primary exports to Peru: chemical manufactures, machinery, and processed foods.'' 
   But more than just economic interests, this agreement builds trust between two countries. By opening the doors for our exports, we also open lines of communication. We help improve lives. We foster a sense of community. 
   Agriculture markets are tremendously important to my district and the Nation as a whole, and I hope to help Nebraska's products continue to compete in the global marketplace. But I also want to help America remain the greatest Nation in the world. We can do so by opening the lines of trade and communications to trading partners across the globe. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan measure.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (ENERGY POLICY IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Thank you to the gentleman from Utah for yielding me time so that we can have a bit of a conversation on energy. I truly believe that our country is lacking a balanced policy. I think that our country is lacking a commonsense policy, which certainly leaves consumers out of the mix for what they need with food, with fuel for their vehicles, energy to heat their homes, energy to run a small business. The list goes on and on.  
   But as we do address and look to the future, I think that utilizing today's technology and even tomorrow's technology so that we can certainly use the resources afforded our country, we can do that in a very responsible manner, and that we would not have certain issues become symbols of I think an extreme agenda that are endorsed by I think a relatively small group of Americans. 
   In 1980, the Congress, and President Carter, I will add, created the nearly 20 million acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but they set aside 1.5 million acres of ANWR's northern coastal plain for the purpose of future energy exploration and development. Let me repeat that. They set aside, this is Congress and President Carter in 1980, 1.5 million acres of ANWR's northern coastal plain for the purpose of future energy exploration and development. This parcel is known as the 1002 area, named after the section of the act that set it aside for its energy resources. 
   Energy exploration will be limited to just 2,000 acres of ANWR's 1002 area, an acreage limitation made possible by 21st century technology. This 2,000 acres, I will add, is equivalent to one-tenth of 1 percent of ANWR's total acreage. 
   According to the U.S. Energy Administration, the mean estimate of recoverable oil in ANWR is 10.4 billion barrels, all of which is now economically recoverable. That is more than the twice the proven oil reserves in all of Texas. That is almost half of the total U.S. proven reserves of 21 billion barrels. That represents a possible 50 percent increase in total U.S. proven reserves. 
   EIA also estimates daily ANWR would provide 1 million barrels per day for 30 years. Will that affect oil prices? Absolutely. Is that a government subsidy? No. I hope that we can get beyond the policies of just saying ``no'' to domestic sources of energy. This is equivalent to what the entire State of Texas produces daily. ANWR's 30 year, 1 million barrel per day supply, also equals 30 years of imports from Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. 
   Let's talk about the revenue. According to a recent CRS report, at today's prices of $125 per barrel, ANWR development would deliver $191.1 billion in corporate income tax and royalty revenue to the Federal Government. Let's talk about fiscal responsibility. Bonus bids alone would deliver close to $4 billion to the Federal Treasury. 
   Economically speaking, relating to jobs, ANWR energy production would create between 250,000 and 750,000 good jobs in America across the country. These are good, broad-based jobs in the energy sector that, in the end, help consumers. A study from the National Defense Council Foundation says that the figure could be as high as 1 million new jobs for Americans in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. 
   In terms of environmental protection, ANWR's leasing plan will be certainly environmentally sound. The Interior Department must administer the leasing program to result in no significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife, their habitat, subsistence resources or the environment. The leasing program will be subject to stringent regulations that at a minimum will require some of these details. Let me share them. 
   Meeting or exceeding environmental mitigation measures established in the prior environmental impact statement. 
   Limiting exploration generally to the period between November and May. 
   Imposing seasonal limits to protect breeding, spawning and wildlife migration patterns. 
   Using ice roads, airstrips and other low impact transportation methods while limiting air traffic to reduce disturbance to fish and wildlife. 
   Requiring pipelines and roads to be designed to minimize adverse effects on migratory caribou, other wildlife and surface water flow. 
   Protecting streams, springs, rivers, wetlands and riparian habitats from the effects of water used in drilling. 
   Treating and disposing of all waste products by use of a hazardous material tracking system and filing an annual report on waste management. 
   Educating crew members on environmental protection methods. 
   Complying with all applicable air and water quality standards and utilizing the best commercially available technology for the exploration and development, not only today, but in the future as well. 
   I could go on and on with many of these details that assure the responsible development, exploration and henceforth the development, but let me give some perspective to this briefly. 
   The size of the small wildlife refuges that currently exist barely measure as a fraction of ANWR's 19.6 million acres, yet the ecosystem and energy production in the refuges coexist without harm. Consider the size of these following National Wildlife Refuges supporting active oil and gas production, according to information provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: 
   Hewitt Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Montana, total size, 1,680 acres; Hagerman National Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma/Texas, 11,000 acres; Kirtland's Warbler National Wildlife Refuge in Michigan, 6,543 acres; Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana, 48,000 acres. We are talking about a good chunk there. San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge in Texas, 37,000 acres; Crosby Wetland Management District in North Dakota, 86,000 acres. But, my friends, ANWR in Alaska, the total size of the refuge is 19.6 million acres, and proposed development is 2,000 acres. 
   I would argue that what is best for consumers is a good, balanced energy policy that isn't just about petroleum. It is about many other sources. And the frustration from consumers in the Third District of Nebraska is getting higher and higher and higher, because they understand the economics of various sources of energy, whether it is biofuels that many people are speaking out against, or even nuclear power, nuclear energy that we know is friendly to the environment in terms of carbon emissions. 
   Hydropower, it was interesting to learn that New Zealand is one of the world's, I would say, most green countries in terms of energy. They are about 80 percent dependent on hydropower. And there is so much pushback here in America on the development of hydropower, consumers are getting frustrated. It is not just policymakers, but it is consumers as well, because they can do the math. 
   Clean coal technology, we have come so far with clean coal, and there is even greater promise in the future. Why would we want to sell ourselves short on that? Oil shale, that I know will be discussed here momentarily, certainly is a domestic source of energy. We heard earlier about some comments about becoming energy independent, oil independent, but yet there is so much pushback from developing our own resources in a very responsible manner.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Well, I can't make any promises, but certainly as it  does speak to economics, there is concern that so much of the price of oil per barrel today is based on speculation, that the mere announcement that we would be opening up some domestic sources of petroleum resources, we would be perhaps warning those folks in the speculative world that things may change a bit.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Absolutely. I think the numbers certainly speak for themselves. 
   Folks, in our economy, on the front lines of our economy, they can do the math. They are very frustrated with what is taking place right now. And while the Third District of Nebraska is a large place, I am not saying it is smaller than this subject area, but we even have opportunities with so many different sources of energy. Why would we want to take something off the table, when there are domestic supplies that with technology today and tomorrow we can do so much more? 
   But more than that, it strikes me as absolutely amazing that the local folks of these subject areas, specifically ANWR, are supportive of this development. I think you spoke earlier of some places in Utah that you pointed out that the locals support. If it were truly going to plunder the environment, as many would speculate and suggest, the local folks would be fighting against that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, we've been hearing a lot about change these days; certain parties claiming more change than others perhaps. 
   I would suggest that what has changed the most is the definition of the term ``bipartisan.'' To say that this effort is bipartisan is not being honest. To say that the process that we're supposed to engage in 2 years ago of being the most open process in the history of Congress, not so. To criticize the executive branch for energy policies 7 years ago being drafted behind closed doors, and then to participate or not allow participation in this issue, I think, is unconscionable for the American people. 
   We're talking about way offshore drilling, if at all. We need broad-based energy supply. 
   If we think that a 9 percent approval rating of Congress is bad, let's pass a bill that won't do anything saying that it will. That is bad policy. If we expect our economy to grow, we need to afford the resources of energy to the growing economy.

The agreement should be brought up before the House as soon as possible. Over 90 percent of U.S. imports from Colombia now enter our country duty-free. The agreement will provide U.S. companies and ag producers with duty-free access to the Colombian market. 
   Colombia's market grew by 7 percent last year, and is already a top global export market for U.S. crops such as corn and cotton. With the trade accord in place, U.S. exports are projected to rise by more than $1 billion per year. The time is right.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Thank you to the gentleman from Iowa. It's great to be here. I take this responsibility, not only this evening, very seriously, but being elected as a Member of the United States House of Representatives very seriously. 
   My primary responsibility, I believe, is to protect the freedoms that so many Americans enjoy and, perhaps, have taken for granted for a time. I think back to the terrorist acts leveled on our country, and that is a constant reminder that we cannot sit idly by, that we cannot let division sway us from our goal. I believe that one of the fundamental sources of our freedom is through economic freedom, and that is why I requested a spot on the Budget Committee. 
   Incidentally, last night, we had a long markup of the budget. It was very enlightening to me as a new Member, and it was very enlightening to me, I think, some of the rhetoric and the objectives of a budget. We know that so often we want to tell people, yes, in terms of the of new programs, of new spending. There comes a time, though, when we are going to have to pay for that. 
   There was a lot of rhetoric exchanged in terms of what tax relief has done for our economy, some would say what it hasn't done for the budget. But I don't know if it's just coincidence that the economy turned around with tax relief. I don't think it's coincidence, to be quite honest with you. But it is interesting how the allegations are leveled that the Bush administration tax relief or the Reagan tax relief or, quite honestly, the President John F. Kennedy tax relief had nothing to do with a rebounding economy subsequently. 
   It was very enlightening to me, in fact, when I was visiting the JFK Library in Boston, or outside of Boston. This is not the Ronald Reagan Library; this is not the Bush 41 or the Bush 43 library. This is the John F. Kennedy Library that has an entire exhibit devoted to the economic policies of tax relief leading to economic prosperity. 
   I believe that it has to do with the very basics of economic freedom that individuals, families, you name it, when they have those dollars in their hands, they can spend it more wisely on the economy, rather than paying it into the government, and then the government doling it out as a redistribution of wealth or whatever the case might be.     
   But it does amaze me that we are here listening to the need for so much more spending. In fact, a high level of spending wasn't enough to get enough support, so they made it even higher to bring on more support. That concerns me, and I know that it concerns many Americans as well. 
   But as we were marking up the budget last night in committee well into the night, it was interesting how we heard that the majority wants to maintain the tax relief relating to the marriage penalty, tax relief relating to the child tax credit, but yet the budget doesn't show that. The budget does not show that. And it just spoke volumes, I guess, in terms of sound budgeting according to the principles I think of economic freedoms that should be instilled there. 
   But when we talk about something, we politicians kind of get a bad name now and then, or maybe more often than that, for saying one thing and doing another. That is unfortunate, because this budget says one thing and does another, and that is my concern. 
   It is interesting that there were amendments proposed for the budget resolution last night that would have solidified the tax relief one measure at a time. So there was the option of cherry-picking, if you will, good parts, bad parts, whatever the case might have been for others wanting to support these amendments. If they like the child tax credit, but didn't like the dividends reduction in taxes, they have the option to choose one without the other. Every single amendment was rejected. Every single amendment. That concerns me a great deal because, like I said, it eats away at what I believe is a fundamental freedom that we should enjoy in America, that being economic freedom.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I did not sense that commitment. It would be hard for me to speak or to speculate. And I am not here to beat up on those with whom I disagree. That is not my job. 
   I do believe, though, that this supplemental spending bill, and I don't want to take up all of your time, but I do want to touch briefly on the fact that this supplemental spending bill with the caveats that many would call micromanaging the war is the wrong thing to do. I don't think we want to give our enemy any hint of what our plans are. A date certain withdrawal is the wrong thing to do. Certainly that was not discussed, especially in the spending context that we have heard so much here today about and well into the future. 
   There is a lot we can worry about in the past, but if we don't focus on the future, we are not doing our jobs. And as we look at protecting the freedom, I can't help but think how productive we could be with a more unified approach. And I believe that military generals are trained highly, and that we should entrust in their abilities the objective of doing what they need to do so that we can see success overseas. And I cannot say that enough, but I truly believe that turning a spending bill into a bill to micromanage the war is the wrong thing to do. 
   Constitutionally the President is the Commander in Chief. No one else is the Commander in Chief. And the Commander in Chief makes the tough decisions. And we can again look at the past and perhaps learn from the past and apply those lessons to the future, which we must do and can do. And if we pay attention to really look at the information and the facts and the data, we can do the right thing, and that is availing the resources to our military, to those most highly trained, those closest to the situation, and allow those folks to make the right decision. 
   I yield back, but I certainly appreciate this opportunity and would certainly encourage my friend from Iowa to continue his pursuits here, because I think it is helpful, and I hope to join again. Thank you.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, when I'm back in Nebraska, I take the opportunity to listen to my constituents about the challenges they face in their day-to-day life. 
   The high cost of fuel, rising energy prices, and the overall strength of the American economy are all concerns for Nebraskans and all Americans. 
   Now is the time for Congress to step up to the plate and act with common-sense and fiscal responsibility. 
   The budget resolution we are debating, however, lets the American people down on those two fronts. 
   Instead of supporting common-sense budget process controls and responsible spending levels, this budget systematically guts a range of budget process tools, from the Majority's own PAYGO rule to abandoning any criteria for emergency spending. 
   In other words, the policies which make it easiest to tax-and-spend. 
   This budget hikes discretionary spending by $204 billion over 5-years on top of the Administration's proposed increase, the Majority loaded up their resolution with over 20 so-called spending ``reserve funds,'' and increased reliance on budget gimmicks, such as advance appropriations. 
   Unfortunately, this budget increases spending, raises taxes to historic levels, refuses to fix the AMT--which will hit millions of middle-class taxpayers if nothing is done. 
   It does nothing to rescue Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid despite the fact the Budget Committee has heard time and time again that something must be done about entitlement spending.  
   Regrettably, the budget we will consider today appears to simply underscore this Majority's insistence on reckless spending, chased by record tax hikes on American workers and businesses, and massive debt burdens for future generations. 
   Nebraskans--and all Americans--have called for Congress to live up to its fiscal responsibilities. 
   Today, however, we are debating a bill which badly misses the mark. 
   I urge my colleagues to take a stand against this budget--which proposes hundreds of billions of dollars in new government spending paid for with the largest tax hike in American history.

Mr. Speaker, prizes have a history of encouraging innovation by promoting competition and expanding the talent pool to include a numerous and diverse array of groups and individuals. Those unable or unwilling to secure grants can participate in the race for the goal. With prizes, government funding is not used to pick technological winners and losers. The prize is only awarded if the goal is met. Prizes encourage the investment of private capital and research, even beyond the monetary value of the prize. 
   I applaud the X PRIZE Foundation for spurring competition and innovation in the race to a more efficient automobile. When the 100 mile-per-gallon vehicle is achieved, citizens of my home State of Nebraska will be able to drive across the State on Interstate 80 on only 4 1/2 gallons of fuel.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, this week the House will, for the third time, debate an energy bill which actually raises gas prices for the American people, sends manufacturing jobs overseas, and increases our reliance on foreign energy. This energy tax hike will raise taxes on domestic energy producers, in essence making it more difficult and expensive to produce American energy for American consumers. 
   As you know, oil has reached and broken the previously untouched benchmark of $100 a barrel, and the average national price of gasoline has gone up 16 cents in just 13 days. In my State of Nebraska, gas prices are hitting $3.14 in Grand Island, and in Scottsbluff they're hitting $3.08. 
   The American public is deeply worried about the rising cost of energy, yet we stand on the verge of making it worse by stubbornly going forward with this legislation. It's simple, really; raising taxes on American energy leads to higher gas prices and a greater dependency on foreign sources of energy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Thank you, I appreciate that. 
   First I would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Brown, Ranking Member Mica and Ranking Member Shuster for their support of this resolution. As you've heard, this resolution would recognize North Platte, Nebraska, as Rail Town USA. North Platte is a thriving community of over 25,000 people possessing a rich history dating back to before it was organized as a city in 1874. 
   Today North Platte is home to Bailey Yard, owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. Bailey Yard is the largest rail classification yard in the world. Every 24 hours, Bailey Yard handles 10,000 railroad cars and an average of 135 trains bound for cities as distant as the east, west, and gulf coasts of America, as well as the Canadian and Mexican borders. 
   In addition to the current importance of the railroad to North Platte, the community and railroad also share a storied past of goodwill during World War II. For 54 months between 1941 and 1946, millions of troops found a small bit of comfort when their trains stopped in North Platte. One December day, word spread that Company D of Nebraska's National Guard was going to travel through North Platte later that morning. As it does in close-knit communities, word traveled rapidly. Though the train was scheduled to arrive mid-morning, no train had arrived by 4:30 p.m. Shortly thereafter, the nearly 500 people who had gathered to show support for their fellow Nebraskans were instead surprised to find the train loaded with troops from Kansas. Though not their expected native sons and daughters, the Nebraskans gathered would not let these brave young men travel on without knowing they were supported and honored. They were offered food, coffee and gifts, just as if they were Nebraska's own. 
   Rae Wilson, in fact, a sister to one of the troops from Nebraska, took it upon herself to write a letter to the local paper suggesting that citizens gather for all trains of troops passing through North Platte. On December 22, 1941, a canteen committee was organized, and Rae was chosen as chairwoman. Just 3 days later, the canteen officially opened its doors from 5 a.m. to midnight, all volunteers. During its busiest period, the canteen would be open 24 hours a day, again, all volunteers honoring the troops. 
   Before Union Pacific switched to diesel-electric power, North Platte was a designated servicing point. While the trains were being serviced, soldiers visited the canteen. At the war's peak, 3,000 to 5,000 personnel were greeted daily with North Platte sometimes hosting up to 20 trains a day. In fact, these volunteers from 125 communities in and around the State contributed with donations of time, money, supplies, food and smiles. More than 6 million service men and women who traveled through Nebraska during World War II were greeted by the North Platte Canteen. A total of $137,000, and more than that in cash, was contributed to the canteen over its operation. 
   Today the effort of the North Platte Canteen during World War II is still a source of pride within the community and throughout Nebraska. And the town's relationship with the railroad continues to be recognized as an important part of North Platte's history. 
   I would like to elaborate, Madam Speaker, that today, as we look at the canteen issues and the railroad in general, we know that North Platte, the railroad and the Bailey Yard contributed significantly to our energy supply, with coal trains coming through from the coal fields of Wyoming. They come through Nebraska and many other places, but this rail yard specifically, and there are thousands of workers, specifically many workers associated with the United Transportation Union, who are employed with good jobs contributing to the energy supply of our Nation. 
   I only hope that we can come up with a policy that is more friendly to clean coal. And this can help all of us. This provides jobs for those in middle America. But more than that, it provides a stimulus package, if you will, that is through more affordable energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (ANNUAL BUDGET DEBATE -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling). It is good to be here this evening as we discuss, I believe, an important aspect of our future. 
   Later this week we will begin debating the majority party's budget resolution. It promises to balance the budget by 2012 without raising taxes and with significant increases in both discretionary and mandatory spending. Basic math tells me this is impossible. 
   The majority party's budget assumes the expiration of all of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts by adding those revenues into the budget over time to bring it into balance. Chasing higher spending with higher taxes, Mr. Speaker, will fail to address the unsustainable growth of government and will undo everything our economy has accomplished.     
   Even as our Nation faced tremendous challenges over the past few years, the strategy of economic growth through tax relief has delivered significant deficit reductions, including job growth. 
   If we are to raise taxes to balance the budget, entitlements would quickly drive us right back into the deficit, just at a higher level of taxing and spending. 
   With the retirement of the massive baby-boom generation looming, this situation will grow more serious, not less so. Most importantly, however, from an agricultural point of view, the majority party's budget promises more than $110 billion in increased mandatory spending in selected issue areas. They address this by creating 10 so-called reserve funds for specific items like health care, education and the farm bill. Agriculture gets a $20 billion ``reserve'' fund to be released at the discretion of the Budget Committee chairman. Sounds like a good deal, well, until you read the details. 
   This farm bill reserve fund can only be made available if the farm bill would not increase the deficit or decrease the surplus through 2017. In other words, to get the $20 billion, it must be offset by spending cuts or tax increases. This is either a shell game to give the impression of increased funding with no substance, or it is part of a larger plan leading to tax hikes, and I believe it is a part of a larger plan that would lead to the largest tax increase in American history. 
   It is interesting to note that in Nebraska this tax hike would cost the average Nebraskan, with over 656,000 taxpayers in Nebraska, an average of over $2,800 per taxpayer. My friends in Wyoming, almost $3,200 per taxpayer. My neighbors in Colorado over $3,000; Kansas, almost $2,900; South Dakota, almost $2,600 per taxpayer. 
   What concerns me the most, Mr. Speaker, is that sitting through several long hearings in the Budget Committee because it is certainly an important topic, we heard from the experts, and I would say the experts of the experts, who gave us clear warnings that we must reform entitlements. 
   The Federal Reserve Chairman, Mr. Bernanke, in the Budget Committee on February 28, 2007, said, ``Without early and meaningful action to address the rapid growth of entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' 
   The Comptroller General, Mr. David Walker, also in a Budget Committee hearing, on January 23 stated, ``Health care is the number one fiscal challenge for the Federal and State governments. It is the number one competitiveness challenge for American business, and it is a growing challenge for American families. If there is one thing that can bankrupt America, it is health care. We need dramatic and fundamental reforms.'' 
   Mr. Walker went on to say on ``60 Minutes'' that the rising cost of government entitlements are a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt America. 
   Even the Democrat chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has acknowledged, ``It is always easier to defer, to kick the can down the road to avoid making choices.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise with great concern about our future. I am concerned that when it comes to fiscal policies we have ignored the past, we haven't learned our lessons, and that we expect spending into prosperity, taxing into prosperity, and there is a law of diminishing returns. We know that is not a sustainable situation, and we have to practice fiscal responsibility because what concerns me the most is that the more we delay the decision, the tougher the decision becomes. 
   I know as we look at this budget and the revenues it necessitates are not sustainable with those policies. I rise out of great concern and look forward to a good, hearty debate as we address these issues that are so important to middle-class America.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 375--Honoring United Parcel Service and its 100 years of commitment and leadership in the United States--and the more than 1000 UPS drivers, managers and other employees in the Third District of Nebraska. 
   Founded in 1907, UPS has become an everyday sight for many of us. In Washington, DC it is not remarkable to see one of the big, brown trucks every day. 
   But for people in rural Nebraska, UPS is an invaluable resource. Rural delivery service--for many--is a life-line for homes far away from the local post office. UPS prides itself on delivery service to every address in North America and Europe, including areas where neighbors can be separated by miles of ranch and farmland. 
   I have had the honor of meeting with some UPS drivers, and I look forward to doing so again in the near future. Until then, I say ``thank you'' to all UPS employees and to ``keep up the great work.''

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, In 2006, the Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska, in Niobrara, received a Rural Housing and Economic Development Innovative Support Grant award, to provide additional funding for a 40-unit subdivision in the Village of Santee. 
   Today, we will pass H.R. 1982, authorizing the Office of Housing and Urban Development to authorize the Rural Housing and Economic Development program to provide competitive grants to support housing and economic development in rural areas. 
   This program is the only exclusively rural housing program administered by HUD, and focuses on ``high-risk'' areas. 
   If rural areas of Nebraska are going to grow and prosper, we need strong, safe communities. H.R. 1982 is an investment in the future for struggling rural areas, and is a good step in the right direction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, today, we will pass H. Con. Res. 87, supporting the goals and ideals of a world day or remembrance for road crash victims. 
   This legislation sets aside the third Sunday of November as a day of remembrance for road crash victims and their families, and calls on nations globally to improve road safety. 
   It also encourages our country to support and participate in programs and activities to commemorate a world day of remembrance for road crash victims with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and other activities. 
   Each year 40,000 people in the U.S. die in road crashes--last year Nebraska had 226 fatal crashes, according to the Nebraska Office of Highway Safety. 
   Very few of us can say we have never been affected by a road crash. It is my hope, through these educational and informative steps, we can lower the total of Americans--and Nebraskans--lost to road crashes each year.

   A great statesman, he will be hard--if not impossible--to replace. President Ford taught us lessons of unity we will do well to remember as we debate issues that may be divisive.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 2669, a bill which does not reduce the cost of a college education, but creates five new entitlement programs and expands the reach of government programs over non-profit and commercial lenders. 
   The measure contains $21.5 billion in new spending over five years while saving only $752 million for deficit reduction. The bill cuts $22.3 billion from the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, to force a shift to the government's direct lending program, increasing the government's role. 
   H.R. 2669 spends $7.1 billion on college graduates by gradually phasing down interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over four years, before allowing rates to return to the original rate in July 2012 to recover the costs of the new spending. 
   What we are voting on today does nothing address the problem facing college bound students--rising college costs. Instead of holding colleges and universities accountable for how they spend taxpayer dollars, we are doing the exact opposite. We are helping graduates, not students, and expanding the Federal government. 
   Budget gimmicks won't teach our children, and won't make college more affordable for low- to middle-income families. Until we take a real, thoughtful look at the reasons behind the skyrocketing cost of a higher education, we are simply going to continue to pass legislation that sounds good, but does little.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today in appreciation of the brave men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
   Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to tour the DEA's anti-meth lab training facility as well as the chance to briefly speak to agent trainees. Meth leaves lives destroyed and communities shaken to the core. These agents have literally devoted their lives to protect our communities and deserve our thanks for their efforts to combat the scourge of illegal drugs. 
   Though the number of meth labs in America has decreased since 2006, Mexican drug cartels are creating super labs, which produce a huge percentage of the meth in our country. This is why I introduced the Meth Kingpin Elimination Act last year, which would increase penalties on drug manufacturers and smugglers. 
   Meth abuse and production knows no borders, and I thank the instructors and students at Quantico for taking time to show us how important it truly is to win the war on drugs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, for many Americans, pulling up to the gas station is becoming a dreaded event. There have been some short-term remedies, but with prices at $4 per gallon, any relief must be paired with a broader energy plan which unlocks American resources. 
   Current U.S. policy unnecessarily keeps many areas off limits to exploration, restraining additional growth and supply. High fuel prices impact rural areas the hardest. Long commutes are a way of life, and crushing gas prices have hit farmers and ranchers in every aspect of their lives. 
   Unfortunately, several special interest groups have said no to virtually  every solution, including clean, renewable hydropower, non-emitting nuclear power, clean coal technology, wind power, and domestic exploration and development. 
   It has been over 20 years since President Ronald Reagan called on Congress to lease ANWR. It has been over 30 years since a new refinery has come on line. Since then, America has paid the price for delay, and we are paying the price every time we pull up to the pump.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 5680 is a technical corrections bill amending several laws concerning Native Americans. This bill has six substantive sections that will increase tribal economic development in several western States, Michigan and also Alaska. The bill is supported by the administration, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I must add, of course, that opening up American reserves of oil, natural gas, geothermal energy and oil shale here at home would also help economic development, not only for Native Americans, but for all Americans. 
   Rather than devoting precious hours to legislation that covers a multitude of topics, and I understand many of them are necessary, others are more discretionary, I would ask, I would plead in fact as a member of the minority, that the leadership allow us the opportunity to vote on bills that would address the shortage of energy supply in our country. 
   I will say that no single answer remains to solve our energy situation. That is why I believe so many sources of energy need to be on the table. We have heard various criticisms and various analogies, but the fact is that we need more energy supply. The economics point to that. The demands of our economy point to that. The checkbooks of every single American point to that. Households all across America, all across our economy need more access, more affordable access to energy. 
   Congress ought not point a finger at those folks who they think use too much energy. Certainly I would not tell a farmer or rancher in my district of Nebraska they are caught up in consuming too much energy in producing food for America, or feed stocks for alternative energy. It takes energy to produce energy. Yes, I understand that, and we can do better with our policies. 
   I have no additional speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we consider the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Act. According to the DEA, 33.3 kilograms of methamphetamine were seized in my home State of Nebraska in 2006. For this reason, I would like to commend the leadership and Appropriations Committee for including $85 million in funding for grant projects to address the manufacture, sale and use of methamphetamine. However, we must send a stronger message to those who are smuggling and distributing the drug, which is why I have introduced the Methamphetamine Kingpin Elimination Act of 2007. 
   The number of methamphetamine labs in the U.S. has declined since Congress enacted the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act last year to restrict the sale of pseudoephedrine, the key ingredient in methamphetamine. Unfortunately, a reverse trend has occurred south of our border. 
   Mexico is the largest foreign supplier of methamphetamine destined for the U.S. It is estimated that as much as 80 percent of the methamphetamine on U.S. streets comes from Mexico. Unlike the small U.S. kitchen labs, Mexican drug cartels are creating superlabs, which produce huge quantities of cheap methamphetamine and then smuggle it north to U.S. users. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time we stop this flood of methamphetamine coming across our border.  
   The ``Meth Kingpin Elimination Act of 2007,'' increases penalties for meth kingpins. The bill also authorizes $20 million for multi-jurisdictional methamphetamine task forces. 
   Meth devastates not only those who abuse the drug, but their families and their communities as well. The drug has a phenomenal rate of addiction, with some experts saying users often get hooked after just one use. Recent studies have demonstrated that methamphetamine causes more damage to the brain than heroin, alcohol, or cocaine. 
    Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in keeping this destructive drug off America's streets and ensuring that meth kingpins and traffickers receive harsher penalties.  
   Mr. Speaker, we must work together to address this severe problem.

The 1074th, headquartered out of North Platte, with detachments in Broken Bow, Ogallala, and Sidney, Nebraska, returned to Nebraska after a year-long deployment to Iraq. While in Iraq, the 1074th Transportation Company's primary missions were convoy security and local humanitarian support. 
   The 1074th tragically lost one of their own. Sergeant Randy J. Matheny, a native of McCook, Nebraska, made the ultimate sacrifice to his country on February 4, 2007. I join my fellow Nebraskans in offering my sincere sympathy and continued thoughts and prayers for the Matheny family. 
   The reception the 1074th received from families, friends and supporters upon their return to Nebraska was truly inspiring, as thousands, literally thousands of well-wishers welcomed these American heroes home in an incredible display of patriotism and pride. I wish to convey appreciation to the 1074th upon their safe return to Nebraska, and certainly commend Nebraskans for their amazing show of support in giving our soldiers the warm, heartfelt reception they deserve.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the serious situation many of my constituents are facing. Recently, a series of severe winter storms and ice storms, more specifically, hit Nebraska, leaving thousands in the Third District without power. 
   An expedited major disaster declaration for 57 affected counties in Nebraska, almost all in the Third District, was granted, freeing up Federal funds to assist the utility companies and local governments with the immense recovery efforts. 
   Due to the severity of the storms, thousands of constituents were without power for days and even weeks. They lost wages, food spoiled and expenses began piling up. 
   During these trying weeks, neighbors, families, friends and strangers have worked together to aid and assist those in need. Donations were made. Generators, gas, food and shelter have poured in to assist those suffering from the effects of the storm. 
   Utility linemen have been working long hours and even volunteering to repair the shattered grid system. 
   This difficult time has brought about great personal sacrifice for many Nebraskans, and I strongly commend the volunteers and donors who have come to the aid of those in need. 
   I urge my colleagues in the House, whether or not your district has been hurt, to remember these folks as we take up tax issues, the AMT and the farm bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (A QUARTERLY REPORT CARD -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be a part of this discussion here this evening, and certainly I consider it a great privilege to serve on the Budget Committee. 
   As witness after witness after witness told the Budget Committee that we should address the entitlement challenges we face and reform entitlements so that we can have a safety net, so that we can have an economy to preserve that safety net, we need to adopt some changes. And yet the budget that has been presented and is moving through the Halls of Congress does not address entitlement reform. That is my concern. That was the major thrust of the Budget Committee hearings, certainly, as I said, witness after witness addressing that. 
   But I stand here before you this evening concerned about the future. When I get asked why I would want to serve in Congress, I say it is because I care about the future. I care about the direction in which our country is heading. I believe that we need to encourage prosperity, not penalize it. And yet our tax policies are bound to penalize prosperity with the current budget. 
   We heard in the Budget Committee that we need to increase spending. More of the same. And, certainly, the supplemental, as so many folks know, this emergency supplemental spending bill contains items that are far from emergency in nature. I am afraid that there were too many politics being played in terms of funding the very necessary functions of our military so bravely serving overseas. 
   I am concerned about our future, and that is why I went to Iraq. I learned in Iraq that there are some bright spots. Certainly we have a lot of work to do. But it comes back to the economy. I am encouraged when I learn that there are more than twice as many merchant vessels traveling the one single waterway into Iraq from the gulf. I am encouraged when I see a developing police force perhaps in Ramadi. That is what contributes to the fundamentals of a sound economy with the rule of law. 
   But as we balance our policies overseas with our domestic policies here at home, we have to be mindful again of the future, the future that I believe can be bright with the sound, solid economy. 
   My friends so very eloquently pointed out the estate tax, commonly called the death tax. I can't help but think back to when I was visiting a business in my district, actually the Nation's largest producers of natural wool yarn. I didn't prompt this discussion whatsoever. But the second generation owner, or manager in this case, of this company said, Adrian, one thing you can do in serving in Congress is to reform or repeal the death tax. It will devastate us. ``Devastate'' was her word. 
   Now, one might think that the Nation's largest producer of natural wool yarn would be big business, big corporations, all these big companies that people want to beat up on who provide jobs. No, this is a family-run operation with about 45 employees that just reinvested many dollars so they could double their output, so that they could take new customers because before they invested in some expansion, they couldn't take new customers. And yet our tax policies will penalize them. 
   And, quite honestly, I don't care how large an estate one might have, I think it is wrong, fundamentally wrong, and actually unconscionable that the government would lay claim to 55 percent of an estate. Some people say, well, these wealthy folks can plan around it. Some can. Boy, you had better plan your debt too, as so many folks cannot. 
   But it all comes back to the economy. And I believe in Republican budget principles that are sound, through promoting enhanced prosperity, by balancing the budget and continuing the tax relief, through making needed reforms to entitlement programs, as our Budget Committee witnesses pointed out, increasing accountability through budget and appropriation reforms to help end Washington waste, fraud and abuse. 
   When we look, Mr. Speaker, at what is before us with the budget, it is the largest tax increase in American history: $400 billion, that is with a B, $400 billion tax increase. And my friends and I, Mr. Speaker, believe that that will be damaging to our economy. And I say that because of the facts. The facts point out that when tax relief was brought about in 2003, the unemployment rate went down. GDP went up. Jobs were created. And I find that exciting. 
   When I entered politics a few years back, I never thought that I would become so enthused about economic principles about good, sound tax policy, but I have seen what tax policy can do over these last few years, that tax relief can create jobs. Tax relief can leverage a family's dollars, hard earned dollars in our economy so that we can have good, thriving businesses in all of our districts, large and small, rural and urban. We need a good sustainable farm bill that builds on the future, that uses our experiences from the past, Mr. Speaker, in realizing that we need to build our markets with our trading partners. And we can expect good, sound trade policy, not giving away everything, and so that we can help our energy markets, we can help our agriculture markets. 
   And especially I find it so exciting about the future when we see agriculture and energy coming together. I think we need to be careful when we talk about energy. As I was reading an article the other day, Time magazine, I had an article that said eating a T-bone steak is as egregious in our environment as driving a Hummer vehicle. I found that to be quite surprising, honestly. I certainly represent an area that probably contains more cattle than any other district in the United States. And I don't bring up this issue because of that, but I think that as we address our energy needs and looking to the feature, we need good commonsense policies.     
   And that is what I want to work on because I do care about the future. I care about entitlement reform. I care about a balanced budget so that we can encourage our coming generations to focus on the future, so that they can see even more opportunity and that their prosperity is not punished through bad tax policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, although we are coming to an end to this time of discussion, I think that we all hope that promoting prosperity that has taken place over the last few years will not come to an end. And I want to very quickly point out that this is what is about to come to an end, even though it has been working, even though we have been creating jobs, even though the deficit has been cut in half actually. Despite many of these spending measures, the deficit has been cut in half over the last couple of years. But we are about to see an end to tax relief for the average family of four earning $40,000 a year of $2,052 in taxes. Taxes are going to go up. 
   The Republican budget focuses on promoting prosperity through the tax relief of $4,712 in average taxes paid by 27 million small businesses. These are small businesses. These aren't necessarily the wealthiest of the wealthy. These are common, everyday Americans working hard and growing our economy. 
   I hope that we can come back to a budget that promotes prosperity by keeping the death tax at zero through 2012, perhaps even beyond, because I believe that the government should not have the right to take 55 percent of an estate. That would be 55 percent of a ranch or a farm in my district, where we are encouraging young farmers and ranchers to engage in the business, to engage in the economy. And yet they would have to come up with cash to inherit the farm or ranch? Unconscionable. 
   I believe that we can do better. That is why I like to focus on the future and I like to focus on the future through building our economy with sound tax policy, availing capital to our entrepreneurs so that our entrepreneurs can be creative, can pursue innovation and grow jobs, becoming prosperous. And they will pay taxes. They will pay a fair amount of taxes all along the way. But let's not take too much of it and punish them.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time and bringing this bill forward today. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1025 would authorize one of the requirements of the Republican River Compact Settlement negotiated between the States of Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado and approved by the Supreme Court in 2003. It is not only necessary to ensure the States remain in compliance with this agreement, but to make certain the agriculture, industrial and domestic use of the water is carried out in the most efficient and effective manner possible. 
   The Lower Republican River Basin Study will examine how to better utilize opportunities to increase water storage in the river basin. I am hopeful the results of this study will lead to an increase in water availability while we continue to encourage more efficient water use. 
   As many of you know, especially those from the Midwest, the current water shortage has made this a very critical issue for my congressional district. So if we can, through this study, allocate more water, allocate water more effectively, it will help farmers, ranchers, municipalities both in Nebraska and Kansas in the long term. 
   I want to thank Mr. Rahall, Mr. Young, and the Natural Resources Committee staff for bringing forth this bill. I appreciate the cooperation on both sides of the aisle. I urge Members of Congress to approve this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, I rise with great concern about the proposed budget and how sustainable it is or it is not.     
   I would express it concerns me a great deal when I see the fact that 115  million taxpayers would see their taxes increase on average by almost $1,800 in 2011. I think this discussion can be healthy, and I appreciate the fact that the majority does want to keep some of the tax relief, but it needs a budget that comports with that intent. 
   It concerns me a great deal when I look at the long term when we see absolutely no change in direction from prior spending. We hear that there has been borrowing that has taken place. It has. There is no denying that. But now it seem that the option is to take more tax dollars from the taxpayers, and that is what I think will be damaging to the economy as a whole and certainly the economy of households all across America. When I look at what I see as very damaging to seniors with the dividends tax relief plan that would be cut off, that concerns me a great deal, and when I look at the impact to my State of Nebraska in the increases in taxes, I just don't see where this new budget sets a new direction. 
   We were told in the Budget Committee several times that we need fundamental reforms in entitlements, and yet this budget presents absolutely no reforms in entitlements. 
   Mr. Chairman, those are my concerns and they are concerns about the future.

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise with great concern. I rise with great concern about H.R. 4, which actually removes the negotiating process from the private sector and places it in the public sector. I rise with concern because H.R. 4 will not reduce prices. It will reduce choice. I also rise with concern because our current premiums are actually 42 percent lower than expected. 
   Mr. Speaker, the private sector is doing well in this, and I don't think we should tamper with that. Should one have to forfeit their personal choices to the lowest bidder?  
   As a representative of the great State of Nebraska, I rise in concern over H.R. 4. There are 208,040 Medicare prescription drug beneficiaries in the third district which I represent. Everyone wants to make sure that seniors get the prescription drugs they need at the lowest possible price. But, H.R. 4 will not reduce their prices, it will reduce their choices. The government should not be choosing one drug over others. 
   According to estimates by actuaries in the Congressional Budget Office and the Department of Health and Human Services, H.R. 4 would not provide substantial savings to the government or Medicare beneficiaries. The reality is that with market based principals governing Medicare Part D, premiums are actually 42 percent lower than expected levels. 
   I disagree with H.R. 4 in a fundamental philosophical way. H.R. 4 would have the government making decisions for consumers. The government would end up picking one drug over others.  
   I believe that doctors and patients should consult with each other on what medications will best address patients' needs. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 4. Constituents of Nebraska's Third District and throughout the United States deserve to have their doctor's choices of prescription medication protected. Should one have to forfeit their personal choices to the lowest bidder?

   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, since being elected to Congress, I have had the opportunity to speak with young students throughout the Third District of Nebraska. They are smart and sharp, and we need to do everything we can to encourage them. Unfortunately, however, many rural States have seen what we call ``brain drain'' in recent years. As the depletion occurs, we lose our most vital economic asset to more populated areas. Responsible policy is needed to retain and grow our workforce to make our rural communities more competitive in this modern economy. 
   The College Opportunity and Affordability Act seeks to address this by encouraging economic development partnerships. These partnerships would be formed between rural colleges and universities and rural employers. This would provide additional career training to students attending rural schools in fields significant to the local economy. It also would encourage rural businesses to employ students once they graduate. 
   I thank the chairman and ranking member for working with me to target these partnerships to the areas in the most need.

   Even now, people in Nebraska and throughout our country are looking beyond the horizon for new ways to strengthen and grow our small, rural communities. We owe it to them to do everything in our power to foster these new ideas. 
   We live in a world with unlimited innovation, and I look forward to seeing what the future will bring from further research and development. 
   I urge the House leadership to bring H.R. 2138, the Investment in America Act, to the floor as soon as possible.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. (ENERGY BILL AND OUR ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, one needs to look no further than the headlines in our Nation's newspapers to see the consequences of doing nothing with regard to the energy crisis facing our Nation. 
   We have stood idly by while skyrocketing fuel and energy prices undercut consumer confidence and are partially responsible for our current economic straits. But instead of passing a comprehensive energy bill in which all forms of energy were on the table, last week we took up legislation which will not only prove ineffective, but I believe counterproductive. 
   It was a bill written behind closed doors, with no input from Republicans, and even many Democrats wishing to participate. It bypassed the Natural Resources Committee and was brought to the floor under a closed rule, freezing out members of both parties, all after a promise of the most open Congress in history. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's not make the same mistake this week. We still have time. Bring the American Energy Act to the floor for a vote before we adjourn, and we can help address the crisis facing our Nation.
