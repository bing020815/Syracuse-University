<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Chairman, I stand in opposition to the so-called Employee Free Choice Act, H.R. 800, and ask my fellow colleagues to join with me in supporting every worker's right to a secret ballot. I am appalled that this House would bring forth legislation that eliminates free speech and contradicts our system of democracy. H.R. 800 goes against the principles hard-working Americans stand for: openness, fairness, and freedom.  The United States Congress is charged with upholding the Constitution, not undermining it. 
   I have the honor of representing the Fourth District of Kansas, which includes Wichita and is the air capital of the world--home to Cessna, Hawker-Beech, Bombardier LearJet, the Boeing Company, Spirit Aerosystems, and scores of small aviation machine shops and supplies. It is a leading center of aviation research, training, manufacturing and modification. 
   During my time in Congress, I have had the privilege to work closely with the machinist and engineer union members on common goals and concerns--from the extension of jobless benefits to securing the continuation of the E-4B modification program, which will support many union jobs in south-central Kansas. I know the value that unions bring to workers, their families, and a community. I will continue to fight for my district, and support every Wichita worker. 
   H.R. 800, which some have aptly termed the ``worker intimidation act,'' would limit the choices of employees in Kansas. This legislation would replace the fair, time-honored, government-sponsored secret ballot elections with an inherently corruptible card signing system. Employees should have the right to decide on unionization in a non-coercive environment. I am shocked and dismayed that the Democrat majority would act so recklessly as to remove the fundamental and basic labor rights of free choice and free election from our hard-working men and women. Every worker has a fundamental right to a secret ballot. Congress does not have a right to take that away. 
   In the card-check system proposed in this bill, workers would be publicly pressured--before friends, co-workers and union organizers--to sign a card. Once labor union bosses get a simple majority of employee-signed cards, the union would be formed. There is no ballot and no democratic system. Almost one-half of all employees would never be given a chance to say whether they want to join a union. H.R. 800 takes away their voice. 
   Currently, 28 States do not have ``right-to-work'' laws; meaning that once union organizers have a simple majority of check-cards, all employees, without a right to vote or express their views, would be forced to pay union dues. Then, on top of this insult, newly unionized members would not be guaranteed the right to vote on the new union contract. 
   H.R. 800 also strikes our first amendment right to freedom of speech. This legislation would bar employers from telling their employees about the true consequences of unionization. It is unconscionable that Congress would violate the first amendment and limit the access to information by employees. Some Democrats in this House believe that workers are not capable of making a decision when presented all the facts. Every worker should be insulted by the underlying premise of this legislation. 
   At this point, if anyone still questions whether H.R. 800 would help or hurt workers, let me point out that this legislation would make it illegal for employers to give increases of pay or benefits during the card-check process. Proponents of the legislation say that increased benefits could influence the process. However, let me be on the record as saying that I will always support a company's right to increase the pay and benefits of its employees. A couple weeks ago, this House voted to increase the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years--an increase which I support. However, to now vote to ban a company from increasing wages on its own accord is hypocritical. I have yet to find one worker who did not want a pay raise. 
   In addition to restricting pay raises, this legislation will have a dramatic and dangerous impact on jobs across this Nation. Small business owners create up to 80 percent of all new jobs in this country. This legislation will limit the growth of small businesses and drive these good paying jobs overseas. Many in the Democrat party pay lip-service to wanting to stop the exodus of American jobs overseas, but, if enacted, H.R. 800 will actually encourage employers to relocate their businesses. 
   Giving employees less choice, killing the right to a secret ballot, keeping employees from critical information, making it illegal to provide increased benefits, driving jobs overseas. Does this sound like the United States of America? These are the real results of this ill-conceived, politically motivated bill. 
   This begs the question, why would labor unions and their allies push for such an antiworker and undemocratic bill? The official reason is that because employers are illegally coercing employees to not join a union; that union organizers are illegally fired or punished. Regrettably this activity has taken place to some degree. In 2005, there were 62 cases in which companies had illegally fired a worker for union organizing activities--62. In a country of 140 million workers. And, as I said, this is already illegal. Employers should be, and are, held responsible for all illegal activities. However, a few bad actors should not result in the destruction of a cornerstone of our Nation's union laws.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (HONORING CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT JACKSON A. WINSETT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding United States Air Force Reserve senior noncommissioned officer, Chief Master Sergeant Jackson A. Winsett, upon his retirement from Air Force Reserve after more than 28 years of honorable service. 
   Throughout his career, Chief Master Sergeant Winsett served with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has provided the Air Force Reserve and our Nation. 
   Chief Master Sergeant Winsett is a native of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and currently lives in Lenexa, Kansas. He entered the United States Army in October 1966. 
   His assignments took him to the Republic of Vietnam and the Federal Republic of Germany where he served his Nation as an administrative and personnel assistant. In September 1969, Chief Master Sergeant Winsett was honorably discharged from the United States Army as a Sergeant E-5. 
   Chief Master Sergeant Winsett joined the United States Air Force Reserve in October 1981 as an administrative specialist in the 442nd Fighter Wing, Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri. During his tenure with this organization, he served in numerous positions, including a 2-year assignment as the consolidated base personnel office career adviser, 2 years as the unit career adviser for the 442nd Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, 4 years as the first sergeant for the 442nd Combat Support Group, 7 years as the first sergeant for the 442nd Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, 2 years as the senior enlisted adviser for the 442nd Fighter Wing, and 2 years as the command chief master sergeant for the 442nd Fighter Wing. 
   Chief Master Sergeant Winsett applied for and was selected in July 2000 to be the command chief master sergeant for headquarters, 10th Air Force, at Naval Air Station, Joint Reserve Base, Fort Worth, Texas. 
   During this assignment, which increased in scope and responsibility, Chief Winsett was responsible for providing advice on personnel matters concerning the welfare, effective use, and progress of the 10,000-member enlisted force to the 10th Air Force Command. 
   Chief Master Sergeant Winsett most recently served as the command chief master sergeant at headquarters, Air Force Reserve Command Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, where he continued his personal tradition of excellence, service and integrity. Through frequent communications, Chief Winsett maintained liaison between the commander of the United States Air Force Reserve Command and the 60,000-plus member enlisted force and key staff members. 
   He communicated to the commander problems and solutions, concerns, morale and attitude of the enlisted force, and ensured the commander's policies were known and understood by them. 
   Additionally, Chief Master Sergeant Winsett evaluated the quality of noncommissioned officer leadership, management and supervision. He monitored compliance with various Air Force instructions, including conduct and performance standards. Within his functional area, he issued directives and other guidance ensuring policy compliance. 
   During his incredible career, Chief Master Sergeant Winsett has served the United States Air Force Reserve and our great Nation with excellence and distinction. He provided exemplary leadership to the best trained and best prepared enlisted citizen-airmen force in the history of the United States. 
   Chief Master Sergeant Winsett is a model of leadership and a living example of our military's dedication to our safety and security entrusted to them by each of us. 
   Chief Master Sergeant Winsett will retire from the United States Air Force Reserve on March 7, 2007, after 28 years and 3 months of dedicated service. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Chief Master Sergeant Winsett the very best. Congratulations on completion of an outstanding and successful career.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (TANKER SHOULD BE BUILT BY AMERICANS -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, we should all be deeply troubled by last week's decision by the Air Force to choose a French-built air refueling tanker. 
   The European Aeronautics Defense and Space Team, known as EADS, found a front American company, Northrup Grumman, to bid their foreign-built tanker. When the Air Force chose this French tanker, they chose to outsource our national security and to send American jobs overseas.  
   This contract award has rightly created outrage all across the United States. It is just another example, and perhaps the best example, of how our own government is putting the United States at an economic disadvantage. At a time of economic insecurity, it is mind-boggling that the Department of Defense would send at a minimum 19,000 jobs overseas. 
   We should have an American tanker built by an American company with American workers. Instead, the Air Force awarded this contract for a French tanker built by Europeans. How could this happen? Well, first, the Department of Defense has created an unlevel playing field that favored foreign companies. We should have known something was wrong when the replacement for Marine I, the President's helicopter, was awarded to a European company. If that wasn't enough, we should have known it was fixed in favor of foreign companies when the Army awarded a French company the contract to build the light utility helicopter. The light utility helicopter is for domestic use here in America, awarded to a French company. And, now, the third big contract in a row goes to a French company to build a French tanker. 
   First it was the Presidential helicopter went to a foreign company, then it was the light utility helicopter went to a foreign company, and now our air-refueling tanker. We need an American tanker built by American companies with American workers. The Air Force rules do not consider the loss of American jobs. The Air Force rules do not consider illegal subsidies given to foreign companies. The Air Force rules do not consider that NATO allies, the French company, do not have to comply with the same American regulations as American contractors do. The Air Force does not consider the loss of Federal revenue, because French workers do not pay American taxes. But the Air Force will have to consider the outrage of outsourcing our national defense. 
   The Air Force will have to consider that we need an American tanker built by American companies with American workers. To help the Department of Defense and the Air Force understand this nationwide outrage, I have set up an online petition that all Americans can participate in. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to go to the Web site, www.House.gov/Tiahrt, and sign a petition expressing their own outrage at outsourcing our national security and outsourcing American jobs. 
   We need an American tanker built by an American company with American workers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Madam Speaker, Washington is broken and it needs to be changed. This rule is poorly devised and the underlying bill is poorly conceived. This bill did not go through the committee process, it is unprecedented and it violates the intent of the rules of the House. 
   Why is this important, Madam Speaker? Well, the American people would not allow the Democrat leadership to cancel the next election. The American people would not allow one person to determine who our next President is going to be; but on a smaller scale, that is exactly what has happened on this bill. 
   The Speaker of the House has determined what is in this bill, not the appropriate committee. An election was cancelled. There was no vote. The representatives of the people did not have a voice in this process. We did not have any committee hearings. This is not the democratic process. Washington is broken and it needs to be changed. 
   The rule accepts this violation of our own House rules, that's why I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule because Washington is broken and it needs to be changed. We have to change the process here because Washington is broken and it needs to be changed.

   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, Washington is broken and it needs to be changed. This bill has been excluded from the normal rules and regulations of the House, and America's Representatives have not had their voices heard or their rights allowed. It would be a totally different bill if we had not violated the House rules and let the committee process work. Washington is broken and we need to have it changed.     
   For example, if we had committee meetings, we would not have had a tax increase in here. We have a huge tax increase in this bill that affects small business owners. Eighty percent or 83 percent of the taxes here, of the people that are going to be taxed here, are small businessmen. 
   Now, in Kansas, just like a lot of America, four out five jobs are created by small businesses. And for those of  you that have not been reading the newspaper, our country is in a period of slow growth. This is exactly the time we need to strengthen small businesses, instead of punishing them through this bill. Eighty-three percent of the people punished in this bill are people that are creating jobs. 
   If we'd had a committee process, we may not have added in other ancillary issues into this idea. Instead, we would have had a clean bill that would address the needs of our young men and women who are faithfully serving this Nation, protecting our families, take the fight to the enemy and helping us keep this country safe. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, Washington is broken and it needs to be changed. We have avoided the committee process and because of that, there are portions of this bill that could have been improved, portions of it that could have been improved for our veterans that have served so faithfully, come home to us broken, people we need to take care of. But because the committee was not involved in this process, we have not had the ability to improve this care for those who have done so much for us. The reason is, Mr. Speaker, is because Washington is broken and it needs to be changed. 
   We need to use the committee process. The committee process is a very important part of this. It's been violative of our own House rules. Washington is broken and it needs to be changed.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to protest the Democrat Leadership's dictatorial tactics. Our Founding Fathers, in their infinite wisdom, created a system of government by which the people's voice would be heard in legislative decisions, especially those affecting the use of their hard earned taxpayer dollars. The House of Representatives has the awesome responsibility to represent the will of the people, and for that reason, under the Constitution of the United States, spending bills originate in this body. What we have here today, however, is the suppression of the people's voice. This bill is brought to the floor without consideration by the committee of jurisdiction whose chairmen didn't even have input and without true consideration by the House with a lockdown rule that does not allow for consideration of amendments or a substitute bill. Democrat and Republican Members have been shut out of this process. 
   This bill contains funding for the men and women who protect this nation at home and abroad--yet the defense subcommittee which holds hearings year round about their needs has not been consulted. This bill contains funding for our nation's veterans, yet again the subcommittee that best understands their needs has not been consulted. This bill contains funding for domestic priorities and yet again the subcommittees of jurisdiction have not been consulted. 
   Why is the Speaker of the House opposed to allowing the House of Representatives have their say? I can only assume it is that she knows the American people would reject this irresponsible use of their hard earned tax dollars. This bill takes $250 billion out of the pockets of American workers. $250 billion. That cannot be taken lightly. Families across this nation are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of gas, rising food prices, rising education costs, etc. The people must have a say in whether this is a wise use of their money. 
   I strongly support our troops, as do my constituents, yet we are not given a chance to have a say in how to best supply them. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to stand up for their constituents and demand that we have a say. Vote against the bill and force the Democrat Leadership to bring this bill through regular order.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and give recognition to the life and continued service of the honorable Wesley E. Brown, United States District Court judge for the District of Kansas. 
   Since Judge Brown's appointment to the Federal bench by President John F. Kennedy in 1962, Judge Brown has served his beloved State of Kansas and this Nation with great distinction. And after 45 years of service on the bench, Judge Brown continues to serve as a senior judge, coming in each morning and carrying a full caseload. In fact, the Federal courthouse in Wichita could not manage its caseload without Judge Brown's service and his commitment. 
   Prior to his judicial appointment by President Kennedy, Judge Brown managed to work his way through law school by taking classes at night in Kansas City while working during the day assembling model A cars for the Ford Motor Company. After losing his job at Ford during the Great Depression, he served as Reno County Attorney in Kansas and later enlisted in the United States Navy to serve in World War II as a lieutenant, stationed at Commander Philippines Sea Frontier. 
   Today I have the honor of introducing a House resolution which not only recognizes Judge Brown's distinguished service to our Nation as the longest-serving Federal judge in Kansas, but also celebrates his 100th birthday today. 
   Judge Brown, your State of Kansas and this Nation wishes you a very happy birthday today and thanks you for your continuing service.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Chairman, I rise today to offer my support for H.R. 5715, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act. As many of my colleagues are, no doubt, aware, the rupture of the housing bubble in this nation has had a ripple effect across our economy. The student loan industry has not been immune to these economic difficulties. In fact, in recent months, 57 providers of student loans have announced that they will no longer offer loans to students. This legislation is a good effort on the part of Congress to address this situation. 
   We should delude ourselves by believing that this legislation is a panacea, bringing a complete solution to the circumstances we find ourselves in today. By and large, the lending market will need to take actions of its own to right the tottering ship. These efforts are things that Congress is not, and should not be, in the business of mandating. But this legislation does take steps to protect students and their families by providing assurances that the opportunities to finance a college education are not jeopardized while the lending market is in flux. 
   Presently, experts in the field are unsure that the situation is, in fact, a ``crisis,'' pointing to a number of additional factors that may have contributed to the narrowing of the market. We will not know for several more months, when requests for student loans reach their peak, just how serious a problem we are facing. That is exactly the reason this legislation is the correct approach. It takes preventive steps to ensure that funding is available to students and their parents, if a crisis does arise. It does not create new mandates, but instead gives the Secretary of Education the authority to address potential problems. 
   Ensuring access to affordable student loans is of great importance to this nation, to our economy, and to our millions of students in college. I appreciate the efforts of Mr. McKeon and Mr. Miller to bring this legislation to the floor in such a timely manner, and hope that this bill will be enough to stave off larger problems down the road.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, America needs to secure its own sources of energy, be it from oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear renewable or other sources. A strong, vibrant economy with well-paying jobs goes along with it. It's inextricably linked with reliable and preferably inexpensive energy sources. 
   Sadly, as Mr. Peterson points out, we pay more now for natural gas than we ever have before in the history of this Nation. If we want to help workers and businesses that employ workers, we must continue to build and strengthen our economy and provide them with reliable energy resources. 
   If we want to have high-quality, high-paying jobs in America, and I think we all do, then we are going to need additional energy, and we are going to need additional natural gas. Do we have the resources? Yes, we have the resources. Can we produce it safely? Yes, we can produce it safely. 
   We have been producing gas, natural gas, in Kansas for over 100 years. Natural gas is very versatile. You can make so much from it. You can make fertilizer, you can make make-up, clothing, plastics, ethanol. But we mostly use it to produce energy or electricity, energy in the form of electricity. 
   I think when we look at this issue, we have to figure out, are we going to make energy available inexpensively, and, if we are, we are going to have to go to where the reserves are. This amendment opens up an area for us to produce natural gas, or it can be produced safely, and it's going to be essential if we are going to continue to grow our economy. 
   So I urge the adoption of Mr. Peterson's amendment, because I think we know that we have proven reserves that can produce safely, natural gas. This is the time for us to send this message to America, that we are going to continue to build a strong economy, and we are going to give our economy the tools necessary to produce the jobs we need to continue to provide the hope and a source for continuing to complete dreams here at home. 
   I urge strong support of this amendment.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are some people on their way down here that wanted to talk about a very important issue related to the Department of Agriculture related to Payment in Lieu of Taxes, which is an issue that has been very important to many members of the committee, especially the Western Caucus. And in that problem we have seen several charts that have been brought forward. One of them showed all of the Federal lands that are in the Western States and because of those Federal lands, they are unable to assess taxes for their local communities and including their schools. 
   So at this point in time, it seems like it is a very pertinent time for us to deal with the PILT issue. And I know, Mr. Chairman, when we heard testimony about Payment in Lieu of Taxes, it was a great hardship on the local communities, especially the schools. 
   We should give our Members an opportunity to talk about their particular communities and the needs that they have. I think it is important for us to think about how we are going to make an equitable situation for these Western States where they have problems in those areas.

Some of these local communities have had very difficult times.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, Chairman Dicks is to be commended for the reasonable manner in which he has conducted the business of the Interior Appropriations Committee and the personal consideration he has given me in my role as ranking member. It is a reflection of the experience he received while waiting 30 years to become chairman. We should all recognize the patience and expertise that Mr. Dicks brings to the floor of the House. 
   Mr. Chairman, the subcommittee's work this year has been a bipartisan collaborative effort. But in spite of the comity reflected in much of the subcommittee's work, the minority does have genuine policy differences with the Democratic majority and a divergence of views over the level of funding necessary to address the critical needs of this bill. 
   Our 38 subcommittee hearings revealed many unmet needs and urgent priorities. Still, while we have an obligation to be good stewards of our Nation's environment and public lands for future generations, we also have an obligation to be good stewards of our tax dollars. In that respect, I believe this legislation falls short. 
   The 302(b) allocation for this bill is $27.6 billion, a $1.9 billion increase over the President's budget increase and a $1.2 billion increase over the enacted fiscal year 2007 Interior bill. The enacted fiscal year 2007 Interior bill itself was $400 million over what the House passed last fall. 
   The initial subcommittee allocation, which was $858 million above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level, though very generous, would have resulted, I believe, in a better, more balanced bill. The additional $335 million added to the subcommittee's already charitable allocation is simply unnecessary, and, more importantly, unsustainable. No matter how well-intentioned, this overly generous allocation will cause many of the same problems down the road that this subcommittee has been trying to resolve in recent years, namely, huge backlogs in operations and maintenance. 
   The circumstance is, in many respects, similar to the homeowner who receives a big bonus and uses these extra funds to buy a bigger house for his family. The bigger bonus is welcome and unexpected. Buying a bigger house seems like a great idea at the time. But down the road he realizes he can't depend on getting a bonus every year, and he finds himself unable to afford living in this new house. He, like this subcommittee, risks becoming overextended and unable to pay the bills. The difference is the homeowner goes bankrupt and a new owner takes over. The government fails to keep up with the new property, and the property soon becomes listed on a maintenance backlog. 
   It is human nature that we want to create new programs to build new structures, to buy new land. Yet it seems no one worries about the future cost of maintaining them. Over the years, this subcommittee has learned through good oversight that too little money can do real harm. The same is true for too much money. 
   We believe that the subcommittee should strive for a balance, and that is precisely what the original subcommittee allocation achieved. We ought to provide enough money to allow the agencies to carry out their primary mission. We should focus on taking care of what we presently have in the public trust. We have to give careful, thoughtful consideration before purchasing something new. Again, we must strive for balance. As this bill goes on to conference with the Senate, I am hopeful that the majority will be sensitive and responsive to this challenge. 
   In many areas this legislation has achieved balance. I applaud Chairman Dicks for his focus on the operating accounts within this bill. There has clearly been an erosion in this area, due in part to the absorption of the pay and fixed costs over the years. However, I believe the subcommittee should move more cautiously in providing funds for new land acquisition and construction. While there are high priority needs in these areas, it is important that we focus on the core mission of these agencies and not become overextended. 
   The subcommittee risks creating a larger problem down the road by hastily expanding current areas that we cannot oversee or creating new ones that we cannot maintain. Many will recall that when Congress provided these agencies with too much funding too quickly in the early to mid-nineties, they lost focus. The result was a huge backlog, redundant programs and large unobligated balances, many of which still remain, and numerous operational shortfalls. Our job is to provide for core needs, be vigilant about oversight, and avoid the mistakes of the past. 
   I recognize that Chairman Dicks and Chairman Obey have a special place in their heart for the great open spaces of this country, and I know that they appreciate the grandeur of our national parks; and I join both chairmen in support of the $198 million increase in the operations budget for the National Park Service. 
   I am also very pleased with the needed attention in this bill that it provides to the Native Americans. There are many unmet needs in Indian country, in education, healthcare, law enforcement, methamphetamine treatment and other areas; and this bill does a great deal to address those priorities. I also believe it is critically important to restore full funding for Urban Indian Health Clinics, and this bill does exactly that. 
   While this bill is positive in many respects, I would be remiss if I didn't outline several specific areas where I would have written the bill differently. The fire season is upon us once again and catastrophic fires out west are again commanding national headlines, like the South Lake Tahoe fire just yesterday. It is appropriate that this bill provides additional funding for wildfire preparedness at the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service. 
   Subcommittee hearings this year demonstrated that there is a great interest and great concern over the ongoing wildfire suppression challenge which is presently burning up about 45 percent of the Forest Service budget. In light of the large subcommittee allocation and the tremendous anticipated need during this fire season, I think the subcommittee could have done even more to address fire preparedness and fire suppression problems, because being prepared can avoid the need for fire suppression.     
   Mr. Chairman, while reasonable people may disagree over the cause, there is clearly a need for more focused science on climate change. I believe  Chairman Dicks would agree that our response to climate change must look at long-term solutions rather than simply trying to provide for a quick fix. 
   The USGS is the science agency for the Department of the Interior, and I believe they should manage any additional funds directed to address this issue for the department. While I have the greatest respect for Chairman Dicks, I am concerned about the inclusion of the global climate change sense of Congress resolution in this bill. My concern is based on the simple fact that it does not reflect a consensus opinion of many climate change experts who testified before the subcommittee this year. It proposes conclusions and solutions to a problem that is not yet fully understood. Historically, mandatory market-based limits suggested in the language simply have not worked. 
   I believe we need to make wise, science-based decisions rather than merely respond to the heated rhetoric of political dialogue of the day. 
   As one agency scientist testified this year, our greatest need is to focus on the gaps in credible scientific information. Without understanding the complete scientific data, we will be unable to solve the problems created by climate change, and it will create a false hope presenting bad solutions to the wrong problems. 
   America needs to secure its own sources of energy, be it from oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear, renewable or other sources. A strong and vibrant economy and the well-paying jobs that go along with it are closely linked to reliable and preferably inexpensive energy sources. 
   If we want to help American working families to continue to build and strengthen our economy, we must provide them with the tools they need to pursue reliable sources of energy. I believe responsible use of our resources is precisely the right course. The approximately 43 million outer continental shelf acres under lease generally account for 20 percent of America's domestic natural gas. To address the growing demand for domestic sources of natural gas, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson) last year offered a commonsense amendment in full committee which was supported on a bipartisan basis. 
   Republicans and Democrats alike agreed that the United States needed to lessen its dependence on foreign sources of natural gas. Mr. Peterson will soon be offering the same amendment on the House floor, and I urge its adoption. 
   Many heard me say over the past few months how fortunate I have been to be selected as the ranking member of the Interior, Environment Appropriations Subcommittee. Not only do I have the privilege of working with Chairman Dicks, but I have had the pleasure of working with a fine appropriations committee staff. 
   First, I would like to thank Debbie Weatherly and Dave LesStrang here beside me on the Republican staff for all of their hard work and dedication not only to crafting this bill, but also preparing me for this new subcommittee in this inaugural role as ranking member. This spring would have been a very difficult learning process but for their guidance. 
   Many of you know Debbie and her impeccable stewardship of this appropriations bill during the Republican majority. She is also one of the most beloved and respected committee staffers I have ever come across. The fact that Members across the aisle continue to consult her is a testament to her depth of knowledge. I have appreciated all of the time she has spent with me over the past few months. I know that her husband, Glenn, has missed her, and I am glad he will soon get to see her more often. 
   I am also extremely grateful to Dave LesStrang who has taken on Interior Appropriations as part of his portfolio for Mr. Lewis. Like Debbie, Dave is one of the most respected and well-liked staffers on the Capitol campus. I thank Mr. Lewis, and especially Dave's wife, Elaine, and his sons Matthew and Michael for their patience in allowing him to spend so much time on the important work of this subcommittee. 
   Let me also commend Steve Crane of the minority staff for his guidance on issues related to offshore oil and gas drilling. Steve's expertise on these issues is exceeded only by his knowledge of anything related to the Boston Red Sox. 
   I am also grateful to the majority staff led by Mike Stephens. They have been cooperative and effective in not only crafting this bill, but also in helping me and my staff become acquainted with the Interior, Environment appropriations process. The entire Interior staff is to be commended for fostering a spirit of teamwork in crafting this legislation. Chris Topik, Delia Scott, Greg Knadle, Beth Houser, and Martin Brockman are bright, friendly, dedicated and among the most knowledgeable staffers on the Hill. I am pleased that once this bill is passed, they will finally have a weekend to themselves. 
   I would be remiss if I did not also point out the many contributions of Pete Modaff and Kelli Shilito of Chairman Dicks' staff, as well as Jeff Kahrs, AmyClaire Brusch, and Melissa James of my own staff. 
   In closing, Mr. Chairman, while I have real policy differences and spending concerns related to this legislation, it is our hope that between now and the conference negotiations with the Senate later this year, we can address those issues of disagreement and seek a bipartisan consensus on a reasonable, sustainable subcommittee allocation. Our sincere desire is to work with Chairman Dicks to fashion a responsible, balanced conference report worthy of broad bipartisan support. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I think that the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) has made a good point and reinforced what I was saying in my opening statement that we can get overextended in the Park Service and acquire more than we can take care of. 
   The beautiful building that he used in his example provides a wonderful purpose is now closed because we have not been able to maintain it. My concern, in getting overextended, is that we build new buildings and acquire new land that we are unable to maintain and we get into the same problem that we're trying to correct today. 
   So I thank the gentleman for offering his amendment, and I think it makes a valid point.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman from Washington will yield, I thank the gentlewoman from Kansas for bringing this to the attention of the House. This is a very important issue. 
   The community of Treece has been trying to bring this issue to resolution for years. In fact, it was over a decade ago when it first came to my attention, and I had a staff member working on it for some time. I am pleased that the gentlewoman is carrying on the work of her predecessor, Congressman Jim Ryun, and other Kansas officials. Earlier this year, State Representative Gatewood came to my office and asked for some help with the Office of Surface Mining, and we still have the request pending from them as well. 
   According to the estimates for the State of Kansas, it will cost approximately $8 million to conduct a buyout program, which is not a lot of money in the scheme of things. While we understand that the bill which we are debating today cannot address the buyout program, we both hope that the EPA will speed its approval of the funding to remove the chat and hope that other Federal resources will come to bear to help the people of Treece find relief through a similar buyout program. 
   I am also hopeful that the OSM and the Army Corps of Engineers will also help the residents in their struggle to improve their communities.

   Mr. TIAHRT. I just wanted to mention to the chairman and to the House that even though this is a sense of Congress, I think that it is opposed enough in the way it is worded that the amendment should be agreed to and the language should be stricken. For example, in the very beginning, where, number one, it says, ``greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere are causing average temperatures to rise at a rate outside the range of natural variability,'' we had a lot of testimony in this Subcommittee of Interior about this very issue. It was very clear that the scientists that study this say that we have large gaps in the scientific data, and it is still inconclusive. 
   One of the great examples of this is the ocean itself. The ocean itself is a carbon bank. It retains carbon sometimes. When it gets warmer, it actually allows carbon to go up into the atmosphere in the form of CO  
   2. That in itself brings the question whether carbon in our atmosphere is a cause of heat or whether heat is a cause of carbon in the air. If you look at the core samples that are found in the Antarctic which have been drilled down to go back and date what our environment was like hundreds of thousands of years ago, we find that there is a high carbon content in our atmosphere when our earth was warmer. And we do know that our earth is getting warmer. In fact, 10,000 years ago, Kansas was covered by a sheet of ice. 
   Just a weekend ago or so, I was back there playing golf, and I can tell you for sure, there is no ice covering the State of Kansas today. Why? Because the earth is getting warmer. But for us to say that the cause is human-induced raises the question. Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change when they looked at it this year, revised their estimate of the ocean going up because of climate change, from going up to 36 inches. They revised it downward to only going up 17 inches. So that means that they were half off. 
   They said that, as far as climate change, it's human-induced, and they have a 90 percent confidence level. Well, if that's based on their estimate of what the water level is going to be 10 years or 50 years from now, then they are admittedly 50 percent off, so that means they've only got a 45 percent confidence level. That means less than half. 
   My point is that there is no growing scientific consensus on the cause of climate change. In fact, it may be a normal cycle that we're going through. And, in fact, it may be a cycle that is moving us into a cooler climate rather than a warmer climate. So this language, I think, makes assumptions that are based on data that is inconclusive. The scientists tell us there are gaps in the data. It certainly isn't a consensus of Congress from my view. So I would think that we should adopt the gentleman's amendment. 
   I would yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. TIAHRT. I agree that the temperature is going up. It's the cause that is a concern for me. The wording here says that we already know what the cause is and we should move forward and try to do something to stop it, and that includes some very drastic types of actions, including caps and market-based limits on incentives, mandatory market-based limits, I might say. It's my view that those things have not been successful in the past. In fact, when we did mandatory limits, I thought we ended up with gas lines and higher gas prices. That's my view. 
   I would ask that my colleagues here in the House accept this amendment and vote for it.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The administration proposed the rule, and the reason for it is simple, and it is to provide incentives and to encourage industry to lower emissions. It reminds me of the story when the Kansan went over across the river to visit Missouri. 
   The story goes that he took the ferry across, and he was picked up by a gentleman who had a cart with a mule in front of it. The gentleman was dangling a carrot in front of the mule. The mule would move forward, and that incentive got the mule to move. 
   So he went down to the courthouse in Saint Joseph, and he conducted his business. Then he went back out to get a ride back to the ferry, and there was another gentleman with a cart and a mule. So he hopped in the back of the cart and he said, I would like to go back to the ferry. 
   And the mule skinner said, ``Giddyap,'' and the mule did not move. So he got out of the car and he pulled out a 2 by 4, and he whacked the mule in the head. The guy from Kansas said, ``well, why'd you do that.'' He said, ``well, I had to get the mule's attention.'' He got back in the cart, and he said, ``Giddyap.'' 
   The man from Kansas said, ``Wouldn't it have been better if you gave the mule an incentive, like a carrot,'' and he explained the whole story. 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, the companies have no incentives under the old Clinton policy to reduce pollution, because once designated as a major source, they are always designated as a major source. As a result, companies are stuck at certain levels of pollution and  not provided with any incentive, no carrot whatsoever to lower their emissions below that level. 
   Over the last decade, pollution prevention methods have changed, and many companies are now embracing the economics of environmental protection. EPA is currently reviewing the public comments on this proposed rule, and we should allow that process to move forward. 
   The bottom line is, if there is even a chance that this proposed rule would encourage more sources to strive for additional reductions of toxic air pollution with these new incentives, then we should encourage that action. 
   I therefore urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. I am also a fiscal conservative, but I think this amendment is misdirected. We should not limit the funds to do proper forest management on the Tongass. 
   Some limited road building is needed to take care of the land. The Tongass National Forest is, indeed, a wonderful place. But under the existing forest management, approximately 90 percent of the 16.8 million acre forest, over 15 million acres is roadless and undeveloped. 
   Only 4 percent of the forest is suitable for commercial timber harvest, and only half of that area is within the inventoried roadless areas. 
   The amendment would prevent the Forest Service from doing road maintenance on a large area of southeast Alaska. Most of these communities have no road access to the outside world, but they need the Forest Service roads to get around during their daily activities. 
   This amendment would also harm a variety of forestry, recreation and wildlife conservation activities by preventing the proper road maintenance. The existing forest plan allows timber harvest on only 300,000 acres, only about 2 percent of the more than 15 million total acres of roadless area on the forest. 
   I have a letter here from the United States Department of Agriculture, and it's from a person called the forest supervisor up in Tongass. He said we have heard the figure today that there was $40 million lost each year. He says from fiscal year 2005 to 2006, the Tongass spent $2.4 million less on roads, reducing the level from $10 million to $7.8 million; from 2006 to 2007, the program reduced further to $6.1 million. All told, over the past 3 years, the forest has cut spending by $4.1 million to less than 50 percent. 
   So I don't know where the $40 million per year figure came from when they are only spending $6.1 million this year on the roads. In addition, when you add up all the jobs, according to the Forest Service, it's about 1,000 jobs that are at risk with this legislation. 
   This, by also prohibiting roads, also makes the forest more vulnerable to forest fires. So if you love the forest, if you love the bounty, if you love the beauty, then oppose this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Alaska.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, at the end of the day, I was sent to Congress in November 1994 because the people of the 4th congressional district of Kansas believed in the message of less Government spending, personal and corporate responsibility and lower taxes. Therefore, I remain committed to those who  sent me here and opposed to the unprecedented power that would be given to the Federal Government through this bill. 
   Last week, the Treasury Secretary came to Congress with a message: he needed $700 billion and he needed it now. I understand the need to act and the need to act quickly. At that time, however, I stood with my Republican colleagues and opposed the hasty call for an unprecedented blank check to the Federal Government. 
   Over the weekend, Congress negotiated with the Secretary to work out a better proposal through several non-government based approaches. Some of the provisions I could support but the fact remains that a $700 billion bailout of Wall Street is too much for our taxpayers to bear. 
   On Monday, I joined with a majority of my Republican and Democrat colleagues to defeat this short-sighted fix that exposed Americans everywhere to long-term debt that could lead to an even greater financial crisis. 
   Not wanting to be outdone, the Senate quietly inserted over a billion dollars worth of pork: $148 million for wool fabric producers, $2 million for the makers of wooden arrows for children, and a $100 million tax break to benefit NASCAR racetracks. Even Hollywood got a tax break gift worth nearly half a billion dollars. 
   What was a three-page idea had grown in a week to more than 450 pages. 
   What it comes down to is that a $700 or $800 billion bailout with voluntary reforms was not a plan I could support. Worse yet, Sec. 112 of the Senate bill, allows foreign financial institutions who hold troubled assets as a result of extending financing to financial institutions that have failed or defaulted on such financing to participate in this massive Government bail-out. What does this mean? Simply, the Federal Government has invited foreign financiers to participate in this bailout on behalf of every American. 
   However, my decision today to oppose the Senate bill does not come easily. Many of us lost savings. Many employers expressed concerns about access to credit so they could make payroll for their workers. I heard from hard-working Kansans who were concerned about a downsized economy that could force them out of a job. 
   A quick bailout fix might work for a short time, but it may not be long before we are asked again for more tax dollars. This is evidenced by recent Government bailouts of Bear Stearns, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, AIG, and the $25 billion tossed to the auto industry. A quick bailout fix might work for the short term, but without addressing the underlying problems, we will be asked again for more tax dollars. 
   An economic rescue plan needs to include reforms that tie mortgage broker's commissions to borrowers' timely payments; a mandatory FDIC-type insurance program for entities with troubled mortgages; a suspension of ``mark to market'' accounting procedures; a temporarily suspension of capital gains taxes; and a permanent, not a temporary increase on FDIC coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 coupled with an increase in premiums so that the statutory obligation of 1.15 percent is met. 
   The mandatory FDIC-type insurance program would require the Treasury Department to guarantee (losses up to 100%) resulting from the failure of timely payment and interest from mortgage backed securities originated prior to the date of the enactment. Such insurance, I believe, would provide immediate value to the securities and a foundation for which they could then be sold. I am disappointed this provision was not included as a mandatory program. 
   Furthermore, instead of a Government-driven bailout, I support an alternative where the Government enables and coordinates a greater involvement of private investors. An alternative could be to allow companies to carry-back losses arising in tax years ending in 2007, 2008, or 2009 back 5 years, generating a tax refund and immediate capital. 
   These are just a few alternative provisions that I believe would be better than merely throwing money at a problem we hope to fix. I want Kansans to go to bed tonight with peace of mind and not worry about their savings. I am ready for this financial turmoil to calm and for us to focus on other important things in our lives. But I could not support a $700 or $800 billion bailout plan that embraces temporary relief while shunning long-term reform that brings lasting stability. 
   I remain committed to working for a long-term solution with Democrats and Republicans who are willing to put the good of our country ahead of short-term fixes. It's the right thing to do.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (WE NEED AMERICAN TANKERS -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I am outraged tonight that we are outsourcing our national security. 
   Today, in the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, we heard testimony that the Department of Defense has modified the Buy American Act with a memorandum of understanding that exempts our allies in Europe from the same requirements we demand of U.S. manufacturers. 
   The results are that in the last three major contracts, we've lost them all to European manufacturers. Marine One, the replacement of the President's helicopter, went to a foreign manufacturer. The Light Utility Helicopter went to a foreign manufacturer. Last Friday, the Air Force announced that we are going to send the air refueling tanker to a foreign manufacturer. 
   Today, in testimony on the other side of the Capitol, Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne said in a subcommittee that, according to the news, the European-made A330 airframe selected for the new refueling airplane could be used to replace a fleet of air control surveillance and other special mission aircraft. That would mean 200 more aircraft and 40,000 more jobs going to Europe overseas. 
   Mr. Speaker, we've got to stop this today. Rebid the tanker contract because we need American tankers made by American companies with American workers.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (RECOGNIZING NEWTON CHISHOLM MIDDLE SCHOOL -- (House of Representatives - April 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Chisholm Middle School in Newton, Kansas, for a prestigious award they recently received. Chisholm Middle School was one of only 16 schools selected by the Intel Corporation and Scholastic for their Schools of Distinction Awards. 
   Chisholm received this award under the category of Collaboration and Teamwork. They were also awarded the ``Best of the Best'' award in part for their impressive academic record and exceptional staff, as well as their engaged and involved parents, community leaders, and local businesses. 
   Intel and Scholastic sponsor the awards and honor those schools which demonstrate academic excellence in the areas of science, mathematics, technology, literacy, and leadership. They reward the selected schools with $10,000 as well as other wonderful prizes to acknowledge their achievement. 
   The school chosen as ``Best of the Best'' also receives an additional $15,000 grant from the Intel Foundation and other prizes such as computer software. What an accomplishment it is for Chisholm Middle School to receive these grants for new technology and software. 
   It is wonderful to see families and communities come together to support the youth of America. The students, parents, educators, community leaders, and local businesses should all be commended for working together to improve education, for bringing excitement to learning, and for investing in the future of our generations. 
   The grants Chisholm Middle School received will go a long way in bringing new and exciting technology into the classroom. In fact, on Monday, April 30, they are hosting a reception in their media center to demonstrate the new technology that they have purchased with this award. That will be an interesting and exciting day at Chisholm Middle School. 
   In order to maintain a competitive edge in the global economy, America's schools need to provide quality education to ensure the next generation is well prepared. Schools across the Nation are striving for this kind of quality education. 
   It is evident that through the dedication of teachers, parents, communities, doors of opportunities are opening for America's young people. I encourage you to keep striving for excellence, and you will reap the benefits of hard work and perseverance. 
   I would like to also note that Ogden Elementary School in Ogden, Kansas, received a School of Distinction Award in the Mathematics Achievement category. The State of Kansas had two schools that were recipients of the Schools of Distinction Award for 2006. 
   We are proud of our students at Chisholm and Ogden for this high honor, and today I am pleased to offer congratulations on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHY AND PLEDGING SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS OF SEVERE FLOODING IN EASTERN KANSAS -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for his contributions and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) in helping me through this process of getting recognition to the people of Kansas who have suffered under this flood. 
   Madam Speaker, we have had a lot of trouble in Kansas this year. Out of our 105 counties, 102 have been declared a disaster at one time or another. It started in January with a 100-year event, an ice storm. We lost a lot of cattle. Power was down in half of the State. It was a very difficult time. 
   Later on in the year we had a series of tornadoes that were considered another 100-year event. It included a level 5 or T-5 tornado that hit Greensburg, Kansas, and the small community of 1,500 was completely wiped out by that tornado. 
   This was the third wave of natural disaster that has hit Kansas this year. It actually encompassed about 21 counties when it was all said and done. As you heard earlier, we lost 3,100 homes. 
   I have been in this flood area about five times since the flooding has occurred. I have been through the refinery that is now back up and running. The small community of Coffeyville seemed to be the worst hit. We have had quite a bit of difficulty getting through the problem, complicated by the oil that was spilled into many homes in that area. 
   Coffeyville resources is in the process of trying to rectify that situation; but I am very pleased that the jobs have never ceased at that refinery. They started the cleanup process right away, and they will continue to remain in that community. It is one of three refineries that we have in Kansas, and it does bring a lot of jobs to the area. It is also unique in that it is one of two refineries in the world that takes the by-product of making petroleum or gasoline from petroleum and it turns it into fertilizer for farmers in the area. So it is a very progressive refinery, and it has been a good source of jobs in that area. 
   I would like to acknowledge a few people who were very instrumental in bringing that community and other communities, like Independence, Kansas, back to their feet: Independence Mayor Rick Mott; Independence City Manager Paul Sasse; Independence Police Chief Ken Parker; Independence Fire Chief Dale Rail; Coffeyville Mayor Virgil Horn; Coffeyville City Manager Jeff Morris; Coffeyville Police Chief Joe Humble; Coffeyville Fire Chief Greg Allen; State Senators Derek Schmidt and Dwayne Umbarger; Kansas Adjutant General Maj. Gen. Tod M. Bunting; Governor Kathleen Sebelius; State Representatives Jeff King, Virgil Peck and Kasha Kelly; and Montgomery County Commissioners Billy Lewark-Wood, Tony Fowler and Gene Tucker. 
   There are other people that were involved like Jim Miller with Emergency Management and the Kansas National Guard and the Kansas Highway Patrol that did a great deal of work during that time to make sure we had minimal casualties. 
   The one story I remember is the gentleman who was notified to get out of the area because the floodwaters were rising.     
   He chose to go back to his home to save his coin collection. I don't know what he was carrying his coins in, but he was later rescued by the Coffeyville Fire Department, and he lost all his coins. 
   So I think there was a good time for people to respond to the need, the disaster, and get out, but those that chose to stay behind did so at their own peril. I think it's a good lesson for all of America when emergency situations arise and our first responders are telling you to please leave the area, don't go back for your coin collection or anything else. Your personal safety is first. 
   Coins can be replaced, possessions can be replaced, but our human lives are one thing that cannot be replaced. So I'm very pleased that we had minimal casualties and only one fatality in that situation. Incidentally, that one fatality was a gentleman who chose not to respond to the warnings and stayed in his dwelling against the will of the people who were trying to rescue him. 
   There's another piece of legislation that I would like to mention that is the first step of reaching out to other areas, other Members of Congress who have had similar flooding since July. Now, they have been in States like Indiana, in their counties. It's been in Illinois, been in Texas, Nebraska. I have a bill that will help Kansas get back on its feet, but I would like to reach out to the other Members of Congress who have experienced flooding and ask them to join with me to help Kansas, as well as their areas. 
   I think we should have one bill that would address all the needs because they're very similar. The communities need to have the cleanup. They need to have some rehabilitation of historic buildings. They need to have infrastructure rebuilt. They need to have businesses supporting the cleanup. 
   So the bill that I have is H.R. 3444, and if we can work with those Members  of Congress, Madam Speaker, that have had similar flooding problems and have one bill, I think it would be easier for the House to schedule. Plus, we would meet the needs of all our communities. 
   Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia. There was one thing that I failed to mention, and that is that Coffeyville Resources, which is the refinery, has made plans to make things right. They've responded to the community. Those homes that were damaged by the spilt oil, they have asked to purchase those homes. They're going to turn that land back over to the city. They're going to make a park in that area. 
   So I think it's significant to note that when some corporation is a good public citizen, a good corporate citizen, that we ought to acknowledge that publicly because we need more of that. 
   I thank you for the time.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, the Interior approps bill will be in the full committee tomorrow and is, on balance, a very good bill. Chairman Dicks has done a thorough job, with many hearings, and has been very fair in looking at the various elements of the bill. 
   But it is an energy bill as well, and with gas at $4.089 as a nationwide average, and with great opportunity in the Interior bill, we have done nothing to bring down the price of gas. 
   So, tomorrow, in the full committee, we have a series of amendments that will address the price of gasoline, and I urge all my colleagues to join in the effort to bring down the price of gas. 
   We can do this by increasing production in ANWR, in the Outer Continental Shelf. We can start to do the permitting process for oil shale. In every case, we will increase a reliable, environmentally safe supply of oil, and bring down the price of oil for working men and women here in America. 
   So, again, Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join with us and bring down the price of oil by increasing the supply.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (RECOGNIZING PIZZA HUT ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. ``Gather 'round the good stuff.'' That's what Pizza Hut says in their ads today. But they have been gathering around the good stuff for 50 years. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of an American success story, Pizza Hut. It has grown from a single brick building in Wichita, Kansas, to more than 11,000 stores worldwide with sales of more than $1.8 billion in the last fiscal quarter alone. 
   Founded on May 31, 1958, by Dan and Frank Carney, Wichita, Kansas, natives, Pizza Hut represents the very essence of the American Dream. The Carney brothers borrowed $600 from their mother, purchased used kitchen equipment, and rented a 550 square foot brick building and began selling pizzas. 
   The business grew quickly, and in 1959 they opened their first franchise restaurant in Topeka, Kansas. By 1966, just 8 years after opening, Pizza Hut established its first home office in Wichita to oversee the booming business of 145 restaurants. 
   In the late 1960s, a pizza company from California was beginning to expand eastward, and the Carney brothers were faced with new business challenges. They decided that Pizza Huts would be the neighborhood pizza restaurants, with standard layouts and looks. In 1969 the red roof was instituted as the national standard for Pizza Hut locations. The move paid off, as Pizza Hut became the number one pizza chain in the world, both in term of sales and in the number of restaurants. 
   Frank Carney attributes the early success of Pizza Hut to the good values and solid work ethic he and his brother learned from helping their father at his neighborhood grocery store. They believed that growth would come through a commitment to quality and an attitude of service from dedicated employees. 
   The 1970s were a significant time of growth for Pizza Hut. They became a publicly traded corporation in 1970, opened their 1,000th store in Wichita, Kansas, in 1972, and their first international restaurant in Costa Rica that same year. Four years later the 100th international store opened in Australia and the 2,000th Pizza Hut store worldwide. In 1977 they merged with PepsiCo. 
   Since then Pizza Hut has grown in terms of restaurants and menu options. In 1986 they began offering delivery services. In 2000 Pizza Hut joined with several other restaurant holdings, including KFC and Taco Bell, to become YUM! Brands. 
   A number of events are planned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Pizza Huts' founding, culminating in a gala at the Gaylord Hotel in the DC area here on the evening of May 31. I want to especially commend Bev Jeskie for all her hard work in organizing these events and for making sure that I remained informed of their activities. 
   Madam Speaker, the idea began 50 years ago in a little hut in Wichita, Kansas. It has been immensely successful. Dan Carney cites the relationships he developed, strengthened with friends, family members, co-workers, and franchisees, as being the most important aspect of Pizza Hut. Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to take a cue from a couple of good Kansans: ``Gather 'round the good stuff.''

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES REGARDING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS LAUNCHED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 -- (House of Representatives - September 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, today is the 7th anniversary of one of the most horrific days in our Nation's history. On September 11, 2001 terrorists attacked the United States and slaughtered our fellow citizens in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Fox News is calling this the ``day that changed America'' but I disagree. America didn't change, instead the evil attacks brought out the best in America. 
   As terrible events have a tendency to do, the terrorist attacks brought this Nation together. We have mourned together, been angry together, prayed together, indeed come together as Americans not as Southerners or Northerners, Midwesterners or East Coasters. It's an outlook that extends beyond national pride; we acknowledge that we as Americans are all in this together. None of us who were here on that terrible day will forget the spontaneous gathering of Congress on the steps of this great building that survived thanks to the brave men and women of Flight 93. Politics was truly brushed aside as we joined hand in hand, mourning the dead, celebrating the spirit of this great Nation, and vowing to do all we can to protect this Nation and her citizens. 
   The events of September 11, 2001 did have had a drastic effect on our Nation and the world at large. The focus of the country changed. Today, our Nation's ideas and her people still face a continuing threat from terrorists. Nearly every single day, the intelligence community records another threat or two against America or our interests. Hardly a week goes by that some terrorists somewhere don't reiterate their interest in attacking this great Nation. But our military, first responders and intelligence officers as well as alert citizens have remained vigilant and prevented further attacks. 
   Today as we remember those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001 and their loved ones, we also take time to honor and thank the thousands of first responders, the myriad aviation personnel from air traffic controllers to pilots and flight attendants who safely grounded planes across the country, and of course the men and women in our military and intelligence communities who have been engaged in a global war on the terrorists for the past seven years. God bless them all and may God continue to bless America.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, fundamentally, there is something wrong with the way we are proceeding. The arguments use fear to build confidence. We are on an artificial deadline, rushing to judgment, fearful we can't get there in time. No one has addressed the fundamental reason that has brought us to this state of fear. No one has talked about it because this bill does not fix the underlying problems. Your fear drives you away from reasoning. 
   So now the worm turns. Those of you who complained the rich are getting richer want to take money away from those who can't afford it and give it to those who live the life style of the rich and famous. Those of you who curse corporate welfare pursue the biggest corporate welfare bill in history. Why? Because of fear. Taxpayers don't want to throw good money--their money--after bad behavior. 
   Vote against this. Fix the underlying problem. Don't let fear drive you to a bad decision. Vote ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington. 
   I rise in opposition to the rule and also to the underlying Ag bill for a couple of reasons. One is the current trend that we're seeing played out on the floor of the House. We saw it last week as we addressed the farm bill, and it seems like the bill that once was designed to make sure that we had a low-cost, stable food supply is moving money out of the rural areas and being hijacked into the urban areas. 
   And you look at the pie chart of the total funding of the Ag appropriation that was used earlier, you can see that 35 percent of this pie chart is the agricultural side of the programs and 60 percent, almost two-thirds, is the domestic food assistance. Now, nobody thinks it's bad to feed people who are having a tough time, and we must be doing a very good job of it because the number one problem for people in poverty today is obesity. Maybe we're giving them the wrong foods. We should go back to the basic foods that we present them, but this big shift in funding is accentuated in the current farm bill that was passed last week.  
   The farm commodity portion in the bill that we passed last week is only 14 percent of total spending, and if you look at how it's been reduced in this Ag appropriations bill, it's a continuation of movement from helping the rural areas, moving it into the urban areas. And I think that's a reflection that only 2 percent of our population are farmers in America today. 
   In small States like the ones that I represent, in Kansas with only 3 million people, we only have four Representatives. And when we try to fight for rural development and for rural agricultural programs, we hope that we can keep our economy strong in those rural areas. But we also want to make sure that the benefits that were designed to keep a low-cost, stable food supply don't get hijacked and sent to the urban areas. This is something that I believe has developed just over this last year. 
   In the past, just a short story, how we have given farmers more opportunity in the past, now that has changed in Ag policy. Opportunity is dwindling for farmers. 
   In 1996, we had four farmers in Kansas who raised cotton. The farm bill then, the Freedom to Farm Act, allowed farmers to expand their product lines. Now we have over 50,000 acres of cotton in Kansas. We have a dozen cotton gins. We expanded their financial base a lot by giving them more opportunity. 
   Under the current plan, which is exhibited here with the shifting of emphasis to the urban areas, we're taking a lot of the opportunity away from the farmers and giving them less opportunity, while more opportunity is going to the urban areas. 
   So I'm opposed to this bill. I'm opposed to the rule because I don't think it gives us an opportunity to turn this trend around. I don't think it gives us an opportunity to get the assistance where we need it in the rural areas so we can develop the infrastructure necessary to build a strong economy to allow the agriculture to grow for the future so we have a low-cost, stable food supply well into the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I would like to thank the gentleman from Washington, and I would like to respond to the gentlelady from Connecticut. It is true, the Carsey report is true that 40 percent of rural America does rely on food stamps. The problem is, there is a lot of poverty there because we have not done the right thing on building infrastructure in the rural areas. 
   It's the shift from this low-cost stable food supply we have had in the past and the help we had to build that infrastructure. The finances are now shifting to the urban areas because we have so many urban Members of Congress. The Democrat leadership has been allowing that to happen. 
   It's true there are $940 million put in this bill for the rural areas, but it's an $18 billion bill. It has $18 billion; $940 million of it is not a very big chunk of that. 
   I just think that we are seeing a bad trend here in America. The Democrat leadership is allowing this trend to continue where resources are being shifted out of the rural areas, because there are a high number of urban Members of Congress, and they are leaving farmers vulnerable who are trying to keep this low-cost stable food supply available, and trying to keep the agricultural exports growing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from Michigan. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to this bill, and I am extremely concerned about our national security and deeply troubled that our intelligence community has been prevented from doing the job they need to do to protect Americans. 
   We do not need another delay of much needed FISA improvements. The Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive FISA bill 68-29. That is the bill that we should be voting on today, and not this temporary extension. It is not the bill that I would have written, but it does give our intelligence community many important tools they need to protect our Nation. Instead of taking up a perfectly good, well-thought-out bill, we have another delay tactic by the House Democratic leadership that insists on catering to special interest groups like the trial lawyers and the hard left of the Democrat Party. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have had leaks in the way we collect information on individuals through electronic conversation; we have had leaks about how we collect e-mails on terrorist Web sites; we have had leaks that have caused our allies in Europe to no longer cooperate when it comes to tracking terrorist financing. Instead of prioritizing arguably the most important security issue, the majority party has delayed and failed to focus on how we can help the community in the 21st century against enemies who utilize the latest technology against our country. 
   As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I have been very disturbed this past year to see the anger against our President cloud the judgments of its members. In an effort to embarrass the President, they have weakened our intelligence gathering capabilities and caused long-term damage to the security of this Nation. We do not monitor phone conversations like we should, we do not monitor e-mails like we should, or finances like we should. And the enemy knows it. It is time for us to strengthen and not weaken the terrorist surveillance program. Enough is enough. 
   We all know that if we simply pass an extension for 21 days, it doesn't solve the problem. It is time for us to stand up and force the Democrat leadership of this House to do their job and bring the FISA modernization bill before this body, the one that was passed by the Senate by a wide margin, so that the intelligence community can have every tool at its disposal to protect the United States. 
   The Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, the man in charge of overseeing the intelligence community, has repeatedly told us of the urgency to modernize the FISA law. He said, ``We must urgently close the gap in our current ability to effectively collect foreign intelligence. The current FISA law does not allow us to be effective. Modernizing this law is essential for the intelligence community to be able to provide warning of threats to this country.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, what the Senate passed does exactly what Mr. McConnell talked about. We should bring that vote to the floor and vote it up or down.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (AMERICAN BRAILLE FLAG MEMORIAL ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from Texas for their assistance in helping me with this very fine piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, last summer, one of my constituents, Randy Cabral, president of the Kansas Braille Transcript Institute, e-mailed me with an idea, to place an American Braille flag at Arlington National Cemetery. Today, we see the fruition of one man's idea. 
   Prior to the creation of the American Braille flag, the American flag was not accessible to the blind. This flag was created by the Kansas Braille Transcript Institute in Wichita, Kansas. 
   As you can see on this poster to my left, the flag has been specially designed in a way that informs the blind of the full color of the American flag, the 13 stripes and the 50 stars on a blue field. Additionally, this tactile flag bears the Pledge of Allegiance, both in raised print and in grade one Braille. 
   Few know that our Nation has more than 1 million blind and low-vision veterans, and those numbers continue to rise. The Department of Defense estimates that 16 percent of those injured in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom suffer from severe vision loss. An additional 10 to 12 million Americans are blind or of low vision. 
   The American Braille Flag Memorial Act authorizes the placement of an American Braille flag at Arlington National Cemetery, a national place of remembrance and honor for our Nation's veterans. The cemetery is visited by an estimated 4 million people annually. The American Braille Flag Memorial will bring honor to our Nation's blind community and allow our blind veterans to see the American flag again. 
   In order to ensure that this effort will enhance and not detract from the cemetery, I have worked with the superintendent of the Arlington National Cemetery, John Metzler. Mr. Metzler believes that a 15-inch by 17-inch bronze replica of the American Braille flag would be a wonderful addition to the visitors center at the cemetery. 
   This is a unique bronze replica, and, as such, this new drawing and special casting had to be commissioned. The drawings for the bronze replica were completed by Kevin West, a student at Wichita Area Technical College. Kevin is a specialist in the Kansas Army National Guard. He is also a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. He served in the 778th Combat Heavy Equipment Transport Group, or HET, out of Kansas City, Kansas, as both a convoy security and a HET operator. Let me take this moment to thank Kevin for his service to the Nation. 
   The actual bronze flag memorial will be cast free of charge by the Truxes Company of Oswego, Illinois. The Truxes Company was founded by another American hero, Mr. Bill Truxes. Mr. Truxes joined the Army Air Corps during World War II and served as a B-24 pilot. While serving in World War II, he was shot down during the Battle of the Bulge and became a POW in Germany in 1944. He was liberated at the end of the war. I greatly appreciate Mr. Truxes' patriotism and generosity in agreeing to donate the bronze casting, and I also want to thank him for his service. 
   With Mr. West and Mr. Truxes both donating their service, and the Kansas Braille Transcription Institute donating the transportation, this entire project will be provided to the government free of charge. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 16 cosponsors and the Blind Veterans of America for their endorsement and support of this effort. But more importantly, I want to thank those who served this Nation. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to our veterans, and this simple action will mean much more to our patriotic blind veterans. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join with me in supporting this effort and placing the Braille flag at Arlington National Cemetery.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (COMMENDING THE KANSAS JAYHAWKS FOR WINNING THE 2008 NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support for H. Res 1096, Head Coach Bill Self, and his national champion basketball team at Kansas University. Congratulations to the team on an outstanding season, and a thrilling ride through March Madness. 
   The season began with high expectations, as the Jayhawks were ranked fourth in the preseason ESPN/USA Today poll. These expectations were justified, as KU won the first 20 games of the season and climbed as high as number 2 in the polls, before losing to Kansas State University at the end of January. Two additional losses, including a heartbreaker to then 7th ranked Texas, dropped them as low as 7th in the national polls, and many sports pundits questioned their ability to win in big games. 
   Coach Self and his players continued to believe in themselves, however, and finished the season ranked fourth in the Nation, with a 28-3 record. It was a rocky trip through the Big XII Conference Tournament, with narrow wins against Nebraska and Texas A&M, before avenging their regular season loss against co-conference regular season champion Texas. The Jayhawks were getting hot at the right time. Their 10 point victory over the Longhorns gave them their 7th Conference Tournament championship in 12 years, and was enough to lock up a number one seed in the national tournament. 
   KU did not meet a significant challenge in the tournament until the regional final, where they met tournament darlings Stephen Curry and Davidson. They played each other neck and neck throughout the game, with neither team leading by more than 5 points at any time during the game. An errant three point shot by Davidson as time expired gave Kansas the win, and secured their place in the Final Four. 
   Kansas avenged another loss in the national semi-final--that of former coach Roy Williams, who left the university in 2003. Thought to be the best team in the country this year, North Carolina could not keep up with KU's fast paced game plan, and had no answer for their swarming defense. Kansas won in a rout, 84-66. 
   The national final against Memphis was an instant classic. Though the teams were close for much of the game, Memphis began to pull away towards the end. Undeterred, KU was able to capitalize on the Achilles' Heel of Memphis--free throw shooting. Even so, they were still trailing by 3 with 10 seconds left when Sherron Collins drove the length of the floor, and passed to Mario Chalmers who drained a 3-pointer with 2.1 seconds left, sending the game into overtime. Kansas continued to perform well through overtime, and won the game 75-68. This was the first national championship for Coach Bill Self, and the first for KU since Danny and the Miracles in 1988. 
   Congratulations to Coach Self, the basketball team, and the entire Kansas University community. Rock, Chalk, Jayhawk!

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for H. Res. 1130, and for our Nation's teachers. Their hard work and dedication to the students of this Nation is exemplary, and I commend them for it. 
   If the United States is to remain competitive, if our economy is to continue to grow, our children must have access to quality education, specifically in the areas of science and mathematics. One of the best ways to stimulate the economy is through a well-rounded and well-educated workforce. A quality education provides options for students to achieve the skills necessary to successfully compete in today's demanding job market. And our students would not be able to obtain a quality education were it not for the dedication of America's educators. 
   Teachers in this Nation are over-worked, and under-appreciated. Teaching has never been an easy profession. The work of teachers extends far beyond the time spent in the classroom, preparing lessons, grading papers, and looking for additional ways to enhance the educational experience in the classroom. We in Congress have not made their jobs any easier. In our, albeit laudable, effort to enhance the performance of our students, we have placed additional requirements on our teachers that demand more and more of their time. Federal regulations place additional pressure on both teachers and students. Our teachers do not receive nearly enough recognition for the care and concern they show for their students. 
   So today, I take the time to thank the many teachers who helped educate a restless boy that now has the honor of serving in this remarkable institution, the teachers who have guided my children and given them the skills to pursue their dreams, and also my beloved wife, Vicki, who has used her many talents to help teach children with disabilities. I urge my colleagues to show their support for America's teachers by voting in favor of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (THE NATIONAL RAMIFICATIONS OF U.S. AIR FORCE'S DECISION TO AWARD TANKER CONTRACT TO EUROPEAN AEROSPACE CONSORTIUM -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding. And I also want to thank Mr. Inslee for his leadership in trying to bring some common sense to the procurement process down at the Department of Defense. 
   Madam Speaker, Americans are outraged by the Air Force outsourcing our national security to the French. This contract award to a foreign manufacturer is wrong, and it makes us less, not more, secure. 
   As my chart to the left here shows, we should have known that we had a problem when the President's helicopter replacement, the VH-71, went to a foreign manufacturer. We should have suspected it again when the light utility helicopter went to a foreign manufacturer. And now with the KC-X program going to be a manufacturer, it's as plain as the nose on your face. We have three of the last four major contract awards now going to foreign suppliers. 
   Here's how this works: The Department of Defense and the Air Force really have bent over backwards to give this contract to the French, but they've been very sly. They first, as a foreign supplier, find an American front company, and then they employ tactics like waiving regulations that our Department of Defense gladly awards them. They use illegal subsidies. They employ illegal subsidies. And then they buy into defense contracts, knowing that further on down the line, there won't be the ability to have an American manufacturer beat them out in any competitive bid. And then further, as was pointed out by Mr. Inslee, they make promises in their proposals, and then the contracts are awarded by the Department of Defense, but they change their mind about the work content and they keep the work in Europe. 
   Let me just talk for a brief minute about why this was such a shock when this contract went to a foreign supplier. The Air Force tanker roadmap is a chart that was given to us by the Air Force. I sit on the Defense Subcommittee of Appropriations, and in December of last year, December of 2007, this was the chart that they said was their roadmap to replacing the tankers. On the left-hand side here, we have 2006. This is where this chart begins, fiscal year 2006, and it runs out to fiscal year 2007. 
   They have two tankers in our stock now. They have two versions of the KC-135. They have the older KC-135Es, which are the first ones to go out of the inventory. Next we're going to replace the KC-135Rs. ``R'' stands for the re-engine version of the KC-135. And at the bottom, we have our very largest tankers, the KC-10s, built on a DC-10 airframe, almost as large as a 747. But that's the larger airframe. This is the medium-range tankers, according to the Air Force. 
   The KC-135s, as you can see, in 2006 we started to take them out of the inventory. And as time goes on, you can see this little yellow triangle getting smaller and smaller. That means the KC-135s are going to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base into what we call the ``bone yard.'' They're no longer flying. 
   We're still flying the KC-135s. The average age is about 45 years of age, and they need to be replaced. We have then the KC-10s. They're the newer version and the larger tanker. 
   So what the Air Force told us is that they were going to replace this KC-135 medium-sized tanker over the next 15 years. Actually, it's going to run about 20 years with all that's said and done on the current schedule. But we were supposed to start out here in 2011 by having them first delivered. 
   So when the contract was awarded, did we get a replacement for the KC-135? No. The Air Force bought an airplane larger than the KC-10. So, naturally, everybody was shocked all across America. And then when they found out that the KC-10 replacement is the KC-30, a variation of the Airbus A330, a French airplane, they were shocked and outraged. We're outsourcing our national security to the French. 
   So what is behind this decision? How could this possibly have happened? Well, if you look at the contract scenario, we find out that there were waived regulations, waived regulations  by our own Department of Defense. They waive them for our NATO allies. And if you go to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, paragraph 225, it will tell you which of the 20 nations have waived regulations when they bid on defense contracts. Those 20 nations include the four ownership nations of Airbus and the parent company of EADS. They include the United Kingdom. They include Spain. They include France, and they include Germany. These are the regulations that are waived, and they're very costly, very expensive. 
   Let's just look at the first one on the list here: Cost Accounting Standards. Now, Cost Accounting Standards say basically that you have to include all the costs that it takes to make a product that you're going to supply to the Department of Defense. And if you miss a cost or shift costs in and out of a contract, it could be a violation of the Cost Accounting Standards with very high penalties. It could be determined that it was fraud, and people could go to jail. Or it could be determined that you tried to give the government the slip on some data, and you would be barred from doing business with the Federal Government.     
   You can't shift cost on cost accounting standards. They are very costly to comply with. You have to have people hired to keep track of all costs. They must track them, compare them, report them as far as their relationship with schedules. If you don't have to do it, like EADS, in the case of this tanker, then it's much cheaper as far as your proposal. So cost accounting standards were waived by the Department of Defense for EADS, but they were required by the Boeing Company. 
   Now what does this mean for the Boeing Company? It means they have to include all their costs, including health care costs. Health care costs that they pay for their employees, workmen's compensation costs that they pay to cover the employees are all included in these costs. They have to be included in their proposal. If you don't do it, it is a violation of the cost accounting standards. 
   But those costs are not in the EADS proposal. Health care costs, workmen's compensation costs are picked up by the government, so they don't have to pay for those. Again, that gives a lower bid to EADS for this kind of a cost.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. You make a very good point about the net cost to the taxpayer. Getting back to these accounting standards which you are pointing out, the net cost is very high to the taxpayer. If EADS violates the cost accounting standards, we will never know it because they don't have to report it. And the cost of reporting this, the Boeing Company had to include. So it's really a difficult time for any American company to compete with a European company when you waive this first standard. 
   The next standard is a specialty metal standard, called the Berry amendment. This is where our manufacturers are required to track from the time a metal is mined from the ground and processed, until it's riveted onto an airplane. Tracking. That means people are sitting somewhere at a desk and they are spending time trying to keep track of who is processing this and what procedures were put in place. It's very costly. But it was waived for the European manufacturers by our Department of Defense in DFARS 225, that's the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations again. 
   The next one that was waived by the Buy American provisions. Buy American provisions basically say 50 percent of this product has to be made in America. Now the goal in this proposal for Northrop Grumman, the EADS proposal, said 58 percent was their goal. If you look at previous contracts with the Department of Defense, like the light utility helicopter, which EADS also won, their goal there was 65 percent. But they had some American suppliers in there that were included in the bid, and as a second thought EADS said, well, we have got a production line in Europe. Things are going pretty well. We think we will just keep this work here. 
   So there are companies in Kansas that were cheated by this. There was a Spirit Aerospace Manufacturing, which lost the fuselage of the helicopter. There was Command Aerospace, which lost the floor board of the helicopter. Then there was ICE, Incorporated, which lost the wire harnesses for the helicopter. All American work content in the proposal that was then awarded as a contract and then that work was pulled back to Europe. 
   When I asked the Army about this in an open hearing, their response was, well, we have no enforcement mechanism to make sure that these jobs remain in America. No enforcement mechanism. So we waive these kind of standards and regulations that would allow us the knowledge of where these jobs are actually going. And we will never know.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. That is exactly right. This is a question that has been put directly to not only the Army, but also the Secretary of Air Force and the head of procurement for the Air Force. It's common knowledge over in the Pentagon they tell us these things and we evaluate them based on these jobs being in America, and low risk, but then there is really no way of enforcing if these companies decide to keep the jobs in Europe. 
   If you look at this very same contract, the air refueling tanker contract, the first five airplanes are currently planned to be built in Toulouse, France. Then they are going to change the manufacturing procedure and start taking parts and shipping them to Mobile, Alabama, to assemble them. This is a similar scenario to the light utility helicopter. When it came time to ship those jobs to America, they decided to keep them in Europe. 
   There's no guarantee in this contract that has been awarded by the Air Force that says, yes, you plan on doing this in Mobile, Alabama, but there's no enforcement mechanism to make sure the jobs actually come to America.

   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from Washington and the gentleman from Iowa. He is representing one of the 42 States that is impacted by this decision. Getting back to the statement that the gentleman from Washington, Mr. Inslee, said about cleaning up the act, there is a report that really highlights why it is so important that it is such a travesty that foreign corrupt practices is one of the regulations that is waived. 
   We can't track what EADS is doing when it comes to their interface with foreign suppliers and foreign countries. But there is a report that was put out by the Center for Security Policy in April 2007. The name of the report is: ``EADS is Welcome to Compete for U.S. Defense Contracts--But First It Must Clean Up Its Act.'' Then it goes through and highlights some of the corrupt practices that EADS has been known for across the globe, and their problematic issues.     
   Issue number one, espionage, bribery and other dirty practices; issue number two, Russian ownership and influence of EADS; issue number three, trying to supply America's adversaries with weapons. 
   The report goes on, but in the section called ``Bottom Line,'' it says the six things that EADS must do before they should be allowed to bid on government contracts. 
   Madam Speaker, those six issues are: Number one, resolve espionage problems; number two, correct the bribery problem; number three, remove the Kremlin from the company; number four, prevent other ambiguous or known bad actors from owning EADS stakes; number five, resolve the proliferation problem; and, number six, resolve anti-American workforce problems. 
   This is what the Center For Security Policy suggests to the Department of Defense and to Congress, it is a public document, that we should do before we should allow this European manufacturer to supply products for our defense. And we won't ever know what they are doing right, because the foreign corrupt practices regulations are waived by our own Department of Defense. That is another reason why this is such an outrageous practice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from Washington. 
   When talking about risk, the Air Force has done studies as to what is the best manufacturing technology that we have when we are building a complex, single point of failure system like the tanker. They say the best way to do it is to have an integrated production line, where you build your commercial off-the-shelf item and integrate in that very same production line those things that you need to make this a unique product for the Department of Defense. That was what was employed by the Boeing company in their proposal to the Air Force for the KC-767 tanker. 
   What we find out after looking at and listening to the Airbus or the EADS proposal is that they had this disjointed thing, as the gentleman from Washington pointed out very well, multi-country, multi-manufacturing sites, starting four new facilities that have to be FAA certified and they have to find qualified workers for. This develops a tremendous amount of risk in the proposal that the EADS company was putting forward, as compared to what the Air Force actually asked for in their own studies. 
   Somehow in this convoluted process of trying to decide which product to buy, they overlooked the fact that the Air Force said this is what we wanted, an integrated production line. We didn't want a multi-facility operation in multi-countries. We wanted it all to happen in one place, where we could keep track of the product and the quality. And yet when it came time to risk, they gave an equal amount of risk to both companies. It just doesn't make any sense. 
   The other point that the gentleman from Washington made that I would like to add to is what is the net cost to taxpayers? There are some things that the Air Force follows in their Federal acquisition regulations as part of their cost evaluation process, but there are some things they don't consider. For example, they didn't consider outsourcing our national security. They are just based on their rules and regulations. They look at cost and their key performance characteristics, et cetera. 
   But if you look at other things that need to be taken into consideration in Congress, like how do we secure the national defense industry, the defense base, well, we have to take these things into consideration.  
   If you look at the $35 billion contract and say what is the real net cost to the taxpayers, the $35 billion contract we know is what was awarded. But if you looked at the fuel savings that was pointed out by the gentleman from Washington, the KC-767 is 24 percent more fuel efficient, and that saves taxpayers $30 over the life of this program. So you take your $35 billion contract and you have to subtract that from the Boeing bid. So what is the net cost to taxpayers? It is $5 billion. 
   Then you take the comparison of American jobs versus French jobs. One thing unique about French jobs is they don't pay any American income taxes, but American workers do. So you take the 19,000 lost aerospace jobs in America and say what would they have paid the Federal Government over the life of this program in the form of income taxes? Well, 19,000 workers, which is the difference between the two proposals, times about $11,000 a year, which is the average that an aerospace worker pays in federal income taxes, and you take that over the life of this program, it comes out to $8 billion. 
   So you have got $35 billion. You take away $30 billion worth of savings on the fuel and you get down to a $5 billion net cost to the taxpayer. Then you add back what you would get from the lost American jobs paying taxes if they were employed with the American contract than they would have gotten to pay these taxes. That is $8 billion. So the net cost is actually a $3 billion advantage. 
   In other words, if we would have issued this to a American company with American workers paying American Federal income taxes, and you take into consideration the fuel savings, it would have actually brought in $3 billion more in revenue in the net cost to the taxpayer than what it had under the circumstances that they had given it to the foreign supplier. Then you look at the lost revenue from corporate tax by having 90 percent of this airplane built in France instead of built in America, and you get another $1 billion. 
   So what is the true cost to the taxpayers? It is positive $4 billion for the American company employing American workers to make an American tanker, versus $74 billion if you add all these costs up to the foreign supplier using foreign manufacturing workers. 
   So what would you do if you were a taxpayer? For me, a $74 billion cost or a $4 billion savings, I would take the $4 billion savings, and that says we buy an American tanker made by an American company with American workers. So this decision doesn't make sense just on the net cost to taxpayers, let alone all these other things that we are talking about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Another thing Congress must consider in this whole scenario is, looking back over history and saying, when we do have a difference of opinion between our European allies and our own country and we employ our young men and women to carry out the will of this country, will our foreign suppliers be there to supply us in our time of need? 
   During the Gulf War, we had allies that disagreed with what we were doing and they failed to supply the parts that we needed to keep our young men and women safe while they carried out the will of this Nation so they could come home safely to their families. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, again, our European allies failed to support us when, in our time of need and through great diplomatic strains and a lot of harsh words, finally we were able to find suppliers that were going to give us the parts that we needed so that our young men and women could carry out the will of this country and come home safely to their families. 
   Once again, in this system, it is a single point of failure system. It is a system that, if it is down, everything does not function. We cannot transport aircraft from the East Coast to the West Coast for our military without tankers. We cannot supply our troops or carry our troops anywhere outside the continental United States without aerial refueling tankers. If we are going to respond to a natural disaster like the tsunami in southeast Asia, we have to have air refueling tankers. So, we cannot have such a critical item that is so vulnerable to our foreign suppliers when they may disagree with us politically and withhold the parts we need to have this very critical, single point of failure weapons system. 
   So if you look at our ability to protect our families, like my chart has here, it is an immeasurable cost. What is the dollar value when we have to protect our families and our military doesn't have the supplies they need to carry out that task? What about the loss of defense workers? That is another immeasurable cost. Once we lose part of our national defense industry base, it is gone apparently forever. 
   For example, if this contract goes through, never again in America will we rebuild an air refueling tanker. I can give you the technical reasons why, but basically aircraft are built on an improvement curve. And the thought of an improvement curve is a theory, which is reality, is that the second unit costs less time to build than the first unit; the fourth unit costs less time than the second unit; and the eighth unit costs less time than the fourth unit, and on down. Every time it doubles, there is less time to build that next aircraft. After you build 179 aircraft, like in this air refueling tanker contract, you are bidding for the follow-on procurement at unit 180. In other words, you are 180 units down the improvement curve. It is a lot cheaper than if you are building the first unit. An American manufacturer bidding on the follow-on contract would have to bid a number one unit. They cannot keep up, once again, with our foreign suppliers because they are bidding a number one unit and our foreign would be bidding the 180th unit. So we never again will build air refueling tankers here in America if this contract goes forward. 
   And what does that do? It is a loss to defense workers; it compromises our ability to protect our families; and, it is a loss of defense manufacturing capability. Those are things that are immeasurable in cost, but it is something that Congress must consider when we vote on whether this contract should go forward or not.

   Mr. TIAHRT. If you look at all the data involved, from the employment of illegal subsidies that you pointed out so clearly and how our United States trade representative is taking the European companies to task for these illegal subsidies, when you take into consideration the lost tax revenue, when you consider the costly one-sided regulations that are granted by our own Department of Defense and the loss of our industrial base and the loss of our national security, this is a bad decision, and it appears that the Air Force had to bend over backwards to give this work to the French company EADS. And it is heartbreaking in one sense, outrageous in another. But, for me, it came in the form of outrage. 
   I know that one of the Senators from Washington State has set up a Web site where you can fill out a survey. I know, on my own Web site at www.house.gov/tiarht, you can get on my Web site and fill out a survey about your feelings on us outsourcing our national security to the French. It is I think a bad decision. It is one that needs to be reviewed by Congress. I am hopeful that the Government Accountability Office will look at these inequities, these disparities, this unlevel playing field, and correct this before we have to take action on the floor of the House. 
   But I think it is clear from the people that we have spoken with here in the 42 States that have lost workers because of this contract going awry, that there will be something happening on this contract this year, either through the Government Accountability Office or through actions of the Congress, because it is too outrageous to allow our national security to be outsourced to the French.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this supplemental funding is one of the most important bills that Congress will be considering this year, and I am very disappointed that the Democrat leadership has mandated that this bill come to the floor under a closed rule. 
   I have heard the Democrats say that this is not a perfect rule. It is perfectly wrong; that is what it is. 
   What does a closed rule mean? It means voices will not be heard. It means ideas will be silenced. A closed rule means that no amendments will be allowed to the bill, that no alternative plan to fully fund the troops will be allowed. 
   I only have 2 minutes to discuss this, not enough time to explain to the American people how this puts our troops at risk or question why the Speaker believes she has the right to micromanage the war in Iraq. 
   We spent a whole week debating the nonbinding resolution on Iraq, and now we have only 4 hours of how to best fund and support our troops. It is not enough time to explain title IX, where the language of the bill prevents our troops from receiving reinforcements or replacements. It is not enough time to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the supplemental will fulfill the goals of al Qaeda's leader al-Zawahiri. It is not enough time to show the American people how this supplemental replaces the Iraqi National Congress by imposing on their government demands, demands to change their Constitution, demands to change their laws. 
   This is an unfair rule that represents broken promises for a more open Congress made by the Speaker. This is a rule that should be defeated. 
   I am going to vote ``no'' on this, and I encourage my colleagues to also vote ``no'' on this rule. It is an unfair bill.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a terrible bill. It is only allowed 4 hours of debate. We could have had more debate, but according to the Congress Daily P.M., the Speaker of the House is in New York City tonight at a fund-raiser. So we could have spent the time debating tonight. Instead, we are waiting until tomorrow and the time is limited. 
   Our soldiers are in need of our support, and they have sacrificed greatly and given their support to us, and they have kept us safe. We have been safe since September 11, 2001, but instead of providing only what the troops need in this bill, it funds domestic spending with $24 billion. 
   In addition in Title IX of this bill, the language will effectively deny our troop reinforcements or replacements. The language says that no unit may be deployed without being fully mission-capable. If this language were law during World War I, none of the troops would have been fully mission-capable, and we could not have deployed our troops to rescue Europe, and the world would be a very different place. 
   If this language had been law during World War II, our troops would not be fully mission-capable, and they would not have been available for the victories in D-Day or Iwo Jima, and the world would have been a very different place. 
   If this language were law during the Korean War, our troops would not have been able to leave the country because they were never fully mission-capable. They were using broken-down World War II equipment, and if they had not gone to rescue the South Koreans, the world would be a different place. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill will not let our troops in Iraq receive the reinforcements and replacements they need, and let me tell you why. 
   To be fully mission-capable, there are three areas of judgment: personnel, equipment and training. Personnel, we can be fully mission-capable. We have the best soldiers in the world, and our units have the right number of people. 
   Training is a little more subjective. Most people say that they would be ready to be fully mission-capable. However, they do not train on the very same equipment that they use in the field. So there is some contention whether they are actually fully mission-capable or not. Some would say they are not, but definitely in the area of equipment we are not fully mission-capable. The reason: We take the best equipment we have and we put it in the field to protect or troops. We know it is the right thing to do, but our troops do not train on the same equipment they operate in the field. In fact, they could not leave the United States under this language. Right now, they go to Kuwait and they train on equipment. It is not the same equipment but it's close, it is not the same level of protection that they have when they get in field in Iraq. So they will never be fully mission-capable. 
   According to the Congress Daily A.M. this morning said Pentagon leaders have repeatedly told Capitol Hill they need additional war funds by the end of April. If they do not receive those funds by April, it will delay repairs, would exacerbate the readiness problem facing nondeployable units which already have equipment shortfalls. In other word, they would not be fully mission-capable, and the results of that, of not being fully mission-capable, is that our troops cannot receive the reinforcements and they cannot receive replacements. Our troops will be stuck in Iraq. Vote ``no'' on this bill. 
   The language in this bill ties the hands of our military, and it says that none of the troops that are in America today will ever have the ability to leave this country because they cannot be ``fully mission-capable.'' The Title IX language must be struck from the bill because it is very clear that if we do not strike the language, we cannot get any reinforcements out of the country, we cannot get any replacements out of the country, and therefore, our troops will be stuck in Iraq. 
   I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me the additional time.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding. 
   This bill is a good bill and it is needed to fill the gap. 
   I have heard a lot of hate for Attorney General Gonzales and the President tonight, but legislation should not be written based on one individual or two individuals. 
   In 1995 the Republican majority didn't pass legislation because Attorney General Janet Reno took credit for the fiasco in Waco when more than 20 children were burned to death. We didn't write legislation because government agents shot to death a woman holding her child in Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Instead, we went ahead and did the right thing. And tonight, Attorney General Gonzales shouldn't have anything to do with the legislation we are going to pass because the leaks and the lawsuits that have occurred from liberal Democrats have placed this country in jeopardy. 
   Do you realize we don't listen to the terrorist calls like we used to, we don't listen to e-mails or follow e-mails like we used to, we don't follow terrorist finances like we used to because of these leaks and lawsuits from liberal Democrats. But this legislation tonight will pass and it will fill the gap. 
   If you don't pass this legislation, you will be responsible for any attacks that could occur on America.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was very excited to be part of this ethics task force. And led by the able leadership of Chairman Mike Capuano and Ranking Member Lamar Smith, I was very hopeful that we could work in a bipartisan fashion to come up with a good, solid ethics bill. 
   We held over 30 hearings. We worked very hard. And I believed we were on track until about last August. And sometime during last August, the outside special interest groups got to the Democrat leadership, and this whole effort was derailed. 
   And what came out of this was terrible and I will just give you one specific example. This whole thing puts all of us in a vulnerable situation, but in this one specific instance there are six members appointed to the Office of Congressional Ethics, the OCE, and there are supposed to be joint appointments with the Speaker of the House and the Minority Leader. But there is a caveat. If you cannot get an agreement, and just hold off for 90 days and get your respective appointee in this position as one of the six members of the OCE. 
   Now, why should we be concerned that this was hijacked by the outside groups? These outside special interest groups exist to chastise and press charges against Members of Congress. That's how they raise their money. That's why they exist. And they're on both sides of the political spectrum; so all of us are vulnerable. These groups take sides in political battles, and use any scrap of evidence they can find to try to press charges against Members of Congress. 
   In fact, if you have ever amended your FEC report, there are examples of how they've used that as alleged unethical charges against Members of Congress. And nothing disqualifies these members of outside groups from sitting on the OCE as one of six members. 
   So we're all vulnerable by these politically motivated people being incorporated into this whole process to make sure that all of us have a chance to face charges, whether justified or not. 
   Now, just think of your worst critic. They're out there in the blogs. They're in the call-in for your newspapers. These are the types of folks that you will be confronted with if we allow these outside groups to inject themselves in this process. 
   And how will you respond? Well, the first thing you will have to do is go out and hire a lawyer, and those lawyers are about $1,000 an hour; and a minimum investigation, even when you're innocent, is going to a quarter of a million dollars. Now, some people don't mind that. Some have plenty of money to burn. But I think a majority of Members here in this Congress realize that even a false charge can bankrupt them and force them into a position where they have no financial substance. That will happen in this ethics bill. 
   This is just the tip of the iceberg of how this process got hijacked and how this ethics bill is not fair to Members of Congress. It's unconstitutional. And I think this rule ought to be defeated. And if you have a single ounce of self-preservation, you will vote ``no'' for this rule and vote ``no'' against this unconstitutional bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, rise today with reluctance and regret that I am unable to support the House rule change before us today. 
   Exactly 12 months ago I was both honored and excited to receive the appointment from my leader to serve on the Speaker's Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement. At the time, like my Republican colleagues, I was excited about the possibility of forging together a bipartisan piece of legislation that would address the fundamental issues that are currently plaguing our ethics system in Congress. Under the capable and civil leadership of Chairman MIKE CAPUANO and Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH, I was hopeful of what we could achieve. 
   For the past 13 years I have observed the House ethics process and came to the conclusion early on that our system was not transparent enough, not efficient enough, and simply not effective. In a word, our system was broken. Sadly, today, I am forced to accept that the Speaker's Task Force has failed its mission and has produced a partisan, undemocratic, and unconstitutional bill that I am convinced will only compound our current problems--and further frustrate the wishes of the American people for this House to clean up its act. 
   While the Democrat proposal is flawed in several substantial ways, its biggest and most glaring failure is that it turns a democratic ethics process into an undemocratic and partisan one where justice can be easily denied. Under the proposal before us today, an investigation can he initiated by the action of only two of the six members of the new independent Office of Congressional Ethics, OCE. 
   The legislation also mandates that names of the two members remain secret and kept from the American public and the accused Member of Congress. An earlier version of this legislation required a majority vote of the new committee before proceeding to a second-phase review of the pending matter. However, under the version we are debating today, a full-fledged review and investigation may occur without a majority vote of the OCE. This proposal jettisons the basic and fundamental right of democracy and fair play. 
   Mr. Speaker, in addition to being undemocratic, this proposal also contains several provisions which are most likely unconstitutional and therefore unenforceable. The most egregious provision is the creation of the OCE. 
   In its 200+ years of existence, Congress has never seriously contemplated handing over one of its most important responsibilities--that of regulating and disciplining its own Members--to an outside entity that is unaccountable to the American people unlike elected Members of Congress. 
   The legislation before us today would do just that. However, instead of abdicating our constitutional responsibility as specified in article I, section 5 of the United States Constitution, I propose that our task force goes back to work--and finds a solution which bridges our partisan differences while adhering to our constitutional obligations. 
   Our Ethics Committee is broken--so why not focus on and fix the problem instead of creating a whole new set of problems that will only serve to further undermine our ethics process? If Members of Congress are truly interested in repairing our ethics process--if Members of Congress are truly committed to restoring honor and integrity to this House--it's essential that we come together in a bipartisan spirit and develop a package that both sides can agree upon and support. Unfortunately, today's legislation falls way short of hitting that mark. 
   Mr. Speaker, in addition to abolishing basic rights of democracy and fair play--this proposal promises to undermine ongoing Ethic's Committee investigations and will likely impede Department of Justice investigations. In just one example, this legislation imposes an unreasonable period of time to investigate unethical conduct. 
   Quick and incomplete investigations can lead to unjust results--including charging the innocent and letting the guilty off free. It's imperative that our processes of maintaining the highest standards of ethical behavior supports and complements the House Ethic's Committee--regrettably, this bill will only undermine its ability to do its job. 
   On September 26, 2007, David H. Laufman, a former Investigative Counsel for the House Ethics Committee from 1996-2000 and a former federal prosecutor opined the following in Roll Call:  
   ``[T]he creation of an outside ethics panel will not solve the core problems that currently afflict the House. Real ethics reform  in the House begins with willingness on the part of both party leaderships to refrain from political intervention in the ethics process and give the ethics committee the independent, professional resources it needs to do its work. ..... Creating an outside panel, moreover, would simply create another layer of ethics bureaucracy that further slows down a process already characterized by sluggishness.''  
   At this time I would like to submit Mr. Laufman's entire Op-Ed into the RECORD. 
   Mr. Speaker, instead of maintaining and fostering the cause of justice and ethical behavior in Congress, this piece of legislation may actually thwart the efforts of the Ethics Committee and Justice Department to investigate unethical behavior and punish Members appropriately. Again, if the Ethics Committee is broken lets fix or replace it--but why in the world would we want to ignore the problem by creating an additional layer of legislative redtape--which will only serve to work against the purposes of the Ethics Committee--instead of enhancing its ability to get its job done fairly and expeditiously. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to serve on this Task Force and work with my 7 distinguished colleagues. Over the past 12 months I participated in over 30 hearings, listening to testimony from a wide variety of interests on this important matter before us today. 
   While various organizations expressed their support for the concept of creating an independent body--and their endorsements have been promoted today in this debate--it would be unfair to not recognize that several witnesses expressed their misgivings and concerns with the direction this legislation would take the House ethics process. Witnesses I suggest were more qualified then others to testify to the pros and cons of creating a new independent body. 
   Last March the task force met in private with former Congressmen Bob Livingston, R-LA, and Louis Stokes, D-OH, regarding their experiences from serving as cochairs of the last House Ethics Task Force in 1997. Both men had served on the House Ethics Committee and were highly esteemed by their colleagues. Congressman Stokes was a former chairman of the House Ethics Committee and shared the following statement with our task force members:  
   I strongly believe the current Ethics Committee structure should be preserved. I think Congress has a constitutional obligation to police its members. The mechanism exists to hire outside counsel whenever necessary, as the Committee did in the Abscam cases and also in the sex and drug investigations. In both cases the House received accolades for its work. A dangerous aspect of investigations by either a House Committee or an outside panel is interference with Justice Department investigations.  
   At this time I would like to submit Mr. Stokes entire written statement into the RECORD. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise one additional point that warrants discussion. Regardless of the outcome of today's vote, I believe it is important that this House give serious consideration to providing attorney's fees for Members of Congress that may become the subject of an OCE or Ethics Committee review in the future--but are subsequently cleared of any baseless charges. Under the OCE structure set up in this rule, it will be very easy for any two members to initiate an investigation--for any reason--without any real evidence--which in turn will force any discerning Member to hire a DC attorney to make sure their rights are protected and their name is not damaged in the process. 
   Colleagues do not be fooled--this will become inevitable if this rule is enacted today. 
   I want to thank Chairman CAPUANO for highlighting the issue of attorney's fees in his Report and also commend him again for his leadership and hard work with the task force. While I am unable to support its outcome today, I know that every member of the task force is sincere in their desire and efforts to help fix what's wrong with our current ethics process. Unfortunately, today's rule change falls way short of our goal. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me acknowledge that we started out on a great glide path of bipartisanship--but eventually the Democrat leadership was influenced by various outside organizations that refused to accept any compromise that involved maintaining the current democratic rules of justice and fair play. For example, the task force members--both Democrat and Republican--had agreed in principal to allow outside entities the right to submit ethics complaints to the OCE. 
   In fact, this provision was requested by these various organizations and highly promoted as a vehicle to bring much needed credibility to the current ethics process. And, while I had some reservations about it I was willing to support this provision. 
   Unfortunately, these same organizations were not willing to be subjected to the same level of scrutiny and transparency they wished to impose upon Members of Congress--namely the disclosure of their largest donors who may or may not have an ax to grind with a Member of Congress. One official quoted in an article on the issue stated: ``you can. imagine how upsetting this [provision] is to the donor community.'' 
   Indeed. 
   And that was the end of that. 
   In closing Mr. Speaker, let me also thank Ranking Member Lamar Smith for his leadership, experience, expertise, and tireless efforts that he brought to this important effort. 
   Let me also thank the capable staff that assisted us throughout this process, including: Paul Taylor, Chief Republican Counsel to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution; Ed Cassidy, Senior Advisor and Floor Assistant to the Republican Leader, and my Chief of Staff, Jeff Kahrs. 
   Before I end I can't help but note the irony in spending well over 100 hours of my time hearing testimony and discussing the significant ramifications of each provision within this legislation--the most sweeping ethics legislation in over 10 years--and the Democrat leadership decision to bring this bill to the floor--under the cover of darkness--and under a closed partisan rule which only allows 30 minutes of debate on each side--that's less than 30 seconds for each Member of this House to be heard on this topic. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that Members will not be fooled by the lack of an open and full debate on this important issue. I strongly oppose this rule change and respectfully urge all Members--Democrats and Republicans--to reject this proposal. It's time for the Ethics Task Force to get back to work and find a bipartisan solution to our failed ethics process that is supported by a majority of both Republican and Democrat Members. Anything less then a bipartisan solution will result in partisan failure.   
   Outside Panel Won't Resolve Core Ethics Problems  
   Now that President Bush has signed into law S. 1, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, it is fair to ask what sort of enforcement regime for the new rules Members of Congress can expect from the Senate Ethics Committee and the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, also known as the House ethics committee. As in so much of life, the answer is: It depends. 
   The Senate Ethics Committee has long functioned quietly and methodically to evaluate ethics complaints and allegations of misconduct in a professional, nonpartisan manner. That track record reflects the relative collegiality of the Senate and the inclination of the respective party leaderships to leave ethics matters ``to the professionals'' for sorting out. There is every reason to expect that the Senate committee will bring the same balanced enforcement to the new rules that has characterized its operations in the past. 
   The House ethics committee, however, is a different matter. Although the committee has undertaken some tough investigations in recent years--most notably, its inquiries regarding former Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) and former Rep. Bud Shuster (R-Pa.)--it has been cleaved by partisan turmoil and deadlock for much of the period since the conclusion of the cases against former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) in 1997. The nadir of this devolution occurred in 2005, when two seasoned attorneys on the committee's nonpartisan staff were fired in apparent retribution for their work on the DeLay investigation, and two committee members believed to be ``politically unreliable'' by their party leadership were summarily jettisoned. 
   Now, there is potential for even further disequilibrium in the House ethics process. At issue is the pending determination by the Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement as to whether an outside panel should be established to conduct preliminary review of ethics complaints and make recommendations to the House ethics committee on whether investigative action should be undertaken. 
   As a former investigative counsel to the House ethics committee who investigated both Democrats and Republicans--and as a former federal prosecutor--I fully appreciate the importance of conducting thorough, independent investigations. I also appreciate that the establishment of an outside ethics panel might enhance public confidence in the integrity of the House ethics process. But the creation of an outside ethics panel will not solve the core problems that currently affect the House. 
   Real ethics reform in the House begins with a willingness on the part of both party leaderships to refrain from political intervention in the ethics process and give the ethics committee the independent, professional resources it needs to do its work. All the new ethics laws and rules in the world will amount to nothing unless the party leadership on both sides refrain from politicizing the ethics process, the committee members ultimately charged with implementing them are committed to consistent, nonpartisan enforcement, and committee members do not have to worry about retaliation from their party leadership or fellow members.  
   Establishing an outside ethics panel also would constitute a historic abdication of the House's constitutional responsibility for self-regulation. Article I, Section 5, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution states that ``Each House [of Congress] may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.'' Although the drafters of the Constitution chose the permissive ``may'' rather than ``shall,'' it is clear that they intended to create a system of peer review where Members of Congress shoulder the responsibility for weighing allegations of other Members' misconduct. The establishment of an outside panel to evaluate ethics complaints would be an unprecedented deviation from more than 200 years of self-regulation. Moreover, it would be tantamount to an admission that the House is now unable to fully govern itself and needs protection against its own improper impulses. 
   Nor, if established, would an outside panel likely improve the House ethics process. First, none of the publicly reported proposals under consideration to establish an outside panel divests the House ethics committee of ultimate decision-making discretion as to whether ethics violations occurred or what sanctions to impose if a violation is found. Creating an outside panel, moreover, would simply create another layer of ethics bureaucracy that further slows down a process already characterized by sluggishness. Second, making informed assessments of allegations of misconduct requires more than the mere application of law or rules to facts: It also requires a nuanced understanding of the institutional context in which the alleged misconduct occurred. Arguably, the need for such a nuanced understanding is particularly great in the case of a political institution that has its own unique cultural attributes. It is possible that retired Members of Congress could bring the necessary perspective to bear if appointed to an outside ethics panel. It is less likely that retired jurists, academicians or individuals from other professions would be equally capable of making the necessary contextual judgments. 
   That the committee would retain autonomy to reject the recommendations of an outside panel ignores political realities surrounding ethics scandals. If, for example, the outside panel recommended that the committee initiate an investigation--a recommendation that almost certainly would become publicly known--the pressure on the committee from interest groups and the news media to accept the panel's recommendation would be formidable. 
   Clause 1 of House Rule 23, which comprises the Code of Official Conduct, states that ``A Member, officer, or employee of the House of Representatives shall conduct himself at all times in a manner which shall reflect creditably on the House of Representatives.'' The special task force would bring credit on the House by rejecting the idea of an outside ethics panel and recommitting the House to ethics enforcement marked by bipartisanship and consensus.  
   Congressman Louis Stokes' Statement on Ethics Reform 
   I strongly believe the current Ethics Committee structure should be preserved. I think Congress has a constitutional obligation to police its members. The mechanism exists to hire outside council whenever necessary, as the Committee did in the Abscam cases and also in the sex and drug investigations. In both cases the House received accolades for its work. A dangerous aspect of investigations by either a House Committee or an outside panel is interference with Justice Department investigations. I think this danger may be better contained by a House Committee. Also, the House has a great educational process for members along with an approval process to keep members from going astray. Neither a House Committee nor an outside Panel or Commission can stop a member who uses his position in Congress to obtain a Rolls Royce, a yacht, a million dollar home, and other illegal gifts. The current system worked when I had men like Floyd Spence and Jim Hansen as my ranking member because we approached the business of the Committee on a bi-partisan basis. We handled the tough cases and never had a dissenting vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, a bill that is both morally and ethically compromising. H.R. 3, sponsored by Rep. DIANA DEGETTE, would expand federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. Supporters of this legislation are encouraging the destruction of human embryos in the hope of one day treating diseases. 
   The timing of this bill is especially ironic as we learned on January 7, 2007 that amniotic fluid stem cells were found to have pluripotent properties and grow as fast as embryonic stem cells. This is yet another example of a successful ethical alternative to embryonic stem cell research. 
   To date, there are 72 diseases and injuries that have been successfully treated with adult stem cells unlike embryonic stem cells which have yet to yield a single successful human treatment. Proponents of embryonic stem cell research would like you to believe there is no ongoing federal research using embryonic stem cell lines approved by the NIH, however, the United States leads the world in embryonic stem cell research.  
   Embryonic stem cell research received no federal funding through the NIH prior to 2001 when President Bush established a policy to allow for embryonic stem cell research on a line of existing cells. This was the first time the federal government had ever made funding available for embryonic stem cell research. Since then, more than $130 million of federal money has been spent on human embryonic stem cell research and over $3 billion has been spent on all stem cell research. This does not include the billions of dollars raised in the private sector for stem cell research. 
   While bioethics and science have brought about medical advancements and breakthroughs, our society should promote the protection of human life and dignity in all its forms. We can promote science and technology while applying ethical and moral guidelines that err on the side of life. Science can and should be used to improve the quality of lives, to save lives, cure fatal diseases and bring hope to those who are suffering, yet I cannot support legislation that would require the destruction of human embryos. Adult stem cell research has provided treatments of diseases while applying ethical standards. 
   I will continue to support legislation that promotes ethical science and produces an uncompromised standard that values all human life. H.R. 3 would only further expand the destruction of human life. 
   I will vote against this unethical and morally compromising bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (FOSTERING CONNECTIONS TO SUCCESS AND INCREASING ADOPTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for adoption. Specifically, I rise to express my support for two bills we are considering on the floor today--the Fostering Connections to Success and Increased Adoptions Act, and the resolution Recognizing National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month. 
   It is no secret that I am pro-life. Life begins at conception, and I believe that we should do everything within our power to encourage and facilitate mothers to carry their child to term. It is my hope and prayer that every child will be wanted and loved by his or her parent. But I am not so nai 4ve as to think that this is always the case. Tragically, there are situations where the mother and/or father cannot care for their baby. Perhaps the mother is still in school, and too young to responsibly raise the child. Perhaps she is unmarried, and does not have the means to provide for her baby. There are a myriad of reasons. But while there are some in this great nation who would suggest these, and other extenuating circumstances are exactly why abortion needs to remain legal, I instead believe that they are exactly the reason adoption needs greater national attention. 
   Over the years that I have had the privilege of serving the people of the 4th District of Kansas here in Washington, I have worked with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass legislation that protects the sanctity of life, for those born, and those still in the womb. An important aspect of that effort, however, is caring for the child after it is born. Unfortunately, this is an area that is often overlooked. It is my hope that legislation before us today, H.R. 6893 and H. Res. 1432, will help remedy this problem. 
   The Fostering Connections to Success and Increased Adoptions Act takes great steps to assist both children and adoptive parents. It provides financial assistance for relatives of children in foster care that agree to become permanent guardians. And it includes educational stability as a factor when establishing a child's case plans. Provisions like these help to establish a sense of consistency in the life  of a child that is all too often lacking that. It also reauthorizes the Adoption Incentives Program, which can make the possibility of adopting more feasible for some families. 
   Madam Speaker, the choice to adopt a child is not one to be made without great consideration. There are risks and challenges involved with such a decision. We in Congress should show them our support and encouragement for them when they do decide to adopt. One way for us to do that is through H. Res. 1432. I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for these bills, and let's show our support for adoption, and the children and families involved in it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, gas is over $4 a gallon and people are upset. According to a May 20 Gallup poll, 57 percent of Americans support drilling in U.S. coastal and wilderness areas that are now off-limits. The tide is turning. Americans know we can solve this problem of high gas prices. 
   Just this week the Sioux City Journal reported the results of what they called the ``most important election in the county's history.'' By a solid 58-42 percent, the voters of Union County approved a zoning ordinance that will keep alive the county's chances of landing the Nation's first oil refinery in 32 years. They know we need to increase our energy supply, and that's why I introduced the Refinery Streamlined Permitting Act, H.R. 2471, a bill that would require agencies to give high priority to refinery applications that would result in greater capacity, a cleaner-burning fuel, and a reduction in refinery's pollution output. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans need substantive solutions to secure our Nation's energy future. Let's join together in our efforts to open up the coasts, the wilderness areas, and drill for more oil to increase our domestic supply and bring down the price of gasoline.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the brave men and women in our military. Thank you, and thank you to the families who have made so many sacrifices. 
   Today we are taking the first step towards defeat. No one likes where we are today, but our goal should be success, not to accept the defeat the Democrats are leading us towards. 
   I am very disappointed that the new Democrat leadership will not allow a true debate on what should be our focus today: what can we do to help achieve success in Iraq, and what metrics should we use to measure that success. That is the debate we should be having on the floor this week. Our military, our children, our fellow citizens, and the people of Iraq deserve nothing less. 
   Instead, this Democrat leadership is telling the brave men and women who serve in our military that their efforts have not been good enough and that they do not think they deserve the tools to fight this war. 
   We've been safe in the United States since September 11, 2001. But that is only because the Bush Administration and Congress and our brave troops took the fight to the terrorists. But it is by no means over. The United States remains a Nation at war. It's hard for Americans who do not have loved ones in the military to remember that sometimes. 
   We are not safe simply because we have not seen an attack on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001. We are safer today because of the professionals of the worldwide network of intelligence, military and law enforcement officials who continue to pressure and strike al-Qaeda and its followers. 
   September 11, 2001 showed us the danger of Islamic terrorism. It also taught us that we can't wait for them to come to us. We have to go to the root cause of terrorism and sever the root. 
   We are blessed with an outstanding military that has taken the battle to the enemy. It is very important that we take the fight to them in places where fortunately every American carries a gun--rather than on the streets of New York, Washington or Wichita, KS. And make no mistake, Iraq is where the terrorists have to come to fight. 
   Our most important duty as Members of Congress is to protect our Nation from ever experiencing the lesson of 9/11 again. For that reason, we must continue to focus on improving our national security, our homeland security and our intelligence systems. Today's resolution does the opposite and sends the exact message the enemy wants to hear. 
   Our enemy is not going away. The war in Iraq is a tough one, as is the overall Global War on Terror, GWOT. That is what the terrorist have promised in their letter, written by Ayman al-Zawahiri. 
   Just because it is tough does not mean that it is not worthwhile. The Democrat approach is dangerous and naive. We cannot put our heads back in the sands. Our enemies are ready to strike. Leaving Iraq will not mean the end to our troubles or to our enemy's plans. 
   Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's chief deputy, has stated again and again that Iraq is the centerpiece of Al Qaeda's strategy to establish dominance in the Middle East and beyond. A July 9, 2005 letter from al-Zawahiri listed al Qaeda's objectives in Iraq. Let me remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle what those objectives are: 
   1. Expel Americans from Iraq. 
   2. Establish an al Qaeda ``emirate'' in Iraq. 
   3. Extend a jihad from Iraq to secular states neighboring Iraq. 
   4. Clash with Israel. 
   Senator FEINGOLD and many other Democrats can't wait to pull out of Iraq and have introduced legislation to that effect. While I would like nothing more than to see our men and women home safely, I know that pulling out now would be a disaster for U.S. security and would only mean that those men and women would have to go back to the Middle East to fight a stronger, recharged enemy. Because the enemy knows that all he has to do is make life difficult for a couple of years and the United States will back down in retreat. 
   In this resolution, where is the Democrat plan for success, where is their plan to fight terrorism? What is the Democrat plan to stop al Qaeda from turning Iraq into a base of operations for worldwide terrorism if we leave? What is the plan to deal with Iran, who has already targeted the Shia majority, when they fund allies against Israel, America, you and me? These are the questions the American people need answers to. 
   Unfortunately, we have seen how the Democrats respond to terrorism, to those whose stated goal is to kill Americans and destroy our Nation. Their response is to ignore the problem and hope it goes away. September 11, 2001 was not the first time this enemy attacked us--there were numerous attacks preceding that horrible day--the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, the 1998 bombing of our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000. Our enemies are looking for signs that we will resume that attitude of ignorance. Today my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are telling our enemies that the United States does not have the wherewithal to fight the Global War on Terror. In fact, today's resolution will carry no weight--except with our enemies. 
   Let me put this war in perspective. On June 6th, 1944, General Dwight David Eisenhower sent 156,000 allied troops ashore in Normandy in the D-Day invasion. That is about 7,000 more troops than we will have in Iraq after the surge. 
   Now, Eisenhower was coming off of three pretty rough years in North Africa. The campaign there displayed the serious shortcomings in the Allies' ability to diplomatically engage the Vichy French, establish and maintain lines of communication and hold terrain in key locations. The Allied Forces were forced to retreat from engagements with the Germans in battles like the Kasserine Pass. 
   What if Congress, after assessing the difficulties in the North Africa Campaign, called on President Roosevelt to tie Eisenhower's hands? What if they asked Ike to pare back the D-Day landing party because it was just too risky? 
   We didn't have that problem because in 1944 Congress, like President Roosevelt, knew that we were fighting to secure the future of the world. After reading this resolution, I am convinced that the Democrats have yet to grasp the importance of today's struggle. 
   What will happen if we pull out now? What will the Middle East look like? 
   Iraq will become utter chaos, violence will only increase and terrorists will have an unchallenged base of operations. It is likely that Shia extremists would dominate Iraq. Iran is eager for this to happen so that it can control Iraq. This is extremely worrisome. President Bush was correct when he labeled Iran one of the axes of evil. We know that Iran is gaining  the capabilities to become a nuclear power. Iran is also collaborating with many radical Islamist groups, including Hezbollah and Hamas. With Iraq also under its thumb if the U.S. pulls out, this could cause a regional war that threatens Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Israel. It is hard to see how the U.S. could avoid being drawn into such a conflict. This would put our troops in an even graver situation than they are today, with less hope for success. It also will reverberate through our economy at home, with skyrocketing oil prices. 
   The Democrats need to understand the reverberations of defeat. 
   House Republicans take our role in Iraq seriously, and we want to see success. Our leadership has called on the Speaker to appoint a bipartisan select oversight committee to monitor and implement the effectiveness of the President's new strategy. Instead of taking this responsible suggestion, what is their response? Spending a week on a do-nothing resolution to embarrass the President and encourage our enemies. Even in the majority, they are still more comfortable with being the party of ``no'' rather than the party that governs. 
   Republicans on the other hand have a plan, because we know that success in Iraq means a safer, more secure America. We have proposed strategic benchmarks to measure our effectiveness. We are prepared to work with the Democrats to construct a plan for success in Iraq. The Democrat leadership will not allow us to present our plan this week because they do not wish to see success in Iraq, they want to pull out despite its effects on Iraq and the United States. We need to support our military, our new Secretary of Defense, and our Commander-in-Chief as they work to achieve success in Iraq and the Global War on Terror. 
   I leave you with a question a constituent asked me recently: If the Democrats get their wish and we pull out of Iraq without attempting to achieve victory, what happens the next day? Unfortunately, we know that answer because our enemies have made it clear: they bring the fight to the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today to honor a great American. Henry Hyde was a true gentleman and a greatly respected Member of Congress. Many words come to mind when I think of Mr. Hyde: leadership, aggressiveness, determination, dignity. Many sought counsel from him, including me. He was a tremendous orator, with a keen mind and a silver tongue. Members of both parties liked and respected him, because they knew that, regardless of party or ideology, they would be treated fairly, with dignity and respect. 
   Unfortunately, Henry Hyde has been criticized in the press for leading the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton, but the most important cause he led was to protect life. His political career was comprehensive, but it is his work to protect and promote the dignity of human life that has had the greatest impact. His efforts in this body are unmatched, and he leaves a profound legacy of challenges met, obstacles overcome, and grace in tumultuous times. He will be deeply missed, and our prayers go out to the entire Hyde family during this difficult time. 
   I join many of my colleagues in praising the life and work of Henry Hyde. The greatest tribute we can give him is to carry on his efforts to acknowledge the worth of every single human being, born and unborn. I encourage members of this body and our constituents to follow Henry's lead and make sure that we honor the value of life.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, being the gentleman from Kansas here, I would like to address the mention of the Kansas National Guard. 
   I was in Greensburg, Kansas, where the tornado occurred, four times since it has occurred and on Saturday the day after the tornado occurred, General Tod Bunning, the Adjutant General of Kansas, said he had all the equipment needed to respond to emergencies in Kansas. This was restated by him again on Monday and again Wednesday when the President visited. 
   So the Army National Guard in Kansas has plenty of equipment to respond to emergencies, and to reference that it does not have the equipment would be a mischaracterization of the facts in Kansas. 
   I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against this rule. There are two provisions in this bill regarding specialty metals that will make a bad situation worse. I offered two amendments to help correct this problem but, unfortunately, the majority did not allow either of the amendments. As a result, the Democrat majority will force high quality union jobs overseas. 
   My amendment would have also addressed the problems with the specialty metals and the country of origin specialty metals problem. 
   Can you believe that today we simply exempt foreign suppliers from the specialty metals provisions. If a product containing specialty metals comes from 18 other countries like France, Germany or Canada, they simply do not have to comply. 
   This provision is a competitive disadvantage for American industry and American workers. And here's how it works today. Caterpillar makes diesel engines for the Army. These are very common, commercially available engines that operate in civilian construction and trucking industry all over the world. This engine is manufactured by American workers in their Greenville, South Carolina plant. 
   But Caterpillar also manufactures the very same engine in Belgium. Because of the world demand, Belgium is also a qualifying country. That means that if Caterpillar makes an engine for the MRAP in South Carolina, they must go through the expensive process of documenting the nation of origin of the specialty metals content of every component in the engine. Or they could simply shift the production to Belgium and avoid the process and save money. This puts American jobs at risk because of this outdated legislation, and this rule denies us the ability to protect American workers in this bill. 
   It's simply unconscionable that we would legislate a competitive disadvantage upon American companies and American workers. And it's even more disheartening that Congress refuses to address the unintended consequences of this decade old problem. 
   DOD should be leveraging the industrial might of the United States to provide the best technology for our soldiers. But we're denied that ability in this rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (CONGRATULATING THE WICHITA STATE UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S BOWLING TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2007 UNITED STATES BOWLING CONGRESS INTERCOLLEGIATE BOWLING NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York. I am pleased today to have the privilege of honoring the 2007 National Championship Wichita State University women's bowling team. House Resolution 472 congratulates and commends the Wichita State University's bowling team for winning the 2007 United States Bowling Congress Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship. 
   Though known for its baseball and lately its basketball teams, the Shockers have had a long tradition of championship bowlers, and last year's team again made the region proud. The Wichita State University's women's bowling team has won eight intercollegiate bowling national championships, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1986, 1990, 1994, 2005, and now 2007, and has advanced to the national tournament a record 31 times. 
   On April 21, 2007, the Wichita State University's women's bowling team won the 2007 United States Bowling Congress Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship Tournament in Wichita by defeating Central Florida University four games to one in the semi-finals and McKendree College of Illinois two games to zero in the finals. 
   Wichita State University earned the second seed on the day after completing 32 baker games. On day two, the team defeated Ohio State University four games to one in the best of seven series, Purdue University four to one and Newman University four games to two to advance to the semi-finals. 
   On the final day of the tournament, the Wichita State University women defeated Central Florida University four games to one in the semi-finals and McKendree College two games to zero in the finals to win the national championship at home at Northrock Lanes. 
   Despite having a top caliber team, the championship was not assured going into the season because the Shockers had lost seven players from their top-ranked team from the 2006 season. The 2007 additions included six new members and three international players, Wichita local freshman Ricki Williams and two transfers. None of the bowlers had been in a championship game before nor a televised game. Yet they did not let the hype overpower them and instead let their talent shine through. 
   I want to congratulate WSU President Don Beggs and athletic director Jim Schaus for their leadership by creating a great university and an excellent athletic program. Wichita State is blessed to have two coaches, Gordon Vadakin and Mark Lewis, who are themselves members of USBC Hall of Fame. Head coach Gordon Vadakin has coached the team since 1978, leading it to the Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship Tournament 29 times and has coached the team to six national titles. Women's coach Mark Lewis and assistant women's coach Kristal Scott directly coached the 2007 WSU women's team to the national championship in Wichita, Kansas. 
   The 2007 national championship team is comprised of the following members: Daniela Alvarado, Ashley Cox, Elysia Current, Sandra Gongora, Melissa Hurst, Samantha Linder, Emily Maier, Rocio Restrepo, Ricki Williams and Felicia Wong. WSU juniors, Elysia Current and Emily Maier, were named the First Team All-Americans, and Maier was named as the member of the All-Tournament team of the Intercollegiate Bowling Championship Tournament. I also want to thank Amy Skeen of my staff who worked on this resolution and getting it to the floor. 
   Once again, I am very pleased that today the United States House of Representatives will congratulate and commend the Wichita State University's women's bowling team for winning the 2007 Intercollegiate Bowling National Championship Tournament. Go Shox.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, yesterday President Bush sent us his budget request for Fiscal Year 2008. This request includes his spending priorities for each federal agency. 
   I applaud his efforts to balance the budget by the end of the decade, and to do so without raising taxes on American families. I also applaud his recent efforts to reduce the burden of agency guidance documents through the Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices that was published on January 25th. 
   In addition to federal regulations, which are burdensome enough, the past decade has seen an explosion in ``guidance documents'' that are not legislated but have the same effect as regulation on American employers and can stifle their growth. As OMB itself noted:  
   The phenomenon we see in this case is familiar. Congress passes a broadly worded statute. The agency follows with regulations containing broad language, open-ended phrases, ambiguous standards and the like. Then as years pass, the agency issues circulars or guidance or memoranda, explaining, interpreting, defining and often expanding the commands in regulations. One guidance document may yield another and then another and so on. Several words in a regulation may spawn hundreds of pages of text as the agency offers more and more detail regarding what its regulations demand of regulated entities. Law is made, without notice and comment, without public participation, and without publication in the Federal Register or the Code of Federal Regulations.  
   In this spirit, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to examine the agency budget requests not only with regard to fiscal matters but also with regards to how spending priorities affect our economic competitiveness. 
   Taxpayer dollars should be used to benefit the public good. Unfortunately, we have seen over and over again that--often with good intention--agencies instead use taxpayer money to impose and enforce regulations that literally strangle businesses and impede job growth. 
   Regulation imposes its heaviest burden on small and medium sized businesses because it is harder for them to handle the necessary overhead costs of paperwork, staff time and attorney and accountant fees. 
   Richard Vedder, an economist at the Center for the Study of American Business, finds that federal regulations cause $1.3 trillion in economic output to be lost each year. This is roughly equivalent to the entire economic output of the mid-Atlantic region. 
   I have to imagine that processing this paperwork also requires a lot of agency time and reduces their ability to clean up the environment, provide better health care, improve labor conditions, make our transport systems more efficient, etc. If the government instead worked with employers to create a better work environment and a cleaner and safer nation, both sides could better accomplish their goals. The real winner would be the American people. 
   As we go through the budget and appropriations process, I hope that we do so with an eye towards keeping our nation economically competitive now and in the future. We should look for ways in which the government can better work with employers, and also for the best programs to fund to train our children and children's children for the 21st Century economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from Michigan for yielding to me. I rise in opposition to this bill. 
   I am really surprised by the procedure we have gone through to get to this point in this legislation. You know, under the underlying bill we had open hearings, we had closed hearings, we looked at a lot of the details and openly debated them and I thought we were making pretty good progress. But then, in the self-enacting rule, we have a whole bunch of new language that is dumped into this bill that has had no hearings. 
   In fact, section 18 says in this bill now, no rights under the RESTORE Act for undocumented aliens. It says: This Act shall not be construed to prohibit surveillance of an alien not permitted to be in the United States. 
   Undocumented aliens, no rights. 
   Then we get to what, the rights that the terrorists have in the underlying bill. Section 3 has procedures for authorizing acquisitions of communications, and there are 8 pages telling how we are going to protect the terrorists. They have got some rights protected under this bill. 
   Then we get to section 4, the emergency authorization. We have 8 more pages explaining how terrorists have more rights than undocumented aliens right here in the United States. 
   So then we listened to the gentleman from California (Mr. Lungren), who is the former Attorney General of the State of California, and he explains that, through the minimization procedures, that we are actually giving terrorists more rights than we do our own U.S. common criminals. 
   So what is the deal with this? It is really a mess. You have got terrorists at a higher status than undocumented aliens that are here in America and a lot of them just trying to make a living, and then you have got a higher standard for terrorists than you do for our own criminals. Now, why don't we balance things out here? Why don't we balance things out? You have tried to push this thing through without hearings, you have hodgepodged it together, and it truly is a mess. We ought to send this back to committee and do the right thing on this. 
   We want to protect the rights of American citizens, and we think that humans have a certain set of rights, too. But this bill does not provide it. It has mixed standards. It is a mess, and I think we should vote it down.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, they say that in America all you need to do to be successful is to work a half a day, and you can choose whether it's the first 12 hours or the second 12 hours. The American people probably expect double from their government these days when we have serious challenges to our economic and national security. So what is Congress doing? Are we doing what it takes to be successful to solve these problems? No. We're not starting business today until noon. Congress is sleeping in. Maybe we're on California time, but I will wager we will not be here until midnight. 
   Any Third World dictator would be pleased at the way we are operating today. Our economy is in a precarious situation. We learned this morning that oil is at $120, could go to $200 per barrel, that gas is at $4, easily could go to $5. We're still denying our intelligence community the tools important to keep this country safe. And Congress is sleeping in. 
   Many of us came to Washington sacrificing a good, normal lifestyle in our respective States' districts to serve this nation and work hard to help make America stronger, but we're not being given a chance to do our job. Kansans have been asking me for months, ``What is the government going to do about the rising cost of gas?'' In April 2006, the Democrat house leadership assured Americans they ``have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' Well, Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Democrat leadership to unveil this plan. Since 2007 when the Democrats took control of the House, gas prices have risen 50 percent. We have $4 a gallon, going to $5. 
   Today we hear that the House Democrat leadership has intentions to bring a $250 billion supplemental on the American people without proper input from Congress. I guess we don't have time. Congress is sleeping in till noon. As a body, Republicans and Democrats are very proud of our responsibility to oversee the power of the purse, but the Democrat leadership has completely undermined that power. 
   What is this defense supplemental appropriations bill about? We don't know. Nor does the chairman of the respective appropriations subcommittees. Why? Because the Speaker doesn't think it's important for Members of Congress to weigh in and oversee the appropriations process. We don't know if this package will give our men and women in uniform the resources that they need to protect themselves. We don't know if this package will address price of gasoline or the price of food. We don't know if this package will ensure that our veterans are properly taken care of. 
   The experts, the men and women, Democrat and Republican, who serve in Congress on the committee could answer these questions. We spend time overseeing the process, the funding needs of our agencies, but we've been cut out of the process. In other words, the people's representatives have been cut out of the process. How do the American people feel about a $250 billion monstrosity that has no input from their representatives? Unless you're from San Francisco, who will be represented in this bill? 
   Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, David Obey, and I are friends. Last year, as a part of overseeing the national park system, we went to Death Valley National Park in California. As fate would have it on that very hot day, we took a drive into Death Valley and the truck that we were in that the Park Service gave us had not one, not two, but three flat tires. With the capable assistance of Rob Nabors, the committee staff director, Chairman Obey and I changed all the flat tires and got ourselves back on the road. By working together we got it back on the road. 
   In many respects, the development of the emergency supplemental reminds me of that day in Death Valley. The environment on the House floor is hot and getting hotter every minute. The Democrat leadership is having a very difficult time getting this legislation on the road. I believe Chairman Obey would have better success if he enlisted the assistance of his fellow appropriators, Democrats and Republicans. Let us work together on this legislative vehicle, together through the normal process, as we did on that hot day in Death Valley last year. 
   This has been the most disappointing Congress in recent memory. The Democrat leadership shirks their duty to tackle the real issues facing American families. They've left Congress out of the workload. It's no wonder that we have the lowest approval ratings in history. A banana republic could not do it better. Mr. Speaker, don't slip on the banana peel.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for this. I want to point out that we did a joint review process of each of these earmarks to make sure that they were within the guidelines of what we have done in past precedence in the House. This particular earmark, like the other earmarks, passed this process. This is part of the Save America's Treasures program, authorized by the Save America's Treasures Act. It is a 50/50 match on a small portion of a larger project. It is also on the National Registry of Historic Places. 
   I think the fundamental question that we have is, do we think it is proper for Federal dollars to be part of this effort? I think that is what Members should base their vote on, whether we think that this should be a part of the Federal effort to save a historic place like this. 
   The gentleman from Arizona brought up a very good point. He said that we can't fund every request. That is true. I think that some requests we have had were culled from this because they didn't meet the past precedent or the standards that we had left in place before. Just by sheer limits on the number of amendments and the dollar amounts available, we have also created limits for this process of selecting these treasures that are part of our history and to save them. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding time.

I want to commend the chairman for his leadership in trying to focus our resources on the problem. 
   When the studies are complete, I think we will all be satisfied that we can move forward. The Smithsonian is a great institution and it needs powerful leadership, and we need to have strong checks and balances in place. I believe those are being put in place.

   The Acting CHAIRMAN. A point of order is pending. The gentleman may not strike the last word. 
   Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? 
   The proponent of an item of appropriation carries the burden of persuasion on the question whether it is supported by an authorization in law. 
   Having reviewed the amendment and entertained argument on the point of order, the Chair is unable to conclude that the item of appropriation contained in the amendment is authorized in law. 
   Under the precedents of July 12, 1995, as recorded in House Practice at page 145, and July 16, 1997, an amendment adding matter at the pending portion of the bill to effect an indirect increase in an unauthorized amount permitted to remain in a portion of the bill already passed in the reading is not ``merely perfecting'' for purposes of clause 2(a) of rule XXI. 
   The Chair is therefore constrained to sustain the point of order under clause 2(a) of rule XXI.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   Under the current law, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permits, under very stringent rules, the importation of bear parts for trophies. But this is only allowed from an approved management area in Canada.     
   Importation from other countries is prohibited because they are covered by the CITES, or Convention on International Trade and Endangered Species. 
   Also allowed under current law, other exemptions are permitted, but limited to Native American purposes, for medicines, for religious reasons and for certain scientific purposes. All of these require a permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service. And as far as the committee knows, the Fish and Wildlife Service is doing a very good job. 
   I also have a letter from the Canadian embassy. The Canadian Government is opposed to banning the polar bear trophy imports. Canada has strong opposition to this amendment, where two-thirds of the world's polar bear population exists. Now they're studying this through their endangered species group. We are studying this, as far as America is concerned, under our Endangered Species Act. And these two reviews are just about to be done. So this amendment is actually premature. And knowing that these two studies are pending, the Canadian Government has decided to oppose this. So I think this is premature. It should probably wait until next year, or they should just wait until the governments of the United States and Canada come to a conclusion. 
   Also, I want to note for the record that there are groups that are opposed to this amendment. These groups, besides the Canadian Government, include the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance, the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, the National Rifle Association, Boone & Crockett Club, Congressional Sportsmen Foundation, the Conservation Force, the North American Bear Foundation and the Wildlife Management Institute, among others. 
   So I think it is very important that we allow top scientists in both the United States Geological Survey and the Fish and Wildlife Service do their polar bear population studies and see what problems exist before we start to limit what's going on under the current situation. So I think it's premature. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe strongly in a balanced energy policy. We need to invest in alternative energy sources and we need to tap the resources that we have in a responsible manner. 
   The Department of the Interior is now completing a programmatic environmental impact study on the commercial leasing program that is authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This study is focused on evaluating the potential impacts associated with the development of commercial leasing programs for oil shale and tar sand resources on public lands in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. 
   The scope of this environmental impact study will include an assessment for the positive and negative environmental, social and economic impacts of leasing oil shale and tar sand resources, both the positive and the negative impacts. I think that is important. 
   This will also include a discussion of the relevant mitigation measures to address any potential impacts on the Bureau of Land Management's administered lands in Colorado, as well as in Utah and Wyoming. The Bureau of Land Management anticipates that the draft Oil Shale and Tar Sands Leasing Programmatic Environmental Impact Study will be issued just this summer. But this amendment would stop that from occurring. 
   The draft environmental impact study will be followed by an extensive public comment period, and a second revised programmatic environmental impact study will be issued prior to the final record of decision. 
   I believe we must pursue environmentally responsible means of developing domestic energy sources, and this amendment delays the responsible planning process already in place. 
   The gentleman from Colorado said this is important to our energy policy, and I agree. He also said that this was important to our taxpayers. I also agree. But the leases that were expected to come in under the Energy Act of 2005 have been taken into consideration in the budget we already passed this year. By stopping this, you will stop the income from those leases in fiscal year 2008. So this will cause us to exceed the budget authority. 
   I would suggest the gentleman from Colorado withdraw this amendment because it is subject to a point of order because your budget authority is going to be exceeded by this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would yield to the gentleman from Colorado, but I would request that he withdraw this amendment.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr Chairman, reclaiming my time to explain the reason the revenue would be depleted, there was planned income from fiscal year 2008 from the leases on the oil shale. So I believe, in my estimation, I am waiting for confirmation from the Congressional Budget Office, that it will be out of order.

   Mr. TIAHRT. For purposes of discussion, I would like to ask the gentleman from Utah if it is correct, and my understanding of what you're trying to do is offset what Mr. Udall is doing because he is stopping the permitting process not only in Colorado but also in Utah, your home State. 
   Is it also true he would stop the permitting in Wyoming as well?

   Mr. TIAHRT. So, Mr. Chairman, as I understand this, what the gentleman from Utah is doing is his very best to represent the interests of his State. And what the gentleman from Colorado is doing was try to represent the best interests of his State. So I think in fairness to the Members of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, it would be proper for us to adopt Mr. Cannon's amendment. That way it would satisfy Mr. Udall by restricting and limiting the permitting process in Colorado but allowing the gentleman from Utah to represent his district by letting the permitting process move forward. 
   So I would encourage the Members of the House to support Mr. Udall via Mr. Cannon's amendment and vote to accept the Cannon amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cannon). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (BENEFITS OF TRADE AGREEMENTS -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, today's Wall Street Journal ran an editorial on the benefits of trade agreements. It is clear that additional trade agreements are an essential part of our economic future if we want high-quality, high-paying jobs for ourselves and our children. 
   Several years ago, I formed the Economic Competitive Caucus to reveal the barriers, created by Congress, that keep us from bringing jobs back to America. 
   Lack of free trade agreements is one of those barriers, and it is clear that from the information from the U.S. Trade Representative's office that our trade has increased 26 percent with 10 of the countries that we signed trade agreements with since 2001, compared with the rest of the world, which has only grown by 13 percent. This success has meant more union jobs at U.S. manufacturers like Caterpillar, Boeing, and Cessna. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe America would have a stronger economy and more high-quality, high-paying jobs, including more union jobs, if Congress had approved 40 trade pacts like the Chilean Government has over the past 15 years. 
   Madam Speaker, let us tear down the trade barriers for American working families.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (IMPROVING FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE TO DEFEND THE NATION AND THE CONSTITUTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Madam Speaker, I am extremely concerned about our national security and deeply troubled that our intelligence community has been prevented from doing the job they need to protect Americans, For that reason I strongly oppose H.R. 3356 as it will only further tie the hands of our intelligence community. 
   The latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) clearly states that we are at risk of an attack. We have all read the reports this week about the very real concerns that our enemies intend to attack the in the next month or so.  Police forces in the nation's capital have beefed up security in response to these perceived threats. But without good intelligence, they will not know when or how we may be attacked--never mind having a chance to thwart any plots. Due to Democrat undermining of our intelligence of our intelligence community and our military for the past couple of years--through leaks and political games--we are less prepared to uncover terrorist plots and prevent such attacks. 
   We need to fix the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) so that the intelligence community can do its job. The American people know we need to fix the loopholes in FISA implementation that allow terrorists to bypass our intelligence capabilities. For several months Administration and Republican Leadership have repeatedly asked the Democrats to address this problem, and they have ignored these requests. 
   As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence I have been very disturbed by what I have seen this past year. The vitriol that Members on the other side of the aisle have for the President has clouded their judgment. In an effort to embarrass him, they have weakened our intelligence gathering capabilities and caused long term damage to the security of this nation. We do not monitor phone conversations, emails or finances of suspected terrorists and terrorist allies as we used to and the enemy knows it. It is time for us to strengthen, not weaken, terrorist surveillance. 
   Unfortunately this bill does not address the needs of the intelligence community. The Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell is strongly opposed to this bill: 
   I have reviewed the proposal that the House of Representatives is expected to vote on this afternoon to modify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House proposal is unacceptable, and I strongly oppose it. 
   The House proposal would not allow me to carry out my responsibility to provide warning and to protect the Nation, especially in our heightened threat environment. 
   I urge Members of Congress to support the legislation I provided last evening to modify FISA and to equip our Intelligence Community with the tools we need to protect our Nation. 
   I trust the DNI far more than the Democrat leadership that has clearly chosen to put politics over security. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and encourage the majority to bring a true FISA reform bin before this body so that the intelligence community can have every tool at its disposal to protect the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3773, RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from Washington. 
   I rise in strong opposition to this bill. I am extremely concerned about our national security and I am deeply troubled that our intelligence community will be prevented from doing the job they need to do to protect Americans by this bill. For that reason, I strongly oppose the RESTORE Act as it will only further tie the hands of our intelligence community. 
   If this bill passes, Congress would depart from the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission by making it more difficult and cumbersome to gather intelligence on Islamic terrorists. Our most important job here is to provide the tools to those charged with protecting our Nation and keeping us safe from those threats. In the last 6 years we have been kept safe in this country because we have had a sharp edge on the tools that we have been using to peel back the layers of secrecy on terrorists and terrorist organizations. 
   This bill requires a court order to gather communications when a foreign terrorist in a foreign country tries to contact somebody in the United States. Since 1978, from President Carter to President Clinton, there was never a concern. Yet now, after we have had attacks on our U.S. soil and are well aware there are terrorist cells in our homeland, the Democrats want to prevent the intelligence community from intercepting communications of foreign terrorists. 
   To my knowledge, no violation of civil rights has occurred in the FISA process. However, as this bill is written, the Democrats have opened the door for alarming violations of civil liberties by requiring the intelligence community to compile a database of reports on the identities of U.S. citizens that have inadvertently been accumulated in the process of gathering information. As the Washington Times noted this morning, apparently pandering to the left-wing blogosphere and the ACLU is a higher priority than the safety of Americans and even American GIs fighting al Qaeda. 
   Normally, under current guidelines, the intelligence community blacks out all these names and they never get distributed anywhere. They are just simply eliminated from the database. But now, under this bill, we see the Democrats requiring a list be sent to Congress. And we all know that we have had leaks here in Congress. You would think the ACLU would be opposed not only to compiling such a list but distributing it to Congress. We have had leaks related to the way we collect information on individuals through electronic conversations, we have had leaks about how we have e-mails that have been reviewed on terrorist Web sites, we have had leaks that caused our allies in Europe to no longer cooperate when it comes to tracking terrorist financing. For us to give this type of information to Congress would almost certainly guarantee a leak and a violation of the civil liberties of those individuals who it inadvertently picked up in the process of trying to find terrorists working within our country trying to do harm. 
   This is a bad bill. It goes back and dulls the tools, this edge that we have been using to keep the country safe. If it is passed and it becomes law, I would fear for the safety of this country because dulling the tools that have kept us safe for 6 years would put us in a much more vulnerable position than we are today. 
   Over 2 months ago, the DNI, Mike McConnell, the man charged with overseeing the intelligence community, urged us to modernize the FISA law. But this does not do it. This sets us backwards.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, on February 5, the President sent a request to fund our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq to the House. This week, Majority Leader Hoyer said to a C-SPAN audience, the Speaker's plan was to get this supplemental funding to the President by Memorial Day. That means it will take 120 days to fund the President's request. In the meantime, not one penny is going to make its way to the troops. Why? Well, the President has said, in its current form, this bill is going to be vetoed. He will veto this bill because it funds the troops on a contingency basis for only 60 days; 120 days to get the request funded, and then it only funds it for 60 days. It will be vetoed also because Secretary Gates says the Pentagon cannot manage a 60-day appropriations bill. The bureaucracy simply will not move that fast. 
   This bill will also be vetoed because it has too many strings attached. They are attached in the form of benchmarks. And there are more than a dozen of them, 17 to be exact. It will take more than 60 days just to see if the benchmarks have been accomplished. 
   In the 120 days we have spent haggling over this bill that funds the troops for only 60 days, we know it is going to be vetoed. In the meantime, the troops are waiting for the mine-resistant equipment that is funded in this bill to be manufactured and to be sent to Iraq. They are waiting on the equipment that they need. They are waiting on the equipment they need. The majority should withdraw this bill and send back a clean appropriations supplemental bill that funds the troops without the 60-day contingency, without the strings attached so we can  meet the needs of our troops. This bill does not do it. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. I thank the gentleman from Michigan. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill reduces our human intelligence capabilities. Human intelligence is one of the primary tools used to keep us informed about the plans and intentions of our adversaries. Human intelligence keeps our families and our military personnel safe. 
   Today, we are faced by many threats around the world, from radical jihadists to the emerging threat from rogue nations. One of our primary ways to combat these threats is with human intelligence, but this bill distracts us from that. And we have been in this predicament before. It is entirely probable that the downsizing of our Intelligence Community, and specifically the Central Intelligence Agency, during the decade of the 1990s contributed to the intelligence breakdown often associated with 9/11. We should have learned that lesson, but instead of putting more resources into human intelligence, this bill redirects resources to a new top priority. 
   The bill requires that the Intelligence Community determine the impacts of global warming. How could we have overlooked this? I thought the enemy was al Qaeda, who claimed responsibility for September 11, 2001. I thought it was Iran, who calls us ``the Great Satan'' and is actively pursuing nuclear weapons. I thought it was the Islamic terrorists that are attacking our young men and women every day. Now we find out it is global warming. 
   Now, I know that the world is warming. Kansas used to be covered by a sheet of ice 14,000 years ago; now it's not. But for the record, I would like to point out that the United States has 13 Federal agencies currently studying the effects of climate change. In fact, the President's 2008 budget request has nearly $7.4 billion associated with studying climate change. And according to the Congressional Research Service, since 2001, the Federal Government has devoted $37 billion to study climate change activities. 
   Why is this an intelligence priority? Is it really responsible to shift our resources, currently focused on North Korea and Iran and other threats, to the impacts of global warming? 
   Madam Chairman, this bill is not the right approach, and it does not provide the tools to protect our Nation's security. Intelligence is the first line of defense. Now is not the time to let down our guard. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 2082.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (SERGEANT JAMIE O. MAUGANS POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina for carrying this bill and also the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding to me and for the great job he's doing here in the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am also honored to have to carry this bill. And, today, Congress has the honor to approve the bill, naming the post office in Derby, Kansas, after a true American hero, SGT Jamie O'Dell Maugans. 
   Sergeant Maugans was the first casualty of the global war on terror from the 4th District of Kansas, a district that has experienced 12 casualties in this war. A Derby native, Sergeant Maugans graduated from Derby High School and attended Cowley County Community College and the University of Kansas before joining the Army. 
   When the terrorists attacked our Nation on September 11, 2001, Jamie was serving as an ordnance disposal specialist stationed in San Diego, California. Shortly after those attacks, he was deployed in Afghanistan in connection with Operation Enduring Freedom. On April 15, 2002, while disposing of ordnance near Kandahar, Afghanistan, Sergeant Maugans was killed. 
   The explosion also took the lives of three other soldiers, including fellow Kansan, SSG Justin Galewski from Olathe. Jamie was only 27 years old. 
   Sergeant Maugans left behind a loving family and friends in Kansas. I know his mother, Kathy Wurdeman, and his father, Bryce Maugans, his step-mother, Mary Maugans, and his brother and four sisters are very proud of Jamie and his service to this country. I am honored to have worked with the Maugans family and the Derby community on this effort. 
   Although this bill names the Derby Post Office building after Sergeant Maugans, this endeavor is not only a way to honor Jamie, but a way to honor all those from Kansas who have died in defense of this Nation from radical Muslims. 
   As the first casualty from my district, Jamie's life and memory are a representation of all those who have lost their lives in the global war on terror. I hope this effort will be a reminder to everyone in south central Kansas of the sacrifice that so many veterans have made for our country and our freedoms. 
   Let me take just a few moments to read the names of all those from the 4th District of Kansas who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan so that their sacrifice is honored:

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, no one wants to see the auto industry fail. I don't want to see this. This would result in millions of job lost. I don't, however, believe this is the right approach for the long-term viability of the American auto industry and the sustainability of millions of American workers. 
   In October, the Treasury Secretary came to Congress asking for a $700 billion blank check for the financial industry. I said then and I repeat today, a quick bailout fix might work for a short time, but it may not be long before we are asked again for more tax dollars. In fact, some have said the $15 billion being given to the auto manufacturers will get them through to March 2009. Then what? A quick bailout fix might work for the short term, but without addressing the underlying problems, we will be asked again for more tax dollars. 
   We cannot keep passing bailout after bailout without fundamental reforms to help American workers and businesses achieve long-term prosperity. The plan offered today offers more government involvement instead of incentives for private-sector solutions. We are placing risks on the American taxpayer that private investors are not willing to take. Furthermore, this bill does nothing to address economic competitiveness barriers faced by the American automotive industry. 
   I also strongly oppose the job-killing provision contained in this bill that would ban these automakers from leasing or owning business jets. The use of business jets by company leaders is not why the U.S. auto industry is in financial trouble. This provision is a symbolic slap in the face to more than 1.2 million workers spread across every State whose jobs depend on general aviation. Banning our automakers from leasing or owning jets makes as much sense as asking them to stop using BlackBerrys and laptops--tools that have made us the most efficient and productive workforce in the world. 
   I remain committed to working for a long-term solution with Democrats and Republicans who are willing to put the good of our country ahead of short-term fixes. It's the right thing to do.

   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Annie Work for her retirement from KWCH-TV in Wichita, Kansas. She has been a loyal employee since her first day in April 1986. 
   In this fast-paced media world where people are rushed and feel rushed, one could always count on walking into Channel 12 and being greeted by Annie's warm and friendly face. I knew that every time I entered the station, I would be greeted with a hearty welcome and then fall easily into conversation with her. 
   One of our favorite topics was golf. Her enjoyment of the sport and excitement she brings into the conversation about it is contagious. 
   Although I know she enjoys her job as the welcoming face for Channel 12, I am sure that Annie would say her proudest accomplishment is being the mother of five daughters. Every parent enjoys watching their family expand, and Annie has had the pleasure of welcoming into the world several grandchildren. 
   While Annie will be leaving the television station, I hope she will continue to publish the Urban News. This monthly newsletter founded by, published, edited and circulated by Annie helps the community keep aware of events occurring around them. 
   Again, I congratulate Annie Work on her invaluable contribution to KWCH, our community, and the Fourth District of Kansas. I know she will be missed by the rest of the Channel 12 staff, and I will miss having the opportunity to speak with her during my visits to the station. 
   I wish her all of the best in her retirement and all of her future endeavors.

<DOCNO>Mr. TIAHRT. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TIAHRT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my support for H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. This bill takes significant steps to make the dream of a college education a reality for America's young people, and I am very pleased that we are considering it today. H.R. 4137 addresses  a number of aspects of higher education, but there are two provisions in particular that I would like to commend. 
   First, I am pleased with the inclusion of section 706, which establishes grants for urban-serving universities. Our cities are facing unique challenges that require solutions that are tailored to their needs. Urban secondary schools have higher dropout rates and lower test scores than their suburban and rural counterparts. Urban schools struggle to recruit and retain teachers, especially in areas like mathematics and science. A larger proportion of urban populations are uninsured or under-insured. Urban research universities, like Wichita State University in my district, are well positioned and equipped to find real, meaningful solutions to these issues. They are uniquely qualified to train teachers for urban classrooms. They are able to use their strategic location to develop community-academic partnerships to develop effective treatments for diseases in urban populations, and rectify health disparities in their communities. The magnitude of these issues requires an investment by the Federal Government to encourage urban universities to coordinate, evaluate, and disseminate solutions to key urban problems related to education, community revitalization, and health and quality of life. The grant programs in section 706 are a solid first step towards this end. 
   Secondly, I am pleased with the promotion of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, STEM, fields. Success in these fields is critical to the continued economic dominance that the United States currently enjoys. The United States has the No. 1 economy in the world. For almost two centuries, we have been the envy of the world--a dynamic economy, a hardworking, motivated workforce, truly the land of opportunity where innovation has thrived. That status is changing, however. While our education system is languishing, especially in STEM fields that are so critical to our continued economic growth, China, India, and other nations are preparing for the future. They are educating their students in math, science, and technology and pumping out record numbers of engineers. Language included in this bill will help American students keep pace with their international counterparts. 
   I urge my colleagues to support these measures in particular, and the underlying bill.
