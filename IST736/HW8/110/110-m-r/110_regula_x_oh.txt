<DOCNO>Mr. REGULA. (45TH ANNIVERSARY OF JOHN HERSCHEL GLENN, JR. BECOMING FIRST U.S. ASTRONAUT TO ORBIT EARTH -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize John Glenn, a fellow Buckeye, on the 45th anniversary of becoming the first astronaut to orbit the earth. 
   John Glenn is a pioneer in the field of space exploration and science, and his achievements serve as an inspiration for students studying math, engineering, science and technology. 
   His landmark journey propelled other missions and projects such as the first moon landing, NASA'S Hubble Space Telescope, and the International Space Station. Our economic prosperity depends increasingly on science and technology, and it is because of explorers like John Glenn that America remains on the cutting edge of science and technology research and discovery. 
   I would also add that John's wife, Annie, has always been a wonderful, supportive partner in the success of John's endeavors. She also deserves our appreciation.

<DOCNO>Mr. REGULA. (EDUCATION: THE QUALITY OF OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, with the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, our nation made a commitment to closing the achievement gap between disadvantaged and minority students and their peers and to changing the culture of America's schools so that all students receive the support and high-quality instruction they need to meet higher expectations. 
   The critical part of this challenge, at the high school level, is reducing the number of young  people who disengage and drop out of school and, conversely, increasing the number of students who graduate from high school and go on to higher education or get a job in the workforce. 
   Because of the importance of improving high school performance, NCLB requires secondary schools to meet reading and math targets for all of its students that are established by the State--just like all public schools. However, secondary schools must also meet State-established graduation rate targets in order to meet the requirements of the law. The law also authorizes the School Dropout Prevention Program whose purpose is to provide grants to States and school districts to assist in the dropout prevention and school re-entry activities. 
   As several national studies have found, a staggering number of youth fail to graduate on time. For example: 
   About one-third of our students--approximately 1.23 million each year--leave high school without a diploma. 
   Black and Hispanic youth are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to drop out of high school. In 2005, 6 percent of non-Hispanic whites ages 16 to 24 were not enrolled in school and had not completed high school, compared with 11 percent of blacks and 23 percent of Hispanics. 
   A student's decision to drop out of school has long-term consequences that not only affect the individuals themselves, but the society at large: 
   Dropouts from the class of 2006 cost the nation more than $309 billion in lost wages, taxes and productivity over their lifetimes. 
   If the nation's likely dropouts from the class of 2006 graduated, we could save more than $17 billion in Medicaid and expenditures for uninsured care over the course of those young people's lifetimes. 
   If high schools and colleges raise the graduation rates of Hispanic, African-American and Native American students to the levels of white students by 2020, the potential increase in personal income would add more than $320 billion to the U.S. economy. 
   Increasing the graduation rate and college matriculation of male students in the U.S. by just 5 percent could lead to combined savings and revenue of almost $8 billion each year by reducing crime-related costs. 
   A high school diploma and further postsecondary education or training is critical in today's global economy. Dropouts are unlikely to have the minimum skills necessary to function in today's increasingly complex and technological workforce. 
   Graduation rates are a fundamental indicator that our nation's public schools are doing what they are intended to do: Enroll, engage and educate youth to be productive members of society. 
   However, there have been some concerns raised over the availability and quality of data on graduation and dropout rates and how they differ from State to State. This is based largely on whether the individual State has developed strong standards for its high schools. For example, even though NCLB has improved the reporting of data, a few States continue to have wide gaps in their data and can not accurately calculate graduation or dropout rates from 1993 to 2002. 
   To deal with this problem, yesterday, Secretary Spellings issued proposed federal regulations to establish a uniform formula to calculate graduation rates. In particular, States would be required to adopt the formula, largely based on a rate agreed to by the National Governors Association, NGA, by 2012. 
   I agree with the Secretary that this must be done. Only by knowing how well or how poorly States, schools, and school districts are educating students can we ensure that every student receives an excellent education.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), my colleague, who is the senior member of the Democrat delegation, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and colleague Paul Gillmor of Tiffin, Ohio. Paul Gillmor was a leader in Ohio. He was elected five times by his colleagues in the Ohio Senate as a leader and was President of the Ohio Senate three times. 
   He was a leader here in this House on financial issues, focusing effectively on legislation to protect the general public. Additionally, Paul's leadership extended beyond Ohio and Congress to his position as Vice President of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. 
   His awards from grateful constituents and community groups he represented were powerful evidence of Paul's diligent efforts on behalf of those who depended on his caring representation on their behalf. Five Ohio colleges and universities honored his outstanding leadership with honorary degrees. 
   In addition, he served his country as a captain in the Air Force with active duty during the Vietnam conflict from 1965 to 1966. Ohio Wesleyan University and the University of Michigan Law School are proud to claim him as an alumnus.     
   Our sympathy goes out to PAUL'S wife, Karen, and his five children. 
   To those of us who cherished him not only as a colleague, but as a friend, we will long remember PAUL and will always be grateful that he was part of our life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. I just want to say, too, that PAUL cared a lot about his staff. He was always a person that cared for others, and particularly his staff, and I want the members of his staff to know that we understand the great loss that they feel. 
   And I guess particularly when I left the Ohio senate, my staff person was inherited by PAUL, and we used to often talk about Celia Foraker, about Celia did this and Celia did that, because we both shared a great fondness for her. I know that PAUL felt that way about his staff here. It's a great loss to his staff to have a Member that had the caring concern that he did.

   Mr. REGULA. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I also would like to mention the loss of Charlie Vanik. I think for the people of Ohio, his greatest legacy is he joined John Seiberling and myself in creating the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and it was his leadership that was vital in getting that legislation passed. Millions of Ohioans and others enjoy the great outdoors in this 33,000-acre park that serves our State so well, and that was a wonderful legacy that Charlie Vanik left as part of his service in this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Madam Speaker, I know that Leader Boehner has already informed the House of the untimely death of our colleague, Paul Gillmor, but I want to just add to that. I will be offering a resolution of bereavement after we have finished the suspensions for the day, which will be very shortly, for those who might want to comment. 
   It is a tremendous loss for Ohio. Paul was a leader in the Ohio senate over a number of years, 22 years to be exact. He was a leader here on the Financial Services Committee. But most importantly, he was a person who cared about the people of Ohio. He made a tremendous effort to represent them well. It is evident by a number of awards that he received and so on. I won't take the time to go into that now, but all of you knew Paul. 
   I think something that many were not aware of, he was chosen as the vice president of the International NATO Group, the parliamentary group that is made up of something like 22 nations, and they elected him as the number two person in their leadership responsibilities. It is a tribute to him and to Ohio and to this body that he was chosen for that assignment. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like if we would all rise and recognize his loss, too, in a moment of silence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for yielding time. I could spend all day on this. I've had 10 years of experience with this, with the heritage corridor, and it's been such a tremendous asset. 
   As a matter of fact, our chamber of commerce brought in an expert on economic development as to what we could do to keep young families in our community, and she said your number one asset is the corridor, the trail, because young families want to use it, and they do use it. And putting a human face on it, not only do I see young families all the time out on the towpath with their bicycles, with their family groups, but I see handicapped people who are wheeling their wheelchairs down the trail. So they, too, can benefit from the value of open space, a touch of environment and touch of nature. 
   It's a terrific asset in our community. Over 3 million people use it. In terms of costs, this is not an appropriation. This is an authorization. So let's not be confused here by what it costs. That will be a decision for the Appropriations Committee to make as to how much they want to commit. All this bill does is authorize this expenditure. 
   But what we found is that we get a huge outpouring of community support, foundations, village councils, private individuals who support this. For every dollar of Federal support, there's probably been $10 of local community involvement because they appreciate the recreational value. They appreciate the family values that come from using these facilities. They appreciate what it means to have this kind of thing in our community. 
   The Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath, which was originally there as part of the canal system, had brought prosperity to Ohio many years ago. In fact, we had had a system of canals that were the original expressways of yesteryear, and it started with George Washington and John Quincy Adams who pushed this for people. 
   Of course, we all know about the granddaddy of all canals, the C&O Canal. That was saved. It was originally designated to be a highway. The highway folks said, yeah, this is wonderful; we've got 160 miles here of corridor where the canal and the towpath run so we'll put a highway on it. And Justice William O. Douglas got the Washington press corps together and said, ``Come with me; we'll hike this piece of history.'' I suppose that was a little strenuous at the time, but they managed it, and they wrote such glowing editorials about it that it was preserved. 
   And to date, it's the C&O Canal National Parkway, and all you need to do is go out there on a Sunday afternoon or any weekday and you see people, thousands of people, from the City of Washington and the area using the C&O Canal for recreation, for an understanding of environment, for an understanding of history. It's a terrific asset. 
   And I think what we're saying here is that other communities want to preserve their heritage corridors to tell the story of how their communities were built originally, and this is the case in Ohio. But you get all the additional benefits of health, of walking and bicycling on a towpath, the benefits of being together as a family, the benefits of having a community asset. 
   It was mentioned about the cost, but I don't think we are ready to charge for Yellowstone or Gettysburg. We preserve these things, and it's part of the national responsibility to preserve these historic artifacts and places that are very much a part of our Nation's history. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to support this bill. Let the communities raise their money. Let them go to the Appropriations Committee and get whatever they can by way of support.

   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to commend Chairman Rahall and the staff for their effective working on this. 
   This is a people's bill because what it does is allows the local communities to develop their heritage legacy. As Mr. Wolf pointed out, the historic corridors, as was pointed out also by Mr. LaHood, would bring these things to life. It would bring these battlefields to life to understand what happened there and how important that is to our Nation's heritage as a people, how important it is in the case of Lincoln, as to what his life has meant to all of us. 
   And it's no encroachment on local control. In fact, it's the epitome of local control, because the decision to make heritage corridors work is up to the people. In our own experience, as I say, we've raised over 250 million private dollars to match something like 8 or 9 million of Federal dollars. 
   But putting the Federal imprimatur on this gives it a certain status that allows foundations, that allows private individuals to contribute to making these corridors a success. 
   And as I said earlier, it enhances family values. It enhances property values. It enhances understanding.  
   I'll never forget going out, to our corridor, where we had a group of students from the inner city as part of a summer work program, cleaning up the right-of-way where we now have the towpath. And these two young students who for the first time in their life, saw a turtle. It was a whole new experience for them. I said to them, Keep your finger out of that turtle's mouth. 
   But it illustrates how historic corridors are so much a part of everyone's heritage, to understand environmental values, to understand historical values, to understand what has made this Nation great. 
   And I would urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. This is a gift to the people of all local communities that have a corridor.

<DOCNO>Mr. REGULA. (TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE RALPH REGULA, THE HONORABLE DEBORAH PRYCE AND THE HONORABLE DAVID HOBSON -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this tonight. You'll have to admit that I have one gift, and that is that I recognize talent. That has turned out to be one of the better decisions I made when I got Steve LaTourette on Transportation. 
   Madam Speaker, the Ohio delegation and this body will be losing two outstanding Members at the end of this Congress--David Hobson and Deborah Pryce. Both Members have been tireless servants on behalf of the people in their districts in our State. I'd like to take this opportunity to share some of the legacies they leave behind. 
   Dave was elected in 1991 to represent Ohio's Seventh Congressional District. He was appointed to the Ethics Committee as a freshman lawmaker, and it's obvious that the leader saw an element of fairness in the makeup of this gentleman and gave him what was, I think, a very tough assignment. I was pleased, again speaking of recognizing talent, to help Dave secure a position on the Appropriations Committee during his second term. 
   Speaker Gingrich made Hobson his personal appointee to the Budget Committee in the 104th and in the 105th Congress. In that role, Dave served as a member of the House leadership and as a conduit between the Speaker and Ohio Republican John Kasich. Knowing these two personalities, that was a challenge. John Kasich was chairman of the Budget Committee and, as he would say, the architect of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   As chairman of military construction within Appropriations, Dave led the efforts to provide troops and their families with safe, clean and modern facilities 
   both here and overseas through housing privatization. When you have to depend on a volunteer Army, it becomes very important to have good housing because this affects the decision of members as to whether they will re-up in the military. Of course, their spouses, who are impacted by the housing, always have a great word in as to whether or not that happens. So Dave made a real contribution to a volunteer military force by taking care of the housing problems. 
   Dave became chairman of the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee where he worked with the U.S. Corps of Engineers to develop a long-term approach--and we don't have enough long-term approaches in this body when it comes to management. He kept the corps from entering into costly, open-ended contracts, but made sure that it had the funding necessary to complete high-priority infrastructure projects. 
   Through his subcommittee, he also helped to bring a post-Cold War approach to the Department of Energy's management of the nuclear weapons complex. An example of this new focus was eliminating funding for the ``bunker buster,'' also known as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, a fancy name for a bunker buster. Dave stopped it, and it would have been a waste of money. 
   Congressman Hobson used his experience as a small businessman to work with the communities in Ohio's Seventh District to promote economic growth and job creation. Part of his efforts included bringing leaders from both the public and private sectors to help attract new businesses. Dave has a very good skill in bringing people together, which is important when handling the military and which is also important when handling the leaders of his community. 
   With four military bases in his district--Wright-Pat, Defense Supply Center Columbus, Springfield Air National Guard, and Rickenbacker International Airport--he worked tirelessly with community leaders and base officials to support the missions of each of these bases. It included his work to protect Ohio's military bases from the impact of the BRAC round of base closures. 
   Continuing to work, he began as chairman of the Ohio Senate Health Committee. He worked in Congress to preserve the basic values of American health care, including access, security, affordability, choice, and fairness. I think as one that parents would especially appreciate, he supported legislation to ensure fair access to immunizations for low-income children and to help small business owners and farmers secure better prices on health insurance premiums. I think this illustrates that Dave was a Member with a heart, with a caring for people, and that's so important in this job. He worked to modernize the Medicare program by adding the prescription drug benefit. 
   In all of his efforts, both here and in the State, he has a reputation for working in a bipartisan way. I think this is reflected in the fact that he was very successful in all that he did. I can say a lot more about Dave, but again, I think one of the good decisions I made as a member of the steering committee was to get both Steve on Transportation and Dave on Appropriations. The public of this Nation is better served. 
   Next is Congresswoman Deborah Pryce. She was elected in 1993 to represent Ohio's 15th Congressional District. Throughout her distinguished career in the House, Deborah has worked tirelessly in support of improving access to health care, especially for children, and I know the parents across this Nation are in her debt for all that she has done in working on children's health issues. 
   She authored the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of 2008 and the Patient Navigator Outreach and Chronic Disease Prevention Act--two very important legislative enactments to help with children and to help with health care generally. I know that she has been a strong supporter of Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, one of the leading children's hospitals in the Nation. In fact, I visited there once, and they were bringing in children from all over the country to benefit from Children's Hospital, and they didn't know that they were in the debt of Deborah Pryce for making that facility be there and be the strong leader it is in children's health issues. 
   She was also a strong supporter of GME, Graduate Medical Education programs for pediatricians. Again, it is so vitally important because pediatricians, I think, are a very essential component of the health care program because they deal with the early years of a child's life, and Deborah was a leader in that effort. 
   She was appointed by the Speaker to the House Rules Committee where she served from 1995 to 2004 and as chairman of its Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process. Then she was appointed to the House Select Committee on Homeland Security and to the Republican leadership health care working group on managed care reform. Deborah has always been a leader in health care, and I think that is such an important responsibility of the Congress. 
   She served as a member of the Committee on Financial Services. The committee, of course, is in the hot seat right now. Deborah is not there, but I think it illustrates the importance of this committee and that she served it so well in both 1993 and 1994 to 2005. She served on the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology, and she is currently the ranking Republican member on the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises.  
   She was the cofounder and cochair of the House Cancer Caucus where she has been an active leader in educating others on this terrible disease. Further, Deborah coordinated House Republican strategy and served as its chief House spokesperson on the landmark tobacco settlement among 40 States and tobacco companies. What a challenge. I think a bailout seems simple after that. 
   As Ohioans, we are extremely proud that Deborah became the highest ranking woman in the House Republican leadership when she chaired the House Republican Conference from 2002 to 2006. This required a lot of diplomacy, and she gave that program the type of leadership that made her very successful in that role. She was the fourth ranking elected leader in the House of Representatives. She has had other leadership positions, including as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, as secretary of the House Republican Conference, and as deputy whip from 1996 to the present. 
   Madam Speaker, the Nation has received outstanding service from these two great Members from Ohio. We will miss them. We extend our appreciation for their work on behalf of the people of Ohio and on behalf of the country. We wish them and their families health and happiness in the future. 
   I just want to say on a personal note that it has been a real joy to serve with Dave Hobson and Deborah Pryce. They're the kind of individuals who make service in this Congress something that we can all point to with pride and with the joy of fellowship in working with them and in helping provide leadership under their guidance for the many programs that benefit the people of this great Nation. Thank you.

<DOCNO>Mr. REGULA. (OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Madam Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the Members of this body on their support for the continuing resolution which we approved earlier this week, as it removed the provision that had prohibited oil and gas leasing in vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf. This action is indeed historic. I know, because I am one of the few Members of this body who was here when the moratorium was first placed on the Interior appropriations bill. This history is instructive and one that needs to be recorded. 
   The story began in 1969 with a 3 million gallon oil spill off of Santa Barbara. Until recently, a lesser known consequence of this event was the congressional moratorium that forbid exploration of the OCS. 
   The late 1970s were a time of oil shortages, lines at the pump, and even gasoline rationing. In 1978, President Carter boldly declared our energy situation to be the moral equivalent of war. Congress rose to that challenge by passing the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, declaring it to be the policy of the United States that, and I quote: ``The OCS is a vital national resource held by the Federal Government for the public, which should be made available for expeditious and orderly development ..... '' 
   Had we done that, we would have oil today. The ink was barely dry on these words before Congress began derailing its own policy, and by 1981 with the long lines at the pumps gone, Congress placed the first moratorium, which applied to only 736,000 acres in one area. Since then, the amount of  oil and gas resources we placed off limits has exploded to almost 266 million acres--18 percent of the whole Outer Continental Shelf.  
   Next, in July 1985 Secretary of the Interior Donald Hodel and members of the California congressional delegation announced a preliminary agreement to both protect and develop the California Outer Continental Shelf. Under that agreement, just 150 of the 6,450 tracts under moratoria restrictions would be available for lease, with the remainder protected until the year 2000. 
   Even that minimal concession sparked an outcry, including the specter of oil soaked beaches, and headlines in the LA Times: ``Drilling Plan Sparks Coast Battle Cry''. 
   At that time I testified and still believe today that the issue of leasing on the OCS is principally one of aesthetics, the Not in My Back Yard (NIMBY) syndrome, not an environmental one. Further, I said: ``Today we have no energy crisis, making it the ideal time to begin the safe and orderly development of the OCS. In the event of an energy crisis in the near future how many of us are going to want to tell our constituents that we were responsible for tying up this national resource?'' 
   The Hodel deal crumbled, and a bipartisan Congressional negotiating team was named to try to craft a new proposal. This group met 16 times between January and July 1986, but no consensus could be reached. Rather the Secretary was directed to consider all of the proposals in preparing the next Five-Year Plan for OCS Leasing and Development. 
   This effort was followed in 1989 by the President's establishment of an Interagency OCS Task Force to examine adverse impacts of lease sales offshore California and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. 
   In testimony before that body I noted that: ``The real effects of these moratoria have been to deprive the Nation of the opportunity to determine the size of its offshore resource base, to increase our dependence on unstable foreign sources, to increase our exposure to the risk of tanker spills and to increasingly force our domestic oil and gas industry to look to other nations for opportunities to locate oil and gas resources.'' 
   Not surprisingly, in June 1990 President George H. W. Bush announced his decision to put 99 percent of the California coast and the coast of southwest Florida off limits to oil and gas leasing and development until after the year 2000. Despite even that assurance the ``one year'' annual legislative moratorium remained in effect. However, on July 15 of this year President George Bush lifted the Executive Ban on drilling, reigniting the age old debate. and this week, this House removed the last barrier to exploring in the OCS. The issue is not behind us though, and the next Congress must be vigilant in ensuring that these lands remain open to exploration.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies. 
   As you know, I chaired the subcommittee responsible for providing the funding in this bill for the previous 6 years, and I am pleased to provide my support today. The bill provides Federal funds that touch every American. And it's important in serving as the backbone for our medical research, job training, and key education programs at all levels of learning. 
   I do want to compliment Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Walsh on the excellent job they did in crafting this legislation. Within the bill's allocation, they have targeted increased dollars in key areas that I strongly support. 
   First, as we continue to ask for more in the performance of our teachers and students under the No Child Left Behind Act, we continue to maintain the vital role the classroom teacher plays in student achievement. I am extremely pleased that the bill funds the Teacher Incentive Fund, a program that awards teachers for student achievement at $99 million. 
   Next, our Nation's future economic success depends on an educated population. An education that ends at high school no longer suffices in our globally competitive world. Therefore, I strongly support the increase in the Pell Grant for students, which reaches a new high of $4,700 in this bill. 
   Our Nation's biomedical research effort has made great strides since we doubled the funding for the National Institutes of Health during my tenure and led by our previous speaker in years past. 
   I am pleased that the bill will build on NIH funding in our continued attempts as a Nation to seek treatments and cures for the debilitating diseases that strike us, our family and friends. 
   Next, I talked about our competitive global economy, and I support funding to assist our current workers in improving their skills through the Department of Labor's employment and job training programs that are passed through to our local communities for use directly in these communities and for Jobs Corps, which gives our young people a second chance to participate in the workforce in society. 
   I could go on highlighting the numerous programs in the bill that impact Americans. But let me close by expressing my support for the increase in funding for the administrative costs for the Social Security Administration. 
   While the benefits Americans receive for Social Security or disability support are provided through mandatory spending, without good people and a sufficient staff to process these claims, the program would not run. Therefore, I support the $400 million increase in funding for the SSA administrative cost. Americans deserve effective and efficient responses to their claim requests. And with that funding, I'm hopeful the SSA will continue to improve and shorten its response times. 
   Again, this is a very good bill. I congratulate my colleagues on the subcommittee for their work in bringing it before us today. I urge my colleagues in the House to support this bill.

   Mr. REGULA. First of all, Madam Chairman, I want to express my appreciation to the chairman of the committee for including funding for the teacher incentive fund. It is so vitally important to the inner cities to be able to attract the best teachers and this fund can be used by school districts to do just that. 
   Too often in the school systems, the best teachers tend to flee to the suburbs and they also flee to the good schools. Where we really need the top notch teachers are in the inner cities because our cities are really facing a crisis in the sense that their percentage of those who do not finish high school is growing and is a terrible waste of human capital. We can't afford that. 
   And one of the important things is to get these students in the early years, first grade, kindergarten, second grade, third grade, to like school and to like to learn, and that takes a quality teacher. And this program, and thanks to the chairman we have the 99 million dollars and this proposal for some additional, allows schools to give some financial incentives to the really top notch teachers to take on that responsibility. 
   I have an instance in my district where a handicapped teacher has inspired a class in a low-income neighborhood and it has made a world of difference in the lives of these young people. 
   So I just want to express, again, my appreciation to the chairman and for the interest of the gentleman from Georgia in the Teacher Incentive program because I think it is one of the vital challenges in addressing the dropout rate in the big cities to ensure that these students get a taste for education and they enjoy the experience and they stay with it. I am hopeful that the States will use these funds in that way, to give incentives to the very best teachers to go into the toughest areas and inspire young people. 
   I will add that the Teach for America program does a great job in that respect because they send their Teach for America candidates into very difficult situations. 
   I hope that we can address the dropout rate prospectively when we have a nation where 31 percent statistically do not finish high school and we know it is much larger in the cities. So there is the challenge, and this program, which the chairman was gracious enough to include in the original bill, is one of the keys to addressing that problem. So I, again, commend the chairman and also the gentleman from Georgia for their concern to inspire and make it attractive for the quality teachers to teach in difficult situations. 
   The teacher is where it is. If you ask any group, as I do when I give a speech, how many of you had a teacher, maybe two that made a difference in your life? And every hand will go up, and that says so eloquently that we want to have teachers in the toughest situations where their students will at some time in the future say, yes, I had a teacher that made a difference in my life.     
   That's why I'm here. That's why I finished high school. That's why I press on. 
   I went into a charter school where there was a Teach for America Teachers and it was in one of the toughest parts of the city. And the teacher there said, as we walked through the door, these were fifth graders, ``What do we do in 2010 or 2011?'' Without missing a beat, every student said, ``We go to college.'' Now, if I had done that 5 years ago or 3, they would have said, ``What? What do we do? I don't know. Drop out, probably.'' 
   So I want to again commend the chairman for many parts of this bill that are important to giving teachers inspiration and making schools better so that whomever is here 25 years from now will not be saying that 31 percent of the students in the United States drop out. We can ill afford that in the competitive world in which we live. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. REGULA. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Madam Speaker, I have a little bit different approach to this. I have been introducing a bill in several sessions which would provide for retrocession of the city of Washington, D.C. minus the Federal portion  to the State of Maryland. This would give the people who reside in Washington, D.C. a chance to vote on Senators. It would give them a chance to vote on legislators. It would give the people who live here a chance to participate in the university system, the highway system, economic development. A lot of things would accrue to the benefit of the people if we would have retrocession of the city minus the Federal portion. 
   There is precedent for this in the fact that originally we had a portion of it retrocede to Virginia, and I think retroceding the balance to Maryland would make a lot of sense for the people. It would give them what they are seeking, which would be a vote not just for Congress but for Senators, for the legislators, and it would be a way in which they could more effectively participate.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation. I want to be clear, however, that I have long been an advocate of voting rights for the residents of the District of Columbia. Beginning with my service on the DC Appropriations Subcommittee in 1987, I have been keenly aware of this unfair situation within our democracy. Virtually every Congress since then I have introduced legislation that would give the District of Columbia residents representation in Congress. Voting is a privilege that our founding fathers intended every American to have, and giving this right to DC residents is a matter of doing what is right. Yet 200 years have passed since DC residents lost their voting rights and they continue to express dissatisfaction over their lack of voting representation in Congress. 
   Because of this frustrating situation and the numerous failed attempts to grant DC either statehood or a voting representative, I have advocated for a simple, sound and proven process to give DC residents voting rights. This process is known as retrocession or reunion. Through this process, the District, barring a small Federal enclave, would be returned to the State of Maryland, which originally ceded the land in 1790. 
   Retrocession would be beneficial for both the District and Maryland. The voting rights issue would be resolved, as DC residents would gain not only a voting representative in the House of Representatives but also two in the United States Senate. The residents also would gain new representation on the State level and enjoy access to Maryland's State infrastructure, facilities and assistance programs. On a very local level, Washington, as a city in a state, would regain the local decision-making authority it has been seeking for so long. 
   Conversely, by gaining the District's nearly 600,000 residents, Maryland would gain a seat in the House and extend its influence in Congress. With the Nation's 2nd highest per capita income, District residents would enhance Maryland's tax base and help create the 4th largest regional market in the country. 
   Canada offers a prime example of how this proposal could work. Its capital, Ottawa, lies in the province of Ontario and sends representatives to the provincial parliament in Toronto as well as the federal parliament as part of the Ontario delegation. Also, in 1790, Alexandria, Virginia was in a similar position to DC. Alexandria was included in the area chosen by George Washington to become the District of Columbia. A portion of the City of Alexandria and all of today's Arlington County share the distinction of having been originally in Virginia, ceded to the U.S. Government to form the District of Columbia, and later retroceded to Virginia by the Federal Government in 1846, when the District was reduced in size to exclude the portion south of the Potomac River. 
   I believe this framework is the most logical and constitutionally sound way to give DC residents the voting rights they deserve. Additionally, as I mentioned previously, the precedent already exists. Let's pursue a realistic solution to restore the rights of District residents and provide them with a better future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with regret to express my opposition to this supplemental appropriations bill. I oppose this bill because rather than the bill before us, we need a bill that cleanly has as its objective providing support for our troops, not a bill that is saddled with all kinds of extraneous programs, programs that should stand on their own merits, not be used to gain support. We need a bill that will have as its goal stability in Iraq, that will enable the Iraqi people to take responsibility for the future of their country. 
   The Iraq Study Group report has one recommendation that summarized the need for a clean supplemental that will provide the funds necessary to achieve the goals we all want for the future of our forces in this conflict, and I quote from this report: ``If the Iraqi Government demonstrates political will and makes substantial progress towards the achievement of milestones on national reconciliation, security and governance, the United States should make clear its willingness to continue training, assistance and support for Iraq's security forces and to continue political, military and economic support for the Iraq Government.'' And this is important: ``As Iraq becomes more capable of governing, defending and sustaining itself, the U.S. military and civilian presence in Iraq can be reduced.'' 
   That is really what the goal of this supplemental is. I think it is vitally important that we have a clean bill that makes clear our goal of success in Iraq, that will reflect honorably on the sacrifices that have been made by the Armed Forces of our Nation, that is part of securing for the people of our  country freedom from terrorist threats. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this collection of unrelated expenditures. Vote instead for a clean bill to support our troops.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Chairman RAHALL and my colleagues in the Senate for all of their hard work on this bill. It is my pleasure today to speak on behalf of S. 2739. 
   I rise to highlight Title IV of this comprehensive natural resources bill, which reauthorizes the National Heritage Area program. Heritage Areas allow communities to preserve and maintain places of cultural and historical importance so that future generations can enjoy them. These areas also provide important recreational opportunities for local families and visitors who come from all over the country. They relieve the Federal Government of the burden of permanently maintaining these spaces as national parks at a time when the National Park System is overburdened. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a tremendous benefit to the American people. National Heritage Areas provide opportunities for the health, education, and recreation of the American people in their communities. In my State of Ohio, the Ohio and Erie Canalway is one of the many great examples of the success of this program. The Ohio and Erie Canal was originally created nearly two centuries ago in an attempt to bring Ohio out of economic stagnation by making the State a vital link in the waterways that connect the Eastern States with the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, Ohio excelled to become one of the most prosperous States within 20 years of the canal's creation. Today, that heritage is shared with the people as they enjoy the many of the benefits Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath. With over 3 million users a year, this one of several National Heritage Areas clearly highlights the success of this program. 
   I also want to emphasize the fiscal responsibility of the heritage area provisions. This bill will not provide money to managing entities unless they provide matching funds from other sources. For example, within the Ohio and Erie Canalway, for the $8 million in Federal funding that has been secured for this area, over $270 million in State, local, and private contributions have been leveraged. 
   Mr. Speaker, the National Heritage Area program has been a successful program for nearly 10 years. I believe it will continue to be a successful program as it has been an efficient use of the taxpayers' money while preserving historic and cultural landmarks for communities across this country. I ask my colleagues to support S. 2739.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Chairman and Members of this body, I am sure that the sponsor thinks he is going to improve the operations of the government, but I think this is probably offered for political purposes. 
   We cannot deal with the constitutional responsibilities in this bill, and the Vice President does have constitutional responsibilities as President of the Senate. The Senate Legislative Branch appropriations bill provides funding for his salary and legislative operating expenses. In fiscal year 2008, his requests equal $2.3 million. 
   I think it's important that I take time to oppose this amendment because it is setting a bad precedent. I think the sponsor must be making an assumption that they will never have a Vice President, because you are setting a precedent here that might come back to haunt you at some time in the future. 
   The Vice President's office also receives $4.8 million to fund the executive branch duties of the Vice President and pay for his residence. We decided that, for security reasons, the Vice President needs to have a residence. There was a time that that was not the case. And I don't think that because some Members may not like the current Vice President, or any future Vice President, doesn't mean Congress should use its power of the purse to eliminate funding for the office. That is not how the Founding Fathers envisioned the separation of powers operating. 
   Eliminating funding to maintain the Vice President's residence and the 25 Federal employees funded by this object is irresponsible. I think it is disrespectful of the Constitution and the Office of the Vice President. Whether we agree or not, the Vice President's office serves an important executive and legislative function. 
   And let me just say again to my colleagues, this sets a very bad precedent. Where do we stop if we determine that we're going to, by using the power of the purse, pass judgment on the policies of people that serve in government? 
   It's a political activity. It's a political attempt to embarrass the Vice President. I would hope my colleagues reject this. 
   Just remember, you may have a Vice President, too. And once you set a precedent, I'm not sure that you would want that to be part of your legacy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. Points I want to make; First of all, we have reduced the level of earmarks. 
   Number two, our title is Representative to the Congress. As such, we have a responsibility to represent the needs of our districts. Earmarks provide a vehicle to do that. 
   Third, earmarks if you follow them through, are great generators of private investment. It certainly happened in my district. A lot of good things get done because we have the stimulus of an earmark. 
   Fourth, we have a right to decide the priorities of our district. We are better equipped to do that than somebody in the bureaucracy and in the executive branch. Constitutionally, we have the responsibility to make policy. Their job is to execute policy downtown. 
   Fifth, Congress has a transparent and open process. This is the result of the efforts of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. That was the discussion we had. We have accomplished that. This is why the gentleman from California can question this earmark, earmarks generally, because we have a transparent process. People know what the earmark is, what it does, and who sponsored it. We have had Member after Member come in and defend their earmarks today, and that is the way it should be. If you eliminate the earmarking process, you move it solely to the administration, and where is the transparency in the administration; or, we revert to the old days where a few people in conference were adding projects with very little opportunity for the Members of the body to look at them or challenge them. 
   I would think that the gentleman from California would be pleased that we have the transparency that is part of this and allows him or others to question earmarks. I think those who put in the earmarks have to be prepared to defend the validity of what they have offered. So this is a good process, and this is a result of our discussion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express deep sadness on the sudden passing of our colleague in this House and a member of the Ohio delegation, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones. 
   August was a busy month for us. We have participated in events in our districts and meetings in our offices. Many of us participated in our party's presidential conventions. Unfortunately, too many of these tasks and goals were cut short and cut short too early for our colleague. We grieve her loss here this evening. 
   Throughout our time together in this House, the members of the Ohio delegation have been a congenial group and not a partisan one. We regularly worked together to share common responsibilities and actions to improve and strengthen our State. Stephanie brought energy and enthusiasm to our delegation and to our work, and we will miss her terribly. 
   As you will hear throughout this evening's remarks by my colleagues, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones is a Member who held many firsts in our delegation. And I won't repeat those because many Members will touch on it. 
   To me, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones was my friendly, outgoing, and upbeat colleague. We often traveled back and forth together in the same plane from Ohio to Washington for our congressional session. I will miss her wonderful personality and the energy she brought to our delegation and to this House. 
   This morning, when I was getting ready to leave for the airport, I said to my wife, ``You know, I'm going to really miss Stephanie because we would always be on the plane together most the time, the same flight, and she was always so upbeat and she had the common expression, `Well, how are you doing today? How are you doing today?' '' 
   Well, we did well together, but I will miss her energy and personality that she brought to the delegation and to this House. I worked with Stephanie--her district was not far from mine--and we had a common interest in furthering the medical facilities in Cleveland, Ohio, some of the best in the United States; 
   and it was a pleasure always to work with her and to enjoy her boundless enthusiasm and good nature. 
   And certainly on behalf of my colleagues in the Ohio delegation, we express our sincere sympathy to her son, Mervyn Jones, and to her sister, Barbara Walker, as well as to her thousands of constituents and to her devoted staff.

   I also want to comment on one other thing, and that is that thousands of people in East Cleveland, in her district, have better health care today than they would have without Stephanie. She focused on the health care assets of East Cleveland, some of the best in the Nation, and as a result, the people that she represented have a better chance to take advantage of the health care facilities. And that's a legacy of Stephanie that most people aren't aware of and yet touches the lives of literally thousands of people. 
   And I congratulate the gentlewoman from Ohio for having this Special Order tonight because Stephanie was special.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   I simply want to compliment Chairman Serrano in providing great leadership in the financial services area. This is one of the few bills that was substantially under the President's request, and in fact, it's more than $1 billion under the President's request, which was kind of unusual. 
   But more importantly, I won't begin to get into all the features of the bill, but because of the news in a recent editorial in The Post, we note that Mayor Fenty and Chancellor Ray are trying to improve the school system of the City of Washington. That's a huge challenge; and in this bill, we've tried to give them as much support as possible in their effort to improve the opportunities for the young people in the Washington, D.C., community. This city should be a leader in education. 
   Secondly, and there's language in here and I don't know how many of you noted in The Post a couple of weeks ago a story indicating that D.C. has the highest HIV/AIDS rate of any major capital in the world. That's shameful and should not be, and we've provided language in this bill to not only provide help to other countries but to provide help to this city to address that problem and a lot of other features which, regarding the interests of time, I won't get into.  
   As ranking member of the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee, I would like to thank Chairman Serrano for creating such a fair and open environment in composing the Financial Services and General Government portion of this bill. Chairman Serrano has provided great leadership, knowledge, and an inclusive spirit while shepherding this bill through. Additionally, my colleagues on the subcommittee have provided valuable insight to the final product before us today. Lastly, but equally as important, I would like to recognize the hard work, dedication and expertise of the subcommittee staff on both sides of the aisle without which none of this would be possible. 
   The Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill allocates $20.6 billion in discretionary budget authority. By taking into consideration the priorities of the President and the Members of the House and Senate, we have produced a bill that meets the needs of Americans, and the operations of our government while staying $1.1 billion below the President's budget request and approximately $800 million below the House request. I appreciate the efforts of our counterparts in the Senate in helping us put forth this compromise. 
   Although the subcommittee's allocation is below the President's request, it is still a significant increase from fiscal year 2007 and contains more than adequate funds for the 32 agencies in this bill to fulfill their missions. The bill provides funding for a diverse number of agencies that affect the lives of all Americans. The agencies funded in this bill regulate the financial and telecommunications industries, collect taxes and provide taxpayer assistance, protect consumers from harmful products, lend a helping hand to small businesses and disadvantaged communities by providing them with capital, support the operations of the White House and Federal Judiciary, provide Federal payments to the District of Columbia, operate and maintain Federal buildings, manage our Federal workforce, which is expected to experience tremendous attrition rates over the next 10 years, assists in the administration of Federal elections and protects consumers and investors from fraudulent practices. 
   At this time I would like to highlight several items of importance to me. 
   I am particularly pleased at the $97 million for Small Business Development Centers, an increase of nearly $10 million. The Small Business Development Centers account is the Small Business Administration's primary method of providing management assistance to small businesses. In my State of Ohio we have over 889,000 small businesses, and every dollar invested in the OHIO SBDC network leverages at least $2. This program is vital to the life of small business. 
   I am also encouraged to see $1.1 million for Treasury's Office of Financial Education, an increase of approximately $400,000 over the President's request. The increase is targeted toward improving the National Strategy for Financial Literacy and expanding efforts at financial literacy in elementary schools and high schools. Financial literacy is a very important life skill, and I look forward to working with the chairman to further develop this initiative to ensure maximum programmatic impact. 
   Additionally, the bill increases essential funding for the Internal Revenue Service to close the nearly $300 billion tax gap. Closing the tax gap is critical as most Americans do not mind paying their fair share of taxes as long as they know others are doing the same. Furthermore, $3.6 billion is set aside for taxpayer support services activities aimed at tax return preparation, the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate and IRS outreach and education efforts to serve taxpayers by helping them understand their tax obligations before they file. These activities have been steadily reduced in recent years and are in need of a boost. 
   Last, but not least, I am supportive of the funding appropriated in the bill to improve education in the District of Columbia. We are in a unique position to help the new Chancellor and Mayor provide a better future for the children of Washington. The children in Washington, DC, have been at a disadvantage for many years, and I look forward to working with the Mayor to enhance the school system to give the children of DC a chance to succeed. 
   Also, the bill contains language regarding HIV/AIDS in DC. One in every 20 city residents in Washington, DC, is thought to have HIV, and one in every 50 has AIDS; these rates are higher than those in many poorer countries. I find this astonishing and disheartening. I look forward to working with my colleagues, the Mayor, and the administration to address this serious problem. 
   Chairman Serrano has done a fair job in allocating funds to the various agencies within the bill. However, I do have a couple of spending concerns, which I would like to outline. 
   Primarily, I am concerned about $125 million added to this bill in unrequested funding for election assistance grants. This program has not been authorized to receive funding in 2008, and there still remains a large carryover balance, which leads me to believe this money cannot be used effectively before the 2008 elections. 
   I am also concerned about the elimination of funding for the Department of Homeland Security to begin planning their new headquarters building. This funding is critical to begin relocating DHS employees who are currently spread out all across Washington, DC, under one roof. 
   Lastly, I am pleased to note that all of the contentious policy riders have been eliminated from the bill. Therefore, I strongly support the Financial Services and General Government section of this bill.

   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5036. 
   CBO estimates that this bill will cost the taxpayers $685 million to reimburse jurisdictions for the cost of converting to voting systems that produce paper ballots, manual audits and hand recounts. We have already provided the States with $3.2 billion in grants to implement the Help America Vote Act, including $115 million appropriated in fiscal year 2008. 
   The administration of elections is a State and local responsibility. Many jurisdictions have already decided to change their election systems to require paper ballots using their own resources. This bill would encourage other jurisdictions to rush the implementation of new paper ballot systems for the November election. 
   In written testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee, the bipartisan Election Assistance Commission stated: ``Experience has taught election officials that a minimum of 6 to 8 months, and preferably longer, is needed to effectively implement a new voting system and to educate the voting public about how to use the system. Consistency in procedures and process is key in creating a secure, accurate and effective election. As we have seen in Ohio and in several other jurisdictions, the hasty attaching of a printer to some machines has led to paper jams, long lines, and confusion. While jurisdictions may find a voter verified paper audit trail to be suitable for their needs, hastily requiring such a thing for this year's election has the potential to lead to more problems than it can possibly solve. At this point in the election cycle, election officials are better served by sharpening their already existing policies than trying to apply patchwork fixes that could lead to greater problems.'' 
   That was from the Election Assistance Commission which is a bipartisan group. 
   I would add, this bill will not only put the country further in debt, but would encourage jurisdictions to implement new voting systems between the primaries and general election, leading to additional election problems. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislative proposal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this. When I was chairman of the committee, we eliminated the Bureau of Mines in 1995. Nobody missed it. The functions are carried on by the USGS very effectively. It is just one of those things that is not needed. I think it would be a big mistake to put it back in place. 
   The amendment provides for 200 employees out of USGS. Why take them away from where they are doing a good job? The mining programs have worked very effectively since 1995, the time at which we eliminated this. It saves about $100 million. I think it would be a big mistake to put another, put it back in place. 
   I hope that the Members will join me in opposing this amendment.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Pearce amendment. This amendment would simply re-create an agency that was dismantled in 1995. As Chairman of the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee at that time, I worked to close the Bureau of Mines which the proposed amendment's agency resembles, in an effort to balance the budget through smaller, more effective government. With its closure, almost $100 million, or 66%, of the Bureau of Mines' 1995 programs ceased. However, certain critical minerals information activities moved to the US Geological Survey. This meant we receive the needed information on our mineral resources using far less money than in the past. 
   Since taking over the minerals information functions, the USGS has done an excellent job of producing critical minerals information and in fact has broadened the role of the minerals information group by providing vital statistics and insight to help commerce, industry, and security. 
   The USGS is the sole provider of mineral resource assessments and information in the federal government. To fragment this program once again by creating a new bureaucracy in government would not improve its functionality or serve American taxpayers' interests. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not create anything new that is substantive. The only thing the amendment will create is a title of new agency, move some people around, and employ 100 new bureaucrats in administrative positions. Why do we need 100 administrative positions to oversee 200 scientists who were already working effectively at the USGS? 
   Further, the amendment proposes a $30 million budget, which is more than double the current funding for this function. In our current budget climate, it makes no sense to add this new agency burden to government when the work this agency is proposed to do is already being done at the USGS effectively, with less expense to the taxpayer. 
   This amendment will only fracture our current system of attaining knowledge on our country's mineral resources, create a new bureaucracy and waste tax dollars. I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.

   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5803. 
   Historically, the administration of elections is a State and local responsibility. This includes providing for a backup method of voting if a piece of equipment fails or in the case of an emergency. This bill proposes to use Federal taxpayer dollars to fund an activity that State and local election officials are already performing. As stated in the minority views on this bill, ``H.R. 5803 is an unnecessary and costly solution to a problem that doesn't exist.'' 
   The elections are only a few months away, and encouraging jurisdictions to change their election procedures now, after the primaries, could lead to confusion on Election Day. 
   In addition, the administration strongly opposes this bill since this is over $1 billion of funding that has already been appropriated that is currently available to the States to prepare for and conduct the 2008 elections. 
   Finally, even if this authorizing bill were enacted into law, no appropriations will be provided to fund it. We're approaching the August recess, and no fiscal year 2009 appropriation bills have cleared either body. According to media reports, only the Defense and Military Construction bills have even a chance of being enacted before the transition to the new administration. This means that there will be no financial services and general government appropriations bills to fund this program. 
   Why are we debating a bill to authorize new spending for the November election if the appropriations bill that would fund this activity won't be enacted until after the election? New legislation and additional Federal election funding are not warranted at this time. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. REGULA. (CONGRATULATING THE MOUNT UNION COLLEGE PURPLE RAIDERS FOR WINNING THE 2006 NCAA DIVISION III FOOTBALL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 103, congratulating the Mount Union College Purple Raiders on their 2006 Division III Football National Championship. 
   As you know, Ohio is quite a football State; and while most people think of teams like Ohio State when they think of Ohio football, the team with the most amazing winning record is actually Mount Union College and its Purple Raiders. In December they beat the Wisconsin-Whitewater Warhawks in the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl. 
   The Purple Raiders from Mount Union College in Alliance have been a perpetually dominant team under the reign of Head Coach Larry Kehres and staff, winning an astounding nine NCAA Division III Football Championships. The players who have come and gone through the Mount Union football program should also be honored for their superior work ethic on the football field and in the classroom. As an alumnus of Mount Union College, I take special pride that the students that remain in the football program all 4 years have an incredible 98 percent graduation rate. That is astounding, I think, everything considered in what we hear and so on. Such phenomenal scholastic and athletic achievement should not go unnoticed. These graduation rates are impressive for any higher education institution and are especially remarkable for college athletes. 
   The most recent NCAA victory comes as no surprise to those who have followed the Purple Raiders over the past two decades. They have had the two longest winning streaks in all of college football, with 54 consecutive victories from 1996 to 1999 and 55 victories from 2000 to 2003. The Purple Raiders also currently hold the second longest winning streak in all of college football, with 23 consecutive victories. With winning streaks like these, it is no shock that Larry Kehres has the best career winning percentage in any division level of college football ever, with a remarkable record of 246 wins, 20 losses, and 3 ties. That is a remarkable record. 
   Along with such incredible regular season records, the Purple Raiders have also won nine NCAA Division III championships, 17 Ohio Athletic Conference titles to go along with 15 perfect seasons. These statistics have all been achieved under the excellent coaching of Larry Kehres. His record has earned him the American Football Coaches Association Division III Coach of the Year a record eight times. Coach Kehres can certainly take great pride in the dexterity and proficiency he has instilled in the young athletes that have walked the halls of Mount Union College. 
   This year's players have yet again risen to the occasion and proved to be the best of Division III. The Purple Raiders finished first nationally in Division III football in total offense and second in total defense, which can only give a slight indication as to the work ethic of this team. The national title they achieved in 2006 was well earned by these athletes, coaches, and staff. 
   I would like to congratulate Mount Union College President Richard Giese; Coach Larry Kehres; his coaches; the faculty and staff; as well as the terrific and enthusiastic fans, and we have them, but especially all of the players for yet another undefeated year and national championship.     
   Mr. Speaker, 2006 was a great season, and I am sure it will not be the last for these Purple Raiders. As the great coach Vince Lombardi once said, ``Being a champion means you are willing to go longer, work harder, and give more than anyone else.'' The current Purple Raiders team and those of prior seasons, along with Coach Kehres, have proven the wisdom of this statement time and time again.

   Mr. REGULA. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. It's certainly with pleasure that I rise today as the dean of the Ohio delegation to welcome our newest Member, the Honorable Marcia Fudge, of the 11th District. We will all sadly recall our delegation and this House unexpectedly lost our friend and colleague, the Honorable Stephanie Tubbs Jones, this past August. While we all miss Stephanie's warmth and friendship, today we welcome Congresswoman Fudge to this body. 
   As my colleague from Toledo has said, she has an outstanding record of achievements, and I know she will be a very strong contributing Member to this body. Of course, she has the great experience of serving as the Mayor of Warrensville Heights. Any of you that have experienced local government, particularly as a mayor or a council person, you know that you have to learn to accommodate, compromise, reach across the aisle, and do a lot of things that will make for success in this body. 
   Also, she is a product of Ohio's fine schools. She has a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the Ohio State University. Go Bucks. She has a law degree from the Cleveland Marshall College of Law at Cleveland State University. 
   Madam Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues on my side of the aisle, and colleagues generally, we are happy to welcome Ms. Fudge as one of our Members and wish her a long and successful career as a Member of this body. It's a great honor to serve in the United States Congress. I think all of us can attest to that. 
   I thank the gentlelady for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Madam Speaker, one of the most significant factors of a student's academic achievement and success in life is a teacher who inspires. It is my privilege to rise today to recognize two outstanding teachers from my district who have been honored for their exceptional service and dedication. 
   Just last month, Terra Mann was recognized among 4,000 nominations by the U.S. Department of Education as Ohio's recipient of ``American Stars of Teaching.'' With 19 years of teaching at Worley School in Canton and hundreds of inspired students behind her, Terra's talent and commitment has propelled students forward. In 5 years, she has risen to the challenge and helped move a struggling school to one of the highest designations of success we measure as a Nation, particularly in the critical area of reading proficiency. 
   Julie Herman teaches at Compton Elementary in Canton, Ohio, and is the most recent recipient of the Milken Family Foundation National Educator Award, an award also known as the ``Oscars of Teaching.'' She is an intervention specialist and engages young at-risk and disabled students to achieve remarkable success academically. In 2005-2006, she helped all of her third graders pass the Ohio Achievement Test. 
   Before our future entrepreneurs, innovators and leaders stands a teacher, and these women are examples of the truly best. I'm pleased to recognize and congratulate them here today.

   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman that the Office of Inspector General at the GSA needs adequate funds to operate. But, Chairman Serrano's mark provided a level of funds that is both responsible and sufficient for the OIG. 
   In the fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution, the Congress provided $6 million in additional funds to the OIG. They were not able to spend these funds in the fiscal year, and have asked for the authority to assess them in fiscal year 2008. This authority has been granted by the committee. 
   Chairman Serrano has made funding the Office of Inspector General and the other oversight offices one of his highest priorities in this bill. I commend him for his work, and oppose this attempt to change the committee mark. 
   I question the ability of the OIG to spend these additional funds this year, and I reiterate the fact that this was taken care of in the previous legislation. Therefore, I urge the defeat of this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am going to include my statement in the Record. I will paraphrase it in the interests of time. 
   First, I want to congratulate Chairman Serrano in being the pioneer chairman of the newly created Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee. He has given us great leadership in a bipartisan, inclusive spirit while shepherding this bill through the subcommittee. Additionally, my colleagues on the subcommittee on both sides have provided valuable input and guidance. The chairman has mentioned the hard work of the staff on both the majority and minority. I won't reiterate that, but I will say we have had great staff help for both majority and the minority. 
   I am pleased to present this Financial Services bill. We have taken into consideration the priorities of the President and the Members of the House, and I think we have produced a bill that meets the needs of Americans and our operations of government while staying below the President's budget request, which is somewhat unusual for most of the Appropriations Committee bills. I appreciate the leaders of the Appropriations Committee, Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis, in providing a manageable allocation for the bill. 
   We allocate, as the chairman has said, $21.4 billion in discretionary budget authority. This is $243 million below the administration's request, but it is $2 billion above fiscal year 2007. This is in recognition of some additional responsibilities that we have. 
   It provides funding for a diverse number of agencies that affect the lives of all Americans. Twenty-seven different agencies are funded in this bill: Telecommunications; IRS Taxpayer Assistance; Small Business Administration, an interesting group; the General Services Administration; and also the Office of Personnel Management. 
   I want to mention here that in testimony, I was struck by the fact that the director of the Office of Personnel Management said that in the next 10 years, 60 percent of the workforce will retire. I would say to any young people that are listening tonight there will be a lot of opportunity in the Federal Government. 
   Another point that was made in the hearing was that only 15 percent of the Federal employment is in Washington, D.C., which means that there will be job opportunities all across the country. I would urge young people that are in political science or have an interest in government to think about getting the skills that might be useful in working in Federal employment. This would, of course, be some budget experience, some tax policy and some general policy of government. There will be opportunities and exciting challenges. 
   We have the Small Business Development Centers. Sometimes I think we only think about the big ones in terms of businesses, but it is the thousands and thousands of small businesses that really fuel this Nation's economy. I know in my own district, if you add up the 50, the 75 and the 100-employee businesses, that is a very significant total. Those businesses don't tend to go overseas. They don't sell out and move their operations somewhere offshore. They stay. Therefore, I think it is extremely important that we help small business in every possible way. 
   We do that in this bill. We have $100 million for Small Business Development Centers. This is an increase. It is a method, a way of providing management assistance. Just in Ohio alone, we have over almost 900,000 small businesses. Every dollar we invest in this leverages a couple of dollars in economic activity.     
   Another interesting thing in the bill is financial literacy. We hear a lot of comment about the fact that our young people don't know how to handle credit cards, they don't know how to handle their loans, and they get themselves in financial trouble. We have allocated in this bill $900,000 for the Treasury's Office of Financial Education. This is some $200,000 over the President's request. 
   What I would like to do is urge that Treasury work with the Department of Education and move some of this responsibility to them to work with the schools, the elementary and high schools, in improving financial literacy in this country. Credit is extremely important, and too often young people do not understand the impact of building credit card debt and other types of debt which gets them in substantial financial trouble. So we hope that we can encourage a greater amount of financial education among the students of this Nation. 
   We also hear a lot about the fact that $300 billion of taxes are left uncollected. As Mr. Dreier pointed out on the statement on the rule, most people pay their taxes. The United States is unique, probably in some respects in that we have a voluntary system of paying taxes, but people want to know that if they pay their taxes, they want their neighbor and their fellow citizens to also pay theirs. 
   If there is this $300 billion tax gap, we need to do something to address it, so we have set aside the money for taxpayer support services. And I might say, for those that are listening out in the audience across the country, that many people are not aware of the fact that there is a Taxpayer Assistance Service. It is available in most of the major cities of the country, and they can be very helpful to people who have some type of problem with IRS. We said some years ago that we want to make the IRS more taxpayer friendly, and we have tried to do that in this bill. 
   The chairman mentioned the District of Columbia. I often think about President Reagan, who talked about the city of Washington being the ``shining city on the hill.'' What we try to do in this bill is to move this city a little bit further along in that direction. 
   The District of Columbia, and we recently changed their voting status, is the Capital of this Nation and a city we should all take pride in. So what we have tried to do in this bill, since we fund D.C., their Federal money, is to make it a better city. 
   I want to say I think the Mayor is recognizing the challenge that is before him. They have made a dramatic change in their school system. Now the Mayor is responsible and accountable, and I am hopeful that this will make a vast improvement over a period of time in education. 
   The key to a successful city is a successful education system. One of the things that plagues the cities of America is the fact that they do have problems with their system, and they have a high rate of dropouts. We hope we can change that not only in the District of Columbia, but in every city in America. 
   If our Nation is to remain competitive in the years to come, we have to start with the education system. I am pleased that the Mayor and the city leadership here recognize that fact. We put $35 million for college tuition assistance, $41 million for school improvement, and $10 million to improve libraries. I know the Mayor has selected a new superintendent. We wish her well. We want to do everything we can to make her administration and that of the Mayor a success in dealing with education problems. 
   The chairman mentioned the Election Assistance Commission. This is, of course, designed to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to vote. That is, again, fundamental to our democracy, that people have not only the right to vote, but that we make it as uncomplicated as possible so they do make the effort to exercise their franchise. I think, perhaps, the $300 million is not necessarily required at this time because the Presidential primaries will start in January, and the States are already sitting on $1.3 billion, but we can perhaps address that issue in conference. 
   The loan program, I am a little concerned. We are giving $80 million to help subsidize loans where there is a default. Historically this is funded by a premium on both the borrowers and lenders, and I am hoping that we can work out a program that will encourage people to use the loan program. 
   Private debt collectors, we don't know. We have kept that in place with a very limited amount of money because we are not sure how effective that program is, but I think the Treasury would argue that it has been a successful program.  
   We have maintained the policies on abortion. We have maintained the policies on Cuba. Any change of these would bring about a Presidential veto. 
   I hope that we can work out any differences we might have in conference, and that the bill would be one that the President of the United States can sign. Certainly in terms of meeting his fiscal requirements. We have more than met that challenge by being under his numbers. 
   I urge Members to look at this bill and weigh the importance of it when it comes time for final passage. I know we will have a number of amendments, and we will address those as we move along.  
   INTRODUCTION 
   First, I would like to congratulate Chairman Serrano on being the pioneer Chairman of the newly created Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee. Chairman Serrano has provided great leadership and a bipartisan, inclusive spirit while shepherding this bill through subcommittee and full committee. Additionally, my colleagues on the subcommittee have provided valuable input and guidance throughout the process. 
   Also, I would like to acknowledge the hard work, dedication and expertise of the subcommittee staff. On the majority side, Dale Oak, Bob Bonner, Karyn Kendall, Frank Carillo, Deb Bilek, Jim Curry and Nadine Berg on Chairman Serrano's personal staff. On the minority side I would like to thank John Martens and Alice Hogans for their counsel in putting together this bill. 
   OVERVIEW 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to present before the House today the fiscal year 2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill. By taking into consideration the priorities of the President and the Members of the House, we have produced a bill that meets the needs of Americans, and the operations of our government while staying below the President's budget request. I appreciate the efforts of the leaders of the House, Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis to provide a manageable allocation for this bill. 
   The Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill allocates $21.4 billion in discretionary budget authority. This number is $243 million below the Administration's request and $2 billion above fiscal year 2007. I would like to repeat this to my colleagues who have voiced concerns over extraneous spending in appropriations bills; this bill is $243 million below the Administration's request, while still providing sufficient funds for various agencies to continue their missions and service. 
   The bill provides funding for a diverse number of agencies that affect the lives of all Americans. The agencies funded in this bill regulate the financial and telecommunications industries, collect taxes and provide taxpayer assistance, lend a helping hand to small businesses and disadvantaged communities by providing them with capital, support the operations of the White House and Federal Judiciary, provide Federal payments to the District of Columbia, operate and maintain Federal buildings, manage our federal workforce which is expected to experience tremendous attrition rates over the next ten years, assists in the administration of federal elections and protect consumers and investors from fraudulent practices. 
   SBA-SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS 
   The Chairman has done a good job of highlighting the bill so I will not repeat him, but I would like to mention several items of importance to me. I am particularly pleased at the $100 million for Small Business Development Centers, an increase of nearly $13 million. The Small Business Development Centers account is the Small Business Administration's primary method of providing management assistance to small businesses. In my state of Ohio we have over 889,000 small businesses and every dollar invested in the OHIO SBDC network leverages at least $2.00. This program is vital to the life of small business, and I urge my colleagues to maintain this funding on the House floor today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I congratulate the sponsors. 
   In the Labor, Health and Human Resources and Education bill, we started funding this program. It was a huge success. We had testimony in our subcommittee from students who had been involved in this, and they were so impressed that they could participate. And I'm sure, out of this program, we've developed not only teachers, but administrators. A classic example is Michelle Rhee, who is the new superintendent of the City of Washington school system. She was a person who was part of the Teach for America. And not only do you get teachers who are, of course, extremely important to education, but you get people who will probably be on school boards, community leaders who will be in positions to further the cause of education. And I don't think there's anything we can do as a Nation more important than beefing up and supporting our education system. It's the future of this country to have educated people, and to do that you need good teachers. And we need to get people from all walks of life involved in teaching. 
   I think it's a great program. We certainly were impressed with the testimony we heard in the Labor, Health and Human Services Education Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee about the value of this to the society and to the individuals involved.     
   I congratulate the authors for this support, and I think by making this a part of the education program on a fixed basis we are saying, in effect, this is more than temporary; this is of permanent value to the future of this Nation and to the future of education.

<DOCNO>Mr. REGULA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REGULA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, like many Americans I am frustrated and dissatisfied with the situation in Iraq. I did not take my vote lightly when Congress authorized the President to use force. Every day I think about the patriotism and sacrifice of our brave men and women who are serving courageously in harm's way. 
   Mistakes and the complexity of events along the way have led us to the place we are today. Sectarian violence has increased, and Iraq is mired in a civil war, making it difficult for the new government to take hold. 
   While our role in this conflict has become a divisive issue, there is no denying the significant consequences Iraq's future will have for national and international security and stability. 
   So I must ask, how do we move forward in a way that honors the commitment and tremendous sacrifices our Nation and its troops have made? We can do so neither by cutting off funding for the troops nor by providing the President with a blank check. 
   Instead of political posturing, we must insist on a surge in diplomacy. I believe we need to follow closely the recommendations made by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to bring about the best possible outcome. The Iraq Study Group report states, and I quote: 
   The United States should immediately launch a new diplomatic offensive to build an international consensus for stability in Iraq and the region. 
   This diplomatic effort should include every country that has an interest in avoiding a chaotic Iraq, including all of Iraq's neighbors. Given the ability of Iran and Syria to influence events  within Iraq, the United States should try to engage them constructively. 
   By doing so, it would help marginalize extremists and terrorists, promote U.S. values and interests, and improve America's global image. States included within the diplomatic offensives can play a major role in reinforcing national reconciliation efforts between Iraq, Iraqi Sunnis and Shia. Such reinforcement would contribute substantially to legitimatizing of the political process in Iraq. 
   Iraq's leaders may not be able to come together unless they receive the necessary signals and support from abroad. This backing will not materialize of its own accord, and it must be encouraged urgently by the United States. We should make it clear to the Iraqi leadership that the additional troops are solely for the purpose of achieving stability, and that this deployment is a precursor to our leading the future of this Nation to the Iraqi people. And I would emphasize this is the important process. 
   Troop increases alone will not solve the fundamental cause of violence in Iraq if its government is not committed to a national reconciliation process. 
   However, as we lead a surge in diplomacy, and the Iraqi Government accelerates its efforts at national reconciliation, the Iraq Study Group report makes clear, and I quote, ``The United States should significantly increase the number of U.S. military personnel, including combat troops, embedded in and supporting Iraqi Army units. As these actions proceed, we could begin to move combat forces out of Iraq.'' 
   Denying additional troops, as requested by our military leadership, could put our troops that are there at greater risk and delay their return to their loved ones. I hear from my constituents who want our troops home immediately and from those who want us to remain there so we don't have to fight the terrorists on our own soil. 
   What I do know is that the challenges in Iraq are complex, and the consequences of immediate withdrawal would be devastating. The Iraq Study Group report goes on to say ``The global standing of the United States could be diminished.'' Our Nation has sacrificed far too much to allow our credibility and values to be weakened. 
   I cannot, in good faith, support this nonbinding resolution. We also support the troops, and we all want to bring the troops home as quickly as possible. 
   Let us instead urge the President to increase diplomatic efforts and to follow the recommendations made by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to work on many fronts to solve the challenges in Iraq.
