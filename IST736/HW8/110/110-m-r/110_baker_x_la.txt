<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. I thank the gentleman for yielding and am appreciative of this time. 
   I wish to express my appreciation to committee leadership for attempting to address a most difficult subject matter. I have had some interest in this matter for a period of years, and understand the difficulty of crafting a remedy to which all Members may agree. 
   However, I have been troubled by the characterization that there would be Members, if voting ``no'' on this measure, would be ideologues voting for some unusual reason rather than in the Nation's best interests or in the Nation's recovery effort in the great city of New York. 
   It would be of note, I think, to the body to recall that it was November 29, 2001, at 4:37 p.m., in this august body when the House had a recorded vote 2 months after 9/11 on the adoption of the very first Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. You will find in the Record, which I have a copy of should it be needed for review, Mr. Ackerman, Mr. Clyburn, Mr. Crowley, Mr. Hinchey, Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Israel, Mr. Kanjorski, Mrs. Maloney, Mrs. McCarthy, Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Serrano, Ms. Slaughter, Mr. Weiner, Ms. Waters, Ms. Vel&#225;zquez, Mr. Meeks, Mr. McNulty, Mr. Engel, Mr. Frank all found it appropriate and the right discharge of duty to vote ``no'' on the terrorism reinsurance proposal adopted two months after 9/11. 
   Now, I have no criticism to be made of those Members for taking that action. They did what they thought best for their constituents in that window of responsibility. I would merely point out that in the bills that we have passed on two occasions in this House under Republican leadership, we looked upon this responsibility as a loan to the industry to help them at a time of serious liquidity crisis to be able to withstand this assault, meet their financial obligations to the insureds, and move forward. But at such time as it was determined the crisis had passed, there was a mandatory obligation to repay the taxpayers of the United States the generosity that was extended in the form of a bridge loan and to give back to the taxpayers their generosity which enabled the industry to survive. 
   This bill does not require mandatory repayment of assistance. It is, in fact, a gift to the industry in a time of crisis, which is appropriate. But in the period of time in which the industry returns to profitability, is it wrong to say, ``Taxpayers, here's your money back. You helped us in a crisis, now it's time for us to repay your generosity''? I think that is a pivotal cornerstone of whatever we do going forward in assisting sectors of our economy which have untoward experiences that we cannot predict, where there is serious economic dislocation. But it is not right to give away the taxpayers' money without accountability. 
   For that reason alone, I suggest Members, who may choose to do so, could oppose this legislation and do so on a philosophical basis that is purely defensible. There are many other reasons why some may have concern. 
   Now, I will be quick to acknowledge that I worked with the gentleman from New York in addressing one serious flaw, and I appreciate the gentleman's willingness to extend that courtesy and fix that one significant difficulty with a legislative proposal. I am appreciative of that, and I look forward to working with him as they go forward through this process. 
   The bill today is flawed, and I would hope you would seriously consider a ``no'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. Madam Chairman, at this time I claim 2 minutes. 
   Madam Chairman, I wish to express my appreciation to the gentlelady and to the Chair for their diligent work in this area. Certainly, it is an arena in which there is a clear and established, well identified need for which there are too few resources available. It is also a problem which will require many, many years of dedicated work to ensure the delivery of a safe water infrastructure in the years ahead. 
   I, regretfully, have observed that the debate which will occur over the establishment of Davis-Bacon in this legislation is the one point around which great controversy has emerged. 
   In my own State, I can speak with authority as to our circumstance. Pursuant to the devastation of Katrina and Rita, we find our communities struggling to get back on their feet, and our infrastructure has been badly damaged. Water systems, pumping stations, sewage systems have been destroyed; and it will take, unfortunately, years for many communities to attain the status that they once had prior to the storms' impact. 
   It is clear to us that, although the American people and this Congress have been very generous to our State in making resources available, those resources are going to be stretched to their maximum extent possible; and yet we still have incredible needs that will yet be unmet. For this reason, we feel, at least in the view of our own State's interest, that the application of the Davis-Bacon requirement, artificially increasing the cost of construction of these important infrastructure projects, will only ensure that we are years longer in achieving the necessary recovery. 
   To state it quite simply, to spend more and accomplish less is not something we in Louisiana are comfortable in pursuing. For that reason, I join with my ranking Member, Mr. Mica, in expressing grave concerns over the inclusion of Davis-Bacon. 
   In the normal operative circumstance, when funds are made available from the State revolving account to a State for a particular project, Davis-Bacon has applied to that first-round funding. This bill will now make Davis-Bacon provisions extend to all subsequent utilizations of those funds, and that is the expansion to which we strongly object.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I think it is important to understand the operative nature of the State Revolving Fund and the results of the legislation before us on that operation of the fund. 
   If a community in Florida, the ranking member's State, which has no prevailing Davis-Bacon requirement, borrows money from the revolving fund, there is a match associated with that which is State dollars. There is also interest that accrues on that loan. When the State repays the loan, the State repays the interest, that comes back into the revolving loan account. 
   Each year, as the Federal funds are made available, assume $500 million would be made available of Federal resources for the revolving fund account, only that $500 million under current rule would be subject to Davis-Bacon application. All of the repayment made by the State of Florida, including the interest, would be exempt from the applicability of a Davis-Bacon requirement. 
   ``For the first time,'' and I read from the statement of administration policy, the White House statement on the matter, ``For the first time ever, projects financed by funds contributed solely by States and moneys repaid to the State Revolving Fund will be subject to Davis-Bacon requirements.'' 
   So let there be no mistake about this, this is not merely voting to sustain Davis-Bacon as we currently know it. This is to expand the requirement for State-generated funds into States that have no Davis-Bacon requirement at the State level, and it will diminish those States' abilities to meet their identified water infrastructure needs. That is why this debate is occurring. It is not just about whether big business or big labor or the beneficiaries of some legislative initiative. This is about the real world in back home America, and are we going to provide the resources to help small communities get their water systems in decent and safe operating condition? We all agree that is a worthwhile goal. 
   The question is: How do we want to achieve it? 
   Do we want to constrain a free market system with arbitrary Washington rules that artificially drive up prices and give taxpayers less? Most of us think that is not advisable.

   Mr. BAKER. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of the time. 
   I wish to express sincere and deep appreciation to the gentlewoman who is the Chair of the Water Resources Subcommittee and, of course, to the distinguished chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar. In thinking back over my tenure on the committee, it really is hard to remember a time when there has been significant partisan difference. It truly is one of the committees of the House that works in a unified way and produces a consistent, unified voice. 
   We share the vision that America's infrastructure is the key to our Nation's economic future and that where infrastructure is damaged or inadequate, economies lag behind, employment is high, and circumstances are not good. So we really are joined here together in an effort to do what we believe is right and best for communities we represent. 
   In this one instance, we find ourselves on the opposite side of a policy which has, over time, divided this Congress, the requirement by government to tell those engaged in a business endeavor what you should pay your employees in meeting essential public need. 
   It is clear to me that in my home State, the economic dislocations because of the tragic storms is immense and widespread and felt deeply and unfortunately will be likely felt for many years to come. We all know that there aren't sufficient resources to solve every problem in every community and certainly not even in our own State. Despite the generosity of the American people and this Congress, there will be billions of dollars of unmet need. 
   The question, as we go to Dr. Boustany's district in southwest Louisiana to a small, small rural parish in Cameron, where there isn't even a municipality, where after the storm's terrible surge went across the land, you could stand on the northern edge of the parish and look all the way to the gulf coast and not see a structure standing. We don't have enough money to build it all back. We can't even tell people even when we are likely to build it back, but we are going to send some money, now in the form of a State revolving fund intended for the restructuring and rebuilding of critical water infrastructure. 
   What are we going to do with that $10? Are we going to artificially increase the cost of that project just to make it more difficult for rural Cameron parish to recover? I don't think we really want or intend to do that, but that is the consequence of this provision in this bill. It makes recovery more difficult. It will take recovery longer. It will cost more to build less. 
   We all pride ourselves in America on our strong free enterprise beliefs. Let's turn free enterprise loose. Let's let Louisiana rebuild. Let's do it in the most efficient and expeditious way possible. Let's strike Davis-Bacon provisions from this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. I claim the remaining time. 
   I certainly respect the chairman's knowledge and views of these matters and appreciate that on 95 percent of the issues before the committee, we are generally in unanimity. 
   On this particular point, I would like to bring the issue to that of the individual who is trying to rebuild their home in the difficult area of south Louisiana. Materials are short, workmen are hard to find. Do we really want to tell an individual trying to rebuild their personal home, you are going to have to meet a government wage rate in order to build this house or else you cannot build it? This is about government injecting itself into a free market process, all for no apparent reason that is clear to me. 
   It will make the compliance of the rules for the rural and lower income communities much more difficult to achieve. Compliance with the Davis-Bacon provisions is a difficult and cumbersome task.     
   And where we have low-income communities, where resources are greatly limited, we are now going to require additional regulatory burden and a higher wage rate that is artificial to further inhibit the ability of that community rebuild. We wouldn't contemplate having that set of requirements on the individual trying to rebuild their own home, but yet we are going to force that set of standards on communities across this Nation, even where States have no Davis-Bacon provisions at the State level at all. And that I think is the most troublesome aspect of the implementation of the proposal as constructed. Eighteen States have chosen not to require a Davis-Bacon implementation, and yet we here in the Congress by virtue of the State revolving infrastructure fund are going to require those States now to comply with these new standards. I hope Members will carefully consider the consequences of this amendment and vote for the Baker-King amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAKER. (GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlelady for her courtesy. 
   I rise today to make observation that when a hurricane makes landfall, most people do not consider it a Republican or a Democratic event; that in the aftermath, when you have been devastated from life and property and someone comes to help, you don't ask, are you from local government, State government or Federal Government, and, by the way, are you a Republican or a Democrat? 
   The only thing I observed that hurricanes and government have in common at this point as a Louisianian is that either one you touch, you are going to come away confused, disoriented and possibly hopeless. 
   We can do better. I should be quick to add, however, lest these comments be misinterpreted, that it was President Bush's administration who came to this Congress and asked for the $100 billion of taxpayer money to begin the long, slow process of recovery. I also want to quickly add that it was Chairman Frank who discussed with me the administrative problems of the resolution and incorporated into the bill now before us important expediting processes which will make a measurable and financial difference to the people of Louisiana. 
   I want to express my appreciation to Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member Biggert for their continued effort to understand and respond. 
   Not to dismiss that there are problems. In fact, a provision I was trying to include in the bill, which was made reference to during the debate on the rule, caused the CBO to express concern that we had a scoring problem. To make sure I say this the way I intend it, I learned that the CBO scoring process is mystical, algorithmic, nonsensical, opaque process intended to obstinately delegate common sense to irrelevance. 
   Short-circuiting all of that, let me say I appreciate Chairman Frank's  staff working diligently and the Rules Committee allowing that provision to be made in order and to be included in this legislation. 
   That problem is not the only one for taxpayers. Let me explain to you that when you send us a dollar, we don't get a dollar. At best, we get 80 cents, because FEMA has been keeping at least 20 percent of all the money intended to help people recover for their operational expenses. The American public needs to know that, that we are not wasting $100 billion. Certainly we can be more efficient in rolling out a response to a devastation that we have seen never before in this country, 90,000 square miles. I would say where we are today is not a hopeless mess, but indeed it is a mess. 
   My hope is that the small pilot program contained in this legislation, which will enable the collection of disparate tracts of property to be cleaned off and sold back into the private market, can be a way to kick-start a free-market recovery that to date has been impossible with government interference and obstinate regulation. There is a faster, better way, a more efficient way, to combat this scale of devastation and human suffering. 
   Maximizing taxpayer expenditures while minimizing benefits to those in need doesn't seem possible to the extent that we have seen in the current circumstance. If there is to be any long-term benefit to the resolution of this matter for all the affected taxpayers around this country, it is to construct a response mechanism that when the next devastating event occurs, we will be able to deploy resources, get people the help they need in an efficient manner, and get government the heck out of the way and let free markets function. 
   The bill before us today incorporates provisions that I believe will help get us closer to that goal. Are we there yet? Of course not. 
   Webster charges this House of Representatives with a very clear mission: Let us develop the resources of this land, call forth her powers, build up her institutions, promote all her great interests, and see whether we also in this, our day and generation, may perform something to be worthy of remembering. 
   Webster got it. We need to leave this place in a better condition than when we found it. We can do better than this. And before the next disaster strikes, we must.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAKER. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. I thank the gentleman for the gracious yielding of time and do appreciate his good leadership in this area, as well as that of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski), and the entire New York delegation, which is understandably focused on the issue of how we best respond as a Federal Government to a tragic event of another terrorist assault on this great Nation. 
   I rise today not to be critical of the product but to say that we have moved far in our considerations. In the first response after 9/11, the first terrorism risk reinsurance proposal was only 3 years in duration, which was then extended for an additional 2-year term, without the inclusion of group life,  NBCR, and some of the other modifications now suggested as being appropriate. 
   I would point out that during that 5- to 6-year period after 9/11, contracts were entered into, loans were made by financial institutions and construction proceeded, only to make the point that having an absolute lifelong guarantee by the Federal taxpayer with any risk associated with a terrorist attack is not necessarily inherently a standard of operation which this Congress should consider. 
   Rather, as we go forward, as the chairman has indicated in the hearings of next year, we should strongly consider enabling companies to build up internal reserves specifically to addressing and responding to these types of horrific acts, without accounting consequence or tax liabilities, and enable them to build up appropriate reserves in their eye to meet the insured losses which they potentially could share. 
   There are alternatives to the plan currently in place, and we should reengage and have discussions on all of those alternatives. Some might find my position on this matter unusual, but I would say in facing the losses that we struggle with and continue to struggle with in the Gulf States, Louisiana and Mississippi alike, post Katrina and Rita, I still don't believe we can ask the taxpayers of this great country to pay off all of our losses in the event of a higher loss. 
   We should build higher standards and adjust rates in accordance with the risks identified, and we should be smart in the enterprise, enabling market forces to function. The same should be said with terrorism risk. 
   We should do all we can before we open taxpayers' checkbooks and write those big checks out when market function should be the first and appropriate response to any loss in the insurance world. So I stand in defense of the product, and I believe the 7-year term is more than adequate and echo the comments of my chairman on capital markets. We need to be careful before we move, and we certainly need to understand before we act.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAKER. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and wish to quickly say as a Louisianan, obviously I am a defender of the flood insurance program. 
   I want to commend Chairman Frank for his willingness to work with us and all affected parties in crafting a flood insurance program reform which I thought was a very good product. It was only with the addition of the wind exposure element to the underlying bill that I began to have any concerns about the legislative direction of the chairman's recommendation. 
   Currently, the notional value of flood insurance in effect, just flood, not to confuse with wind, today is $1,092,932,778,000 as of a June 30 FEMA report. That's the potential exposure of the flood insurance program to claims pursuant to contract. 
   We know that the current flood program with the actuarial system in place cannot repay the debt it currently has. To put into scale what the additional risk brought onto the U.S. Government books will look like, the industry estimate from New England to the gulf coast only is an additional $19 trillion of risk exposure. 
   The limits in the bill that have been described is it's only available where you can buy flood insurance. We sell flood insurance in New Mexico. We sell it in Boulder, Colorado, and we sell flood insurance in Guam, and the entry to the wind program is to buy the flood policy, so that we will, in fact, nationalize wind insurance coverage via the flood program, opening the U.S. taxpayer to a risk and a payment for which there is not an adequate stream. 
   Some say, well, the bill requires actuarial rating. The flood insurance program has actuarial rating, but it's not industry actuarial. It only looks to historical claims data. There's no risk modeling to look forward. 
   Those who have laid claim to the fact that weather cycles are more severe, damages are likely to escalate, that is not data which is incorporated into the flood insurance premium structure. So there will be problems with the implementation of the program as currently drafted. 
   Am I suggesting we do nothing? Absolutely not. Do I think that the current system is adequately taking care of the risk of those who live along coastal areas? Of course it isn't. 
   I have legislation which I am planning to introduce and hoped to have had introduced before consideration of this bill on the floor which will enable the issuance of a privately issued policy, multi-peril; but it would be exempt from State price controls.

   Mr. BAKER. I thank the gentleman for his courtesy in yielding time. And I  certainly want to express appreciation to my chairman of the subcommittee for her good work and her bipartisan work in this and many other subjects, as well as extending our best wishes to Chairman Oberstar and his speedy recovery. 
   I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this matter as a Member from Louisiana. In fact, it reminds me of a circumstance where a fellow went to the lumberyard to buy some 2 by 4s, and when the vendor at the lumberyard asked, How long do you need them? The fellow said, Well, I'm going to need them for a long time, I'm building a house. That's the way we feel about the WRDA bill, we've been wanting this for a very, very long time. 
   There are many Members whose handiwork is evident in this bill preceding me, many members of our delegation, but I certainly want to acknowledge the work of Mr. Boustany from southwest Louisiana who has been so adversely impacted by the storm many have forgotten called Rita. He has worked mightily to make sure his constituents' needs are met. 
   I wish to put a different face on the adoption of this bill than perhaps others have characterized. There will be many in the aftermath to say, Well, if you throw pork in front of a Congressman, you know what's going to happen. And that's unfortunate. 
   In the case of Louisiana, this is not a matter of political convenience. Many people who will benefit from the $7 billion or so that is in this bill would never be able to vote for me anyway. 
   The bill provides for construction of 16 different hurricane and coastal reclamation projects which have literally been vetted for over decades.     
   So these have been subject to public discussion, local governments, State government, Corps of Engineers examination, and we have been ready to go for many, many years. This is not about a matter of political convenience or economic development. This is really about preservation of a culture in our country that is so vital in our oil and gas and natural resources development. From the Rockies to the Appalachians, every drop of water runs through the Mississippi system and runs right through the Bayou of Louisiana out into the open waters of the gulf. In order to protect people from the ravages of the river's annual flooding, the Corps constructed enormous levees which throw all that sediment now out into the deep waters of the gulf. The result of man's own engineering is that we are now subject to the ravages of coastal destruction, particularly in the heights of the hurricane season. One storm does more damage in a few hours than a decade long of natural forces. We are at our rope's end. Some estimate we have less than 10 years to act. 
   The bill before us, although merely an authorization, will make available to us a wide scope of projects which will take decades to complete. But I, for one, and I am sure other members of the Louisiana delegation will state to this Congress, we are deeply indebted to this Congress for taking this action. And as to the disagreement with the President, I have had many disagreements with my President. I have had disagreements with other Presidents. That is nothing new for us. This is just a difference of opinion. I am sure we will all have differences of opinion as we move forward through the legislative process. I am glad that in this instance we have found a way to act from committee to floor to the United States Senate in a bipartisan manner and produce a product that is beneficial to the entire country. 
   I hope you will join with me in overriding this veto and sending this important measure on to the Corps of Engineers and to the States for implementation as soon as is practical.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAKER. (RELIEF FOR ENTREPRENEURS: COORDINATION OF OBJECTIVES AND VALUES FOR EFFECTIVE RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time. 
   I wish to express concern about the operative effects of the gentleman's amendment. For many outside the storm impact area, you would not have an understanding of how processes work. But if you were eligible under the Road Home program, that was the federally funded program to assist people to return to their homes, the maximum allowable money that you could receive regardless of your circumstance was $150,000. But under current rule, if you are eligible for $150,000 and you, for example, had purchased Federal flood insurance in the amount of $150,000 and got paid $150,000 pursuant to the flood insurance premium, you would get nothing out of the Road Home program. Because of that inequitable application of benefits, this House has already voted to eliminate the duplication of benefits in the flood insurance area. 
   Now what is being suggested by the underlying bill is we should do the same thing with regard to an SBA loan. The argument here is even more persuasive. The person may have entered into the SBA obligation far in advance of the onslaught of Katrina. It  might be several hundred thousand dollars of loans that were made available to this individual through the SBA.     
   Under the current rule, any assistance that might be offered to that homeowner who happened to have the SBA loan would all go back to repaying the SBA obligation. 
   So get the picture. The Federal Government puts a stamp on the check, drops it in the mailbox and sends it to the house. But before it gets there, another Federal agent picks it up and hauls it over and deposits it at the SBA. Do you see where the hole is in this argument? No money at all gets to the affected individual. 
   So what the bill now provides is that without increasing the overall expenditure, the money made available to assist people via Katrina and Rita has been appropriated by the Congress. It is over, that is it. We are talking about available resources, not new dollars. 
   Secondly, once the money gets to the individual, the individual is still capped by the rules of the Road Home program, and that is, there shall be no enrichment above that $150,000 level. This is a reasonable proposal. It will enable people to recover appropriately from the disaster which is so overwhelming. 
   I suggest if any still have doubt whether this level of assistance is required and justifiable, walk the streets of New Orleans, as I did this past weekend. Sure, the business district and the French Quarter look terrific. The shops are empty, the restaurants aren't full and people are not coming back. But get out into the neighborhoods where the devastation still exists. We need this help, and we need it now.

   Mr. BAKER. Mr. Ranking Member, I am humbled by your comments. I thank you for that courtesy, and I am deeply appreciative. 
   I have enjoyed very much the opportunity not only to work with you in this capacity but to work with our chairman, who has deep roots and ties to New Orleans, and the gracious gentlelady from Texas, the chairman of our subcommittee. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been a terrific team from which there has been a terrific product developed that all Members who have spoken this evening have made clear as to the scope of the projects, the need for the projects, the clarity of the process, which our ranking member insisted on and opening up to public scrutiny the projects which ultimately are contained in this report. 
   I wish to make just one observation as a representative of Louisiana and make clear that the Governor, the congressional delegation and, most importantly, the people of Louisiana recognize what this legislation means to us tonight. It is not merely the elimination of an inconvenience or the restoration of some public service that we would like to have. This bill goes to the point of restoring our culture and our ability to live as people along the coast of the great State of Louisiana. For that, all of us are deeply grateful to the Members who have made this possible and to this Congress. 
   There is one notable development I would like to memorialize in the discussion of the conference report tonight, and that is a problem which had been long-standing for many years with the representatives of the great State of Mississippi, particularly that of Senator Lott, to whom I would like to express deep appreciation. 
   The gentleman has had for many years concerns about the salinity levels of the water off the gulf coast affecting the productivity of his own fisheries. Likewise, we in Louisiana had concerns about some of the proposed remedies which, in our view, would have had an adverse water quality effect on our own fisheries. 
   In the course of the debate with the conferees, I was assigned the duty to work with the Senator and come to some resolution thereon, which will enable both States to seek the benefit they are entitled to. 
   I am pleased that with the coastal area impact program, we have identified a source of funding, we have agreed to the terms of construction for the Violet Canal project, and I tonight want to say tonight, on behalf of the congressional delegation and for those who follow us here, that it is our intent to honor and abide by the terms and  agreement that Senator Lott negotiated with us and in good faith ultimately seek closure of this most difficult project, which I understand has led to difficulty and the consideration of prior WRDA legislative efforts. It is important, I believe, for us to recognize the contributions made by that delegation and their willingness to assist us in Louisiana in coming to final agreement. 
   With that, I am just pleased to be a small part this process and to have enabled the ability to participate in a small way getting a vital piece of legislation virtually for every congressional district in this country.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Port of New Orleans and the economic and business interests throughout the State of Louisiana that rely on the maritime trade and commerce through the Port, I am especially pleased today to commend the conferees on H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, WRDA, for their support of the navigation project to improve access to the Port's Napoleon Avenue Container Terminal.

This will ensure that the transportation benefits of the authorized channel depth of the Mississippi River Ship Channel will continue to be realized by the adjacent Port terminal and the larger container and other oceangoing vessels that desire to use that facility. This small navigation enhancement project will create significant economic and business benefits for the Port, and aid in the continuing recovery of the greater New Orleans area. I thank Chairman JIM OBERSTAR and Ranking Member JOHN MICA of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their support of this initiative in the vital WRDA legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAKER. (FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I wish to compliment the gentleman from New Jersey on his intended goal and merely point out the defects that exist in the current system. 
   I want to make clear, I am a strong advocate of affordable housing and have gone to some trouble to examine the current portfolio of both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. 
   The one thing I think is consistent and hopefully will not be objected to is to observe that poor people generally don't have money. And so when you go to a closing of a house, regardless of the price, that's not an issue, you are going to try to get as much of that appraised value financed as possible, maybe come up with the closing costs. In a lot of cases, people are actually financing the closing costs too. 
   So it would make sense, if you looked at an analysis of the GSE's portfolio mortgage holdings and determined the loan-to-value ratio, meaning, if it was a $100,000 house and you were borrowing at least $95,000, or up, 96, 97, 98, 99, maybe 101 because you needed help with the closing costs, that there ought to be a disproportionate amount of those loans in their portfolio as compared to, say, a commercial bank. 
   When you look at Fannie and Freddie's portfolio holdings, you find that Freddie has 1.5 percent of their mortgages in a 95 percent plus range. You find Fannie Mae slightly better at 2.8 95 percent plus. So then you back off and say, my goodness, if only 1 or 2 percent is in those very high-leveraged loans, where are they making their money? And where you find the bulk of their loans is in two wage earners per household who are buying a second, third home because they have 60 to 70 LTV, meaning they are putting down a bunch of money. So even if you are a person buying a modest home of $100,000, that means that you are putting down $30,000 or $40,000 at time of closing. That is not my definition of ``poor person.'' 
   If we really want to get focused, and this is a sincere observation about these corporations, they are driven to make a profit my their shareholders.  Nothing wrong with that. But they have been given special privilege by this Congress to accomplish a particular mission, and that is to help low-income first-time home buyers. That is why I am not as affronted by the chairman's concept as some may be. This is a specific requirement to spend $500 million on affordable housing. 
   But to suggest that the gentleman is trying to somehow constrain the target of helping low-income people because they do such a wonderful job now, I have to suggest to you that that is really off the mark. They do a very poor job of helping first-time home buyers and low-income individuals get access to homeownership. They are in the business to make money. They do it quite well. They are the only corporation of their scale that returns double digit rates of return year after year, whether there is a housing crisis or a finance crisis, it's the facts. 
   I would love to work with the other side in focusing these huge corporations into the mission that Congress has described for them to perform. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAKER. (PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, reluctantly, I must speak with concern about the gentleman's underlying proposed amendment. There are more than sufficient reasons for me to express these concerns in my opinion. 
   Going back briefly into the record of the difficulties of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of their derivatives portfolio, I bring to the House's attention this OFHEO special report issued in 2003 in which they determined that senior management and the board were quite aware that the skills and systems in corporate accounting were at the least challenged, and that the derivatives group lacked sufficient knowledge and training to administer the risk. 
   Nonetheless, they chose to move forward with an approach to FAS 133 hedging that was complicated requiring huge volume of monthly accounting events as hedges were designated, and chose to structure some very complicated securitization transactions without proper guidance. 
   In looking at the annual shareholder report, under their derivatives disclosure, they state: ``We principally used the following types of derivatives: Euro Interbank offered rate interest rate swaps; LIBOR based options including swaptions; LIBOR exchange traded futures and foreign currency swaps. 
   If we go further and look to the counterparties with which the enterprises now must engage hedging strategies, we find that Deutsche Bank holds $38.952 billion of Freddie's; BNP Paribas, $28.156 billion; Barclays, $22 billion; Dresdner Bank, $4 billion; and please excuse me because my German is poor, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau holds $2.5 billion. 
   Now in understanding why we should have concern about the restraint of a regulator's authority to analyze the portfolio, the underlying safety and soundness conditions, and the elements of world economy that surround their hedging strategies, one only has to remember for a short moment the days surrounding LTCM when there was a Russian currency liquidity crisis, and people who had no expectation across several different currency transactions and swaps, were called upon to liquidate their positions and make cash available and were unable to do so. 
   It led the Federal Reserve to meet an emergency session in the New York Fed office, and they were surprised to see who was sitting around the table holding these positions, including many commercial banks of whom they had no knowledge were participants. 
   Let me say it this way, if you don't care about any of that, of our insured depository institutions in this country, almost 8,000, of the tier one capital requirement, that is money you have to have by law in your sock drawer. That says if it rains, you have money to mop up the floor. Almost 50 percent of them meet their tier one capital requirement by holding GSE securities. My goodness, if there were to be the slightest of stumble, it goes to the core of our financial depository institution's safety and soundness. 
   There are foreign central banks invested in Fannies and Freddies, and if you don't care about that, at least think about your pensioners. There are billions of dollars of Fannies and  Freddies spread across this economic fabric woven together in an extrinsically complicated matter, and we are going to tell this regulator you can only look through the keyhole, you can't look at the room? It makes no sense. 
   Now I know I will probably lose on this position. The home builders are a powerful enterprise. But for the record, I want to be loud and clear, this is a mistake. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.

   On a broader matter, let me say as to the construction of the bill generally, the chairman has done an extraordinary job of giving the regulator the powers and tools that he needs, save in this one area. I hope in moving forward, we can construct a box that makes appropriate regulatory sense. The Treasury has expressed these concerns to me tonight, and I am expressing those views on their behalf as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. Madam Speaker, in 1986 the United States Congress passed an Immigration Reform Act. As a result, 2.7 million illegal immigrants were given amnesty. That translated immediately into 2.7 million reasons why anyone who wishes to come here should come here illegally. 
   Last week, in the storm-ravaged Katrina area, 88 illegal immigrants were arrested, 13 of whom had criminal felony convictions. 
   This is no longer just a minor problem. It is a taxpayer tragedy. Limited taxpayer resources are being stretched to meet the repair and rebuilding needs of the Katrina/Rita areas. To have those resources dissipated for those who ignore our law and come here illegally is not only a disservice to the American taxpayer, but to all the immigrants who play by the rules, who abide by American law and come here through the normal immigration process. It is time for this to come to an end. It is no longer an inconvenience. It is a tragedy.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAKER. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. I thank the gentleman for his courtesy. I shall try to be brief. I had hoped at the outset the bill would present a uniform national standard so all those engaged in this practice would have legal certainty as to the behavior that complies with the law, no matter where one might extend credit. Unfortunately, that is not the case in the underlying bill. 
   I had hoped more clarity in the provisions of enforceability. I am troubled by some of the unclear language, the way in which some descriptive phrases have been used, as in, for example, the anti-steering provision, which states that loan products which have predatory characteristics, one cannot be sure what constitutes a predatory characteristic. Third, in contract resolution, we had hoped that we would at least avail ourselves of mandatory arbitration, which is a common business practice to resolve differences without the court being involved. Unfortunately, the bill in its current form prohibits mandatory arbitration, which leads us then to the gentleman's very well-thought-out amendment relative to the safe harbor provision. 
   At least we should have the statement that if you engage in lending practices of a certain type, that there will be legal certainty you will not be sued at some future point for engaging in the honorable profession of extending credit to people trying to buy homes. 
   On that point, let me quickly add that 95 percent or more of the people engaged in this practice are honorable people, doing a public service, extending credit to people who pay their obligations on time. It is a mischaracterization on this floor to represent that all people engaged in the business of extending credit for this honorable purpose are up to no good. In fact, when foreclosures occur, it actually costs the industry business. 
   This is not a helpful environment. We would be legislating with certainty, and the bill in the underlying form does not provide that. The gentleman's amendment is excellent, well-constructed. I hope the House will favorably consider it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. Mr. Chairman, I want to make clear my motivations here for the purposes of debate. 
   I certainly am in support of the Roskam amendment, but with or without its adoption, even the underlying bill, without the manager's amendment, is problematic. However, the manager's amendment presents an additional level of concern above those raised at the committee consideration. 
   Insurance is in the business of pricing risk, and I can honestly say as a Louisianan we are really adjusting in a significant way to the new risk now identified for our exposure along our coastal area. 
   Our legislature has responded with the adoption of a building code that really is leading the class in the United States, and to suggest that free markets should not price the risk and provide insurance where they know they will lose money is not a policy that makes a great deal of sense. 
   Hence, the underlying bill will provide a mechanism for the United States Treasury to provide a security backstop to the consortium that now is issuing insurance to Florida residents at a below-market rate. 
   I can recall in great detail the criticisms by many in this House by those of us in Louisiana who are the beneficiaries of a flood insurance program that provides coverage at a governmentally subsidized rate. For the record, I'm for raising those premiums on Louisiana citizens to get that program in actuarial soundness because I know without that the program is eventually doomed. 
   The underlying manager's amendment, although requiring risk-based capital, goes to great steps to avert the requirement, first by exempting companies who now exist from the consortium for the next 5 years. Secondly, there is no full faith and credit of the beneficiary State on the loan that's made by the United States taxpayer and virtually no guarantee of repayment. 
   Let's call this what it is. It is a way to provide stability in the Florida insurance market by accessing taxpayer money without guarantees of repayment. What can we do to improve this? 
   Well, the Roskam amendment now pending is at least the most meager step one should take who is concerned about proprietary action in the insurance world. It does not say the Treasury Secretary will establish the building codes. It merely says the Treasury will examine whether there are even codes in place that are reasonable for the risks that are presented to the occupants of low-lying coastal areas before you extend taxpayer assistance. 
   It's sort of like making sure that you've taken appropriate action to protect your family and that there's not a likelihood of probable loss, and then you're going to sell insurance on the assumption that the risk is low. In this case, rebuilding is taking place in low-lying areas at a rapid pace, and there is an absolute certainty there will be a repeat of significant storms and unquestioned amounts of loss. 
   At least we should say that those who are building in exposures of great risk should exercise the highest level of construction standards before having access to taxpayer money to pay off the loss. 
   Think about your constituents. How many times are we going to ask them to pay for the decisions of others to build in low-lying coastal areas when the coastal area residents themselves are not paying actuarial rates for coverage they are provided. 
   I wish I could say it more clearly, but this is not a balanced approach; and certainly without the Roskam amendment we are opening this Congress and the American taxpayer to enormous financial risk without taking the first meager steps for rational self-protection. 
   I urge the adoption of the Roskam amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

   Mr. BAKER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I just want to make sure I am understanding the effect of the gentleman's amendment properly. If I am a homeowner and I am paying a premium for my coverage and I have a loss, there generally is some sort of deductible, maybe $500 or $1,000, depends on what kind of policy I will have to buy. But I am going to have to put my premium money up, and then I am going to have to have a personal loss to get the benefit of the insurance coverage that I bought for my home. 
   What you are suggesting with this amendment is that the States who are going to avail themselves of the advantage of the Treasury extended loan are going to have to have their own money in the game. They can't just call up and say, Mr. Secretary, send me a few billion dollars. I am kind of short right now. They are going to have to have their own State losses in their own insurance pool before they can get access to the United States Treasury extension of credit; is that correct?

My point here is in speaking, in asking the gentleman the question, is it is absolutely essential, no matter what the government program or service, did you know, that whoever is the beneficiary always makes some contribution to his own well-being or else the program will run amok. There will be no reason to exercise constraint. 
   You are absolutely correct. Premiums charged will never be actuarially sound. The gentleman's amendment, which in my opinion is, by the way, insightful and articulate, has drafted a constructive amendment which I hope others will find beneficial.

   Mr. BAKER. Mr. Chairman, I wish to make clear that my interest in this matter is based on my representation of a portion of coastal Louisiana, so I get the problem. And we are struggling, even today, 2 years after Katrina, in trying to restore our State to what it once used to be. So I do not come to the floor in opposition to this matter in a cavalier manner. 
   The statement that this bill is intended to keep the American taxpayers from being responsible financially for future natural disasters is in direct contravention with the effect of the bill, if it ever does become law. 
   Let's start with the basics. People didn't like the fact that some Louisianans built at the water's edge. How can we be more responsible and elevate structures and build them to a certain code? 
   I support Mr. Roskam's amendment, which provides that the Secretary of the Treasury, before making such a loan, shall certify that the recipient entity in question has such safe and sound building codes. Sounds logical to most taxpayers, I would think. 
   The pending amendment simply says that the recipient entity getting the benefit of the Treasury loan shall have its own money at risk, and shall have suffered some monetary loss. 
   One-in-100 event. Some have suggested this is just a number pulled out of the air. It is a typical actuarial number of risk used by the insurance industry in rating the likelihood of recovery of loss in policies nationwide. It's not something that one can say was simply grabbed out of the air. 
   The risk-based capital provisions in the manager's amendment are completely obliterated for the first 5 years for companies now in existence in the program who would qualify for such loans. And in the event a loan would be made, there's a specific prohibition that the full faith and credit of the State getting the benefit of the credit would not be placed on that note. Translation: they don't have to pay this back. 
   Now, the bigger point is that when you look at the applicability of where NATCAT, national catastrophe funds, would likely be made operational, Florida, yes, California, maybe, and ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, not anywhere else. 
   Our insurance commissioner in our State has carefully evaluated the advantages and possibility of a NATCAT structure being utilized in Louisiana. It will not work. The applicability of this program will be for a narrow, narrow slice of the insurance market at risk on coastal Louisiana. 
   There are much better ways to do this. But do not support this measure on the assumption that the American taxpayer will not be put at risk. 
   In fact, if you really dig into the bill, you find a little provision that says commercial residential may be covered if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the benefits are appropriate, without any conditions as to the requirement, style, nature or manner of repayment. We're going to be taking care of Hilton and their golf courses. 
   Really, really take a careful look at this. I am troubled to be opposed to a bill that could potentially be beneficial to my own State and my own constituents. But I have arrived at the conclusion that this is not the right way to perform this task. And not enough careful thought from varied interests has been taken into consideration in this matter. 
   I urge you, please adopt the Roskam amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BAKER. I thank the ranking member for yielding his time. I certainly appreciate the good work he has done with Ranking Member Mica on this important rail safety bill. Of course, Chairwoman Brown and Chairman Oberstar have been exemplary in working in a bipartisan way to bring this product to the House floor today, and I certainly hope all Members will find a way to support this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak to only one element of the bill that I had particular interest in, and that is with regard to a new reporting requirement for the rails to disclose on an annual basis to the Surface Transportation Board the amount of money spent out of their capital for improvements to rail, track, locomotives and other related maintenance which will give us, I believe for the first time, critical metrics to analyze what they are doing to preserve the safety of our rail system. 
   Of course, safety is uppermost in our mind today, but our rail system is also the heart of our economy. The ability to move goods and services and people across this great Nation over our rail system is absolutely essential going forward. We must judge based on their actual expenditure whether the rails themselves are engaging in appropriate conduct in spending the necessary funds to make this system safe and sound. 
   I have great concerns that in periods of record profitability, Wall Street analysts have identified these systems as being very undervalued. In fact, there are indications that some hedge fund managers are acquiring large blocks of railroad stock and the consequential reaction has been by the rails to repurchase their own stock and perhaps divert needed resources from necessary and very important infrastructure improvements. 
   I commend the committee leadership for the inclusion of this important provision, as I think going forward it will enable this Congress to take actions that are necessary and proper to preserve this important system.

   I want to express my appreciation to Chairman Oberstar, Chairman Johnson and of course my ranking member, Mr. Mica, for their very diligent and hard work; more specifically, for the time spent in the great State of Louisiana after the landfall of Hurricane Katrina. The committee has come down, Members often more than once, to observe for themselves the damage that has been caused by this unbelievable natural catastrophe. 
   The bill under consideration today will begin an enormous and monumental project for the restoration of coastal Louisiana. It is not just about keeping people with the ability to live on the water's edge; it is giving the ability to stop the storm surge coming inland and bringing about the type of devastation that we have painfully experienced again. 
   This legislation is a landmark, certainly for the traditional reasons. Many Members have interests in projects for economic development reasons, for control of public water systems, for enhancing water runoff and minimizing agricultural and other sources of contamination to our water systems. But this bill is really important for maintenance of life and quality of life in our State, and it will begin the meaningful restoration of what is a tremendous natural asset, coastal Louisiana. 
   I would emphasize what has already been stated repeatedly: this is a process resulting in over 600 projects which has come about over a 6-year period. And so it is my deepest hope that this House will this evening favorably adopt 1495, that the Senate will work expeditiously with us in moving forward, and that the administration will find a way to sign this important jobs bill into law. 
   $13.1 billion is a lot of money, and when coupled with the local matched dollars which are required, it will be a significant shot in the economic arm for the construction industry across this country. So I am most appreciative of the opportunity to have participated in this process. 
   I am grateful to my Democratic colleagues for their kind and hard work on this subject and listening to the people of Louisiana in their hour of need. For that we are and will always be most appreciative.

   Mr. BAKER. Mr. Chairman, I just want to speak for a moment as to process and my appreciation for the manner in which the chairman handled this particular legislation. At the time of some of the subcommittee consideration, there were some Members who had not completed the necessary documents for submission of their projects in the required form, and the chairman made clear that should a Member provide the necessary information in a timely manner, that their projects would be included for consideration. And the manager's amendment reflects the closure of that verbal agreement in allowing many Members to complete the necessary documentation, therefore enabling the committee to include their projects of interest in the final mark before the House this evening. That is a model of how appropriate legislative consideration should be engaged, and I want to express appreciation to him. 
   I can verify for him if there is ever any question that there are a large number of Members who have a very deep and abiding interest in this subject matter, I have a list. And they also are appreciative of the willingness to give opportunity for appropriate consideration. 
   The manager's amendment is extraordinarily important in that it touches about a hundred projects which otherwise would not be included. I certainly hope that those present will support the adoption of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this time, I would yield such time as the gentleman may consume to my ranking member, Mr. Mica.

   Mr. BAKER. Mr. Chairman, I am certainly appreciative of the gentleman's interest and have worked with him closely on a number of matters through the course of the years. And just in this instance we have a matter of policy difference. 
   The P&G planning process utilized by the Corps does not begin with an idea that something must be done. It is not a process through which a commercial activity will automatically or inordinately be concluded must be implemented. The plan that is proposed must seek certain levels of justification; that is an iterative process where various parties are heard from over time. 
   As to the element of whether the P&G has been modified or not, I have done some work on the matter over the last days, knowing of the gentleman's interest in this amendment. And I can go back further over time, but on September 30 of 1999, the Corps issued Engineering Regulation 1165-2-501, which speaks directly to the gentleman's interest to encourage to the maximum extent practicable the restoration of aquatic ecosystems. 
   From the gentleman's amendment, the 1999 issuance speaks directly to a nonmonetary output compatible with P&G selection criteria; meaning, we should look at things broader than just dollars and cents. 
   On April 22, 2000, regulation 1105-2-200 recognized the national ecosystem restoration plan on a par with national economic development. 
   March 26, 2002, chief of engineers issues the environmental operating principles affirming sustainable development. 
   May 1, 2003: to provide for procedural guidance for formulating and evaluating projects consistent with environmental sustainability. 
   There was another on May 5, 2005. But to ensure the gentleman has time for his question, I will wrap up by saying, I have been assured by the Corps that they are working as diligently as one can work to accommodate environmental sensitivities while at the same time assuring that projects move forward in a timely manner. 
   The reason for my concern, as the gentleman knows, I am highly sensitized to our recovery from the Katrina-Rita days, and I know the gentleman's amendment is worded in such a fashion that, if it is authorized prior to the adoption of this language, it has no effect. But going forward, we are going to be doing this stuff for a very long time in our State. 
   The unintended consequences of these additional standards are going to be costly to local sponsors, and they are going to require significant additional programmatic time to achieve, not to ignore the gentleman's concerns that ecosystem restoration is a valuable and salutary goal that we should pursue. 
   I am happy to yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. BAKER. The distinction between a statutory adoption and a circular being issued is managerial direction to people who are implementing the programmatic requirements. It may be a difference of no distinction to the gentleman; but my opinion is, after spending some time with the Corps individuals, they feel they are on top of and are trying as best they can within financial constraints to achieve the goals the gentleman is prescribing. My worry is this will now transfer a financial liability to the local sponsor which does not now exist and may well, because of the times outlined in the gentleman's amendment, protract the timely construction of worthwhile projects. 
   I, for example, am not sure whether this applies to aids to navigation. I don't know. I am not suggesting it does, but the way the amendment is constructed, I am worried about scope and reach. And please understand, I want to be helpful to the gentleman's interest. I am not at all averse to constructing projects in an environmentally safe and sound manner. I am just not sure that the goals the gentleman seeks are the results we would get out of the adoption of the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAKER. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I just wanted to express a word of appreciation to the gentleman for revision of his amendment as it now appears before Members. He worked diligently with the staff in order to assure that some concerns that had been raised had been alleviated, and we find ourselves at a point where we have an amendment to which I do not believe there is objection. 
   At some point later in the evening I assume we will agree to adopt it and then later we will take up the underlying bill and pass that as well. 
   I assume that the gentleman has sufficiently consumed enough time to where the managerial matters of his earlier interests may have now been resolved, I hope.

   Mr. BAKER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As I understand the amendment, it is to require a study, an inventory, and an assessment of our hydroelectric capacity that is under the Secretary's jurisdiction, further to examine the advisability of perhaps private ownership of those facilities for the public interest, or whether we should enhance the government-owned and -operated facilities. 
   So it is an examination of our energy resources to determine how we should best go forward, and the Congress does not require today the expenditure of any new money for such purpose other than that to accomplish the study.

<DOCNO>Mr. BAKER. (HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA RECOVERY FACILITATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BAKER. I thank the gentleman for yielding time and certainly want to express appreciation to Chairwoman Norton, as well as Chairman Oberstar, for their continuing attention, courtesy and problem-solving for those of us along coastal States suffering yet from the aftermath of storms Katrina and Rita. Particularly, I want to speak to the great work of Congressman Boustany representing his community. As he expressed here this afternoon, the second storm of the season which followed Katrina, Hurricane Rita, was just as devastating to his community, as was Katrina to coastal portions of eastern Louisiana. He has been the singular outspoken voice for the victims of that disaster in seeking relief and remedies that are appropriate. 
   Madam Speaker, contained in this resolution before us today is a unique resolution, as the Stafford Act never contemplated disasters of the magnitude and scope that affected our State. The duration was unexpected, as well as the intensity of the damage. A few would have thought an inconvenience of a few days for a public facility would be cause for reimbursement from the Stafford Act.     
   But in this case the damage went on not just for days and not just for weeks but literally for months. And income that was planned for many of these facilities was lost, as well as the operational expense to engage in the relief activities. As well, unfortunately, in the damage that occurred to the facilities as a result of this unusual and prolonged use. 
   For example, the Lamar Dixon Center on the southern edge of the City of Baton Rouge acted as the staging point for many law enforcement search and rescue efforts which went on for many days. As a result of the sheriff, police, municipal police and others simply engaging in this activity without seeking preclearance, not having a contract with FEMA in order to save people, Lamar Dixon similarly engaged in the care and feeding of literally thousands of those engaged in daily rescue activities. 
   We were surprised to learn that the Stafford Act provisions would not allow for the reimbursement of these highly appropriate and highly valuable services rendered during the height of the storm. 
   Today, with the adoption of this bill, we cure these deficiencies. And although I hope such need would never arise in any other community in our country, if it does, these changes are meaningful not only to the people who engage in the service but to the communities who likewise support and help in this most dire of recovery circumstances. I join with my colleague, Mr. Boustany, to support this legislation.
