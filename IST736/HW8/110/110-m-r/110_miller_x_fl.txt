<DOCNO>Mr. MILLER of Florida. (IMPROVING COMPENSATION BENEFITS FOR VETERANS IN CERTAIN CASES OF IMPAIRMENT OF VISION INVOLVING BOTH EYES -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of H.R. 797, as amended, the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act. I thank my colleagues, Mr. Hall of New York, the chairman of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, and Mr. Lamborn of Colorado, the ranking member of that subcommittee.  I also thank the chairman, Mr. Filner, and the ranking member, Mr. Buyer, for bringing this important legislation to the floor; and the prime sponsor, Ms. Baldwin. 
   This bill would, in fact, allow veterans who receive a disability compensation for impairment in the vision of one eye to be eligible to receive additional disability compensation for impairment of vision in the eye that is not service connected. 
   This eligibility includes situations where the impairment in each eye is to a visual acuity of 20/200 or less, or a peripheral field loss of 20 degrees or less. This is the same definition of ``legal blindness'' adopted by all 50 States and the Social Security Administration. 
   The New Hires Act would save the government money by allowing the Secretary of the VA to consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding unemployment compensation data in order to determine the eligibility for VA needs-based pension benefits. 
   Also, CBO estimates that this section of H.R. 797, as amended, would save the taxpayers $15 million over 10 years. Also included in H.R. 797, as amended, is a provision that extends the types of work study jobs found in section 3485(a)(4) for 5 years through June 30 of 2012. 
   Current law allows work study recipients to perform a variety of duties throughout VA, as well as veteran-related paperwork at their schools. 
   We also extend the provision for 6 months in Public Law 109-461 to prevent canceling benefits in the middle of a school year. I am pleased we are able to extend this provision even further in this bill. 
   The last provision of this bill provides families with the option of choosing a bronze ``V'' denoting veteran status, in lieu of a VA headstone by graves already marked by a private marker. Many private cemeteries do not allow a second marker on a grave because it complicates routine maintenance. Therefore, that bronze ``V'' would identify a veteran's grave in a manner that is universally acceptable, and meet the family's desire to honor the deceased veteran. 
   The bronze ``V'' would also be readily identifiable to anybody visiting the cemetery, and a standard way to identify veterans who choose not to use a VA-provided headstone. 
   Once again, I express my strong support for H.R. 797, as amended. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MILLER of Florida. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity first to thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Mr. Michaud; as well as the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Filner; and Ranking Member Mr. Buyer for their leadership in bringing this legislation timely to the floor. 
   The heavy burden of some of our servicemembers that they bear in coping with the aftermath of combat is tragically evident in the death of Army Specialist Joshua Lee Omvig. Specialist Omvig was a member of the U.S. Army Reserve 339th Military Police Company from Davenport, Iowa. He took his life in 2005 after returning from a deployment to Iraq. H.R. 327 is aptly named to remember this brave young man. 
   VA must be vigilant with a proactive mental health strategy to help our veterans and returning servicemembers readjust to stateside duty after their exposure to combat. H.R. 327 would require VA to implement a comprehensive program to reduce the incidence of suicide among our veterans. Specific steps included in this bill are: a campaign to reduce stigma surrounding seeking help or training for VA staff in suicide prevention and education; the creation of peer counselors to understand risk factors and to assist families during the readjustment process; and a 24-hour counseling line so that veterans, especially those in rural areas, could seek help whenever they need it. 
   VA is already fulfilling many of the requirements of H.R. 327. The Secretary of VA developed and has started to implement a similar suicide prevention strategy that is based on public health and clinical models with activities both in VA facilities and within local communities. For example, VA is fulfilling requirements of H.R. 327 by providing training for both clinical and nonclinical staff on how to assess and respond to patients that they may come in contact with that are at risk for suicide. And by April 1, the Department plans to have in place a Suicide Prevention Coordinator within each VA medical center. 
   The VA's Serious Mental Illness Treatment Research and Evaluation Center will be designated to guide prevention strategies and maintain data on suicide rates and risk factors. VA is also currently working to create a suicide prevention hotline by the end of this calendar year. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 327. This legislation does put the full force of legal authority behind a comprehensive program to ensure that VA is taking all appropriate measures to prevent suicide among our Nation's veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to today in support of House Resolution 1026, recognizing the 100th anniversary of the Congressional Club. One hundred years ago, the Congressional Club was founded to promote friendship among the spouses of Members of Congress. While keeping true to its purpose, the club throughout the years has become much more. Not only does this distinctive club build relationships between the two political parties, but it also organizes charity events and diplomatic receptions. Every spring since 1912, the spouses gather to host a luncheon in honor of our First Lady, and they donate tens of thousands of dollars to charities in her name. Many of the club's charitable recipients include mentoring programs, literacy programs, the White House library, youth dance troupes, domestic shelters, and child care centers. 
   Fulfilling their own mission to encourage all Americans to strive for greater friendship, civility, and generosity in order to heighten public service, elevate the culture, and enrich humanity; the spouses extend their hands globally in friendship and goodwill by hosting an annual diplomatic reception to entertain the spouses of Ambassadors to the United States. The Congressional Club encourages all Americans to seek out opportunities to give support and to volunteer to assist charitable organizations in their own communities. 
   I am proud and honored that my wife, Vicki Miller, is the incoming president of the Congressional Club next year. She follows in the footsteps of admirable Presidents including Mrs. Vivian Bishop, Mrs. Lindy Boggs, Mrs. Jo Ann Emerson, Mrs. Lois Capps, Mrs. Mary Bono Mack, and Ms. Doris Matsui. I know Vicki is looking forward to carrying on the friendships and bipartisan traditions of the club. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I would like to congratulate the Congressional Club on its 100th anniversary and to recognize these spouses in their efforts to promote the greater good both here at home and abroad. May God bless them and may the Congressional Club continue in their friendship and charitable efforts for many years to come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As Memorial Day approaches, it's appropriate that we take time this week to consider the next 10 bills that are on the suspension calendar. In doing so, we must be mindful of the heavy sacrifices made by the men and the women of our Armed Forces. It is their sacrifices that allow us to enjoy our American way of life and time-honored traditions like Memorial Day. 
   For many of us, Memorial Day will be marked with a solemn commemoration at a veterans' cemetery or a befitting memorial. I appreciate Chairman Filner's expediting these bills through the committee process to bring them to the floor in a timely fashion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon in support of H.R. 2790, as amended, a bill to establish the position of Director or Physician Assistant Services within the office of the Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health. I commend my colleagues Mr. Hare and Mr. Moran for introducing this bill. 
   There is a strong relationship between military service and the physician assistant profession. In 1965 Duke University established the first PA education program to capture the knowledge of military medical corpsmen that served in Vietnam and transition their experience into the civilian health care system. Today the VA is the largest employer of physician assistants, and they play a central role in enhancing veterans' access to health care, and it's important for VA to continue to advance the utilization of these health care providers. 
   Establishing this office would be beneficial to veterans. A full-time Director would ensure PAs are used appropriately to provide veterans the health care that they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5856, the VA Medical Facility Authorization and Lease Act of 2008. I am pleased that this bill will comprehensively address the needs of veterans throughout the Nation. 
   Important to delivering high quality care to our Nation's veterans is the planning for the construction of VA's substantial health care infrastructure. It is vital that veterans can continue to receive care where they need it most and will be able to receive it where they need it in the future. They have given so much for our country, and providing them with timely access to the best health care possible is just one important way we can show them how thankful we are for what all they have done. 
   This legislation improves access to care for veterans by ensuring that current VA facilities are modernized and that future construction occurs where it is needed. That means keeping track of where veterans live and locating facilities in those areas. Too often, veterans must travel great distances to receive their health care, but this is something that we can fix, and the VA Medical Facility Authorization and Lease Act of 2008 is an important step in that direction. 
    I commend Chairman Michaud for his work on this legislation through the Subcommittee on Health and the full Veterans' Affairs Committee, and look forward to its passage.

   I rise in strong support of H.R. 3681, as amended, called the Veterans Benefits Awareness Act of 2008, which would amend title 38 of the U.S. Code to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to advertise in the national media to promote awareness of benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. 
   I additionally want to thank my colleague, Mr. Boozman, for introducing this bill, as well as Chairman Herseth Sandlin of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, and Chairman Filner of the full committee, for expediting this bill through the committee process to bring it to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, as anyone who watches TV or listens to the radio experiences advertising aimed at convincing them of the need for, or the quality of a product or a service, businesses buy advertising, sometimes at very expensive prices because it works. VA should be doing the same thing to bring its outreach programs into the 21st century. H.R. 3681 will clarify VA's authority to use advertising to increase veterans' awareness of the benefits and services that are offered by VA. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this fine measure and reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in honor of H. Con. Res. 32, which does honor the members of the United States Air Force that were killed on the 25th of June, 1996 in the Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. 
   This is the 12th anniversary of the terrorist bombing which killed 19 members of the U.S. Air Force and injured over 300 Americans. On that day in 1996, a truck bomb exploded outside the fence around the Khobar Towers compound.     
   The bomb, estimated at more than 3,000 pounds, detonated about 85 feet from a residential housing unit where U.S. troops were, killing 19 United States Air Force servicemen and wounding hundreds of other Americans. The force of that explosion destroyed or damaged six high-rise apartment buildings and shattered windows throughout the entire residential compound. 
   Today we honor the 19 airmen who gave their lives in the service of this great Nation. This Congress joins me in paying tribute to those men, who are individually recognized in H. Con. Res. 32. 
   It's important to note that 12 of the 19 men killed in the attack were based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida's First District. Several of the airmen, along with their families, were constituents. These brave men, like the men and women currently serving in our military today, were on freedom's watch, prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Nation. As we approach Memorial Day, it's only fitting that we remember the 19 airmen killed at Khobar Towers as well as the many brave men and women who gave their lives for our freedom and our security. It's my sincere hope that all Americans will give pause and honor these heroes and others for their sacrifice. 
   As we look back to 12 years ago, we know that Khobar Towers and the bombing there was a precursor to the terrorist attacks on the USS Cole; the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center; and the current global war on terrorism that we fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. No matter where our troops are stationed, we recognize that they are prepared to defend our security, American values, and the American way of life. It's my hope that we can prevent future attacks like the one at Khobar Towers as we aggressively fight terrorism all around the globe. 
   I want to personally express my deepest appreciation to the families of these heroes who were killed at Khobar Towers. We can never undo the tragedy that they have lived. We can never ease the pain, and I know it's with each of them each and every day. But I hope, and I know that my colleagues join me in this hope, that with the adoption of this resolution, they will take from our actions some solace in the fact that we do not forget those contributions and those sacrifices of their loved ones. They were much more than airmen. They were sons, fathers, brothers, and they are loved ones. 
   Mr. Speaker, our action on this resolution sends a message to the families of those who died, to our Nation, and to the rest of the world, that we honor the sacrifices of these 19 airmen and the families they left behind. They served with the highest distinction and professionalism which is indicative of the United States military. No one could have served better or given more. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join me and the 50 cosponsors in support of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, almost 2 weeks ago, Secretary Henry Paulson came to this Congress requesting $700 billion of taxpayer money for his friends and former colleagues on Wall Street. The former chairman of the investment bank of Goldman Sachs also asked this Congress to pass a law ensuring that his actions ``are nonreviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.'' 
   The Founders of this great Nation set up an ingenious system of government to ensure that power was not disproportionately given to any one individual. The goal was to avoid tyranny, to avoid tyranny at all costs. But Secretary Paulson most likely skipped class that day and was hoping that we had as well. Many wonder how such a poorly constructed piece of legislation could even come to the Congress in the first place. And I wonder how our President approved this as well. 
   By demanding this bailout money, the administration attempted to circumvent the legislative process. Moreover, the administration continues to insist that their way is the only way to avoid an imminent crisis. 
   And perhaps most stunning is that the administration officials that are responsible for protecting American taxpayers and our free-market system were asleep at the switch. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Chris Cox recently admitted his culpability in this matter and amazingly, the Secretary of the Treasury recently admitted he had seen this crisis coming for almost a year and just now has come to our Congress. 
   Such large-scale government interference in our government ensures that the correction process will take much longer. And what would help toward long-term stability is an injection of private capital, private capital into our economy. We need to lower tax rates on capital gains and corporate income, allowing people to invest more of their money and relieving American companies from one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. 
   The Democrats didn't care to address the capital gains tax issue. And in fact their response to the administration's bailout plan was just as bad.

   Just last week, Medicare trustees again reminded Congress that Medicare is projected to draw more than 45 percent of its funding from the general government revenue, as opposed to the Medicare trust fund. 
   If Congress doesn't start to make some changes, the program will face over $34 trillion in unfunded obligations over the next 75 years, which is nearly seven times the size of outstanding public debt today. This rapid growth in Medicare expenditures is fiscally unsustainable.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of victory in Iraq and in support of our troops. But I also rise to oppose this Democratic defeatist resolution and I hope to provide some historical perspective to help the American people understand what the Democrats plan to do this year. 
   Make no mistake about it, this resolution is about polls. National polling before November's elections showed a majority of Americans were opposed to cutting off funds for the war but were generally unhappy with events on the ground. Now, this polling data led the Democratic message machine to create a ``we support the troops, don't support the war but won't cut off funding'' position. Much like Majority Leader Hoyer's empty promises to allow a Republican alternative to this defeatist resolution, the Democrats are now following polls and slowly, piece by piece, bit by bit, revising their stance on defunding the war. 
   Due to their majority status, this resolution will pass, and soon after the  passage, I suspect that Congressman Murtha and others will move to defund the war the same way the Democratic-controlled Congress defunded the Vietnam War over a several-year period. They will do so in a piecemeal fashion with various amendments to appropriation bills, always avoiding the term ``defunding'' at all costs.     
   Before we have even concluded this debate, our Speaker has already said a vote of disapproval will set the stage for additional Iraq legislation, which will be coming to the House floor. I ask our Speaker, what is your additional Iraq legislation? 
   The only difference between what the Democrats will soon attempt to do and what they did in the late 1960s and early 1970s is that they will continue to say publicly that they support the troops, instead of speaking, as Senator Kerry did, in front of a congressional committee of the atrocities of the so-called baby killers. The poisonous atmosphere of those times resulted in the military prohibiting all military personnel in the metropolitan Washington area from wearing their uniforms in public out of safety concerns. 
   Now, two of the most crippling amendments of the Vietnam War were passed in 1969 and 1973. In 1969, Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky cosponsored an amendment prohibiting the use of ground troops in Laos and Thailand. In August of 1973, the Congress passed the Fulbright-Aiken amendment, which cut off all funding for U.S. military forces in or over or from the shore of North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia. 
   President Nixon's approval ratings in 1973 were dismally low, and he was close to resigning as a result of the Watergate scandal, and his weakened position emboldened the Democrats to take extreme actions. I would say that some of their actions may have bordered on treasonous, but they have never been judicially challenged. 
   Our current President has an approval rating nearly as low now as they did then. Democrats are feeling emboldened to challenge our Commander in Chief during a time of war specifically for political gain. 
   It has also been said that this nonbinding resolution will not affect troop morale. If so, why not amend this nonbinding resolution to send a copy to every man and woman fighting in Iraq, along with a record of each vote. That is right, we don't get a chance to have any amendments. 
   What is important here are the President's words and his actions. He has ordered more combat forces to Iraq. He has extended the tours of some forces already in country. Let us be perfectly clear, 14 of the 18 provinces in Iraq are secure. These additional forces will help restore overall order and provide a stable environment for the political process from within which to work. Now, I cannot assure all of my constituents that the recent developments in Iraq will result in a quick or certain victory in Iraq. But I can assure my constituents and my colleagues that Democrats cannot say with absolute certainty that there is no military solution to the war in Iraq. 
   I must also point out several other recent Democratic statements that I take issue with, like the one from over this weekend, where a Senator with Presidential ambitions said that more than 3,000 lives were wasted. Of course, he clarified his remarks, because he forgot about the secret Democratic memo that this isn't the 1970s any more, and trashing the military is no longer acceptable. 
   It reminds me of a former Presidential candidate who said that those who joined our Army were only stupid people. Of course, after the polls came in, he clarified his remarks because he saw they were not being taken very well. 
   Back to the polls, only 15 percent of the public expressed initial support for the first President Bush to invade Iraq in 1991. Many in my own Republican Party vehemently opposed FDR in World War II. During the Civil War, there was a congressional committee that met officially and unofficially on a regular basis to critique President Lincoln's performance in nearly every battle the Union waged. Does history now reflect these?

   Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, once again, the eloquence of our able chairman, he has done an excellent job in explaining the bill that's before us on the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an outstanding bill. It was a true bipartisan effort. I appreciate the chairman of the committee, Mr. Michaud's, able leadership  in bringing this bill to the floor. It does all of the things that our chairman had talked about. 
   It deals with veterans in rural and remote areas. It does deal with certain DOD biological and chemical warfare testing that was done during the Cold War. It also deals with domiciliary programs, providing adequate and safe environments to meet the needs of women veterans. 
   This is not just a good bill. It is a very good bill that helps VA provide better care for our Nation's veteran, and I do urge my colleagues to support this legislation  
   H.R. 2874, the Veterans' Health Care Improvement Act of 2007, as amended, has strong bipartisan support and I want to express my sincere thanks to Subcommittee Chairman MICHAUD for his leadership and hard work to develop this legislation. 
   H.R. 2874, as amended, would establish a number of meaningful improvements that will help VA to provide better care for our Nation's veterans. 
   Veterans in remote rural areas would benefit with the establishment of a grant program to provide innovative transportation options to access VA medical facilities. 
   Readjustment counseling and mental health services for OIF/OEF veterans would be enhanced through programs that would provide peer outreach and support services, with special emphasis for Guard and Reservists. 
   Veterans who participated in certain Department of Defense biological and chemical warfare testing during the Cold War would permanently be granted free VA medical care for conditions that may have resulted from their participation in such testing. 
   VA domiciliary programs would be required to have adequate and safe environments to meet the needs of women veterans. 
   Very low-income veteran families residing in or transitioning to permanent housing would be eligible for VA financial assistance for supportive services. 
   This is a good bill that would help VA provide better care for our Nation's veterans. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just say H.R. 2874, as amended, would establish a number of meaningful improvements that would help VA to provide better care for our Nation's veterans. Once again, I support my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MILLER of Florida. (PROHIBITION ON COLLECTION OF COPAYMENTS FOR ALL HOSPICE CARE FURNISHED BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. I thank the chairman again for his willingness to quickly move this legislation to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2623, as amended, is a bill that I am a sponsor of. It prohibits the collection of copayments for all hospice care furnished by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   Hospice and palliative care is a continuum of comfort-oriented and supportive services provided across settings, including hospitals, extended care facilities, as the chairman said, outpatient clinics, and private residences. Under current law, a veteran receiving care in a nursing home is exempt from any copay. However, if they choose to take that care in their own home or in an acute-care facility, they could be charged a copayment. VA's current policy would penalize a veteran who chooses to remain in their own home for their end-of-life care or, out of medical necessity, receives their care in an acute-care setting. 
   The bipartisan support of this bill is greatly appreciated. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MILLER of Florida. (HONORING ISRAEL ON ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today also to honor the state of Israel which will celebrate its 60th anniversary in May. The relationship between the United States and Israel is indeed a special one. Israel has been our close friend and ally through the Cold War and now in the global war on terror. It is a relationship that will continue to strengthen in the years to come. 
   Even after 60 years, Israel continues to fight for its very survival against relentless attacks by Hamas and Hezbollah and other terrorist groups. The United States and Israel must always stand in complete solidarity against those nations and groups that seek to destroy Israel. We have stood together against anti-Semitism for the last 60 years, and we will continue to do so for many years to come. 
   I congratulate the Israeli government and the Israeli people on their special day. May God continue to bless the very close American relationship with Israel not only in this special year, but for all eternity.

<DOCNO>Mr. MILLER of Florida. (MICHAEL BILIRAKIS DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SPINAL CORD INJURY CENTER -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MILLER of Florida. I thank the ranking member for yielding the time. 
   As you already know, for 24 years Mike Bilirakis served as a staunch advocate for veterans, not only on the floor of this House, but in the committee room, serving on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, including vice-chairman of the full committee. Mike strongly promoted equitable and improved benefits for all of our Nation's veterans and their families as well. 
   One of his signature efforts has already been talked about today, and that was concurrent receipt, H.R. 303. We all remember that very well because that was his signature bill that he pushed on the floor of this House. But his work was not just there. I mean, he was instrumental in seeing that the Department of Veterans Affairs took care of surviving spouses, as the ranking member just said, through the Survivor Benefit Plan. He reassured veterans everywhere that they were not forgotten. And as chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and investigations, he made sure that the VA carried out its mission through its responsibilities. 
   Another one of the key accomplishments of Mike's during his tenure was funding for the Spinal Cord Injury Center at the James Haley VA Medical Center. For 12 years, Mike worked tirelessly to see this center come to reality, and I think it's fitting that it be named after Congressman Bilirakis. 
   When the center opened in February of 2002, some 7,000 veterans from that area finally had a place that they could specifically go that was suited for their needs that they had, those unique needs. So Mr. Speaker, it is only fitting that this facility, providing groundbreaking research such as this one, be named after a person who gave everything that he had to see that veterans receive the care and attention that they deserve. 
   Veterans always knew they had a voice in Michael Bilirakis. Many of us got to serve with him very proudly here in Congress and applauded his enthusiasm. So it's my pleasure to stand today in support of this piece of legislation.
