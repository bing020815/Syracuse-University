<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, 1 minute is just the right amount of time to deal with an issue that is as simple as this: we cannot allow our enemies abroad to have secrets, and we must maintain the secret of how we discover, uncover, reveal, and react to their attempts to hide their activities, including the attempt to kill Americans. That's what this is all about. That's what we are looking for within the next 15 days. I am supportive of this bill because I want to make sure that we cover these two points. 
   It is not enough to simply attack your enemy when he attacks you. We clearly have to know what he intends to do, including when he communicates with his operatives in America from overseas; and we very clearly need to not let our enemies, through discovery in more than 40 lawsuits leveled against all of our communications companies, uncover what they may or may not have done. 
   I want to make sure that we understand: it is not just what communications companies may have done. We do not want our enemies to know what they may not have done.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, today in the Committee on Oversight and Reform, we are going to continue without a doubt the attack on our men and women in uniform. It is clear after last week's debate in which 79 Members of the House refused to denounce MoveOn.org for their attacks on the patriotism of General David Petraeus, there are those who intend to continue to attack the war on any front. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise not because I support the war, not because I love war, not because in fact I have any desire to have this war or any war last one day longer than absolutely necessary. 
   Mr. Speaker, unable to effectively portray our men and women in uniform as guilty of wrongdoing, in spite of the fact that one of our Members called in fact our marines, marines based at Camp Pendleton, killers of women and children in cold blood. Those charges for the most part have already been dismissed. 
   Our men and women in uniform make mistakes. In the Committee on Oversight and Reform today, we are going to be talking about not our men and women in uniform, but men and women who served an average of 10 years in uniform who have joined private contractors in support of our State Department. Specifically, Mr. Speaker, I am talking about Blackwater. I am not defending Blackwater. The truth is neither Speaker Pelosi nor Chairman Waxman know what happened in Iraq in September. What we do know is that there are investigations going on into the specific incidents, like so many incidents in a country in which every day soldiers, sailors and marines die by IEDs and roadside bombs and other ways of killing our men and women without taking risk to their own lives. 
   An incident like that apparently occurred in September, but instead of waiting until the IG, the FBI, the State Department concluded their investigations, today, Mr. Speaker, the Government Oversight and Reform will decide that they are going to go after the facts directly. They have subpoenaed directly the CEO of that company, not because he was there, not because he has some special knowledge, but because, Mr. Speaker, it is all about the headlines. The bodies were not even cold on that incident before the Committee on Oversight and Reform began to prepare for today's hearings. 
   In order to believe that Blackwater is guilty before the evidence is in, you have to believe the Minister of Interior. Mr. Speaker, you have to believe the very organization that former Washington, DC, Chief Ramsey and retired four star General Jim Jones called that organization that he leads, some 300,000 police, 85 percent of whom are Shia, so corrupted and so compromised as to be disbanded. In fact, that is exactly the organization that apparently arrived and apparently is to be believed that some wrongdoing occurred. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I went to Iraq the last time or one time, I went with Chairman Waxman and now Speaker Pelosi, our unit was guarded by Blackwater. At that time, I didn't hear any objections to the overhead cover provided by Blackwater. I didn't hear any objections to the EOD unit that was protecting us against bombs. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the only time there seems to be a desire to have this type of oversight is when the headlines would help demean the very effort we are involved in in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I trust that the American people are in fact more knowledgeable of what this war is all about. Not that they want this war, but that they do not want to have the men and women in uniform or those Americans who under contract go to this combat zone willingly, most of them after service in that combat zone while in uniform, demeaned without a fair opportunity for investigation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was one of many Members of Congress who asked that today's hearing be postponed until at least the State Department, the FBI, and other organizations had an opportunity to do a proper investigation. I am proud to be a ranking member on the Subcommittee on Oversight and Reform, but I am ashamed that we in fact are doing trials rather than oversight. We have never done anything more shameless than what we are doing today, going after an organization without waiting for the facts. We  do not oversee Blackwater in the Congress; we oversee the administration, and we should be looking at their reports, we should be looking at what they have done, and we should be in fact reforming anything that is wrong in the administration. 
   So I trust that today's hearings will be watched by many people, Mr. Speaker. I trust that Members of this body will view this as what it is, a witch hunt, because they can't go after our men and women in uniform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Chairman, in this body, everyone is allowed an opinion. My opinion is I am going to vote to preserve the secret ballot and I will vote for Ranking Member McKeon's amendment. 
   But I think we also have to recognize that truth has to be told. Just a moment ago, I heard one of my colleagues say that Republicans hadn't raised the minimum wage in the 12 years they were in the majority. Of course, 1997 was in those 12 years. That was the last time it was raised, and 2006, this body, Republicans led to raise the minimum wage. It didn't get out of the Senate. That happens. 
   Interestingly, Members taking credit for raising the minimum wage, it has only left the House. It hasn't gone one inch further than it did in the last Congress, when Republicans led the way to raise the minimum wage. So, please, you are entitled to your opinion, but not your facts. 
   I am concerned today that on a partisan basis, the Democratic Party, here and on other initiatives, including looking into putting a disclosure requirement when a preacher in a church says, ``I think you ought to vote your conscience,'' that is going to become public if they have the disclosure. 
   I think there is a pattern of trying to make public for purposes of intimidation, and all I can say is shame on the Democratic Party.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment and for the exact same reason that my colleague on the other side of the aisle opposes it. 
   We have a predicament that we are dealing with in this very committee, in the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. We are dealing with global warming. The $2 billion-plus that we spend every year, and scientists like Jim Hansen and others who have been out there saying what they want to freely, the way they want to, and they have done this at a time in which there is an allegation of a problem. Quite frankly, it is amazing that when I Google, I get tens of thousands of hits on a scientist who is talking about why global warming is a threat, why we have to do things quickly, and yet there is some theory that we have stifled science. 
   By treating science separately in the whistleblower status, we are doing a disservice to every scientist and treating them adversely, separately and differently. This simply wants to return us to a procedure that we had before, one that has worked. In fact, Jim Hansen, who will be before our committee next week, and others have gone through a vetting process and then proceeded to make freely the speeches they wanted to make. There has not been a need for whistleblower. In fact, scientists are free to express their opinions now, and that is appropriate; they can do it under the existing guidelines. 
   This amendment seeks to return us to what was a functioning system, one in which we supported science, and scientists have been free to say what they want to. There may be edits going up the process that the gentleman on the other side of the aisle objects to, but there were edits under the previous administration. 
   I urge support of the Sali amendment, recognizing that, in fact, this would be a sword that could cut both ways and the future could be adverse to the very scientists it seeks to assist.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (RECOGNIZING THE FBI ON THEIR 100TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleague on a bipartisan basis to recognize that in the 100 years since President Theodore Roosevelt created the FBI out of basically an assemblage of Secret Service agents and detectives, what we have done is we have grown 1,000-fold in the number of agents. Clearly today with 30,000 employees, you ask how large has the task of the FBI grown. It has grown 1,000-fold. 
   Whether in fact it was taking on public corruption throughout this last 100 years or taking on racketeering, white collar crime, taking on the rubble of the Oklahoma City bombing and finding out who the true perpetrators were and bringing them to justice, or going after wrongdoing by the most hidden and most influential of corporate America, the FBI has spread out to do its job and do it well. 
   The Bureau, in fact, has taken the next step since September 11 when its primary task became protecting us from another terrorist attack like the one we experienced in New York, in Washington, and Pennsylvania. Those attacks made it very clear that this elite agency had to do more. 
   Today more than ever the FBI agents who are spread throughout the world in every embassy and in locations not even known to this body, they deal with counterterrorism in a way that no other agency can. Working hand-in-hand with overseas entities who have the charge for that, they make it their business to ensure that that foreign terrorism doesn't become an American tragedy. 
   No other group is so prepared to recognize the needs of America and the civil rights of America. The FBI has been a critical tool for President after President to enforce our civil rights laws often against the powerful, even against governors and other elected officials who chose not to recognize the importance of the U.S. Constitution. 
   The FBI has never been a partisan organization and has, in fact, served each and every administration in a way that we today commemorate and appreciate so much. 
   Once again, Mr. Speaker, for the first 90-plus years, the FBI was important. After September 11, 2001, the FBI's expanded role is vital. 
   With that, I urge the passage of this bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleague in urging support for this legislation. 
   The Supreme Court is an independent branch of government needing to have the exact same level and should, to be honest, without any need for extension should, on a permanent basis, have a recognized ability to protect itself. 
   We view ourselves as independent, and we have the Capitol Police. Certainly the executive branch views itself as independent and has both the Secret Service and, of course, the Army, the Navy, and the Marines, and so on. 
   So I certainly believe that this is important for us to do today to extend the authority of the United States Supreme Court Police. But I would happily work with my colleague on the other side of the aisle to recognize that in fact this is a permanent need, and although we would have to fund it on an annual basis as we do the Secret Service, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, and so on, that we should never let the Supreme Court have any doubt but that its independence, its autonomy, its ability to do its constitutional duty without any question, but that they and those who they need to protect along with them would be protected, we should do that through a funding mechanism and never again need to do what we're doing here today. Having said that, this is a body that takes what it gets and does what it can with what it gets. 
   Today we're considering an extension. I move with my colleague on the other side to do that, and I urge all of my colleagues to pass this. I believe this is going to be passed unanimously today. But long before 2013, we should, in fact, make this a permanent authorization.

   Mr. Speaker, I say this in a bipartisan way, that in fact this body, and I know we are not allowed to talk about the other body, the Senate, and so I will only talk in terms of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill came back with a very good piece of legislation attached to a very good piece of legislation; but it came back based on a fundamental problem between the two bodies, and I thought it appropriate to speak on it. 
   There is no germaneness to the second half of this bill. This is simply the Senate's ability under their rules to take something that is not germane and attach it. I wouldn't have a problem with that except under our rules, Mr. Speaker, even if we are in fact doing an immigration bill in committee, as we were last week, even if that immigration bill deals with the allocation of who gets to come into this country temporarily and permanently, if the bill only deals with one sub, sub, sub-portion of a statute, that is all we are allowed to consider. That is wrong, Mr. Speaker. 
   And so I address you on behalf of the inequity between something completely unrelated being attached to a bill and voted out of this body. Both of these pieces of legislation are bipartisan. But if we cannot in fact even consider like information if it is ever so slightly outside of the definition of germaneness, and then we have to accept whole pieces of legislation never voted on because they were attached by the Senate, this body needs fundamental reform as to what our rules of germaneness are.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2352, the School Safety Enhancement Act of 2008. Each day roughly 160,000 children miss school because they are afraid of violent incident: 100,000 children take a weapon to school, often a gun, more often a knife; 14,000 young people are attacked on school property each year; 6,250 teachers are threatened each day; and 260 teachers are assaulted. This has to stop. 
   Normally, the Federal Government doesn't have a role in the day-to-day activities of public schools. In this case, when, in fact, a future workforce is endangered, and the widespread use of these kinds of techniques is often done by gangs and other organized crime links that, in fact, we are fighting on another front. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this because we cannot put all of our money into fighting gangs on the street. We have to do something to secure schools. We have to make sure that gang membership is not necessary just to go to class. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill. This is a bill that, in fact, was first introduced by, many of the provisions were first introduced by Republicans. It is one of those bills that has transcended the change in the administration, change in leadership of the House. And I hope that we will continue to have this kind of work, finding smarter ways, better ways to stem crime on the street, including stemming crime in the classroom.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TORTURE AND TERRORISM ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this piece of legislation. I was not aware of it in its earliest authorship. I became aware of it, in addition to the issue which I was aware of, only when it began to move toward our committee. As I looked at both the legislation and those affected, who had worked so valiantly for 17 years to try to bring justice to an unjust occurrence in the history of Iraq, I discovered that we had a large group of men and women who had been used as human shields, a relatively small group of people who had been tortured at Saddam's hands, Americans. 
   But what I also discovered was that these people had no other way to focus the injustice of what had happened to them than by seeking a remedy in the courts, and that had been denied them for so long. Now they have that remedy from the courts, and they're being denied the opportunity to avail themselves of it. 
   Mr. Speaker, if this were just about money, I wouldn't be standing here. This is not. This is about a much larger cause. Throughout our history, we have endeavored to compensate our men and women when we send them to war. We've endeavored to compensate them when they're prisoners of war, but we will never be able to compensate them for the torture that they've received at the hands of barbarians. 
   The very barbarian who ordered this misconduct, Saddam Hussein, has been executed by the new government of Iraq. The new government of Iraq every day is seeking to reenter the world of justice and civilized nations. They're doing so in a myriad of ways, including settling the wrongful acts of the Saddam regime. This is no different. 
   The amendments that I asked for, and on a bipartisan way were granted, in the Judiciary Committee sought to make it clear America wants no compensation from the new Iraq government unless it is consistent with other compensation for similar acts of the Saddam Hussein regime. As Mr. Scott has already said, the administration of Iraq is making those efforts today, and I know they will negotiate in good faith with the victims of torture if, in fact, they have standing to do so. 
   That's why we're working on a bipartisan basis to grant the President the ability, if there are not similar settlements, to withhold this capability until or unless there are. I don't want this to be about every past war, but it wouldn't be fair to ask for this if we hadn't previously seen Libya make settlements finally but only after the State Department had withdrawn their objections. 
   And to most people here on the House floor, World War II is but a memory or a piece of history they've read about. The men and women who were taken at Bataan and other places were tortured. Most of them died. Then, too, we felt that we shouldn't burden the new Japanese Government with the sins of the past government. I think that's a bad precedent. 
   I believe that the making whole of people for whom you have done more  than just conduct war is, in fact, the responsibility on an ongoing basis of a government if they have the ability and certainly if they grant similar compensation to people from other countries or, in the case of Japan, Libya and post-Saddam Iraq, if they grant money damages to companies who often lost nothing but money. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to support this legislation wholeheartedly. I know my Republican colleagues will. I note that this is, in fact, a good message to the administration to facilitate the settlement rather than to stand aside on it.  
   Mr. Speaker, many members of our armed forces faced horrible abuse and torture at the hands of Iraq's former dictator, Saddam Hussein, during the first Gulf War. We owe those members of the armed forces not only our sympathy, but our deepest thanks for enduring immense pain and suffering for a larger cause that helped keep all of us safe here at home. We also owe those members of the armed forces justice. And that's why we're here today to pass H.R. 5167, the Justice for Victims of Torture and Terrorism Act. 
   In the closing hours before the most recent House recess, I was very pleased to see the House, and the Senate, send legislation to the President that statutorily approved an agreement that was reached between the State Department and Libya regarding the compensation of Americans injured by Libyan-sponsored terrorism. That legislation was passed by both bodies under unanimous consent. It not only approved the negotiated agreement, which provides for hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation, but it also protected the agreement from being undone by lawyers and judges who would have otherwise interfered with its implementation. 
   The agreement with Libya shows that State-to-State negotiations for the compensation of victims of terrorism can work. It is a far more effective means of compensating victims than lawsuits, as domestic court judgments are always difficult to enforce, and foreign entities have many ways of moving their funds offshore to avoid collection. Negotiations worked to provide fair compensation for the victims of Libya, and they can work to provide fair compensation to the victims of the torture and terrorism perpetrated by Saddam Hussein's former regime. 
   I was very pleased to have been able to craft a bill with Chairman CONYERS that not only facilitates, but encourages, State-to-State negotiations with the new democracy in Iraq that is the surest means of providing ultimate compensation for deserving victims. An amendment I offered at committee with Chairman CONYERS, and which is now part of this bill, provides that the negotiations process will be allowed to continue as long as ``the President has certified to the Congress ..... that ..... negotiations are ongoing with the Government of Iraq to settle the claims in the [covered] cases ..... and the President believes that those negotiations are being conducted in good faith and could lead to a satisfactory settlement of those claims .....'' 
   Under this provision, the President must, on a regular basis, provide Congress with a status report attesting to the continuing good faith negotiations between the parties, and to the prospect that those negotiations could lead to a satisfactory settlement. That provision is necessary to help balance several worthy goals. 
   One of those goals is the maintaining of a stable, free, and democratic Iraq that will help ensure horrors the likes of which were seen under Saddam Hussein will not be seen again. To that end, earlier in this Congress, Congress passed H.R. 4986, which authorized the President to waive lawsuits against the new democracy in Iraq if the President determined that the waiver is in the national security interest of the United States; that the waiver will promote the reconstruction of, the consolidation of democracy in, and the relations of the United States with, Iraq; and that Iraq continues to be a reliable ally of the United States and partner in combating acts of international terrorism. On the day the President signed that provision into law, he signed a waiver and issued a statement justifying the exercise of the waiver authority.

   Mr. Speaker, this is drawing to a close. I think that so much has been said, not nearly enough. I appreciate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have done such a good job of making this a bipartisan piece of legislation. 
   Additionally, I would like to echo the last speaker because the gentleman from Pennsylvania, rightfully so, reminded us that the men and women in our Armed Forces, in which he served and in which I served, know the rules; they know the rules that we operate under, and we know the penalty if we break those rules. We know that if our country were to, in fact, torture somebody, we would both punish those who did it and compensate those who were treated in any inconsistent way with the rule of law. We only ask that the post-Saddam Iraq, if they're paying compensation and apologizing to others, they do the same to the men who suffered at their hands. 
   So I think that for all the men and women serving in the Armed Forces today and those who have served in the past, this Congress, on a bipartisan basis, is taking a giant step toward saying we will hold others accountable as we have always held our own accountable.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   Madam Speaker, that makes it very clear that in fact even if there is no objection to including the brave men and women who operate, often without weapons, who operate behind enemy lines, who in fact are part of our Intelligence Community, they cannot be included in this resolution. It is a sad day when democracy does not even include that which there is no objection to from being considered. 
   Notwithstanding that, Madam Speaker, I think it is extremely important that we deal with the limited strict language we have been offered, and, in the spirit of that strict language, I must oppose it. I must oppose it because in fact on a strict basis this resolution, if heeded by the administration, says stay a failed course of action. 
   Madam Speaker, it is amazing that the election very clearly told us in November that the American people were not comfortable with the conduct of this war; that in fact on both sides of the aisle, people were calling for a bolder vision, a vision that was more aggressive diplomatically and militarily. In fact, two Presidential candidates, Senator HILLARY CLINTON and,  in fact, Senator McCain, are and have been saying we should have had more troops early, we should have more troops now. It is amazing that in fact the one thing this resolution is saying is stay the course, make no changes. 
   Further, regardless of what my Democrat colleagues would say today, the next step after ``Mr. President, we will not send more troops,'' is, ``Mr. President, we will not send more tanks; Mr. President, we will not send further personnel and intellectual gatherers to understand our enemy; Mr. President, we won't send more translators; Mr. President, we cannot and will not support more body armor; Mr. President, we will not support this war on terror throughout the region.'' 
   Those are the next steps, because you can't simply say, as this resolution tries to, stay the course. Do nothing. No increases, no decreases. Support the troops, but send them no more. 
   That makes as much sense as telling the people at the Alamo, stay the course. That wasn't the right solution at the Alamo. At the Alamo they should have either increased their forces so that they could have sustained the bombardment, or withdrawn. 
   We, in fact, are in a position where the President has made a multitude of new initiatives, one of which includes additional troops to help relieve those tired troops, to help bring the force level up to a level similar to exactly what Presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle were clamoring for just a few weeks ago and throughout the election. 
   Madam Speaker, one of the other things that just amazes me, today I took a little time and I checked out how many Members of Congress served in the military. It turns out it is less than one-third. I checked out how many Members went to Iraq in the previous Congress. It turns out less than one-third. 
   The fact is that we are considering a resolution as though we were General Petraeus, a man who was unanimously confirmed in the Senate just a few days ago, and deployed to support and defend our troops and this effort, who is solidly convinced that we have to do more and do it better and who is there to do it and was unanimously confirmed. 
   In closing, Madam Speaker, only here, with less than one-third of the Members having gone and seen what is going on in Iraq, less than one-third having served in the military, even at a minor level of lieutenant or captain or private, have the hubris to say that we have to not add, not subtract, just keep the exact same number that we and the American people believe is not getting the job done. That is exactly what this resolution is claiming to do. We are not given an alternative in any way, shape or form. 
   So, Madam Speaker, there is no choice on either side of the aisle. Whether you believe we should have more or we should have less, nobody believes that we should stay the exact course with no change, and that is what this is asking for. 
   So I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to realize that in fact this resolution calls for the one thing that the American people most object to, and that is unchanged staying the course at this level. The American people called on us in November to do something bolder, to bring peace in the region, and I call on you to vote down this resolution just exactly to do that

   Interestingly enough, firefighters also carry automatic external defibrillators and save lives every day. Firefighters are not just people who put out fires. They are people who train in the prevention of fire. They are people who train in emergency procedures that save lives. They are people who answer to so many calls in our community. 
   The fact is on 9/11 we understood that firefighters go in the direction where anyone, anyone, should be running from and they do so with no regard for their own safety. They do so because that is what a firefighter's job is. Firefighters do not shy away from riots. They do not shy away from the worst inferno, and they do not shy away from earthquakes in my home State and other disasters. In fact, the term ``American hero'' is best attributed to the men and women who every day train to go into fires to find and retrieve people and, in fact, not to leave the site until all life has been preserved and all property, to the best of their ability, has also been maintained. 
   Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in recognizing the heroism not just in California 2 months ago but, in fact, throughout the country of our firefighters and urge support and passage of National Fire Fighter Appreciation Day. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (RELATING TO SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, often the most absurd example is what forces us to look, and look more carefully, at flaws in our legislation. This one is a good example. Chris Frecking is a citizen of the United States who has been employed at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco for the last 16 years. Mr. Frecking was born in the Philippines to an American father in 1968 and was sworn in as a U.S. citizen in 1990. But there lies the rub. 
   He was sworn in as an American citizen. He came here from the Philippines after he turned 18 unaware that he should register with the Selective Service after there was in fact no draft or likelihood of anyone being called if they did. He failed to do so. He did try, though, when he discovered that this was a lifetime requirement in 1994. But, in fact, this was not allowed. 
   This is a gentleman who has been a good citizen, who in fact fell through the cracks. This legislation today after careful scrutiny in harmony with many organizations but most importantly at the leadership of the director of the Selective Service, in fact, makes it possible for us to continue to urge men to register for the Selective Service and treats them fairly if, through no fault of their own, they fail to do so. 
   I urge the swift passage of this bill. It is good legislation. It corrects a minor flaw. I join with my colleague from California in saying that sometimes the best legislation is small and bipartisan but makes a big difference in people's lives. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

The sustainability of the small town both before, during and after the Industrial Revolution, throughout a period of development in Texas, took it from a State that was rural in every sense to a State today that is both filled with high-tech and with world headquarters.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The automated external defibrillator is a critical part of saving lives here in America. In the first 10 minutes of an onset of symptoms, you have an incredibly short period of time, that 10 minutes, to make the difference between life and death. A typical response time, an optimum response time, for a 911 call is 5 minutes. The availability of these devices, once thought to be only in the crash kit on an emergency vehicle or in a hospital, is now spreading. At our airports, including our Nation's Capital airports, these devices are not just available but they are hung throughout the facility, making it possible, and, in fact, it has occurred, for people who have a heart symptom and pass out to be brought back to life in those 10 minutes, those precious 10 minutes. But in order to expand the use of this lifesaving apparatus, we need to have additional training. 
   I join with the gentleman from Illinois in saying that the importance of this Automatic External Defibrillator Week is not that we can learn to say it without tying our tongue but, in fact, that we can deploy these devices and get people trained. In my own small condominium unit here in Washington, our neighbors have been trained; and it will undoubtedly in time save lives in our community. 
   I join with the majority in urging that this bill not only become law this year but that we make this an annual event so as to spread the lifesaving capability of this device.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I join happily with the gentleman from Missouri and my own home State Senator, Senator Feinstein, in urging immediate passage of this renewal. 
   This extension is not only critical, but it comes at a time when those of us on this House floor are still remembering the recent loss of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis. Yes, in fact, today could be considered to be Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis' Breast Cancer Awareness Day because it's not just the statistic of 180,000 people, mostly women, getting breast cancer or 40,000 dying, it's a friend and a colleague who fought valiantly through not only this Congress but the previous Congress, and almost, but did not, win against this dreaded disease. 
   Breast Cancer Awareness stamps are not about the $54 million raised, although that goes a long way towards adding to the research pool. It's about the countless millions of people who receive a stamp that sends a message that reminds them to get that available mammogram, to, in fact, do a self-test, to be aware of lumps, to be aware of the possibility of this terrible and invasive disease taking the life of their wife, their daughter, their mother. So, I join again in urging passage of this. 
   And I might take a personal liberty that you don't often see on the House floor. My opponent in my last race and, God willing, my opponent in this race, Jeeni Criscenzo, is presently fighting cancer. I saw her yesterday in California dealing with the effects of chemo. Her detection was relatively early; she has a good chance. But it's things like this that the House does that sometimes gets criticized as not substantial legislation that hopefully will save women like my opponent and friend, Jeeni Criscenzo, from the kind of terrible tragedy that befell Jo Ann Davis and so many other women last year. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (HIRE A VETERAN WEEK -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, today as we prepare to pass House Concurrent Resolution 5, which will express support for the designation of Hire a Veteran Week, I would like to highlight two people, who have built a Web site that has assisted many of the military heroes and veterans from my Congressional District find employment upon their return home from Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   In February, 2005, Mark and Tori Baird created the Web site www.hiremarines.com to serve Marines at Camp Pendleton, CA, who were seeking to find either part-time or full employment after bravely serving our Nation. This site quickly caught on with local employers and media, and soon the Baird's received e-mails from military personnel across the country that wanted to use their site. After 6 months, www.hiremarines.com was expanded to included servicemen from all branches of the Armed Forces, both in Southern California and beyond, and the name of the site was changed to www.hirepatriots.com. 
   As a U.S. Army veteran, I have a sincere appreciation and respect for the military personnel who serve in our Armed Forces. Veterans posses special qualities and skills that make them ideal candidates for employment, and the Congress should do everything that it can to encourage more employers to hire them. 
   Many of the brave men and women who have served the United States so gallantly and selflessly in the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq since September 11, 2001, are beginning to return home to be reunited with their loved ones. They will soon be reentering the workforce or searching for their first jobs outside of military service. 
   H. Con. Res. 5 is an important effort to highlight this issue. I hope it will encourage other citizens to follow in the example of Mark and Tori in either hiring veterans, or providing assistance to those that are currently seeking jobs. 
   This is a small thing to do for these brave men and women who defend our safety and freedom.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of this resolution recognizing Arnold Palmer for his contributions to golf and to our society. How fitting it is that we honor him on the occasion of the opening of the Arnold Palmer Center for Golf History in New Jersey since it is he who made this possible and he who has made golf history so many times. 
   You could, in fact, honor Arnold for his off-the-tee activities, if you wanted to. You could honor him for being somebody who proved that even with an unorthodox swing you could get to the goal. 
   You certainly could recognize him, as we are, for his 92 championships, 61 on the PGA Tour, including two victories at the Masters, two at the British Open and one at the U.S. Open. From 1960 to 1963 he won 29 tournaments. He won 10 more times in the Senior PGA Tour. He has had a long and successful career, one that continues to stand in its records in the American Golf Hall of Fame. 
   He is also, though, a celebrated course designer. His skill, his ability to, in fact, create constantly innovative and enjoyable places for America to golf has left a lasting legacy, both here in the United States and around the world. He even found a way to invent a golf-friendly drink, the Arnold Palmer, which consists of iced tea and lemonade. 
   There is no question this is a man for all seasons and all charities. He has raised millions for charities that fight cancer and other diseases. He has given of his time and money and energies for countless other causes. 
   He also has endeavored to promote golf and serve as one of our finest ambassadors of the sport. 
   We often, here in the House, do resolutions, and we say, this is special. But I don't think there's any question that as America hears today that we have honored Arnold Palmer for golf, they'll say, what took us so long? Of course we should do it.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CONGRESSIONAL CLUB -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of this resolution. I certainly believe that 100 years of the attempts by spouses to have this body work together in a better, more collegial fashion is noteworthy. 
   Today, though, as we honor the work of our spouses, and particularly those who would say that if, in fact, you don't do what I'd like you to do, it could cause a great deal of domestic unhappiness--I believe was the line--in Washington, we should take note that this body is not operating in a collegial fashion. This body has, in fact, broken down. The concept of bipartisan behavior, including the long tradition of a motion to recommit, a long tradition of amendments and opportunities for ideas to be exchanged on and off the dais, has broken down. 
   So I do think it's important that we turn to recognizing an effort made 100 years ago at a time in which Members of Congress--House, Senate, Republican, Democrat--went to dinner together in each other's homes. Their children played together. They, in fact, lived here in Washington. 
   Living here in Washington has become sort of a term for misconduct. The idea that you would come and that you would work with 434 of your colleagues to make a better America, that you would walk across the Capitol and work with 100 Senators to make a better America seems to have fallen out of favor. 
   Today, unfortunately, we spend a lot of time meeting in our conferences on a partisan basis. In those conferences we ask, well, how can we beat them? How can we beat them now? How can we beat them in the election? We should be asking, how do we work together for a better government and a better America? 
   So I hope that the efforts of this club, which have been long, hard, and successful in many, many ways certainly in bringing our spouses together, certainly in activities for the community, will be a starting point today for us looking across the aisle and asking, why is it that we're afraid to have dinner together? Why is it that our meetings are Republicans with Republicans and Democrats with Democrats? We need to work together.  
   We have big problems in America today; some of them are obvious to Americans. We talk of the war and we talk of gas prices, we even talk of the Pelosi premium. Well, I believe it's a Pelosi premium, but it's a premium built on years of other people's mistakes and other people's watches. 
   Today, I use the opportunity given to me to talk about this important bipartisan resolution to say, let's solve gas and oil problems on a bipartisan basis. Let's deal with the challenges we face in Iraq and Afghanistan on a bipartisan basis. Let's deal with the immigration reform challenge on a bipartisan basis. Most of all, let's make sure that America's next 100 years is 100 years of success in competing worldwide. We can do this if we do it on a bipartisan basis. One hundred years ago, mostly women worked tirelessly to form an organization to help us do just that. Let's commit ourselves to doing just that today. 
   With that, I yield back the balance of my time and urge support.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill and I commend the gentleman from New York. I regret that I have to follow the gentleman from New York, because I too grew up listening to Sinatra wondering if the Rat Pack would be my future. Now I am in Congress; it could be that it came true. 
   But whether you admire Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, or Frank Sinatra, they all had one thing in common; they changed the world with their bigger than life behavior. They also changed the world with their generosity. Frank Sinatra was famous for his generosity. Even better than that, he was also famous for having problems with people, and then turning around and being overly generous to people that he had had difficulties with. He helped some years, many years ago give Buddy Rich, a famous jazz drummer, money to start a band even though only a few years earlier they had been arch enemies. He picked up the hospital bills of Bela Lugosi and many others. He funded hospital activities around the world. He lived his life big and he lived it every day. He stretched. He was in fact a great actor. He was in fact somebody who would act in parts that perhaps lesser men would have shied away from, wanting to preserve their image. 
   And certainly his music spanned not only generations and decades, but it spanned every genre. He was able to do that. He was able to reinvent himself from the forties, the fifties, the sixties, and even the seventies. In fact, even as his age increased and perhaps just a slight bit of that famous beautiful voice disappeared, he found ways to redo music, and his music lives on today. I am not surprised that a thoroughly modern man from New York would have 2,000 Frank Sinatra songs. My only question is, why don't you have more?

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1153. I think the gentlelady from Hawaii did a wonderful job of going through the highlights and contributions of Asian Americans, and I think, quite frankly, she did a very good job of recognizing some of the well-known and not-so-well-known examples of when we have failed the Asian Americans. 
   I support the United States Asian American Heritage Month. I also support many of the things that were commented on that we have, in fact, left undone. Very, very clearly, when it comes to the Philippine veterans, we stand in shame in this body. The Rescission Act was signed by Truman while Truman said, in fact, we didn't live up to a moral obligation, and made it very clear that this would be yet another example of America not being proud. That was a long time ago. 
   I am one of the cochairs of the Philippine Caucus and one of the authors of the underlying bill that is included in the Senate bill 1315, which is a package of noncontroversial U.S. benefit extensions for American veterans, but it's also an extension of a long-overdue benefit to people from the territory of the Philippines who fought with us in World War II. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would hope that this body would take note that these Asian Americans, and they were Asian Americans, had a governor, his name was MacArthur, at the beginning of the war. They fought to keep us from being driven off by an invading Army until, hopelessly, they had to withdraw; and yet these Rangers and Scouts continued fighting whenever possible in the jungles for years, even while MacArthur planned to return. MacArthur made this promise, America made this promise. We haven't kept that promise. As the gentlelady rightfully so said, there were over 200,000 Filipinos who fought with us for their country. 
   I take note that there are 4 million-plus Puerto Ricans today. I served in the United States Army from 1970 to 1980 and years beyond that in the Reserves. I was of the assumption that the Puerto Ricans who were in the service with me were Americans. I'm still of that assumption. Members of our territories are, in fact, Americans. 
   I might further note that Senator McCain, a U.S. Senator who could well end up being President, was born in the Panama Canal Zone. Is he less an American because he was born in a sovereign asset of the United States? Of course not. He's fully eligible to be President, and these veterans, these Philippine veterans, are American veterans, and they cannot and should not have to come before this body asking us to unstrip what we stripped away in shame 60 years ago. 
   So I join with the gentlelady in supporting this resolution, but I would like to emphasize as much as I can that we have an important vote this week, a vote about giving American veterans, veterans who are today Americans, veterans who, on that day, were Americans when they fought with us.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation that codifies the 1996 executive order of President Clinton that was issued to promote the proper use of excess Federal computers and electronic equipment to schools of our Nation. 
   I might want to clarify, because I know a lot of people hear us on the House floor and they only know what they've heard. If you hear ``excess'' and ``surplus,'' you might think that, in fact, what we're doing is simply overbuying and letting it sit in warehouses and then giving it away. Virtually all of this equipment in the executive branch, as in the legislative branch, are equipment that we have used for 2, 3, 4 years. It is, in fact, past its prime for us, but very usable by many other institutions. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to support this bill. I would like to also make sure people understand that we're not just simply overbuying. And the term ``excess'' or ``surplus'' doesn't by any means indicate that we're not using America's dollars wisely, but rather, we're using America's dollars again by making them available to people who can use a slightly used computer, who don't need the latest version of Windows and might not need the latest version of Pentium software. But, in fact, this can help schools around America in poor neighborhoods and  even not so poor neighborhoods have a better opportunity and use their hard-earned and hard-given dollars in other areas.     
   So I support this resolution. I hope that the American public understands that this is a great way of causing these products not to go into landfills 3, 4, 5 years earlier than they otherwise would by making them available to those who can use them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this important resolution, and yield myself such time that I may consume. 
   This year marks the 10th anniversary of National Military Appreciation Month, which was first passed on May 1999. I might note that in May 1999, perhaps the reason for the Congress seeing fit to have a National Appreciation Month for our military was that in fact we were in a time of comparative peace. We were at a time in which we wanted to let our military know that we appreciated them standing guard in peacetime as well as in war. 
   For the last 7 years, though, we have been at war. Our troops have been deployed in Afghanistan since shortly after the September 11 attack on our Nation. In fact, this last weekend, as part of the Military Appreciation Month, I was in Oceanside in my own district where 44,000 Marines reside at Camp Pendleton. Except they don't get to reside at Camp Pendleton; they are on their third and fourth deployments throughout that region. 
   I didn't just thank the senior NCOs and the officers, who I appreciate their continued service because they have stayed in and reenlisted during this time of war, but I also thanked the incredible amount of young men and women and their families who showed up and who in fact joined after this war began, and many of them after this war had been going for many, many years. 
   It is in fact our military that is with us in good times and bad. They stay with us in the worst of times. They also enlist in the hardest of times. 
   Many people would say I never voted for this war. I wouldn't vote for this war. This war is wrong. Men and women of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard don't say whether the war is right or wrong. They make a statement about whether America is right or wrong. In their eyes, and in my eyes, America is right. We have a process which we observe in order to ensure that we do not easily go into war, we do not easily send our troops into harm's way. 
   However, our men and women are in harm's way today. And for this month, like every day that we are at war, we should honor our men and women in uniform. We should make that extra effort to try to do what we can for those returning home and for those who remain behind, the families, the children, the husbands, the wives, making sure that every day they are taken care of, that their special needs, because of the absence of the loved one, are observed. And when they come home, they don't come home from the first deployment, the parade is not as easy to recognize; they don't come home from the last deployment. It is not so easy to say, we are coming home for good. 
   So I urge my colleagues and I urge all of America to think about the appreciation we can show year round to in fact realize that a parade is just as important to a troop who has come home from their third deployment. Recognition, a picnic, or some other way of saying we care about your continued service, is just as important in the sixth and seventh year of a struggle that could in fact go on for many years in order to bring freedom and a way of life that is acceptable to the people of Afghanistan and Iraq and other countries throughout the world. 
   Today we can recognize where our men and women are fighting, but we don't often recognize where they are standing so that we don't have to fight. And I would like to close by recognizing the men and women who are in the Sudan, who are in fact trying to do what they can in Africa for some very troubled spots in which we don't recognize it as our fighting but we certainly have to recognize that we are trying to make a difference for those people who in their struggles every day realize that they are at war. 
   I join with the gentlelady from California in urging the support for this resolution. I join with the gentleman from Connecticut in recognizing that every day, every month, should be National Military Recognition Month.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (FEDERAL REAL PROPERTY DISPOSAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5787, the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act, which was introduced last month by Representatives Dennis Moore of Kansas and John Duncan of Tennessee. 
   This legislation would expand the number of agencies allowed to retain the proceeds from the sale of surplus Federal real property and would expand the authority of the General Services. It is very clear that this is a good bill, and I support it. It is also very clear that it is a step in the right direction but does not get us to where we really need to be. In fact, this is simply the tip of the iceberg. 
   The Federal Government is the largest landowner in the country. As such, it is essential that the government manage its properties as efficiently and effectively as possible. More importantly, property which is no longer of use to the Federal Government should be removed from the inventory. Unfortunately, over the years Federal property disposal processes have become increasingly cumbersome and unwieldy, and agencies often decide it's easier to sit on property than to try to get rid of it. In fact, when we as a Congress have done rounds of BRAC, we have often had to do supplemental appropriations of dollars in order to give away property that has become surplus. In fact, OMB estimates a backlog of more than 21,000 properties in need of maintenance and repair carrying a price tag of more than $18 billion. 
   Under Republican control, the Congress spent a considerable amount of time working, mostly on a bipartisan basis, to reform the Federal real property disposal system. The proposals we put forward for substantial changes provided real reform. Although H.R. 5787 does not contain the kind of substantive reform put forward in prior Congresses, it is nevertheless an improvement on the current system. 
   I therefore ask my colleagues to strongly support this legislation as a step in the right direction. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, in closing, today we have handled a great many important resolutions on the floor and some laws. We've done this on a bipartisan basis. 
   As we finish our suspensions for the House Oversight and Reform Committee, I would simply ask my colleagues, the Speaker, to take note that this past week, prices rose once again on gasoline in America. Up 17 cents in a blink of the eye, up a dollar since this Congress switched hands. 
   It is very clear that we need to begin operating on a bipartisan basis to bring down the price of gas and diesel fuel. We can only do that if we work on as much of a bipartisan basis as we work on these resolutions. 
   So I would ask all of my colleagues to note that the real problem America cares about today is not the 100 years of the Congressional Club. It is not, in fact, Arnold Palmer's accomplishments. It is not even Frank Sinatra's doing it his way. It is, in fact, America's inability to cope with rising gas prices, staggering unemployment, and the inability to live in one's own home. I ask that my colleagues take note of that and that we work on a bipartisan basis to bring a real resolution to these problems. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. I had the opportunity to vote it out of our committee week before last. We did so with full expectation that it would be on the floor last week, as has been traditional when law enforcement leaders come from around the country for our peace officers gathering. 
   It's with great trepidation that I support this, but also note that the partisan nature of our body, which has always caused this bill, in the past, to be up for that week so that the men and women could sit in the gallery and observe our recognition of the important work they do, did not happen. I would hope this is the last time that resolutions like this are held because, quote, we wouldn't get to them with all the recorded votes. The men and women, the 56,000-plus who are assaulted every year, the 181 who died last year, up from 151 the year before, they deserve our recognition in a timely fashion. They deserve our constant support. They deserve not to be part of partisan infighting. 
   I believe that, in fact, most of us in the Congress, including the gentlelady from California, shares with me the nonpartisan support for our law enforcement people. 
   I might additionally recognize at this time, that law enforcement is not only around the country, but it's also right here in the Capitol. We in the Congress could not do our business in an orderly fashion if it wasn't for the Capitol Hill Police who stand vigilantly with large weapons against an attack and, on a daily basis, ensure that the tens of thousands of people who come to see the Capitol are able to do so without interfering with the operations of this body. 
   So in the jobs large and small I would like to join with the gentlelady in asking for this bill to be passed, but I'd also like to recognize the men and women of the Capitol Hill Police.  
   H. Res. 1132 supports the goals and ideals of Peace Officers Memorial Day to honor federal, state, and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty, and encourages the citizens of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and respect. 
   Law enforcement officers face dangers on the job every single day while fighting crime, violence and terrorism. On May 17, 1792, New York City's Deputy Sheriff, Isaac Smith, became the first police officer to be recorded as killed in the line of duty. Today, more than 56,000 officers are assaulted each year and just this past year, in 2007, 181 officers were killed while serving the American people. 
   Last year was one of the deadliest years for U.S. law enforcement in nearly two decades. The number of officers killed in the line of duty last year increased nearly 20 percent from 2006, when there were 151 officer deaths. 
   There is a quote by President George H.W. Bush engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, located at Judiciary Square here in D.C. that summarizes the mission of the 900,000 current sworn law enforcement officers in the United States. It states that it is their daily ``quest to preserve both democracy and decency, and to protect a national treasure that we call the American dream.'' 
   May 15 was Peace Officers Memorial Day, a holiday created in 1961, by Congress to pay homage to the fallen law enforcement officers who have dedicated their lives to protecting this country and its citizens. On this day the flag is flown at half-staff and thousands of people visit the National Law Enforcement Memorial, which currently has 18,274 names engraved on its surface. 
   Each of these names is evidence of the sacrifices these brave law enforcement officers have made to keep American citizens safe. 
   With gratitude for our law enforcement officers' devotion and dedication, I ask all members to join me in supporting H. Res. 1132. 
   Ms JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1132, Supporting the goals and ideals of Peace Officers Memorial Day, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Texas, Representative Ted Poe. 
   Peace officers, the sworn, public-sector officers entrusted with law enforcement authority and the power of arrest, risk their lives daily to protect our Nation. These individuals, who are responsible for safeguarding the rights and freedoms we enjoy as Americans, are true heroes. 
   Peace Officers Memorial Day honors those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and security of their communities and our Nation. Created by Public Law 87-726, signed by President Kennedy in 1962, this day gives us the opportunity to acknowledge and pay our respects to those who, through their courageous deeds, have fallen in the line of duty. 
    Mr. Speaker, on thursday, May 15, 2008, our Nation will come together to honor, remember and record those law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty during the year of 2007. Mr. Speaker, one of the names of the fallen heroes added to the list last year was Officer Rodney J. Johnson of the Houston Police Department. Officer Johnson, a 12-year veteran of the Houston Police Department, was killed September 21, 2006, while taking a suspect in custody during a traffic stop. He leaves to honor his memory his beloved wife, Houston Police Department Officer Joslyn Johnson, and five teen-aged children; three daughters and two sons, ages 14 to 19. 
   Officer Rodney Johnson was born in Houston and served in the U.S. Army as a military police officer until being honorably discharged in 1990. He then went to work as a corrections officer for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and then as a jail attendant. He graduated from the Houston police academy in 1994. 
   As a member of the department's Southeast Gang Task Force, Officer Rodney Johnson earned two Lifesaving Awards and one Medal of Valor from the State of Texas. In January 1998, Officer Rodney Johnson rescued a physically challenged driver trapped in rising floodwaters, and later that year he rescued mentally challenged people trapped inside of a burning house. 
   Officer Rodney Johnson, who stood 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighed nearly 300 pounds, served on his union's board of directors. As Hans Marticiuc, the president of Officer Johnson's union stated, ``he was big and he was intimidating-looking, but he was as gentle as a baby bear.'' 
   Although the number of officers killed in the line of duty has declined in recent years, the  fact that one officer is killed every 2 1/2 days in our country is a sober reminder that protecting our communities and safeguarding our democracy come at a heavy price. 
   Last year, the total number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty was represented by 17,917 names engraved on the Memorial, representing officers from all 50 States, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Federal law enforcement and military police agencies. 
   This resolution supports the goals and ideals of National Peace Officer Memorial Day, which honors Federal, State, and local peace officers killed or disabled in the line of duty. This service will honor the 181 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty during 2007, as well as the 900,000 officers who continue to serve in Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies nationwide. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution:

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF AMERICAN EAGLE DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, only on this floor would we debate how the American eagle would feel. I'm astonished that the Democrats have the hubris to talk in terms of how the American eagle would feel. As a matter of fact, the American eagle and countless thousands of birds and other wildlife have been used as an excuse for a generation for 68 million acres--yes, they are leased, but a lease is in fact not a right to drill. Just because you have a lease doesn't waive any environmental consideration. So beyond the requirement to find out if in fact there is oil on a lease site, you have to go through a myriad of hoops before you can begin drilling. 
   It's one of the reasons that, in fact, offshore drilling has become so popular. Not only are there vast resources out there, but in fact, the fish simply swim away; and in deep water, particularly over 400 meters, it is unlikely to find an environmentalist at the bottom claiming that there is some new form of life that is not only new but highly in danger. 
   So with all fairness to the Nation's bird, I would say that what we need to do is stop talking about 68 million acres that are ``available for production'' when in fact, the vast majority of that has little or no usable oil. 
   And I just want to give you a fairly short statement, Mr. Speaker. It is not a question of whether or not you have acreage, it's a question of whether the acreage is valid acreage for oil. I will give you the easiest example. West Virginia. It's a wonderful State. Beautiful State. They take a tremendous amount of coal out of there. They also take a quite a bit of oil. As a matter of fact, with 3,400 oil wells, they take a total of 5,000 barrels a day out of there. To the contrary, or to the other example, Alaska, with only 1,700, half as many wells, take 700,000 barrels a day. 
   So it's not, Mr. Speaker, whether or not you have millions of acres, it's do you have the acreage that you are able to drill in, do you have the acreage that is, in fact, yielding oil. And I can assure you at $134 a barrel, if anyone was holding acreage that yielded barrels that in fact could deliver that kind of revenue, it would be drilled today. 
   The truth is the vast majority of the acreage is either off limits for environmental reasons or, in fact, would be like West Virginia: 3,400 wells, 5,000 barrels a day.

   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I, too, rise in support of this resolution. 
   Certainly history is replete with examples like this where well-intended, strong statements are made and then as much as 2 years passes before the event becomes complete. Juneteenth is no exception to that. 
   More than 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, it took 2,000 Federal soldiers marching into Galveston Island in order to free slaves from servitude. So as we look at what we need to do here in Congress today, let us not be dissuaded from doing what is right because it may take time. Let us not be dissuaded from making sure that America has its freedom and independence assured by our own independence in all areas, including natural resources. 
   I certainly think more than 100 years after the Civil War, we can celebrate the successes of the Civil War; but we also have an obligation to deal with problems that might take 4 or 5 years of domestic exploration and domestic investment in oil and natural gas in order to bear fruit. But I would ask today that we resolve to begin that process because certainly, as we look at President Abraham Lincoln who knew that the Emancipation Proclamation would not immediately free slaves but, in fact, would make a strong statement that we were resolved to do so. 
   I would hope today as we pass this important piece of legislation, we would resolve to make sure that America is independent and free in the years to come. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (GRANTING A FEDERAL CHARTER TO KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I would like to express my support for S. 1692, legislation that grants a Federal charter to the Korean War Veterans Association.  
   Many Americans are only familiar with the Korean War through the television series M*A*S*H. Yet, it was one of the defining conflicts of the 20th Century. Because of the courageous service of millions of American servicemen and women, the global spread of Communism was halted on the Korean peninsula. More than 36,000 Americans lost their lives to preserve the liberty of the South Korean people. The fall of the Iron Curtain. would have been inconceivable without their sacrifice. 
   The Korean War Veterans Association was established in 1985 as the only veteran's organization comprised solely of Korean War Veterans. It now has over 25,000 members. The Association was founded in order to maintain a continuing interest in the welfare of veterans of the Korean War, to rehabilitate disabled veterans of the War, to establish facilities for the assistance of War veterans and to represent them in claims before the Department of Veterans Affairs without charge, and finally to perpetuate and preserve the comradeship and friendships born on the field of battle and to honor the memory of the men and women who gave their lives in the Korean War. 
   Now, on June 6 of last year, the Immigration Subcommittee adopted the following policy concerning the granting of new federal charters: The Subcommittee will not consider any legislation to grant new federal charters because such charters are unnecessary for the operations of any charitable, non-profit organization and falsely imply to the public that a chartered organization and its activities carry a congressional ``seal of approval,'' or that the Federal Government is in some way responsible for its operations. The Subcommittee believes that the significant resources required to properly investigate prospective chartered organizations and monitor them after their charters are granted could and should be spent instead on the Subcommittee's large range of legislative and other substantive policy matters. This policy is not based on any decision that the organizations seeking federal charters are not worthwhile, but rather on the fact that  federal charters serve no valid purpose and therefore ought to be discontinued. 
   This policy represented the continuation of a policy the Subcommittee put in place at the start of the 101st Congress and has been continued every Congress since, against granting new federal charters to private, non-profit organizations. However, if the majority seeks to jettison the policy adopted by its own Judiciary Committee just last year, so be it. If we are to grant any organizations federal charters, then the Korean War Veterans Association should be at the top of the list. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  
   Madam Speaker, it is my great honor to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Plano, Texas, a man of personal experience on what it's all about to be a Korean War veteran, a man who I believe brings to the House the kind of insight necessary to bring this bill to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I join with the gentlelady from Orange County in support of this resolution. But this resolution brings to mind one of the challenges we have in California. You see, in California, we don't allow coal to be used to make electricity. In California, we don't allow nuclear; we banned it for more than 30 years, no new nuclear. As a matter of fact, in California, with the exception of some geothermal that we can't seem to find a way to bring power lines from where it is to where we want it, all of our new power comes from natural gas. 
   And in California, we are not looking for natural gas. As a matter of fact, we don't allow any leasing, Federally or State, off of our coastline. Literally a thousand miles of coastline out 200 miles is off limits to natural gas. We can't take clean natural gas from our own shores in California. As a result, water projects are in danger. 
   The gentlelady from California rightfully so did speak about groundwater replenishment, which she has in her district and I have in my district. We also have desalinization in both of our districts. And guess what? Desalinization is another term for electricity-to-water. 
   In order to meet our water needs, whether it's pumping from the north to the south, pumping for replenishment or, in fact, desalinization, we need energy. That energy is electricity. That electricity comes from natural gas. That natural gas comes from unstable parts of the world in which it must be hauled in by liquefication because we don't meet our own natural gas needs. 
   Republicans here in the House support opening up the opportunity to get natural gas, at least allow some exploration for natural gas 50 miles off the California coast. That's not difficult. And the leaks, in fact, would be methane 50 miles offshore. You wouldn't see it, you wouldn't hear it, and it's nonpolluting. And yet, as of today, the Democrats continue to block that. 
   We need to open up. We've been talking about oil, but we need to talk about natural gas. California needs clean natural gas. It's off our shoreline, it's close to us today. And I would absolutely urge my colleagues, when they're looking at water in California, look at water as electricity and electricity as natural gas, and natural gas is something we have off our shore that is presently unavailable; millions, countless millions of acres unavailable. 
   And last, Mr. Speaker, I would hope that when people are talking about the acreage that isn't being used today, the 68 million acres that's not currently in use, and, you know, we can look at whether some of it just recently was granted and it's in exploration, whether it's in environmental, we can break it down. But the amazing thing is, out of only 41 million acres that is out on lease of any exploration or production, we're getting a huge amount of oil off Federal lands. Just think if we, in fact, used those 68 million acres over the next few years and opened up some major portion of 2.351 billion acres, that's 2,351 million acres that are not available today. 
   So when people talk about the 68 million that are, they should also talk about the 41 million that are under use today that are generating oil and natural gas, the many millions that are coming in from leases that are out that are just now beginning to bear fruit, and of course the 2,351 million acres that are presently closed, a lot of which is off the California and the gulf coast 50 miles out that no one would see, that, in fact, could be drilled in deep water safely, but of course is not available today.

   As you probably know, there are 3,400-plus oil wells throughout West Virginia. We have overdrilled West Virginia and Oklahoma. We haven't put a new drill even for exploration off the California coast in decades, not even to find out how much natural gas is out there. And that, in fact, from 50 to 200 miles, is an economic zone created by Ronald Reagan that belongs to the United States that could be explored.

   Mr. ISSA. Well, Madam Chair, of course it excludes it. But when we look at only 3 percent and 6 percent that are under oil leases, we have to look at all the available BLM land. Just, for example, though, there are 700 million acres that are presently held by the BLM. By definition, the Bureau of Land Management holds that for productive use. So that would be an example where there are no parks on BLM land, there are no national monuments or military bases on those 700 million acres alone.

   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I too rise in support of the resolution. National Public Radio is important. KPBS in my hometown represents a voice that provides a plethora of information that would not otherwise be available. 
   Some of the information that I hope they would provide would be to get to the true causes of our high oil prices. In San Diego, Public Broadcasting is playing a role in saying that $5 gas is unacceptable. Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, public radio is not yet making us aware of just why it is so high. 
   The fact that over 2 billion acres are not available for exploration of oil and gas in California is part of the reason that last weekend I paid $5-plus for a gallon of gas in my home district. That, Madam Speaker, is in fact something that we need to take care of. We need to have public radio and all of our communications systems running on full bore. 
   I do note, Madam Speaker, that this is an April resolution. This is a resolution that we are so far behind in the important business of the House, we are only getting to now celebrating April of 2008 for Public Broadcasting. I find it interesting that we were so busy, and yet we didn't have time to find out what were the real causes of high oil and gas prices, why America is importing half a trillion dollars a year of other people's oil and a similar growing amount of natural gas and other resources. 
   So I would hope that when we get this April legislation off our plate, we would turn to the important issues of the day, certainly the incredibly high price of gas in my home district, caused by a lack of domestic exploration. 
   And if we have just a little time, perhaps we could find out why in the midst of the sub-S meltdown, we discover that Members of this body and Members of the body on the other side of the dome were in fact getting special deals that saved themselves tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars on their home mortgages. These investigations need to happen, because we need to solve the problem of how America finds itself with financial meltdown. We need to find out what it is going to take to get American oil and high-paying American jobs flowing again. 
   Madam Speaker, I would yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 188, which adds several names to the short title of the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. 
   The individuals whose names are added by this legislation deserve to be embodied in that historic legislation for the roles they played in encouraging the participation of all Americans in the political process. 
   Cesar Chavez and Dr. Hector Garcia followed the path of Martin Luther King, Jr. Mr. Chavez founded and led the first successful farm workers' union in the United States and became the president of the United Farm Workers of America, AFL-CIO. From its beginnings, the UFW adhered to the principles of non-violent change. Mr. Chavez received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, in 1994. 
   Dr. Hector Garcia was a Mexican Revolution refugee and medical doctor. He, too, led peaceful protests to empower Mexican Americans to fight legal and political battles against discrimination through his founding of the American GI Forum. He was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. 
   Barbara Jordan was the first African-American woman to serve in the U.S. Congress from the South. She became the first African-American woman to serve in the Texas Senate since 1883, where she served as the chair of a major committee. As a Congresswoman, she sponsored legislation to broaden the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to cover Mexican-Americans and to extend its provisions to States where minorities had been denied the right to vote or had their rights restricted by unfair registration practices. 
   Finally, William Velasquez founded the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project in 1974 to encourage Latinos to join the democratic process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I too rise in strong support of Flag Day. Since 1777, America has in fact invested a great deal of who we are, what we do, what is right and what we stand for in our Nation's flag. Whether it was the first Flag Day, which emerged in 1885 when a 19-year-old schoolteacher in Wisconsin declared the flag's birthday, or in 1889, when a kindergarten teacher in New York City held a patriotic ceremony to help educate his children, or throughout the years, year after year after year, in which America invested its patriotism in the flag, or, as the gentleman in the majority said, in fact on September 11, when here in Washington and around the world we invested in a patriotic showing after the terrible events in New York, here in Washington and Pennsylvania, we did so because in fact we are what America stands for. Our flag represents that. 
   But, today, Madam Speaker, America stands for a country that imports half a trillion dollars worth of oil and vast amounts of natural gas. America is a country with crushing debt owed to other countries around the world. America today is a country proud of itself and proud of its flag, but mortgaging our children's future by investing in foreign oil and foreign natural gas and foreign minerals at a time in which the vast majority of our resources are not being used. 
   Madam Speaker, I join with the majority in saying that in fact America has to make sure that our natural resources are used, whether it is the 68 million acres being called into question by the majority as to whether or not oil leases are being pursued, or the 41 million acres that do have oil under production, or in fact the 2 billion-plus acres, including the area over 50 miles off the California coast that has been permanently taken off limits to oil and clean natural gas so needed in our country. 
   So, as we celebrate this Flag Day and our reinvestment in our flag and in who we are as a nation, let's remember who we are is a country of self-sufficiency, and self-sufficiency starts with the ability to produce our own products and certainly to heat our own homes. 
   Madam Speaker, I have no more to say about our flag than what our flag says for itself, but I have a great deal to say about who we as Americans will be. We will be a country, God willing, that in fact is self-sufficient. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I join with my friend and colleague from Ohio in urging support for H.R. 6150 to name the post office in Cleveland, Ohio, in honor of John P. Gallagher. Like the gentleman, I am also a Clevelander born and raised. Like many of us in the room, I know what Mr. Gallagher came home to after World War II. He came home to a Cleveland that had helped win the war. He came home to a Cleveland in which women had come out of their homes to work in all of the major plants. They worked in auto plants that were now making tanks. They worked in the steel mills. In fact, Cleveland won the war both by the men it sent off to war, and by the men and women who stayed home and worked those heavy industries. 
   So I very much believe it is appropriate and vital that we recognize the Cleveland workforce that made America great and won World War II. And, in fact, the common man, who did the uncommon thing, that was all too common in World War II, and that is going off and fighting for your country while others stayed home and made sure that the tanks, the steel, the tires all came to the battle. 
   And as a Clevelander, I recognized that Cleveland ran on resources. Cleveland ran on coal and iron ore. And yes, Cleveland ran and used to run very well on oil and natural gas, in addition to coal, that made our steel mills work and that made our auto companies produce. 
   Cleveland no longer runs that way. Cleveland is, in fact, a city that is now  needing to turnaround yet again. Why, among other reasons, because of $5 gasoline, the cost of home heating oil, the cost of living that is spiraling up much faster than the men and women of Cleveland have the ability to pay. 
   So as we honor Mr. Gallagher, I would hope that we also turn our focus to the need to deal with these natural resources that we now import, the copper we import, the coal that if we don't change we will soon be importing, certainly the steel mills that have gone to Korea; and yes, the half a trillion dollars a year of oil that we are importing from countries often hostile to us simply because we are not willing to open up exploration on our 2 billion-plus acres of Federal land. 
   So I join with my colleague in strong support of remembering what made America and Cleveland great, and I ask that we join together and do that again by passing comprehensive land opportunities for oil so that we too can be self-sufficient, as we were when Mr. Gallagher came home from World War II. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ISSA. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, no one is a better example of energy, of doing more with less than is Chi-Chi Rodriguez. Not only did he begin golfing at age 6 and shoot a 67 at age 12, but in fact, for a man who never rose above 5'7'' in height or 130 pounds in weight, he has one of the most famous long balls in golf. That is the energy of Chi-Chi Rodriguez, an energy that America covets. He is somebody who doesn't let size or any other limitation keep him from achieving his goals. 
   Earlier, the gentleman from Florida talked about Florida and Chi-Chi Rodriguez' activities there in Clearwater. Florida brings to mind that, when you talk about a man of energy, just 50 miles off the coast of Florida, China and Cuba are now issuing contracts that are going to allow for drilling, for drilling closer to America than we allow, just 50 miles off the coast of Florida, in fact, without the kind of safeguards that American companies would use.     
   So when I think of Florida and I think of a man of energy, I think of the energy that is being kept away from the American people, energy that would keep our dollars from flowing to countries less friendly to us, energy that would make us self-sufficient and self-reliant, and energy that would heat our homes and fuel our cars at a cost far less than what we are paying today. 
   Madam Speaker, I truly think of energy when I think of Chi-Chi Rodriguez, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on Chi-Chi Rodriguez and urge passage of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 6058 to designate the U.S. post office at 42222 Rancho Las Palmas Drive in Rancho Mirage, California, as the Gerald R. Ford Post Office Building. 
   Throughout his life, Gerald Ford was a patriot and a civil servant. Throughout his life he had a ``can do'' attitude, whether it was attending the University of Michigan where he played ball and was quite an athlete, or upon graduation from the University of Michigan, when he had the opportunity to play for the NFL, he declined the offer and instead attended the Yale Law School where he gained a skill that he used the rest of his life. 
   He then served 4 years in World War II, and, like many people, came home from World War II with a ``can do'' attitude, served his district of Michigan for 25 years, and as we all know, gave up the job of minority leader to become the Vice President and almost immediately became the President. 
   Gerald Ford, as the 38th President of the United States, enjoyed the dubious honor of being the only President not to have run for President or Vice President. But he didn't let that stop him. He was not an unelected president but, rather, he was a President who had a mandate to heal the Nation. He was a President who had a mandate to deal with a post-Vietnam, post-Richard Nixon period. He did so not only by pardoning Richard Nixon, something that undoubtedly cost him his own election, but, in fact, he did so recognizing that America's healing was more important than politics. 
   Today, as we recognize Gerald Ford, I would like to just briefly explain that I didn't know him as President. I didn't get to vote for him, of course, as President. I didn't meet him until 1996, when we were doing the Republican convention in San Diego, and his son, Jack, was the executive director for that. And a then aged Gerald Ford came out simply to support his son and to support what we were trying to do in San Diego. He came out repeatedly to help us, help us in the fund raising, but more importantly, help his son who he still, at that age, was trying to make sure that he went even further than his father. 
   Gerald Ford was the kind a person who stayed focused on basics throughout his life. One of the basics here in America is our need for energy, our need for the natural resources to be domestic, not imported. Gerald Ford understood that. 
   During Gerald Ford's time our debt was internally held. We had just come off of a balanced budget in 1969 and were near a balanced budget for his years. And more importantly, the vast majority of our oil was, in fact, domestic. 
   As a matter of fact, although we did have Aramco operating in Saudi Arabia, it was an income stream to the United States and the oil, for the most part, did not come to America. 
   Additionally, the Prudhoe Bay was coming on line at that time, and America's likelihood of getting its oil from its own country made more sense. 
   Many people do not understand, as Gerald Ford certainly would have understood, that Alaska was larger than Saudi Arabia, and that oil reserves every bit as plentiful in some areas as Saudi Arabia should be gleaned from our 50th State. 
   So as we honor and remember Gerald Ford and name this post office after him, let's also remember the time, not too long ago, when Gerald Ford was President, and America was self-sufficient. America had not yet fallen into the melees that it found itself in just a few years later when OPEC turned off the oil and America went cold.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Tim Russert was a great man whose time came too early. He had much more to give to us, not just this past Sunday where he would have had Joe  Biden in a one-on-one or a one-on-two and then brought him to task and brought his other guests to task. 
   But in fact, his legacy will disappear unless we bring ourselves to realize that the truth should not be a casualty of politics. That's what Tim Russert really brought to bear on ``Meet the Press.'' He made the style about the truth. He invited Republicans, Democrats. I think he had Ralph Nader on more than a few times. He made it a point to bring in people who were interesting, and then he asked them interesting questions. And when they answered, he then brought out the interesting fact that they perhaps had not yet prepared for. He asked them to tell the truth, and then if that was not the truth or if there was more to be heard in the truth, he brought that out. His research was second-to-none. 
   Now, he certainly seemed to say every single week, ``Go Bills.'' But as a Clevelander, I am going to take a little liberty today in his name because when it came time to go to a fine college, he went to John Carroll, a Jesuit college in the city in which my high school, Cleveland Heights University High School, was located. He went there because it was a fine education. I'm only surprised that he learned during those years that it was a little less expensive to go to John Marshall for his law school. So he trotted downtown to Cleveland's John Marshall, now Cleveland State's John Marshall Law School. So he was as much a Clevelander in his education, in his preparation, as he was from Buffalo. 
   I think that, in fact, his Cleveland roots are something we need to understand because one of the most famous things he ever did was predict in 2004 that it would be ``Ohio, Ohio, Ohio,'' that would indicate the outcome of the 2004 election. I know, Madam Speaker, that you're well aware that Ohio was, in fact, critical, not Florida. 
   Tim Russert was the kind of person who really enjoyed that kind of let's call the facts to bear, let's bring them in, let's force people to answer tough questions. He did so whether you were a Republican or a Democrat. He did so whether or not the outcome was one direction or the other. 
   I believe that's part of his Cleveland upbringing. I believe it's what made him great. So he will always be remembered for talking about the Buffalo Bills, but for me, he will always be remembered as somebody who was the product of Jesuit education at John Carroll and Cleveland-John Marshall. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   No story of Tim Russert would be complete if we didn't talk about the loss we're going to have this political season. Clearly, as Barack Obama and John McCain compete for the hearts and minds of the American people, we're going to miss Tim Russert asking the tough questions. We're going to miss him undoubtedly at the debates. Somebody else is going to have to be there to be fair but tough. 
   Madam Speaker, additionally, we're going to miss Tim Russert when it comes to the people on both sides of the issue of why we have $5 gasoline and $135 oil. I think Tim Russert would have been just the right guy to hold people accountable, who would talk about the 68 million acres that are ``inactive'' while, in fact, 41 million are under current lease and use and are producing millions of barrels of oil and natural gas a day, but more importantly, over 2 billion, 2 billion acres are not available for exploration and development, including the over 50 miles and less than 200 miles off the California coast. Those miles certainly could give us the natural gas we need to fire our electricity in California at a time when we are dangerously close to the lights going out once again. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I'm going to miss Tim Russert because this debate is too important not to have, a fact-oriented, unbiased moderator who can, in fact, bring to bear the truth that we need to have. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. 
   I am resolute in my opposition, not because it was easy to vote against your President, but our President and his administration are wrong. And if we vote here today for this bill, it is truly the end of the Reagan era. 
   It's the end of the Reagan era because, in fact, under Ronald Reagan's time, we dealt with similar problems, a huge financial problem, and we worked our way out of it without unnecessarily buying assets. We closed institutions but we also saved institutions. 
   Madam Speaker, my Governor often says, ``I'll be back.'' Madam Speaker, I have no doubt I'll be back, and I have no doubt that we will be trying to fix the problems next year that we don't fix here today. The mark-to-market problem, which Secretary Paulson has refused to deal with, in fact, in his own bill is very clearly being denounced. He is raising the price of the assets we buy above mark-to-market while refusing to have the other assets allowed to be flowed to their true value. By definition today we are picking winners and losers in assets rather than going to creditworthy companies and helping them get the capital they need so they can make loans to men and women and companies and entrepreneurs out there who desperately need it to grow our economy. 
   Madam Speaker, we are deleveraging the very capital and the very enterprises we need to date. GE Capital has said they are openly deleveraging. Why? Because that's the signal we're sending. We are collapsing this country into, in fact, a recession at a time in which the Ronald Reagan policy would be to expand opportunity, to find ways to give people who have great ideas an opportunity to reinvent America. 
   So today we are ending the Reagan era if we vote for this, and if we can't come back and fix it next year, we will have permanently put a coffin on top of the coffin of Ronald Reagan.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of another down payment on thanking President Gerald Ford for his legacy, a legacy that really began, flourished and was all about this body. We are recognizing Gerald Ford as the 38th President of the United States because he did spend 2 1/2 years as our President. But, uniquely, the man born in 1913 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was, in fact, a man of the House. 
   During his entire tenure in the House, he did not enjoy time in the majority. Yet his goal was to be Speaker of the House. He had no higher calling, never sought one, but accepted the one that was cast upon him. 
   At the time that he was selected to be Vice President of the United States, we were already mired in the Vietnam War and disgrace had been brought upon the Vice Presidency. It was Gerald Ford who came in impeccably honest, undeniably a man of the people and a man who was only for the people. 
   That is how he was selected, that is why he was selected, it is why the Senate and the House thought he was the only man for the job. Who would have known that just a short time, 10 months later in fact, he would find himself cast into an even larger role, another role that he did not ask for. 
   Yet that was who Gerald Ford was, a man who came out of athletics and out of university to serve in the United States Navy in 1942 because it was the right thing to do. He had represented a district that would have returned him to the House to this very day if, in fact, he were still alive. 
   Instead, he answered a call, a call that each of us in the House has answered by coming to this body. That was the call of service to the United States.  
   As I support this naming of this post office in the place he loved, in the place he skied, in the place that he called home for his immediate period after leaving the White House, I do so as the second man of the House that we are recognizing here today, first Congressman Lane Evans and then Congressman/President Gerald Ford.

   Today, Mr. Speaker, the rules of the House prohibit Members from taking nongovernmental aircraft by any organization, any corporation that has a lobbyist. Mr. Speaker, I might point out that there are lobbyists for United Airlines, Delta, U.S. Air and a litany of other airlines. These rules are unfair, unreasonable and unenforceable, but they have not yet been changed; and under a closed rule, it was a take-it-or-leave-it on the entire package. 
   Mr. Speaker, I submitted for the House H.

   Certainly it is clear that the Congress often names post offices and other bodies after their own Members. But I think today on all three of these bills we picked appropriate candidates, candidates who, in fact, exemplify what this body on both sides of the Dome are about, a body of dedication and service by people who come here to work in a bipartisan way, who come here to make America better, who bring the values of their home State here but who recognize the value of the entire country is what we seek when we come here to meet together to debate and to vote.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 521 to rename the post office in Rock Island, Illinois, for Congressman Lane Evans. 
   The Congressman was born in 1951 in Rock Island, Illinois. Mr. Evans grew up the son of a firefighter and joined the Marines out of high school and fought in the Vietnam War. After that, he earned an undergraduate degree from Augustana College and a law degree from Georgetown. 
   Just 4 years later, he found himself in the House of Representatives, a Democrat representing a largely Republican 17th District of Illinois, where he quickly developed a reputation as an advocate for regular Americans. 
   Known in his district, which covers Moline, Rock Island, Quincy, Decatur, Galesburg, and parts of Springfield and the Quad Cities, for excellent constituent services, he also fought hard for working families and especially for veterans. He became chairman of the Vietnam-Era Veterans Caucus here in the Congress, where he pushed for legislation particularly to improve health care for vets and those with disabilities such as post-traumatic stress syndrome. That disorder today still affects many Americans of that era. He also supported legislation to eliminate land mines and assist land mine victims, and later he helped those affected with Gulf War syndrome. 
   After Hurricane Katrina, long into a debilitating disease, he fought hard to make things right for those people affected so desperately by the hurricanes. 
   Even after being diagnosed in 1995 with Parkinson's, he continued to serve for another six terms in the House and served with great distinction, never giving up the fight. 
   In his final term, the Congressman and I had the pleasure of flying for over 14 hours across the United States and all the way to Iwo Jima to commemorate the 60th commemoration of that great battle. He did so at a time in which he needed a physician's assistant, in which he was uncomfortable at all times, and in which most men afflicted with Parkinson's would never have considered such a trip. He did so because, first of all, he was a Marine. He did so, secondly, because he cared so much about this country and about the battles that men and women had fought for this country. 
   I will remember Congressman Lane Evans for that trip. For someone who went above and beyond what the public saw to do what was right and what was important, even while putting himself in tremendous potential physical harm for those long hours in an aircraft is something that most Members with less afflictions would not have done. 
   I will remember him, and I ask that all Members vote positively on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, it is an unusual day in which the cosponsor of a bill, not in just this Congress but in the previous Congress, comes to oppose the final passage. It is not that I object to the people of the District of Columbia gaining a vote in this body, just the opposite. For two Congresses I have worked with Chairman Davis, now Ranking Member Davis, to achieve that. 
   It is that, for whatever reason, in this Democratically controlled Congress, we have lost democracy. In the regular order of the two committees, amendments were offered, some were passed, some failed. One that was passed was one of mine. It intended to make clear the Maryland relationship to the District of Columbia. It was a  fairly small technical amendment. The Democrat majority, led by Speaker Pelosi, chose to strip that out of what was brought to the floor, to my amazement, but not amusement. And then when I offered the same amendment to the Rules Committee, they voted not to allow it. So that which was voted in the committee of jurisdiction was stripped out by the leadership and then refused to be considered in the body of the whole. That is without any democratic fairness. 
   I am not here to complain about process. I believed it was an essential piece of language when this legislation was considered. So without it, I feel I am compelled not only to vote against it, but to seek alternate remedies for future legislation. 
   We cannot, in this body, Madam Speaker, allow the Speaker of the House or the House majority leader to simply eliminate the tradition of how we do business in order to reach democratically produced legislation. So I will be voting against this bill, and it will be a vote against the kind of heavy-handedness that led to this bill being less than it could have been.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I want to lower the tone and the rhetoric for just a moment and in 2 minutes give the American people and the body here the opportunity to reflect on what we're really doing here tonight. 
   Mr. Speaker, I travel throughout the Arab world regularly. People in that area of the world are more afraid of Islamic terrorism than any American here tonight. They count on us to be their eyes and ears. Most of those countries do not have the resources we have. 
   So when they hear tonight that we don't want a foreign terrorist who calls into a cell in the U.S. to be listened to, they're shocked. They're shocked that we wouldn't at least listen to the foreign side of the operation or see the e-mail, and if the President doesn't sign this by tomorrow, there will be plenty of terrorists who will take note of this because they didn't think, in fact, we weren't able to listen to foreign callers who are calling in to their terrorist cells. 
   Mr. Speaker, oddly enough, September 11 is a story of exactly this, that we were not listening to Osama bin Laden. We were not monitoring Osama bin Laden's instructions to his cells as they went back and forth into the U.S. and even into my home of San Diego. 
   Mr. Speaker, what's amazing to me here tonight is that we're arguing as though we're changing the Constitution arbitrarily. Mr. Speaker, what  we're doing is passing a stopgap 6-month, I repeat, 6-month bill. This thing sunsets in 6 months. One of those months, everybody here will be out on vacation or in their districts doing town hall meetings. 
   The fact is that only 5 months will remain when we come back from the August recess to work further on refinements on a lasting bill. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would close by saying, if people would understand, that really what we're doing is we're simply buying the ability to leave town and letting our allies and the American people know that they can sleep safely tonight. I urge you to take this compromise bipartisan bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I am shocked. I'm shocked that this bill and this process is going forward. 
   When we marked this bill up in the Committee on Government Reform, I was positive that it could not possibly go forward without the section on citizen enforcement being amended, reformed, or eliminated. And yet I am here today not only finding out that it is still in the bill but of the Rules Committee having had the audacity to not even allow it to be considered for amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, this piece of legislation is a license for an unlimited amount of suits against the government by the extreme environmental groups. In fact, this bill pays a $75,000 bounty on top of unlimited legal fees to anyone who sues the government even if, in fact, that suit is based on this body's failure to act. Yes. Lawyers will be telling us, by suing us, that we must do more, and there will be no controls. They can sue in all 92 locations around the country. They can sue for any reason. We will have to pay the bill. When they lose, too bad. When they win, they get paid for taking from us not only 100 percent of their legal fees but $75,000 on top of that. 
   This is a license for America to be held hostage by the trial lawyers. It was deliberate. It was slipped through the committee. They said it was going to be fixed. In fact, nothing has been fixed; and we have been prevented from having an amendment on the House floor. This is undemocratic, and the Democrats know it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I am astounded that you can use the words ``torture'' and ``waterboarding'' as though you were not on the committee of jurisdiction knowing about it as an ex-officio at the time it is to have occurred. I am shocked that this is going to be all about a procedure or procedures that in fact the Speaker of the House had the ability to know about and condoned for years. I am shocked that the Speaker of the House would speak about David Petraeus, when in fact David Petraeus has said publicly and privately: ``You know, on the battlefield of Iraq, I can kill the enemy, but I can't listen to him if he calls America.'' 
   This today should be about what we haven't done. We haven't taken up the Senate's FISA bill. We haven't dealt with the fact that we are in danger every day, and as a member of the intelligence community, I know just how damaging the absence of action has been. 
   This bill has become a partisan bill, and wrongly so. I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fix it and move on, rather than complaining about something that the Speaker is well aware of.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I thank you all for this moment and this minute. 
   I represent a great many tribes in California, none of whom will be adversely affected if this casino goes in or doesn't go in. I come to the floor as a supporter of tribal and historic rights and their gaming rights. I have absolute support for Native Americans having gaming on their tribal lands. I also have absolute support for private property. As the gentlewoman from Michigan would like to have private property respected, then the State of Michigan can license a casino on that site to anyone they want, including those Indians on lands that are not in trust. 
   We, as Federal officers, are being asked to put land in trust for purposes of a casino which has no historic link to the tribes receiving it. We should insist that tribal land be given appropriately in Michigan as close to as possible their historic land or in areas that are for some purpose other than manipulating and distorting the intent of our laws to create a casino.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3195, ADA Amendments Act of 2008. 
   The ADA Amendments Act is a needed step in addressing improper judicial interpretation of the original Americans with Disabilities Act. Courts interpreted the Act more narrowly than Congress had intended resulting in decreased protection under the Act. It is especially gratifying that in crafting the legislation before us today the disability community was able to come to an agreement with private industry on appropriate legislative language. 
   More specifically than the legislation at hand, I bring attention to the lack of Americans with Disability Act, ADA, compliance in the historic Capitol complex, specifically the use of door handles within personal House offices. 
   The purpose the ADA is to ensure nondiscrimination for persons with disabilities including but not limited to public accommodations. The ADA specifically states the use of lever operated mechanisms, push-type mechanisms, or U-shaped handles are acceptable designs for all to operate. 
   Enacted in 1990, I believe it is the responsibility of Congress to every extent reasonable, to install appropriate usable hardware by all those that wish to access the halls of Congress. 
   Beginning with my first term in office in 2000, I have made requests to have my personal House office located in the Cannon building outfitted with ADA appropriate door handles. It is unfortunate that 8 years after my initial request and 18 years following the enactment of the ADA, Congress has chosen to remain out of compliance with the ADA. 
   Congress must lead by example by making these buildings accessible to all Americans, regardless of disability. I urge you to read my attached most recent correspondence requesting this appropriate and necessary change.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (FILIPINO VETERANS EQUITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, today I rise to speak in support of H.R. 6897, the ``Filipino Veterans Equity Act of 2008.'' 
   Recently Congress honored the 67th anniversary of President Franklin Roosevelt's military order conscripting the Philippine military forces into the service of the United States Armed Forces. On July 26, 1941, President Roosevelt said, ``In this great struggle of the Pacific the loyal Americans of the Philippine Island are called upon to play a crucial role ..... I count on every Philippine man, woman, and child to do his duty. We will do ours.'' 
   H.R. 6897 recognizes the service of these veterans to our Nation and commitment of President Roosevelt. 
   In World War II, approximately 200,000 Filipinos served under the command of General MacArthur in the Far East, in guerrilla units,  and the Philippine Scouts. Their service to our country was a critical component to the allied success in the Pacific. 
   Approximately 13,000 survivors of the total estimated 200,000 Filipino World War II veterans now reside in the United States and in the Philippines, many of which are not receiving benefits they earned as servicemen for the U.S. military. 
   Since coming to Congress and as co-chairman of the U.S.-Philippines Friendship Caucus I have urged my House colleagues to support legislation providing equity to World War II Filipino veterans. 
   While not perfect, H.R. 6897 would make payments to those that have yet to receive recognition for their service to the United States. 
   With each passing year, there are fewer surviving Filipino veterans. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6897 to give these veterans their long overdue recognition.

So if we did not decide to put the funding into this particular appropriations bill, we would have to put it in the other.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I was here on the floor yesterday and thought I would only speak once. As I heard the debate of thoughtful Members on both sides of this issue, I was reminded of something I said yesterday that needed to be said again. Although the people you are hearing from mean well on both sides, less than a third of the Members speaking on this House floor served in the U.S. military, although everyone was eligible, and less than a third have traveled to Iraq, although everyone was eligible. Perhaps we will give the freshmen a pass. 
   This is, in fact, a debate by people who are not military experts. I count myself among those, who although I served in the military and have been to Iraq, I am not a military expert. I don't pretend to play one on television and before the American people, and yet that is what we are doing here for four solid days.     
   We are in fact, pretending to be military experts. Well, Mr. Speaker, this morning I had a military expert in my office, Staff Sergeant Bain. He is only a staff sergeant. How is he an expert? He is just finishing 3 years in Walter Reed, 3 years of recovery from terrible wounds. He came in doing a very good job with his artificial leg. He came in and shook my hand, even though he cannot feel with that hand. 
   All I could do was thank him for his service and hand him a coin and wish him well in his civilian life. But he took the time to tell me that he disagreed with the President sending 20,000 troops to Iraq. 
   He said, I am sorry I can't be there for that. He said, they ought to send 100,000. What we did there we need to finish. Staff Sergeant Bain got it right. The United States military and its experts believe we need to get this finished and get it right. 
   Now, the staff sergeant is 3 years out of Iraq, so I will forgive him for not being sure about whether it should be 20,000, as our military leaders, including General Petraeus, have asked for, or whether it should be 20,000 more if necessary, or 100,000. But it is important that Staff Sergeant Bain be heard. 
   Because in fact what you have here are a bunch of people, most of whom did not serve in the military, most of whom have not bothered to go to the combat zone, and those of us who did for the most part had a relatively quick tour in and out. We have not experienced what our troops have experienced. 
   And I know there is some disagreement among those who have been there. But, Mr. Speaker, I ask the American people to ask a vet of this war, their own vet, their own neighborhood, and they are going to find out they want to win this peace just as they won the war. 
   They toppled Saddam, and now they are being told to cut and run. That is what this is leading to. Mr. Speaker, we cannot do that and we know it. And yet for political expedience this body is pretending to be military experts. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will close simply by reminding this body of something we do know about. This is a body filled with people who understand history. Under fascism; we took on Japan, Germany, Italy and their allies. And it took 4 years before we did it, while they grew, and 4 years to defeat them. And it took a decade or more to turn those countries into functional democracies. 
   Yet America stayed the course. And we had troops deployed there and we have troops deployed there today, even though they are functional democracies. 
   Mr. Speaker, for more than 50 years we fought the other ``ism,'' communism. China, the Soviet Union, and the rest of the Soviet Bloc stood there threatening annihilation, but the American people put up with unspeakable amounts of money and significant loss of military lives, over 100,000 in two side battles of the Cold War. 
   We spent countless billions. Sometimes as much as 50 percent of our government's budget went to the military. And we did it. Now we are being asked to deal with radicalism. And I cannot name a country of radicalism. And I cannot say radical Islam or radical Islamic fascism, I simply say radicalism, because these radicals come from different sects of Islam, but they have one thing in common: They seek to conquer countries to put an ``ism'' onto them that is not of their choosing, and without freedom. 
   Won't the American people stand here today with the Congress representing them and stand against this ``ism'' for at least as long as we stood against fascism and at least as long as we stood against communism?

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of S. Con. Res. 45 because there is in fact nothing, nothing more despicable than those who prey upon children. Whether that abuse is physical, psychological or sexual, this crime destroys lives, harms families, and all too often is perpetrated with a cruelty that is unreported and unseen. 
   I support the work of this foundation and its recognition that the National Football League players can off the field make a real contribution to making America a better, safer place.     
   Whether it is John Elway or Joe Montana or any of the other past recipients of this award, they have in fact worked long and hard, not for millions of dollars or thousands of dollars, but for the good of the young people who are our future in this country. Therefore, I too join my colleague and urge the House to unanimously support this resolution.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of S. Con. Res. 45, which commends the Ed Block Courage Award Foundation for its work to prevent child abuse. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is nothing sadder in this country than the specter of children being abused by adults. Whether it's physical, psychological or sexual abuse, these crimes destroy lives, harm families and, all too often, perpetuate cruelty and crime for generations. 
   The award, named for the longtime head athletic trainer of the Baltimore Colts, recognizes the NFL player whose off-the-field efforts have done the most in that year to raise awareness of this often hidden crime. Past winners include Dan Marino, Tedy Bruschi, Joe Klecko, John Elway, Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott. 
   Mr. Speaker, we thank Baltimore for crabcakes and Billie Holliday and Camden Yards and Cal Ripken. And today, we thank Charm City for this. 
   The award was the vision of Sam Lamantia Jr., a Baltimore hair stylist. 
   The courage award concept was initiated by Ernie Accorsi, a longtime NFL executive who served as general manager in Baltimore in the early 1980s. Larry Harris, then assistant sports editor of the Baltimore Evening Sun, had the idea to name the award for Block, a forward-thinking, innovative trainer who had a lifelong passion for preventing and addressing child abuse. 
   The NFL's athletic trainers worked to take the award to a national level. 
   Today, it represents a cooperative effort of the foundation, the NFL, the NFL Players Association, the NFL Alumni Association, NFL films, the Professional Football Athletic Trainers Society and the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Pete Rozelle, the league's late commissioner, was among its biggest supporters. 
   The foundation has helped open Courage Houses, sanctuaries for abused children, in 14 NFL cities. Its annual awards ceremony attracts speakers from the highest levels of the sport. 
   It's been a great partnership, Mr. Speaker, between pro football and the Ed Block Foundation, and it is worthy of our commendation.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to join with the gentleman from Virginia, my friend, in enthusiastically supporting this legislation. After 50 years of this kind of a Council of Governments' working, it deserves the recognition it will receive here on the House floor today. I certainly believe that Mr. Moran has done a very, very good job of outlining the 50 years of success, beginning in April of 1957, and I think we should briefly reflect on what 1957 until day was all about. 
   This is a time in which the District of Columbia went through terrible upheaval. Maryland and Virginia had to reinvent themselves. All of this could not have been done without the kind of cooperation that this council produced. I think it is certainly unique to have the District of Columbia and two States, five counties, two cities and dozens of Maryland counties all working together. These jurisdictions are cooperating. 
   I think that is a legacy that has only half finished its work. I think on a bipartisan basis we all recognize the improvements in the quality of living here, the transportation and infrastructure that makes it possible for us to get to work by road or by rail. 
   So, I look forward to this organization continuing for another 50 years serving what is today 1.6 million people, and certainly a growing population, both in and out of the district. 
   With that, I very much urge passage of this bill.

   She was truly a pillar of the community and well-recognized in Fontana. As my colleague said, the California delegation uniquely requires 53 cosponsors in order to bring a bill. That means that a very diverse State, the most diverse in the Nation, has to come together on these post office namings. This is an example when we did. 
   Bea dedicated her life to the community and in every sense was in fact a true Californian, although in fact, like myself, she was born in Ohio and came to California at age 20. She originally moved to San Bernardino where she attended the San Bernardino Community College. She then worked for the telephone company as an administrator for Pacific Bell. 
   Only years later did she arrive in Fontana. Nevertheless, her dedication allowed her to become truly a pillar of the community, a city councilwoman, and to serve in various capacities for the rest of her life, through both Fontana's 50th and 75th anniversaries. 
   It is not lightly that we consider naming post offices after people not in the postal community, and I join with my colleague today and the California delegation unanimously urging passage of this bill.

   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge the passing of this bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 744 West Oglethorpe Highway in Hinesville, Georgia, as the ``John Sidney `Sid' Flowers Post Office Building''. 
   A native of Liberty County, Sid Flowers served in the U.S. Army before attending law school at Mercer. Despite distinguishing himself as a top scholar at Mercer, he opted not to pursue high profile law firms in Atlanta. Instead he returned to his hometown where he served the county as Solicitor General for nearly four decades. But his public service did not end there. Mr. Flowers was best known for his pro bono legal work, contributing his advice to the First Presbyterian Church and the church's school at no charge. 
   Mr. Flowers not only gave back to the community professionally, but also through his generous, often anonymous, contributions. His munificence took many forms, whether it was through community service or anonymously picking up the tab for soldiers dining at local restaurants. 
   When Mr. Flowers passed on August 21, 2006, Liberty County lost the consummate public servant. A kind and humble man, his passionate and selfless commitment to his community and country undoubtedly deserves tribute. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill to publicly honor this man, not only for his public service, but for the intangible generosity of his spirit.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of this bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 797 Sam Bass Road in Round Rock, Texas, as the ``Marine Corps Corporal Steven P. Gill Post Office Building'' in honor of the late Marine Corporal Steven P. Gill, a 24 year old Marine Corps reservist killed near Zaidon, Iraq by an IED on July 21, 2005. 
   A native of Round Rock, Corporal Gill was not only a model soldier, but also a model citizen. 
   After graduating from Westwood High School in 1999, he enrolled in Concordia University. Corporal Gill planned to enter the seminary, but his work with children and church youth groups inspired him to pursue a life as a youth minister. 
   Then, on September 11, 2001, his life, like so many other American's, changed dramatically. In the words of his father, Bill Gill, ``When he saw those towers crashing, he had to do something.'' 
   Convinced by his father to finish the semester, Corporal Gill enlisted in the Marines in January, 2002, later assigned to the 4th Marine Division, 4th Reconnaissance Battalion, based in San Antonio, the same unit his father served in years ago. 
   Corporal Gill is a shining example of an individual who continually and selflessly served those around him, both through his work for his community and his country. His spirit lives on through the work of his mother, Rose Gill, who, despite losing her job in wake of his death, continues to promote the Marines and the sacrifice of her son. 
   Three months after his death she ran in the Marine Corps Marathon and has run in his honor every year since, raising money for wounded soldiers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in this bipartisan effort to bring greater awareness to World Diabetes Day. 
   As my colleague said, 225,000 people per year die in the United States alone from diabetes. But I believe that, as we recognize this day, we have to recognize that diabetes doesn't just kill; diabetes debilitates. It causes blindness. It takes away all or part of limbs. It slows people down in their day-to-day ability to enjoy life. One of the great inventors of our time invented the insulin pump, which allowed people to not have to periodically stop to take medicine, but it didn't change the debilitating effect that artificially-given insulin causes. 
   We do not have a cure for diabetes today. We need to continue working toward that, as many of our pharmaceutical companies are. So bringing awareness to this is just a first step in making sure that the United States, Europe, and the other developed nations work hard to find real cures for this dreadful disease.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of H. Con. Res. 211, which supports the goals and ideals of World Diabetes Day. 
   Mr. Speaker, diabetes is among the most lethal diseases known to man. It kills about 225,000 people per year in the United States alone--fifth among disease-related deaths and roughly equal to the population of New Orleans or Madison, WI. 
   And it's generally believed to be significantly under-reported on death certificates, especially among the old--who may endure multiple chronic conditions, many caused by diabetes. 
   Because, as anyone who has diabetes knows all too well, when you have diabetes, you don't just have diabetes. The disease leads to increased risk of a number of seriously, sometimes life-threatening complications. 
   These include--but certainly aren't limited to--heart disease and stroke, blindness, high blood pressure, kidney disease, nervous-system disease, dental disease, even pregnancy complications. 
   Strokes and heart disease are two to four times more likely for those with diabetes than those without, and diabetes is the leading cause of new blindness cases in the United States. 
   Most of these associated health problems can be avoided with good diabetes control, but many people don't realize they have diabetes until it has caused one of these other diseases. Indeed, of the 21 million people in the United States who have diabetes, nearly a third don't yet know it. Those who do spend about one in every 10 dollars we spend on health care in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I applaud efforts such as World Diabetes Day that call attention to the problems this disease causes and the need for further research and outreach. 
   We need to do what we can to solve this mystery and slow this killer--both to alleviate the pain, suffering and expense of our fellow citizens afflicted by the disease and for our own economic benefit. 
   Experts say diabetes costs the U.S. economy $132 billion per year. That's what we spend on telecom in a year. It's the total Gross Domestic Product of Singapore and matches, roughly, what the country spends on all research and development in a year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know people who suffer from diabetes. So does everyone in this House. Approving a resolution does not do much to alleviate that suffering. But today, it is what we have the opportunity to do. Let us do it.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

He was a close friend of Henry Hyde and loved to be an advocate for a better understanding not just of the State of Ohio, but of our Nation abroad. It is very befitting that we do this and do it in a timely fashion. I move support for the bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of S. 2174, to designate the U.S. Post Office at 175 South Monroe Street in Tiffin, Ohio, as the ``Paul E. Gillmor Post Office Building.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I doubt I've ever had an easier sell when it comes to convincing my colleagues to support legislation. 
   As was noted repeatedly on this floor when Paul died on Sept. 5 at his home in Arlington, he was a man we all liked, even those of us on the other side of the political aisle. 
   A small-town banker, a businessman, a Vietnam War vet, a former Judge Advocate General, a husband and father of five, he was known to all of us as a man who worked hard for and cared deeply about his constituents, who spent most of his life in service to his country and who, just 12 days before his death, was touring flood-ravaged areas of his beloved Ohio and trying to see how he could help.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I join with my colleague from the District of Columbia in supporting the naming of this post office after Lance Corporal Dennis Veater. He was a dedicated marine who enlisted in 2004 upon his high school graduation and entered the Marine Corps Reserve at age 17, following in the footsteps of his marine sergeant major father. Lance Corporal Veater wanted to serve his country, and he wanted to make a difference. 
   On March 9, 2007, just 2 weeks before his scheduled return to the United States, Lance Corporal Veater was mortally injured while conducting combat operations in Anbar province, Iraq. 
   He leaves behind his fiancee, whom he planned to marry upon his return, and his 14-month-old son, Dominick. 
   Lance Corporal Veater did not die in vain. Today Anbar province is safer because of the work he and the other marines did there. I join with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in thinking it is very important to remember this man and the work he did for his family back home.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of H. Res. 816, congratulating the Colorado Rockies for winning the National League Championship and participating in the World Series. 
   Mr. Speaker, to go to the World Series is to be special. To win it is a 50-50 chance. So I think it is appropriate when we look at a team that had won 21 of 22 games, defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in the Division Series and the Arizona Diamondbacks for the National League Championship to claim their spot in the World Series that, in fact, we in Congress take a few moments before our colleagues, many of them arriving back from their districts, to add this to what we will celebrate for America tonight, because nothing is greater to celebrate for America than its pastime of baseball, particularly at a time when we are cleaning up baseball. 
   So with that, there's no asterisk behind this resolution, and I urge its support.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support and join with my colleagues in supporting and sponsoring the gentlelady from Missouri's bill, H.R. 4220, the Federal Food Donation Act of 2007. 
   As Mrs. Emerson said so well, the effort to aid nonprofit organizations to serve the hungry will be advanced by this bill and its amendment to the Federal acquisition regulations and to encourage Federal agencies and contractors to donate excessive foods to food pantries, food shelters, and homes for the homeless. 
   This bill also seeks to protect agencies and contractors from civil or criminal liabilities associated with these types of donations. It is sad but true in this country that often good deeds go punished as a result of the advent of those who would profit by suing over the good deeds of others. This bill tries to balance those two to encourage the good deeds of others and to shelter them from the type of adverse behavior that might cause people to throw away food rather than give it to the poor.

   Mr. Speaker, I served with Congressman Dan Miller. He, unlike most Members of Congress, came here, said he would stay for a period of time, as the Founding Fathers thought, and return to his life at home. 
   He was elected from the 13th District of Florida in 1992, and after 10 years, five terms, retired in 2003. He did so not to seek higher office, not for any reason except that he felt that he came here for a period of time, served for the time he'd promised, and went back. He has, in fact, returned to his life and appropriately has resettled in southwest Florida at the University of South Florida. 
   I look forward to seeing him up here again some day. I look forward to his continued process of participating here in helping those of us in Congress. 
   It is unusual for a Member of Congress to come, stay for a period of time, and not return to lobbying, not seek higher office, but in fact to go back to being the citizen that he can be and to give to his community and to be available should we need him.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 254, which recognizes and celebrates the 100th anniversary of Oklahoma statehood. 
   Mr. Speaker, Oklahoma is a State that takes energy production so seriously that it has oil wells on the grounds of the Governor's mansion. It is a State people were so anxious to move into that they jumped the gun in claiming homesteads and entered sooner. That is where the nickname comes from, the Sooner State. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a time in which energy independence is talked about but not achieved, in which States like our own, California, are major energy producers but less than half of the oil that it consumes, Oklahoma continues to aggressively find the resources that lie beneath it and to make it available for us. 
   Additionally, throughout its heartache, Oklahoma has given us Gene Autry. I won't skip over Brad Pitt. It has given us music. It has given us both country and a number of other great venues. But, most of all, it gave us J.C. Watts, the longest winning streak in history in college football, and they are proud of it. And, last but not least, it gave us Will Rogers. 
   So as we look at Oklahoma, a State that takes oil seriously, that in fact was rushed into because it was such a great place, I also join with my colleagues in supporting this resolution recognizing that, after 100 years, Oklahoma is still a meaningful and important part of this great Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (EXPRESSING DEEP CONCERN OVER THE USE OF CIVILIANS AS HUMAN SHIELDS -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 125 and join with my colleagues in denouncing Hezbollah for employing the use and the tactic of placing weapons, defensive and offensive, in the midst of communities in which innocent civilians live. 
   I also associate myself with the previous speaker, though, in saying that we have to go beyond a narrow issue of a single enemy in the Middle East. The use of human shields in the Middle East is unfortunately widespread, not just by the cancer that grows, that is known as Hezbollah in Lebanon, but also throughout the region. 
   On this point, I would like to give credit where credit is due. These pictures were taken, this one was taken in 2004, where a 13-year-old Palestinian boy named Mohammed Badwan was tied to the hood of an Israeli police jeep in the West Bank. A group of Palestinian youths had been reportedly throwing rocks at Israeli police, so the boy was taken and tied to the jeep so that they would stop throwing their rocks. 
   On October 6, and I want to give credit where credit is due, because this has not been unanswered, on October 6, 2005, the Israel High Court of Justice, the equivalent of our Supreme Court, ruled that it was illegal for Israeli forces to use Palestinian civilians during military operations. This ruling effectively ended the officially sanctioned tactic known as neighborhood procedure, whereby Israeli soldiers would forcibly use Palestinian civilians for tasks, including entering buildings to check to see if they were booby-trapped, removing building occupants, and moving suspicious objects from roads used by the army. 
   One of the victims of this neighborhood procedure was a 19-year-old Palestinian student who in 2002 was killed in the West Bank after troops took the young man out of his house and forced him to knock on the door of a neighboring building, where a senior Hamas fugitive was hiding. Gunfire erupted, and the student was killed. 
   In addition to the Israeli Supreme Court, human rights group have also been recognized for their work, and I commend them. B'Tselem, Rabbis for Human Rights, and Adalah have worked extensively on these cases and brought them to the court. To the credit of the Israeli people and their court system, they have denounced it, and they have sought to stop it. 
   The Israeli Army itself, most recently, acted swiftly to suspend a commander caught on videotape using two Palestinian youths as human shields earlier this month. In the video that has been seen around the world and covered by the Associated Press, a peace activist is heard shouting to the Israeli soldiers who have positioned two youths standing in front of their vehicle, ``You can't use them as human shields. It's against the law.'' 
   The Israeli soldier responds, ``We are not using them as a human shield.'' 
   ``They are standing in front of your jeep. How is that not a human shield? You are using them to protect you from stones,'' the activist retorts. 
   ``We asked them to speak to their friends and ask them to stop throwing stones at us,'' the soldier says. 
   Shortly after this videotape was posted, the Israeli military announced  the mission commander had been relieved of operational duty following this incident, in which IDF soldiers had apparently used these civilians, and the Israeli Government acted quickly. 
   I applaud their swift response and their efforts to make this use of human shields, once and for all, stop. This morning I circulated a Dear Colleague via e-mail with links to these videos and news stories. 
   I encourage my colleagues to take a look at these articles and efforts under way to stop the use of human shields. I have also issued statements that are on my Web site at www.issa.house.gov under the heading of ``Banning the use of Human Shields.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I believe there are two sides to this. There is a difference. One side is continuing to be a cancer on the people of Lebanon. One side is continuing to use human shields with very little to stop them. The other side is taking those measures. 
   I came here today to commend the Israeli Government for taking those measures, to ask them to continue to use the strongest methods possible to make sure that is eliminated from one side of the equation. I will support this resolution denouncing the other side of the equation that continues to use human shields.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, the two previous speakers on our side spoke in favor of the bill. 
   I would like to honor their speaking in favor of the bill by saying that the bill is well intended, even if it is fatally flawed. People are talking about 10 years of wanting to achieve what they hope to achieve here today. 
   I would say to you and certainly would ask that Federal workers take note of what we do here today. We are not talking about making sure that someone who has a child or adopts a child has the opportunity to take the time off for bonding. We already ensure 12 weeks of that and have for that decade. 
   We are not talking here about anything except as it is presently written and not allowed to be amended, a bill that simply grants 4 weeks every single year to those individuals who choose to have a child, who choose to take time off in relation to a sick Federal employee, as was originally presented, or, more importantly, someone who takes on a foster child. 
   Now I am all for people taking on foster children, but let's look at this from a practical standpoint. You are running a Federal department. You have somebody who you need, and every single year, as often happens, they take on a new foster child that they keep for 3 to 5 years and they have, let's say, three foster children. That means that that individual will be gone on paid leave over and above their vacation, over and above their 13 days of sick leave a year, they are going to be gone 4 weeks every year, conceivably for a full 20 years. 
   So by having not just the birth, of a woman, but the husband, and not just birth, but foster children, we can conceivably go so far beyond the $850 million scoring, we could easily end up in the tens of billions of dollars. 
   Let's consider our Federal workers at a time when we are considering whether this is appropriate to do. Our Federal workers receive 13 days of sick leave a year. Our Federal workers can accumulate those for 6 months, meaning that when they retire, as is often the case, Federal workers simply don't show up to work for the last 6 months. The reason? They are using up their sick leave. They can't be paid for it. They additionally have in the neighborhood of 2 weeks plus of vacation that they can cash out if they don't use it. 
   Now, in the private sector, it is not, in almost any case, a use-it-or-lose-it policy on sick leave. Additionally, a little-known practice, but well used in the Federal service, is the giving away of somebody's sick leave. For example, if somebody in your department or somebody in your organization or the Federal Government were to take on a foster child, there can be a campaign to raise sick leave for that individual so that they would not be unpaid if they had a need for it. No problem, but it comes out of the bank of 13 days per employee per year.     
   What this bill seeks to do is to grant something that is almost unheard of here in Congress or in the private sector. 
   And I would like to take a little exception with the gentlelady from New York; we did go and look at the existing programs, and there is no support for 86 percent of House offices provide paid leave, not at all. Paid parental leave as a written policy does not exist in many of the offices, and I would ask the gentlelady to bring proof of her statement because quite frankly she has been misled if she thinks 86 percent of House offices have a formal written policy granting already this privilege that we seek to grant here this year. 
   The scoring, as I said, Mr. Speaker, is wrong. It is not going to be $850 million, it will be billions of dollars. It will be billions of dollars at a time when Americans are being laid off. It will be billions of dollars at a time when Fortune 100 companies offering either pregnancy-related or disability leave, it is less than one-third of the Fortune 100 companies, which are the most wealthy, most generous companies in America, and less than one-third typically will offer that. 
   The fact is that unpaid parental leave has become widespread. The leadership of the U.S. House and Senate in passing a bill that granted that to Federal workers is to be commended. The opportunity at one's expense using one's resources to take care of and bond in regards to a choice such as a birth or adoption of a child, is commendable and has become widespread. 
   If this becomes widespread, we might someday look back and commend it. But today, what we are doing is we are offering Federal workers, workers who, like ourselves, are often chastised by people in the private sector who have to make a payroll, are being given things which they cannot afford. 
   As is often said on the House floor, 44-plus million Americans don't have health care, and yet we are asking that every Federal worker, in addition to 13 days of paid sick leave, accumulable or borrow-able or giveaway-able, be granted additionally another, what is basically twice that amount, each and every year if they choose to use it. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is simply wrong to do it. In committee we aggressively tried to amend this to allow them to use resources already available more flexibly. Those were voted down on primarily a party-line basis. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time in anticipation of more things that need to be corrected on the House floor.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the majority providing us reference to the 2006 House Compensation Study that shows even with other people's money, and perhaps no guidance on how to spend it, about 20 percent of the House offices offer little or no, or actually offer no paid leave. 
   The amazing thing to me is we are here today talking about a new paid leave. I just want to explain for a moment, when congressional offices choose to do paid leave, they do so out of a fixed budget. The majority would have you believe here that we are going to do this out of some fixed budget. We are not. This is going to run up the cost of every office that does everything, from post offices to the Secret Service to the IRS. It is going to run up the cost of these Federal employees. It is going to run it up by quite a bit. 
   With all due respect to my colleague from California, I am not implying that having foster families is bad; just the opposite, it's good. The question is if you have an active foster parent family and they are being given 4 weeks of paid leave, who is to assume that they won't take it. I believe they will. That will mean for every 12 people doing it, you will have basically the need for an additional Federal worker with all the compensation and benefits that go with it. That is the reality we have here today. 
   In committee we attempted unsuccessfully to have this be fiscally responsible, recognizing that there are 13 days of paid sick leave every year, fully accumulable so that a typical worker need only borrow from the sick leave that they were eventually going to cash out by not coming to work the last 6 months they are in the Federal workforce, simply use it for this. 
   I am not implying that the birth of a child is sick, but it is fully usable under the amendments we tried to offer. So it is a little disingenuous for my colleague from California to say that the military can use it and somehow Federal workers couldn't. That could have been taken care of in committee, and it was clearly fought on a partisan basis. 
   The fact is this bill should be before us today clarifying and taking care of some technical problems in the families being able to take full advantage of the Family and Medical Leave Act by being able to use all of their sick leave, perhaps even borrow against future sick leave, which was proposed, and in fact have their colleagues give them sick leave in order to facilitate their staying home for those 4 weeks or more and not be without pay. 
   The fact is we are here today dealing with a problem which we should not be spending new money on at a time when the Federal deficit and the Federal spending is far in excess of what the private sector can afford. As people here in Washington and people in California find it impossible to make ends meet with $5 a gallon gasoline, it is irresponsible for us to be adding this multibillion-dollar perk at a time in which, with only technical corrections, we could have provided these people the opportunity to use resources they already had in the way of sick leave and vacation. 
   With all due respect to Federal workers, I think the majority of Federal workers would say that if they had their choice of this many billions of dollars of new spending, they would just as soon get it up front in pay and they would care of their choices in children, adopted or natural birth, they would take care of it out of their sick leave if they were given the additional dollars. So I think in fact we are doing them a disservice, if we are going to spend the money, of not spending it straightforward in a proper way, and I look forward to attempts to make this technically correct. 
   And I once again regret that the Rules Committee chose not to allow these technical amendments not to be even considered, but in fact have kept them from debate on the House floor. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to set the record straight. Sick leave of Federal workers is not limited to people who are sick. The common practice at the end of a career of simply retiring 6 months early to use up accrued sick leave speaks loudly to the fact that sick leave is simply 13 additional days that can be used on a discretionary basis. 
   The chairman of the full committee knows this very well. And, in fact, we attempted to make it explicit that not only would you be able to use your 13 days plus any accrual, but even borrow in order to make this fiscally neutral, fiscally responsible at this time.     
   This bill is not about whether or not we allow people to take 4, 6, 8 or 12 weeks of paid leave. In fact, we were more than willing to have the entire 12 weeks of family medical leave be usable, to be able to use its current or even borrow some of its future sick leave. 
   What this bill is doing here today is saying, you get to keep 3, 4, 5 months of sick leave you already have in the bank. You get to keep your many weeks of vacation, and you get this additional amount. This is something the American people are not prepared to pay for. If we're going to be responsible, we're not going to make the American people pay for this additional back-door increase at this time. 
   The majority knows this very well, so I, again, repeat, it is disingenuous to say that they can't use their sick leave. In fact, that was something that could have been handled in committee, would have been handled by the amendments that were not ruled in order by the Rules Committee on a purely partisan basis. 
   In fact, we are considering a bill today that is designed to cost the American people money. 
   I continue to reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I think the leadership said it very well. Of course, they didn't say anything about what we're actually doing here today. This isn't about family unity or bonding. It isn't about mom and dad or the child. This is about a new spending, a new irresponsible spending proposal coming from the Democrats after they promised us fiscal responsibility. 
   The fact is, we will have our taxes raised. The American people will pay for this in higher taxes in the coming years. They will pay for this after we said it was about your family. 
   The reality is that there will be layoffs in the private sector. There will be people in the private sector who say, with these new taxes, can we still afford to have health care benefits while, in fact, Federal workers who not only enjoy good health care benefits, good vacation policies, also get more than 2 1/2 weeks a year to be sick. 
   Now, when the American people discover that an organization, the U.S. government, gives their people 2 1/2 weeks to be sick, and allows them to accrue 6 months of that in case they're ever really sick for a long period of time, and does not require a physician's proof that they actually are sick, and then, when given the opportunity to say, let's use these 2 1/2 plus weeks a year of sick benefits, since they're usable for anything you want to use in the way of time off, let's use  them for time off when you have a child, that, in fact that was turned down as not good enough by the Democrat majority. 
   It was turned down as clearly we have to add the dollars on top of this, wrongfully estimating $850 million when, in fact, this is billions. This could be fiscally responsible and family-oriented by simply allowing this well-accrued sick leave to be used for this, since it's going to be either used for sick leave, or it's going to be used at the end of a career or before someone leaves government as a general practice. It is seldom simply not used and turned back in. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it is very clear from the Democrat leader, that, in fact, this new expense leading to new taxes is, in fact, something that he supports, but calls it family-oriented. It's not family-oriented to the taxpayers in America, to the private sector. It is simply family-oriented to big government.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to correct the RECORD. 
   Mr. Speaker, less than one-third of Fortune 100 companies offer fathers paid leave. Approximately half offer some amount of disability or pregnancy leave in the birth of a natural child. So when you mix and match the richest companies in this country you're going to get less than a third offer anything close to what we're offering here today, not more than half. We're not following. 
   In fact, when you quote the Fortune 100, by definition, what you're quoting are the very large companies that are normally disparaged by my Democrat colleagues as gouging the public on making too much on oil and other resources. 
   In fact, what we normally talk about on the House floor and pay tribute to are the small businesses, the entrepreneurial, mom and pop businesses. They're not giving this. They can't afford to. 
   As a matter of fact, a big part of the 44 million uninsured are because small businesses can't afford health care. They can't afford health, dental, eyeglass. And yet we're giving this benefit. 
   Now, there was a proposal Mr. Van Hollen said that I think was very appropriate. We do have boomers retiring. In committee we have talked about ways to extend the careers of those baby boomers. The easiest way, one which would be fiscally responsible, as a matter of fact, it would even be a benefit to us and to them, those 6 months that are often used as terminal leave on a retiring senior member of government, if we would simply pay them those 6 months when they retire, it would be the least expensive way to get six additional months from the baby booming retired workforce.     
   That proposal is dead on arrival apparently for the Democrat majority. That proposal would be a way to extend these significant amount of Federal workers at the time we need them most, which is when they really are senior people able to pass on to the next generation. That soft landing, dead on arrival. 
   A new costly program, one that less a third of Fortune 100 companies, the richest companies, can even afford in fact is what we're being faced with here today.

   You know, it's amazing that the gentlelady from New York would make the case that this isn't going to cost much. Of course, no dynamic scoring. They're sort of just looking at track history and then want the dynamic scoring for some intangible savings in Federal worker retention. It's very clear this is going to cost $850 million or more and that it is likely to grow. 
   More importantly, I'm not somebody who spends a lot of time preaching family values from the dais. But if we're going to talk family values here today, let's talk them. Family values are about family making sacrifices to make things work. Unlike the gentlelady, I find that her example is an excellent example for my point, not her point. No Federal worker is forced to come back with an open wound. In fact, that woman would have been allowed to continue getting paid leave. 
   Additionally, with more than 2 1/2 weeks of accrued paid medical leave every year, there is no reason that she wouldn't have likely had accruals in her own bank. I love anecdotal examples because they usually make the case for the person delivering them; I would say just the opposite. This woman didn't have to come back. She could use medical leave, and contrary to what the gentlelady from New York is saying, Federal workers are allowed to use their medical, their sick leave in other ways, and they do regularly. 
   Additionally, there is a whole system within the Federal workforce not really understood by the private sector but supported by this Member which is I can put my unused sick leave into banks to help others. I can even put my vacation, under certain circumstances, in banks to help others. So Federal workers can, in fact, share this very generous more than 2 1/2 weeks of sick leave and 2 weeks of vacation if they choose to. 
   So when we talk about the Federal family, the Federal family has plenty of resources to help with this. 
   What we're talking about here is a multibillion-dollar new spending program at a time of recession, at a time of threatened tax increases by the Democrat majority, and at a time when the American people are striving just to fill up the tank with gas and try to figure out how to pay health care benefits. We're looking at new opportunities to increase our own well being. 
   But we don't and shouldn't come first. The taxpayers and hardworking men and women out there come first. So for this Member, I'm going to tell you I'm not going to put us first, I'm going to put the taxpayers first and vote against this. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the time I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, you have noticed I have spoken with great passion here today about this bill. I would wish that I could be speaking with the passion in the positive, because the Federal workers deserve a bill that we didn't bring to the floor today. They deserve one that would allow for flexibility of sick leave, transferability, transparently to people who are having families, whether by adoption or by natural birth. That is what we should be bringing to the floor. 
   We could do so at a time of shortages around the country at no cost to the taxpayer. We could do it exactly the way the gentlelady from New York described. Mrs. Maloney does not get new money for a new perk for her people. She chooses within a budget to in fact provide that benefit. And I commend her for that, and I commend the other Members who make decisions how to allocate a fixed pie of money, whether it's to go on sending constituent mail or providing paying benefits to the employees that answer the mail from constituents. 
   So today we are not being given the bill we should be given. The bill we should give is to guarantee the ability to not lose pay when taking family medical leave but to use resources that are already available within the Federal system. That's not happening today. I regret that that's not happening. Had we been allowed to bring the amendments that we wanted to bring, we would have accomplished that. Had we been allowed to even bring the technical corrections that would have made this a less-imperfect bill, one that would not cause deadbeat dads to be able to take advantage of this, we would be doing that. We're not allowed to do that today. I regret that. 
   I hope that this bill is defeated here and/or in the Senate and that we can bring up a truly bipartisan bill, one that would pass, quite frankly, on suspension if it was structured right, and would provide Federal workers this opportunity without additional costs to the taxpayers. 
   I thank the Speaker, and I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for a spirited debate. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2102, the Free Flow of Information Act. This bill goes too far in jeopardizing our national security. 
   The freedom of the press is an immensely important principal in our democratic society. That is why the Department of Justice (DOJ) has for the past 35 years followed a policy that strictly limits when Federal prosecutors are allowed to issue subpoenas to the press. These standards are so difficult to meet that prosecutors, under this current policy, are commonly discouraged from even seeking a subpoena for a reporter in the first place. 
   These protections, which are far reaching, should not be absolute. When critical, highly sensitive national security information is illegally disclosed to members of the news media and published for every enemy of America to see--Federal prosecutors must be empowered to aggressively investigate the disclosure of that information and the prosecution of those responsible. We simply cannot erect obstacles which hamstring Federal law enforcement when sensitive government secrets are divulged. Such disclosure can be treasonous, and reporters should not be able to protect individuals who jeopardize our national security. American lives are more important than the privilege of anonymity that reporters promise to a source who is compromising our nation's secrets. 
   According to the DOJ, the ``unduly narrow exception to the legislation's broad prohibition on compelled disclosure would hinder efforts to investigate and prosecute those who have leaked classified information, undermine the ability of law enforcement to investigate national security breaches that have already occurred, and weaken Federal efforts to mitigate damage to national security that has already taken place.'' As a member of both the Committees on Judiciary and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I find these faults with the bill unacceptable. 
   While I do not stand in opposition to my friends Representatives MIKE PENCE and RICK BOUCHER, the primary sponsors of this legislation, I must ask my colleagues to vote no on this bill. H.R. 2102 establishes new dangers without sufficient justification.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. 
   Mr. Speaker, the chairman of this committee cannot have it both ways. And the Speaker of the House cannot have it both ways. In their blind hatred for this administration and the President, they would have you believe on Tuesday of last week that you must believe the Ministry of Interior in Iraq and you must believe that the veterans, now serving for Blackwater, murdered in cold blood 17 Iraqis who were unarmed, defenseless, simply for the sport of it. On Tuesday, that is what Erik Prince had to deal with on the orders of Speaker Pelosi and dealt out by Chairman Waxman. 
   That was Tuesday. By Thursday, we were looking at what we see here today, that the administration was covering up so much corruption, particularly the corruption of the Ministry of Interior. Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote for this resolution not because it is flawless. It has its understandable flaws. But I am going to vote for it because in the whereases it says, whereas, the independent commission on security forces of Iraq chaired by General James L. Jones (Retired) reported on September 6, 2007 that ``sectarianism and corruption are pervasive in the Ministry of Interior and cripple the ministry's ability to accomplish its mission.'' 
   It goes on and on to make the point I am making, just as the majority has already made, Mr. Speaker, and that is that in order to believe that combat veterans, special forces veterans, Green Berets and special forces SEALS now out of the military and out of harm's way in Iraq working for Blackwater, in order to believe that they murdered in cold blood defenseless civilians at an intersection just for sport just after a bomb went off, you would have had to believe the Minister of Interior. And Mr. Waxman would have had the committee believe that on Tuesday. But by Thursday, of course, we have the coverup of such rampant corruption. Yet in the very, very resolution, we have an independent commission headed by a distinguished former general say, in no uncertain terms, there is rampant and widespread corruption. That has not been taken back by the administration. 
   Mr. Speaker, what I would say is Mr. Waxman and the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, cannot have it both ways. They cannot go after our troops in harm's way, our contractors serving in those capacities similar, most of them, if not all of them veterans, they cannot denounce every aspect of this war, how we got there and when we go there and then say, but this group is so corrupt we must leave. 
   The previous speaker, Mr. Speaker, went out of his way to say the third from the bottom in corruption is Iraq, never mentioning that Burma was below that. Burma managed to be one of the two at the very bottom. Mr. Speaker, would the majority have us pull out our representation and support in Burma and leave to those who are already the victims of corruption an even more corrupt government? Or would they, given that this administration in their view is not doing enough, say, We should do more, we should engage, we should spend the money insisting on transparency and reform? 
   Mr. Speaker, I am voting for this resolution because, in fact, I believe the majority and the minority should agree that there is corruption, corruption so widespread in Iraq for the Minister of Interior to frame men and women in harm's way in order to get them out of the way. I do not want this body and this Congress to be a party to framing Americans who are putting their lives on the line as patriots in Iraq. 
   I ask that people support it on both sides, not because Mr. Waxman isn't trying to have it both ways, but because, in fact, there is corruption in Iraq, and hopefully, at some point, he will begin to believe loyal Americans over those very corrupt entities that he denounces in other parts of his resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, the deal that is being presented to us is not the best deal that can be had. I know this because of 20-plus years in business, borrowing from banks. There is a better deal. We are not getting it. As the gentlelady from Ohio said, there are other advisers, including Bill Isaac and others, who are weighing in and who are trying to get us to see reason. 
   A plan that I have put forward has been endorsed, not only by Peter Tanous but by Art Laffer, certainly no liberal. The fact is we can bail out these entities without giving away. We can, in fact, loan to them against their substantial assets and not simply buy the bad assets and leave them free to take their good assets and our taxpayers' hard-earned money and walk off into the sunset to do what they want to do, which in this case is unlikely to be to extend a home loan to someone who needs it or a business loan to an innovator. 
   Mr. Speaker, I expect to vote against this bill. From what I've seen of it, not yet fully drafted, it does not do what the American people are asking it to do, which is to protect their tax dollars. That is the fundamental thing we're supposed to do. That's what we are charged to do. That is what we are being told not to worry about because this is an emergency.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 107, which calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Israeli soldiers held captive by Hamas and Hezbollah. 
   On July 19, 2006, I and the three Members of Lebanese ancestry joined together to introduce H. Res. 926 in response to the unprovoked attack and kidnapping by Hezbollah. This resolution condemned Hamas and Hezbollah for engaging in the reprehensible terrorist act of taking hostages, affirmed Israel's right to conduct operations to secure the release of hostages, and urging the protection of innocent life and civilian infrastructure. 
   H. Res. 107 sends an important message that the terrorist leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah must recognize. The United States has not forgotten the kidnapped Israeli soldiers or those responsible for their kidnapping including the states who support the terrorist groups. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to note for the record that this resolution expresses ``strong support and deep interest in achieving a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state living in peace alongside of the State of Israel,'' as well as ``vigorous support and unwavering commitment to the welfare and survival of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders.'' 
   While I fully support the commitment to the welfare and survival of the State of Israel, I have some reservations about this body expressing its support for a nation embracing a specific religious character. My concern is that in some situations, such expression of an endorsement of a particular religion or ethnicity could be used to exclude others which is, of course, not the intention of this resolution. 
   Both Israeli and Palestinian leaders have expressed their preference for a viable two-state solution and, as such, I support this joint goal and the independent peaceful aspirations of both peoples because the parties have made these decisions on their own and not because I support the preeminence of any particular religion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is an excellent example of bipartisan behavior in the drafting. It reflects quite well what we went through in California last week. Particularly, I take note of the fact that this was the largest fire because it had the most fuel. This is one of the challenges we face in California. We have hundreds of thousands of acres that may not have been cleared or burned in more than three decades. That continues to be a challenge. And this body has to take some initiative to correct that. We need to have the ability to clear areas before they burn. But even if we do, there will be fires. 
   I would hope for many of the people that hear us today and read the RECORD of today's Journal that they will recognize that some of the information that perhaps was put out was incorrect over the airwaves. Many people talked in terms of too many people too close to wilderness. 
   When the President visited Congressman Bilbray and my district, Rancho Bernardo, which is at the heart of our two districts, Rancho Bernardo is a suburban, ``Leave It to Beaver'' community. This is an area with an interstate on both sides of it. The fire went on both sides of a 10-lane interstate. It jumped it because 80-mile-an-hour winds will do that. We didn't create that in California; California had that when we arrived. 
   On the hilltops, firefighters were looking at just ordinary backyards, sometimes hillsides, but ordinary backyards of half-acre, acre lots, or less, and in fact trying to save the houses on them. 
   So, I would hope that people throughout the country, when they try to characterize what went on in California, would take an opportunity to meet with somebody from the districts in California, Congressman Filner, Congressman Bilbray, myself, and others, because we saw firsthand that firefighters had residential fires from 80-mile-an-hour-, 100-degree-driven firestorms.     
   Additionally, I would like to bring up something that may not often cross the awareness of the men and women around the country who know about this fire, and that is we not only executed in San Diego County all of the plays that were in the playbook, all of the things which were written on how to fight a fire well from Malibu to the Mexican border, but additionally we wrote some new chapters. 
   I am very proud that the United States Marines of Camp Pendleton and the Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar joined the fight for the first time beyond those who were part of the plan. We were able to mobilize, on any given day, as many as eight additional aircraft which had never been designated to fight fires off the base. They were made available due to the initiative of the Northern Command and of Major General Lehnert and others in the chain of command who said, We have the ability to fight fire. We fight them on our bases every day. We will bring those to bear. 
   With cooperation from the department called CAL FIRE in California and the Governor's office, that was made to happen in less than 48 hours. So when the book is written on the evacuation and on the fighting of the fire in Southern California, yes, it was devastating for over 5,000 families that lost homes, that lost commercial buildings, that lost trailers or that, in fact, lost their farms and ranches, but, in fact, this was a well-fought fire in which the people of San Diego came together to do the right thing. 
   I am very proud of the people of San Diego and all of Southern California. I am also very thankful for the United States Marine Corps and the other first responders who made such a difference in our time of need. I thank you for this resolution, and I support and encourage all those to vote for it.

   As a member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I have managed many bills for post offices, and in my 6 years I have not seen a more befitting naming of a post office. Because, in fact, it is this group of tireless workers for the Federal Government, often the butt of jokes, the postmasters and the postmen and postwomen, that make sure that our bills, our letters, our correspondence, and, yes, our junk mail, are delivered to us. 
   I think this is among the most appropriate pieces of legislation that I have had the opportunity to help manage. I urge the passage of this. I urge the people of this Congress to take note that we are, in fact, naming a post office after a postman this one time.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROGRAM IN CERTAIN DISTRICT COURTS TO ENCOURAGE ENHANCEMENT OF EXPERTISE IN PATENT CASES AMONG DISTRICT JUDGES -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, there are few things in this body that truly transcend party lines. The respect for the Constitution and our obligations under it clearly are the most important among them. 
   The Constitution makes it clear that inventors and authors and artisans are entitled to protection for a limited period of time under the Constitution. And yet, if it takes years to get through a patent case and only to have it reversed 30 to 40 percent of the time, much more often if it is a first-time case before a Federal judge, then justice is not only delayed but in some cases denied if you don't have the ability, after paying maybe $2 million, to pay another $2 million to go through the appeal process. Therefore, it is essential at the district court that the judges get it right the first time. 
   Under the Markman decision, a Federal judge must decide what the patent means. It is incredibly technical often to decide what 5,000 claims, sometimes looking thicker than the Bible and the Koran put together, really mean; and yet that is an obligation of the judge. Those obligations may be in the areas of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering. It could be chemical. It could be bio. It could be so technical as to require outside experts just to decipher some of the language. And yet we ask a Federal judge, most often the one who has just ascended to the bench, to take on these patent cases. This bill is designed to reduce the times in which the most complex cases get before the least prepared and sometimes even the least willing Federal judges. 
   It also is an example of something that has been used in other ways, but appropriate here: a theory that you must mend it, not end it. We have an obligation, and the Federal courts with us have an obligation, to deal with intellectual property properly because it is a right under the Constitution, and yet it is broken. My colleagues, Mr. Schiff as the cosponsor but, more broadly, Ranking Member Smith have been supportive. The now chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Berman, helped all along the way. Mr. Conyers has been supportive, both in the last Congress and this Congress, in getting this bill out; and Senator Leahy and Senator Feinstein are working on the Senate side for a counterpart. 
   This type of legislation is narrowly crafted but deals with the exact problems we are facing. Let me just give you one example, Mr. Speaker. Most Americans understand in the last Congress the RIM or BlackBerry case, a case in which for years the litigation continued on and we were dealing with over half a billion dollars of final damages. Reversal after reversal, decision and indecision. That shouldn't happen when we are dealing with billions of dollars. 
   This legislation seeks to spend only $5 million a year to check out the feasibility of what would probably be only $50 or $60 million in total a year to make our Federal courts able to deal with what turns out to be tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of commerce. 
   Therefore, I hope that because we pass this early and, I trust, unanimously once again, that we will be able to deal with the Senate, bring this to the President's desk, and begin working with the courts to implement it. 
   Last but not least, an unusual ``thank you.'' Justice Breyer was a major part of this discussion from the earliest stages, and as somebody who, while as a Senate staffer, was considered to be the father of the Fed circuit, his opinion that there needed to be a fix in the district court so as not to have to take from the district courts the very jurisdiction that we speak of here today, was crucial to the development of this bill. 
   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this bipartisan support.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 34, a bill to establish a pilot program in certain United States district courts to encourage enhancement of expertise in patent cases among district judges. Congressman ADAM SCHIFF and I have worked together on this legislation since the last Congress, and I am grateful for the chance to move this legislation forward today. 
   The high cost of patent litigation is widely publicized, and it is not unusual for a patent suit to cost each party over $10,000,000. Appeals from district courts to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit are frequent. This is caused, in part, by the general perception within the patent community that most district court judges are not sufficiently prepared to hear patent cases. I drafted this legislation in an attempt to decrease the cost of litigation by increasing the success of district court judges. 
   H.R. 34 establishes a pilot project within at least five district courts. Under the pilot, judges decide whether or not to opt into hearing patent cases. If a judge opts in, and a patent case is randomly assigned to that judge, that judge keeps the case. If a case is randomly assigned to a judge who has not opted into hearing patent cases, that judge has the choice of keeping that case or sending it to the group of judges who have opted in. To be a designated court, the court must have at least 10 authorized judges with at least 3 opting in. 
   The core intent of this pilot is to steer patent cases to judges that have the desire and aptitude to hear patent cases, while preserving random assignment as much as possible. Each of the test courts will be assigned a clerk with expertise in patent law or the scientific issues arising in patent cases, and funding is also allocated to better educate participating  judges in patent law. The pilot will last no longer than 10 years, and periodic studies will occur to determine the pilot project's success. 
   I am happy to say that H.R. 34 is supported by software, hardware, tech and electronics companies, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, district court judges, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, and the Intellectual Property Owners Association among others. 
   This legislation is a good first step toward improving the legal environment for the patent community in the United States. H.R. 34 should not, however, be taken as a replacement for broader patent reform. We still need to address substantive issues within patent law, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on that broader effort as well. 
   I thank Judiciary Committee Chairman JOHN CONYERS and Ranking Member LAMAR SMITH, as well as Intellectual Property Subcommittee Chairman HOWARD BERMAN and Subcommittee Ranking Member HOWARD COBLE for all of their efforts in moving this legislation. I also thank Committee staff David Whitney and Shanna Winters for their counsel during the development of H.R. 34. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 34.

Whether it is the Marbury v. Madison decision, or the dreaded Dred Scott decision, the Court has had to be prodded by the public, the Congress has had to be prodded by the public, and, yes, just as with Harry S. Truman, the President has had to be prodded by the public. No organization in American history has sustained the consistent legacy of being an effective prod to the government greater than the NAACP.

   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 414. It is an appropriate naming of a post office on behalf of a gentleman who for 96 years was a champion of statehood for Puerto Rico. 
   Puerto Rico is not just a territory, Puerto Rico is in fact the largest of all the territories, having a population that would give it at least four Members of Congress if it were to become a State. 
   Although he never succeeded in bringing statehood to Puerto Rico, he kept the hope alive and the belief alive by the Puerto Rican people that in fact they were Americans, and that as Americans one of their options would be statehood. 
   As a prominent businessman, he founded the Western Bank and was the owner of a very prominent newspaper in Puerto Rico. 
   He was born on November 17, 1902, and throughout his career he championed many activities beyond statehood. He was one of the founders of the New Progressive Party. He served in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives from 1932 to 1940, where he became the youngest Speaker and later was elected to the Senate. 
   We remember Mr. Mendez here today, and name this post office on behalf of him at the request of our Delegate from Puerto Rico, LUIS FORTU&#209;O, who unfortunately could not be here today, but who in fact found this to be the most appropriate person to name the post office after because of his long years of service to the territory of Puerto Rico and to the aspirations of the Puerto Rican people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H. Res. 122 which recognizes the tragic significance of Executive Order 9066 signed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to authorize the internment of Japanese Americans at the beginning of World  War II. The resolution also highlights the injustices forced on Italian Americans and German Americans during this same period. 
   In 1942, President Roosevelt authorized the Army to evacuate more than 100,000 Japanese Americans from the Pacific Coast States, including Washington, Oregon, and my home State, California, and also Arizona. This grossly blunderbuss approach to maintaining America's security serves, especially today, as a continuing reminder that the civil rights of American citizens should never be lost in the midst of the chaos of war, not even in a war on terror. 
   President Roosevelt authorized the mass expulsion and incarceration of Japanese Americans, and these are American citizens, by signing Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. A few minutes ago, I spoke about the prodding of this body, the prodding about the Presidency and the prodding of the courts. This ill-fated action unfortunately was supported by this body, the one on the other side of the Dome and, yes, the U.S. Supreme Court. Had any of us recognized our burden of freedom and democracy and taken it to heart, this could not and would not have happened. 
   The tragic misuse of this power was met with an equally powerful response, but unfortunately, it was too late. 
   In 1976, President Gerald Ford issued Proclamation 4417, in which he said, ``Learning from our mistakes is not pleasant, but as a great philosopher once admonished, we must do so if we want to avoid repeating them.'' We recently put to rest President Gerald Ford, but there was no action that Gerald Ford ever did as President more significant than this one. President Ford, in apologizing and taking back the misconduct perpetrated on American citizens so long ago, has set a high standard for it ever happening again. 
   Today, we have just those threats among us and amidst us, so I am happy to support this to join with the ACLU and all the other organizations that daily fight this and recognizing that this should never happen again. 
   Last but not least, we are joined with our colleague, the widow of Bob Matsui, and I might note that as a freshman it was Bob Matsui who was on the Democrat side speaking about this issue firsthand.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I would like to thank Congressman Honda. Mike and I came into this Congress together. We came in at a time of peace. We came in at a time in which remembering 59 years earlier the history of the Japanese internment was a little abstract and yet necessary. I think that it is no longer abstract, and I thank the gentleman from California, because Mr. Honda made it very clear that we have a clear and present danger in the same way. 
   It is easy to blame the Muslim community. It is easy to look at Arab Americans and say can we trust them. 
   I might point out something that is not in the body of the resolution but I know that Mr. Honda and I have talked about in the past. During the time in which we were incarcerating women and children and old men of Japanese ancestry, the young Japanese Americans were in Europe fighting and dying in record numbers, defending our country in the most decorated way of any unit of World War II. That is a separate remembrance but it cannot be separated from the fact that today Arabs and Muslims are fighting in the war on terror in Afghanistan, in Iraq and around the world.     
   They are in fact doing exactly the same thing. And I link the two because I believe that you don't respect history the way we are trying to today, if you don't link it to the present and the future, and you don't say we will learn from this terrible mistake. We can't undo what was done to the Japanese, Italian, and German Americans, but we can dedicate ourselves to ensure that this shall not happen again in this great Union.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, it is not good to talk process in the House of Representatives. I keep hearing that. But when the process that you are talking about is the execution of our right in a democratic society to speak and make a difference, then it is necessary to speak on process. 
   Mr. Speaker, this week we will spend 4 days on the Iraq resolution. I say ``the'' Iraq resolution because it has already been crafted by Speaker Pelosi; it already is a final product. The only thing left to do is in fact to vote on it because we will not be allowed to amend it; the rule will be a closed rule. Democracy and speech and debate will not in fact change anything. The final vote will be exactly at the end of the week where it was at the beginning. That is wrong. Republicans never did that when we held the Speaker's gavel. Democrats should not do that as they hold the Speaker's gavel. 
   The right to amend and the right to debate that leads to a better bill is a right of this democracy, and this body has been reduced by the taking of that right.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 109, recognizing the historical significance of the Pinedale Assembly Center, the reporting site for over 4,823 Americans of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly interned during World War II. 
   The Pinedale Assembly Center is located 8 miles north of downtown Fresno, California, on vacant land. It is a stark place, as was the policy that was supported by Executive Order 9066 signed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to authorize the tragic internment of Japanese Americans at the beginning of World War II. 
   The assembly center was encircled by a high chain-link fence, topped with three rows of barbed wire, and it caged American citizens whose only crime was their ancestry. Soldiers gave orders to citizens who should have been free; livelihoods were put on hold; uncertainty and fear punctuated each day. Thousands of law-abiding citizens who loved America and contributed to its strength had been trapped in endless rows of drab cell blocks. 
   The center serves as a symbol of America's stumbling. But our country has regained its footing. It has appropriately apologized for the tragic mistake of President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, and it is reaffirming its commitment, through this resolution before us today, to never forget its mistakes lest they be repeated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to speak in total support of the naming of this post office. 
   As a member of the committee, I thoroughly support the fact that we have not yet done enough to recognize some of the brave people from the past who created the government, the good parts of government that we take credit for every day. Certainly, I believe this is a good example. Not only was she, in fact, the person most responsible for recognizing the dangers of DDT and leading to the banning of it, but, quite frankly, Rachel Carson, in her novel ``Silent Spring,'' brought to the forefront the very concept of writing works which are widely read, and, in fact, can make a real difference in America's point of view.     
   Rachel Carson was born in 1907 in a rural area of Springdale, Pennsylvania, where she first acquired her interest in nature. Majoring in marine biology, with a strong background in creative writing, she graduated from Chatham College in 1929 magna cum laude. Despite financial difficulties, Ms. Carson continued her studies at Johns Hopkins University, graduating in 1932 with a graduate degree in zoology. While expanding her great passion about zoology and other living things, Carson taught at Johns Hopkins and at the University of Maryland while pursuing her doctorate degree. 
   Due to financial circumstances, Carson found a part-time position as a writer for radio scripts at the United States Bureau of Fisheries. She was faced with sexist resistance, not uncommon at that time, not uncommon at this time, as she took the civil service exam, but after obtaining a high score, she was given a full-time position as a junior aquatic biologist at the Bureau of Fisheries. At the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Ms. Carson submitted one of her radio scripts, named ``Undersea,'' to the Atlantic Monthly, which was published in 1937. Publishers, impressed with her writing, encouraged her to expand the article into book entitled Under the Sea-Wind. 
   Carson continued to write. Her second book, The Sea Around Us, was on the New York Times best seller list for 86 weeks and won the 1952 National Book Award and earned her two honorary doctorates. The book was then made into an Oscar-winning documentary. Her writing achievements did not end here, as she went on to publish a third and fourth book and write numerous magazine articles. 
   Ms. Carson's fourth and legendary book, Silent Spring, greatly influenced the way Americans thought about the environment and was discussed by President John F. Kennedy. One of the main themes of her novel was how all aspects of the environment were connected. She explained that when one uses a pesticide to exterminate a particular organism, the poison travels up the entire food chain, ultimately affecting large animals and humans. With the publication of Silent Spring, Carson was able to draw in reputable scientists in support of her cause of responsible DDT usage and help spread awareness of its impact on the environment. 
   Rachel Carson was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and received many honors, including the Audubon Medal and the Cullen Medal of the American Geographical Society, for her achievements. Unfortunately, poor health kept Ms. Carson from witnessing the ban on DDT in the United States, as she passed away in 1964. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 1980. 
   Carson's legacy lives on as the quiet and consistent voice urging people to  come to terms with nature. The major conference room at the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency is named the Rachel Carson Room. The Rachel Carson State Office Building is located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and is home to the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. There are also numerous bridges, parks, and schools which bear her name as well. 
   To further recognize and honor her contributions in the centennial celebration of her birth and to honor her life as a teacher, scientist, environmentalist, activist, and, most of all, writer, please join me in supporting and passing H.R. 1434. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I will be part of a group, House and Senate, that will be in Belgium this weekend where one of the major topics will be meeting with the Europeans on the next step in finding ways to limit or eliminate various pesticides, in addition to the constant effort to deal with ozone-depleting chemicals. 
   We are, today, as a result of her work, we are in fact smarter in the way we look at the chemicals that bring good things to life, as I think that we once said. We don't assume they are bad. We do test to make sure that what they do good for us is well measured against the side effects. That was a standard created as a result of Rachel Carson. We are honored to have had somebody who worked for the Federal Government, who published and who cared and who persevered throughout her entire life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Atanacio Marin, or as he was better known, Nacho, by his friends, typifies the soldiers that come from California. So many of them are from Los Angeles and surrounding areas, so many have stories like Nacho has: one in which he was born in Mexico; one in which his family came here for a better life; one in which he became integrated with the community that he grew up in; one in which he graduated from Sierra Vista High School and was on the track team and ran in the Los Angeles marathon; one in which he had a desire to serve his country; one in which he joined the National Guard after completing high school and decided to devote his life to serving the military. 
   After his tour with the National Guard ended, Nacho transferred to the regular Army and was assigned to Battery C, 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Hood, Texas. In January, 2 months before reporting for duty in the Middle East, Sergeant Marin was able to spend time with his close-knit family. While he was in Iraq he continued to remain close to his family. He called home often and characteristically sent his mother a Mother's Day card that read, ``Don't worry, be happy.'' Tragically, those uplifting words were some of his last. 
   A checkpoint was manned by the sergeant and came under fire on June 3, 2003. Unfortunately, this brave young man did not survive the attack. He was only 27 years old. 
   The post office we are naming today in Baldwin Park we are naming not just as a tribute to this fine soldier, but as a tribute to those who have gone to serve their country in this war and, like so many others, have an American story. 
   Nacho's American story is the story of California, it is a story of the war that is not often talked on this front, of patriotism, of devotion to family, of devotion to this Nation. And it is so appropriate that we name a post office after this fine young man from California. So I join with the majority in urging its swift passage.

   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I join with my colleague in supporting this naming of the Sergeant Dennis J. Flanagan Post Office. 
   Sergeant Flanagan grew up in Florida and attended high school there. He was active and enjoyed sports. He ran cross-country, played soccer, and was a cadet commander at the school's Civil Air Patrol squadron. He loved learning about American history and hoped that one day he would be a history professor. 
   His commitment to military service began at an early age. He was an active member of the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, or Junior ROTC, where he achieved the rank of first lieutenant during his junior year of high school. He began classes in Central Florida Community College, but enlisted in the Army a week after September 11. 
   Sergeant Flanagan was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He fought with the air assault infantry that led the initial attack in 2003. 
   Wise beyond his years, he understood that victory could not be attained without action. He knew the dangers of war and believed in serving his country. After completing his first tour of duty, he re-enlisted in September of 2005 for a second tour. As an experienced soldier, he hoped he could act as a mentor for new soldiers, and he wanted to train the Iraqi Army recruits. 
   On January 20, 2006, Sergeant Flanagan was on patrol in Iraq in his Humvee with three other U.S. soldiers and a driver when a roadside bomb, or an IED, was exploded near their vehicle. All soldiers were wearing protective body armor. However, only the driver survived the blast. Sergeant Flanagan was only 22 when he died. 
   Today we honor the life of Sergeant Flanagan, a soldier who strongly believed in the fight for freedom. He was an American hero. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask all Members to join with me in supporting this naming and this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. The fact that this is what one might consider Democrat time being yielded to a Republican probably says just how bipartisan this bill is. This has been worked on in a Republican majority and in a Democrat majority. It's been cosponsored by the chairman and the ranking members of the committees. It is, in fact, an unusual piece of work. 
   Additionally, this rule, and I've been voting against rules lately because they weren't open and fair. This rule accommodated virtually every amendment offered. In fact, many of the people speaking here today against the bill and against the rule didn't offer any amendments. 
   Whether you're on the committee or not, this is your opportunity, after nearly 4 years of this being an open process under leadership on both sides of the aisle, this is your opportunity, if you have solutions. 
   I urge the passage of this rule and the passage of the underlying bill because, in fact, it is the best work the best minds on both sides of the aisle could produce over 3 years. 
   Now, people who, in fact, are saying they don't want to vote for it are saying we just need more time. In fact, the engine that drives the economic wealth of our country cannot afford for us to simply let the men and women in black robes continue to try to patch a broken system, as the Supreme Court has done. Not moving in this Congress, and rapid pace could be another year, including the other body. Not moving in this Congress would force the Supreme Court to deal with an out-of-date set of laws. We need to vote this bipartisan bill through a very positive rule, and then to final passage. 
   I strongly recommend that people look at the fact that amendments were accepted by both sides of the aisle, and, as the chairman said, more were accepted by the Republicans, in addition to literally hundreds of suggestions being incorporated into the manager's amendment. 
   I move that we pass the rule, pass the underlying bill, continue a bipartisan process that, of course, will always have somebody who feels they're not benefited. But, in fact, you can't get this kind of support by people who do not normally work well together unless, in fact, this process has been full and fair, as it has been. I thank the ranking member and the chairman for their bipartisan work.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, for those who may be interested, some of my patents have expired and more will. 
   I am no longer a day-to-day inventor; but I will always have the soul of an inventor, the belief that in fact if you have an idea, you can go to the Patent Office and for a relative de minimis amount of money you can in fact protect that idea for a period of 20 years from the time you ask the Patent Office to protect your invention and give you an opportunity to make a small or not-so-small fortune off of it. 
   I don't think there is anyone in the Congress who owes their reason for being here to the success of patents more than myself. My company grew and thrived because we were able to protect our intellectual property, patents, copyrights and trademarks. So since I have been here as a non-attorney coming to the Congress and asking to be on the Judiciary Committee, a little bit like Sonny Bono, that is where the things he knew about were legislated. He knew about copyrights and songs; I know a little bit about patents, and a lot about the flaws in the system. 
   And, Mr. Chairman, there are many flaws in the system. This bill has been the best work by the best minds, both by Members of Congress, but also by staff, trade associations and industry, to bring out those mistakes and to try to find solutions. 
   Today you have heard a lot of anger and rancor about China. Nobody could want America to prosper more than I do. But, in fact, by next year more than half of all patents in the U.S. will be granted to non-U.S. companies. This is not a debate about protecting patents against foreigners. Foreigners are patenting in our country, and we invite that innovation. It has often led to prosperity in all aspects of America. 
   I include a long letter from UCSD CONNECT, an organization founded by Bill Otterson and the University of California at San Diego, in which they, along with California Healthcare Institute, BIOCOM, Gen-Probe, Invitrogen, Pfizer, Qualcomm and others who all say this is a good bill, but we have some additional areas we would like to find compromise on. Some of the things in this letter of yesterday are included in the manager's amendment. Some will be included in amendments that will be heard on the floor in a few minutes.

   September 5, 2007. Hon. Darrell Issa, Washington, DC. 
   Dear Representative Issa: We greatly appreciate the time you spent meeting with CONNECT last week to discuss the Patent Reform Act, H.R. 1908. Thank you for your efforts to improve the bill and, in particular, your ongoing work on the post-grant review provision. 
   Given the immediacy of the House floor consideration, this letter and ensuing draft language serves as a follow-up to our recent meeting. On behalf of the San Diego innovation community and CONNECT members, we request your continued leadership and strongly urge your consideration of the following improvements to the bill.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. 
   In short, this amendment simply seeks to maintain our historic and important American-only right for an inventor who was denied a patent to keep that patent a secret. 
   Additionally, it allows sufficient time in the process for a patent holder to know that his patent, his or her patent, either will or will not likely be granted significant claims. 
   For that reason, we struck a balance between the rest of the world that recognizes that patents are normally published after 18 months. We said, no, it will be the greater of the second office action, which can be anywhere from 3 to 5 years or 18 months, and we did so because we believe somebody should know when they receive significant claims or not before they are forced to decide whether or not to retain a trade secret. 
   It's an important issue; it's one that I believe will allow us a final and lasting way for a secret to be balanced with the interest to not have submarine patents and unknown information. 
   I yield to the chairman of the full committee.

   I guess as a machinist union worker and a mechanic, I'll get that out there so that I get my claim to union membership and to having gotten a lot of grease under fingernails, for Ms. Kaptur's understanding, because I think what she brought up is crucial, and full understanding is essential as to this amendment. 
   This amendment, if it takes 10 years to get a second office action, will give the inventor 10 years of no one else seeing it. It is an infinite period of time, subject to the 20-year expiration. It is, in fact, an infinite period of time. And as an inventor, I chose the second office action, even though small inventors had said the first office action was good enough, because I was aware that the first office action is most often a rejection over which you overcome most of the objections. The second rejection, if there is one, they usually accept some, and if they give you a rejection, you usually don't overcome them, and the venture community, if you've had a second rejection, tends to discount potential additional claims. So that's the reason I chose those because, in fact, it gives you unlimited time to pursue your patent up to and through a second and, usually, final rejection.

   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Chairman, I'll briefly explain the amendment. Almost every single agency of the Federal Government has rule-making authority. But, quite frankly, rules are, in fact, laws made by agencies. So when the Patent and Trademark Office repeatedly has asked us for rule-making authority, it has been a long process to figure out the best way to allow them to make rules but to retain our genuine constitutional obligation over the effects  of those laws. So, in doing so, what we did was we crafted a constitutional review. We're not allowed to veto these agencies, but we are allowed to overrule them. And in doing so, what we have decided to do is to allow any Member of the House or the Senate to bring a motion in opposition to any rule produced or proposed by the Patent and Trademark Office, and we will, in fact, within 60 days, hear that rule, that opposition and make a decision. This is designed specifically to stop any overreaching under this underlying bill from potentially causing things which we would not have legislated to, in fact, be legislated, while recognizing that we want the Patent and Trademark Office to have the ability to move swiftly and accurately to the conclusion of patents on behalf of our economy.

   Both of my amendments are intended to improve this bill. I don't stand before the Committee of the Whole to say that this bill will become perfect. As a matter of fact, in the general debate, I named companies like BIOCOM and GenProbe and Invitrogen, who are part of UCSD CONNECT, who have specific areas we are including in the material that they want continued work done on. They are, in fact, dissatisfied with the bill because it hasn't done everything it could do. But this amendment on rulemaking which would stop an arbitrary decision by the Patent Office on something it may want to do such as eliminate continuations, et cetera, is there for a reason. And I would hope that people who are going to perhaps oppose the bill as not yet good enough would recognize that it is crucial for this amendment to get into it if we are going to protect against arbitrary action by the Patent and Trademark Office.  
   And last but not least, Ms. Kaptur was kind enough to ask one more question during the previous amendment that couldn't be answered, and I just want to make it clear on the previous amendment, you will be able to keep your secret through an unlimited period of debate back and forth with the Patent Office up to two full rejections and then 90 days in which to close. And I would hope the gentlewoman would recognize that that is an improvement even if nothing is perfect.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6146, a bill to stifle the practice of libel tourism. 
   The right to free speech in the United States is of fundamental importance. It is arguably the cornerstone of our democracy and the hammer that keeps our government and its officials in check. 
   We must not take our right to free speech for granted, for our level of freedom is not honored in many countries around the world. China is an easy example of government-controlled speech, as demonstrated recently by the restrictions placed on the international press during the Olympic Games. But other countries are more of a surprise. 
   Our friend and ally, Great Britain, takes a much more liberal position on libel laws than the United States. They allow judgments against defendants that would not pass muster in our domestic courts, and for this reason many plaintiffs in libel suits involving American defendants seek redress in British courts. 
   For example, the book, ``Alms for Jihad'', written by a former State Department analyst and a University of California Santa Barbara professor, looked into the network of global finances aiding international terrorism. The book mentioned a Saudi billionaire as being involved at some level, a claim not without controversy, but also not without legitimate research by the authors. 
   The threat of lawsuit by the billionaire in the British courts alone caused Cambridge University Press to shred all unsold copies of ``Alms for Jihad'' in addition to asking libraries the world over to pull the book.  
   We cannot allow libel laws in other countries to censor the writings of American authors when laws within the United States find the writings legitimate. Doing so will erode our right to free speech in the United States, an outcome I believe we all find abhorrent. 
   I cosponsored H.R. 6146 with Congressman Steve Cohen to help eliminate this threat. The bill instructs courts within the United States not to enforce libel judgments of foreign courts unless the domestic court finds the judgment is consistent with the First Amendment. This is a fairly simple mechanism, but one that we expect to help control the threat of censorship arising from libel tourism. 
   Without the fear of foreign judgments against legitimate writings, American authors should feel safe continue to promote national and international discourse and debate.

But I come to the House floor knowing that in fact in a few short minutes, an hour or so, our Members will vote not knowing what is in this bill. Oh, they will hear us talking in unclassified terms about the fact that HUMINT, contrary to the last speaker, is being cut in absolute dollars. The eyes and ears of human beings is being cut in this bill. 
   Certainly, with inflation, other things are going up. But as everyone knows that has read the Iraq Study Report or the 9/11 report, it is the absence of the human resources that we have been investing in that led to our vulnerability on 9/11. And I will say that if the people on the other side of the aisle want to say we are losing this war, then they have to be willing to make a much greater commitment in the diplomatic and especially in the human resources and the above-sky resources that allow us to know what our enemy is thinking and planning before he attacks. 
   This bill doesn't do it. This bill does, as many of the speakers have said, deal with ``bugs and bunnies.'' Now, I happen to be an advocate for global warming research. I happen to believe that the Earth is warming, and I happen to believe that CO  
   2 is something we have to address. I serve on a committee that has overseen it, that has looked at it, that has costed it; and I will continue to do so. 
   But I am beyond words, furious, that with no new funding we are diverting resources from finding out what bad people want to do to us, to a vague, beyond vague, an open-ended statement of over the next 30 years what is global warming maybe going to do. 
   It is a worst case, all-possible-negatives study. It will cost ten or hundreds of millions of dollars to begin with. It will cause us to divert satellites to do the research. To be honest, the CIA doesn't just throw together a report, especially when it is this vague. 
   We urged in committee that in fact they put reasonable amendments to  this. We asked something simple: task them with the U.N.'s finding on global warming. Any committee, any group's finding. It is an open-ended go-study report. It is going to cost a lot of money, and it is going to cost American lives. 
   But last but not least, there are unconscionable earmarks in this bill which I three times participated and voted for going to closed session so the Members would understand that pork and ``unfounded'' earmarks are in this bill; that American lives will be lost because we divert needed moneys from the human resources we need to invest in to pork projects and special interests of Members of the majority.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT RECYCLED WATER SYSTEM PRESSURIZATION AND EXPANSION PROJECT -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, this bill is not new. In fact, this is the second go-around for it, but that doesn't make it any easier. This bill, like many in the last Congress, died in the Senate. 
   That's going to be different this time thanks to Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young. They considered this, reviewed to see if there were any significant changes, and quickly reported it out of committee. I want to thank them for working on a bipartisan basis to do that early on. 
   This is important to the people of Southern California. As the gentlelady, who will speak, hopefully, next, will tell you, California has water. Unfortunately, we don't capture enough, and it isn't where we need it and when we need it. 
   H.R. 30 is designed to bring some of that availability by significantly increasing our use of recycled water, both helping maintain the aquifer and providing safe, clean water for a multitude of uses for the people of Southern California. I urge the support of this bill, and I will not mention the other body again, except to say that I am looking forward to this early passage turning into an early signature by the President.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this hammered-out compromise bill. 
   You know, Madam Speaker, elections matter. The current balance in the House and the Senate played an important part in the administration, House Republicans, House Democrats, Senate Democrats, and Senate Republicans coming together and figuring out what was needed, what was constitutional, in a very much bipartisan fashion. 
   Unfortunately, there are those who want to have it both ways, those who will talk about how this is balanced, it meets the needs of the administration, as the administration is assuring us, and it meets all of the constitutional requirements. But there are those who want to also play to the other side. While making sure that we are protected by a good piece of legislation, there are those who will come on the floor and denounce this and then vote against it. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask the American people to look long and hard at how people vote on this. This is in fact worked out to assure the American people, and properly so, that we will protect all of their constitutional rights while doing everything we can to ensure their safety. 
   This is good legislation worked out over a long period of time, and a lot of thoughtful work went into it on both sides. But I ask the American people to hold accountable those who would want to know that the American people are protected, and then vote against it in order to play to special interests. 
   Madam Speaker, that is the bad part of what will happen today. The good part is that America will be safer and the Constitution will be secure because of what we are doing here today. I thank you and urge support.

   Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, in just 1 minute it's impossible to assure the American people of everything this bill will do. But I would like too, if you will, react to something that was said on the other side that just simply isn't true. 
   Yes, during J. Edgar Hoover's day, there was warrantless surveillance, even on political enemies of the people who were President at the time. Those days are behind us. 
   This act, long since we've taken care of domestic wiretap, but this goes one step further. It insures Americans and  particularly, I think, Arab Americans like myself who might go back and forth between here or have relatives in the Middle East, that their conversations will not be the subject of warrantless wiretaps, that, in fact, they can be very confident that America is going to observe the Constitution for them, both when they are here and if they are visiting abroad. 
   So it's not easy to undo some of the statements that talk about the past, but the truth is, this will protect what has already been established for Americans here.

<DOCNO>Mr. ISSA. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise with great concern about what the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 1 does, but I am more troubled by what this report has left undone. 
   The purported goal of H.R. 1/S. 4 was to implement all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Report. This conference report does not do that. Specifically, this report remains silent on one of the 9/11 Commission's vital recommendations concerning reform of congressional oversight of intelligence. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, the 9/11 Commission Report recommended that Congress should either form a joint House and Senate Committee on Intelligence or that the House and Senate should consolidate their authorizing and appropriating functions for the intelligence community into one committee in each chamber. To this end, I drafted language to offer during the conference on this bill. But, from introduction to floor consideration, under a closed rule, H.R. 1 did not follow regular order. Likewise, the conference was closed to amendment and debate on all but a few provisions, congressional oversight of intelligence not being one of them. 
   My motion would have included language in the conference report to establish a commission to study the congressional oversight of intelligence. The proposed commission would have examined the impact of the current system of congressional oversight on the intelligence community and specifically addressed at what cost to our national security is the decision not to heed the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. 
   Unfortunately, I was blocked by the majority from offering my amendment. In fact, the majority refused to hear any proposals on intelligence oversight during the conference. The omission of any discussions regarding the 9/11 Commission's recommendations on this matter is troubling and has led to an incomplete piece of legislation that will leave America less secure. As such, this report, and our work as a Congress, is left unfinished.
