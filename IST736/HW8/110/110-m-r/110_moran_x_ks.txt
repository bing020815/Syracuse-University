<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (RECOGNIZING THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS' 40TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1279 to recognize and congratulate Special Olympics for 40 years of extraordinary service to individuals with intellectual disabilities. 
   Beyond giving 2.5 million athletes a chance to compete, it gives their families a way to involve their sons, daughters, brothers and sisters. A chance for them to cheer. A chance to coach. A chance to connect in a special way. A chance to see their family member be accepted and respected in their communities. 
   After 40 years, there are now millions of stories of courage in the Special Olympics, but one athlete who has taken the oath and that embodies this year's theme is LP Esquibel from Dodge City, Kansas. He is more than a fan of courage. He is courageous and because of his courage he was awarded the Most Inspirational Athlete award at the Summer Games this year. Cerebral Palsy kept him from walking until he was 5 years old, but it hasn't kept him from becoming a 13-year veteran of the Special Olympics. It also hasn't kept a smile from his face. From all accounts, LP is more than a great athlete in his events of basketball, shot put, and the 100-yard walk, he is an encouragement to his fellow teammates and helps them on the court. 
   It is stories like LP's that has sold me on the power and benefits of the Special Olympics. Since 2007, I have served as the Honorary Chairman for the Kansas Law Enforcement Torch Run. The Torch Run covers hundreds of miles throughout Kansas and raises thousands of dollars in support of Special Olympics programs. This year-round fundraiser and awareness initiative was implemented by former Wichita Police Chief Richard LaMunyon in 1981. It became an international event 3 years later in 1984 when Chief LaMunyon presented it to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. The Law Enforcement Torch Run is now the largest grass-roots fundraiser and public awareness vehicle for Special Olympics around the world.  
   It was an honor to help raise money this past summer to help send Kansas athletes to compete in China at the World Olympics. I enjoyed meeting them and hearing of their success. 
   Special Olympics does remarkable work, both in the State of Kansas and across the globe. I would like to commend the leaders and volunteers of Special Olympics for 40 years of outstanding service and wish them continued success in the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express a serious concern with H.R. 6604. With the demand of rising energy costs, we're bringing to the floor a bill that will, in my opinion, do little to bring down the price of energy. In fact, certain provisions of this bill may lead to an increase in prices and may reduce market transparency and increase market volatility. 
   I want to be clear. I favor changes at the CFTC and believe we can change the act to improve market transparency, oversight, and enforcement activities. I have been working with CFTC and market participants to create a bill that will enhance those functions while giving regulators the necessary tools to prevent market manipulation and fraud. This bill, however, was put together, in my opinion, too quickly and goes too far. 
   When changing the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress must proceed in a deliberate manner and take into account the advice of industry users, the CFTC, the President's Working Group, and other experts. This bill should be referred back to the Committee on Agriculture so that we can refine provisions to actually enhance transparency and not exclude legitimate market participants. 
   One of the problems of this legislation is that it will likely reduce market transparency. This is because of certain provisions like the one dealing with the Foreign Board of Trade that seek direct access to U.S. and provisions that require reporting for certain over-the-counter and exempt commercial markets. That will push traders to foreign markets. Rather than giving the CFTC a better picture of the market, it will reduce the picture that the CFTC has and potentially increase fraud and manipulation. It restricts the CFTC's ability to see the market. 
   Second, this bill attempts to define a ``bona fide hedging transaction.'' In its current form, section 8 will exclude legitimate commercial market participants from properly hedging risk. This will cause an immediate disruption in the markets as the legitimate market participants are forced out. It will reduce market liquidity and increase price volatility. 
   I am also concerned with provisions in this bill that require routine reporting and potential use of position limits in over-the-counter transactions that are fungible. ``Fungible'' is not defined and suggests that a significant amount of OTC transactions could be implicated by this section. I am especially concerned about the authority given in section 14 to CFTC to impose position limits on OTC trades. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, not only should this bill be returned to committee because of these provisions so that we can take more time and develop a better product, I also recognize that this bill needs to address the root problem of high energy prices, and this will not do so.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (RURAL VETERANS ACCESS TO CARE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, as many in this House of Representatives know, I represent one of the largest congressional districts in this country of over 53,000 square miles. The district is about the size of the State of Illinois. It is bigger than 25 of 26 States east of the Mississippi River. It has more hospitals than any other congressional district, but it has no Veterans Administration Hospital. 
   Some veterans in my rural district have experienced great difficulty in traveling to distant VA health facilities to access care. Though we have been successful in opening several VA outpatient clinics in the First Congressional District, access to care remains a real challenge for veterans living in rural Kansas. 
   I would like to share a couple of stories from Kansans who have written me recently. I received the following letter from the wife of a World War II veteran: ``My husband and I have been residents of a long-term care facility for 2 years, and he is unable to travel 65 miles to take a physical at the Hays Kansas VA clinic, as is required by the VA to receive prescription benefits. They have stopped filling his prescription medicine. Veterans like Ralph gave several years of their lives for our country, and I feel it is a very ungrateful way to treat them.'' 
   The second case involves an elderly veteran from Hoxie, Kansas, who is in need of a pair of glasses. This veteran was told he must travel over 4 hours to the Wichita VA Hospital to get a new pair of glasses, a distance of about 260 miles, and it doesn't make sense to him because his community's optometrist is just across the street. 
   No, it doesn't make sense to any of us. Lack of access to VA care is a problem felt around the country by veterans living in rural America. Veterans who live in rural America are one in five of the veterans enrolled in the health care system. Rural veterans face unique challenges like long drives to VA facilities, bad weather, and lack of specialists. Limited access to VA care too often means rural veterans simply forgo the care and treatment they need. Studies have found that rural veterans are in poorer health than their urban counterparts. A policy change is needed. It isn't right to penalize some veterans because of where they live. It is time to provide these veterans the health care benefits they have earned and that have been promised to them. 
   I have introduced the Rural Veterans Access to Care Act with the goal of ending these disparities in access. This legislation requires the VA to contract with qualified outside health providers to give our most underserved veterans more options to receive care. Rather than traveling long distances to reach VA facilities or deciding not to make the trip at all, these veterans would be given the choice to receive care closer to home at their local hospital or their community clinic or their local physician's office. Additionally, the VA would be required to fill prescriptions written by outside doctors to eligible veterans. 
   To meet the needs of highly rural veterans, the VA would contract and partner with community physicians as well as local hospitals, community health centers, and rural health clinics. These providers already supply high-quality care to America's rural population, and yet their services are denied to America's veterans. 
   Since our Nation's founding, rural communities have always responded to the Nation's call. Today, 44 percent of our country's military recruits come from rural America. When these rural soldiers return home from war, our Nation must be prepared to care for them. Let's take advantage of the successes of existing rural health infrastructure in order to meet the unmet needs of America's rural veterans. 
   For our elderly World War II veterans, our young soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and those who served in all of the conflicts in between, this is a commonsense and life-saving approach that our Nation owes its rural veterans.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, in contrast to my colleagues on the committee and subcommittee, in opposition to H.R. 6604. It is an awkward position to be in because I spend more time and have a greater closer working relationship with the three members of the House of Representatives who are here today speaking from the Agriculture Committee in favor of this legislation than probably any group of Members of Congress since I came to Congress. 
   But I rise today in opposition to this legislation for the same reason that I did nearly a month and a half ago. This bill will do little, if anything, to bring down the price of energy. In fact, certain provisions of this bill could likely lead to less market transparency and increased market volatility. Unlike one and a half months ago, however, Congress has some data provided by the CFTC. The data shows that the commodity markets were not broken, and while crude oil went from $96 per barrel to $146 per barrel over the first 6 months of this year, the aggregate long position of index traders and swap dealers fell by 11 percent or 45,000 contracts. 
   As I stated back in July, I favor changes in the Commodities Exchange Act that will improve market transparency, oversight and enforcement activities. In fact, in working with the CFTC and others, I have introduced legislation, H.R. 6921, that I believe will enhance transparency in the futures markets without disrupting the markets. Based on consensus recommendations of the CFTC, the bill that I have introduced codifies the recommendations of the commission that they suggested would benefit from codification that were presented to our committee. That hearing has been referenced. It just occurred on September 11. 
   What my bill does not do and what this bill does, this bill on the House floor, is redefine a bona fide hedging transaction to prohibit the ability of legitimate market participants from utilizing the market, push domestic traders overseas where CFTC will have little oversight and contains cumbersome and contradictory requirements that will overburden the CFTC staff and lead to little useful information. 
   In July I said this bill was put together quickly, in fact I thought too quickly and went too far. The information provided by the CFTC at our hearing on September 11 in my opinion confirmed that fact. Given that this bill was defeated on suspension and it includes provisions that go beyond the scope of the commission's recommendations, one would think that we would now take that bill back to committee and craft a more precise product rather than bringing the same product to the House floor. We asked for more information, we got more information, and yet the crux of this legislation didn't change. 
   A well-crafted bill needs to provide additional transparency, oversight authority, and not exclude legitimate market participants or reduce market liquidity. One of the problems of this legislation, as I said, is it will reduce market transparency. This is because certain provisions, like the provision dealing with the foreign boards of trade that seek direct access to U.S. markets, will push traders to foreign markets. Rather than giving the CFTC a better picture of markets to prevent fraud and manipulation, it will actually restrict the ability of the CFTC to see that market. 
   In addition, the bill errantly attempts to define a ``bona fide hedging transaction.'' In its current form, section 8 will exclude legitimate commercial market participants from properly hedging risk. This will cause immediate disruption of the markets as the legitimate market participants are forced out of the market. It will reduce market liquidity and increase price volatility. 
   I am also concerned with provisions in this bill that require routine reporting and potential use of position limits in over-the-counter transactions that are ``fungible.'' ``Fungible'' is not defined and suggests that a significant amount of CFTC transactions would be implicated by this section. 
   I am especially concerned about the authority of section 14 which gives the CFTC the opportunity to impose position limits on over-the-counter trades. This is a problem because the OTC trades are nonstandardized contracts. Unlike standardized contracts traded on designated contract markets, OTC trades are often tailored to manage a specific company's risk in a market. And unlike a contract traded on a designated contract market, an OTC trade is made with a single counterparty. On a designated contract market, unlike many OTC trades, a clearinghouse is the counterparty to every contract and can facilitate liquidation of a position. In an OTC trade, if one party is in violation of a position limit and the other is not, liquidation of a position will adversely affect the party that is in compliance, again causing greater market volatility and increased cash prices of a commodity because of a disruption in commercial market participant's risk management strategy. 
   I think this bill has some technical problems that will harm price discovery and risk management strategies. It should be returned to committee where we address, again, the root cause of high energy prices. 
   The goal must be to do no harm, but this goal is not met in this legislation.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, as I indicated in my earlier comments here on the House floor concerning this legislation, I think our goal has been to make certain that we do no harm, and I have concerns that we will do harm with the legislation that's before us. And by harm, I don't mean harm to the industry, not speculators, not swap dealers, but harm to the consumers, harm to the American people, harm to the United States economy. 
   One of those concerns we have is concern with those who have invested their retirement in pension funds. And so this motion to recommit simply is a requirement that CFTC, before they impose those position limitations, would make certain, would certify that the imposition of those payment limitations would not reduce the value of a person's pension fund. 
   The effort here is to make certain that no harm is caused, a goal I'm sure we all share, and in particular, make certain that we know what we are doing does not damage the value of the American people's retirement accounts. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, again, I would ask the House of Representatives to approve our motion to recommit. 
   Again, as the gentleman from Virginia says, we believe there's a better policy that hasn't even been debated upon the House floor in dealing with energy prices than the bill that's before us today. That's the American Energy Act. We wish that motion could be made in order today so that we could have a clear debate and vote upon the issue that is compelling to the American people and damaging to the United States economy. 
   In lieu of that, we would ask that we take this additional step to make certain no unintended consequences occur and we protect the retirement accounts, the pension accounts of Americans. 
   I yield back my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for yielding time, and I thank the Speaker this evening for recognizing me. 
   Mr. Speaker, 20 minutes can go by in a flash; 2 minutes seems like an eternity. Last Friday night, Greensburg, Kansas, was struck by a devastating tornado. With 20 minutes' warning, I am sure the people of Greensburg did everything possible to protect their homes, their lives, to gather their loved ones, to find the basement, to seek the shelter. Twenty minutes is an awfully short period of time to try to save your life. 
   Two minutes, the time that it takes for the tornado 1 1/2 miles wide, winds blowing 207 miles an hour, 2 minutes it takes to destroy a community. 
   The losses last Friday night in Greensburg, Kansas, are significant. The photograph I have with me demonstrates the look of a town, a county seat town of Kiowa County, Kansas, population about 1,500. In many ways, a typical Kansas community; in many ways, a typical small town in rural America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been in Greensburg, Kansas, for the last 3 days. And perhaps what I see is typical, but what I see is heroics. From the moment the tornado struck, the people of Greensburg arose to the occasion, and every moment since then, their lives have been devoted toward making certain that people are okay, seeking recovery of their loved ones and their property, and trying to make certain that everyone is found and that life is preserved. 
   Mr. Speaker, 2 minutes did a lot of damage to a community; and yet in every conversation I had with the citizens of Greensburg, ultimately at least a small smile would come upon their face because they were able to count the blessings that they had despite the tornado. They were able to talk about the next opportunity they have to rebuild their lives, the people's whose lives were saved, the people whose lives are here today. 
   Mr. Speaker, this community has lost its entire housing structure. I walked through Greensburg for about 45 minutes on Saturday, a town that I represented as a State senator and now as a Member of Congress, and I found one home in that 45 minutes that I thought would be habitable.     
   The downtown business district is gone. You know, especially, Mr. Speaker, how difficult it is to preserve and enhance a business district in rural communities. 
   This is a community that has a business district maybe of six or seven  blocks, both sides of the street. But every business destroyed. Gone is the city hall. Gone is the high school. Gone is the grade school. Gone is the hospital. Gone is the library. 
   This community faces many challenges, Mr. Speaker. But in each and every instance, not only have the citizens of that community arose to the occasion, not only have the citizens of that community done everything they could to save lives and protect property; but now already they talk of, how do we rebuild our hometown? 
   I spent a little time with the national media who are covering this story in Greensburg, Kansas, and my guess is Greensburg, Kansas, is probably a foreign country to many of them. And their question is, as they look across the rubble that's demonstrated in this photograph is, Congressman, can you really believe that this community has a future; that they will be around 2 years from now, 5 years from now, a decade from now? And the answer is yes. 
   I don't know a lot about lots of other communities in the country. But I know about the people of Greensburg, Kansas, and they will make every effort to see that their community survives and prospers, and that their children and grandchildren have a future there. You know, there's a special place we all call, it's called home. And everybody wants to live where it's home. And so, as the folks of Greensburg try to pick up their lives, rebuild their homes, re-establish the businesses, recreate a community, they just want Greensburg to be home again. 
   And so tonight I rise to commend them for their spirit, acknowledge their bravery, speak about their compassion and love for their friends and family and neighbors. And I especially want to talk about the city officials, the mayor, Lonnie McCollum, the city manager, Steve Hewett. 
   Perhaps people don't realize that the people who are there today trying to restore the electricity, the water, the sewer, the telephone service, the power, they, too, lost everything. So as the city officials have gone back to work trying to restore the basic needs of a community, they face the challenges of not having a home, vehicles destroyed, families living outside the community. 
   And Mr. Speaker, in addition to the city officials and the people of Greensburg, the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Heart to Heart, church groups, hundreds and thousands of people across the country on Sunday said their prayers for the people of Greensburg, Kansas. Offering plates were passed. The community of Haviland, a small town much smaller than the community of Greensburg, 15 miles down the road, the grocery store open on Sunday. I was there. I watched as the owner of the grocery store, no small task to keep a grocery store in Haviland, Kansas, alive and well, but I watched as customers placed groceries on the counter. And the grocery store owner said, where are you from? And the answer was, Greensburg. No charge. 
   That's the community that people call home in Kansas and many places across the country. And it's that effort that we are seeing today in which people come to the aid and rescue of their friends and neighbors and people they don't even know to make certain that good happens in a very difficult and challenging time. 
   And we are pleased with the National Guard. We are pleased with the services we have with surrounding communities and their law enforcement, emergency preparedness. And FEMA has arrived on the spot almost from day one, almost from the first moment the tornado struck. 
   I just got off the phone with the National Weather Service in Dodge City, Kansas. 20 minutes is not very long. But that 20 minutes, because of the efforts of the folks forecasting the weather that night, saved lives. 
   And I would ask that Kansans and Americans tonight again say their prayers for the people of Greensburg, that they recognize that we in America, no matter where the challenge or difficulty lies, we are in it together. And I would ask that, throughout the course of time, that the contributions be collected, the efforts be made to restore the community and that all Americans share in that process. 
   The people of Greensburg ought to be reassured that we, in Congress, we, as the Federal Government, will do everything within our power to assist them in their efforts. We want to reassure them that the future is theirs, and we're here to help. 
   And the role that we play as a Federal Government, the role that all the agencies who have arrived to provide assistance is important. But the reality is that Greensburg, Kansas, has a future because the people who call Greensburg home want to ensure that future comes tomorrow, next year and for another generation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to pay tribute to a community back home.

   Again, I express my appreciation to my colleagues for their support. I remind the folks of Greensburg, Kansas, that we'll be an ally. I thank those who have worked so hard to this point to see that there is an opportunity for a future.  
   And tonight I especially say my prayers for the family members of those whose families lost their lives. Ten people died in the tornado on Friday night. 
   Life is a very precious thing, and we offer our prayers. We seek the support of all as we try to rebuild Greensburg, Kansas. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding to me. 
   I, like the gentlemen are from Texas, am here in a state of disappointment. But mine is the reverse. A provision that was included in the Senate is not included in the House version of this bill. It is a piece of legislation that I introduced earlier this session and one that was offered as an amendment when this bill was considered by the House Ways and Means Committee, and it failed on a party-line vote. This provision, as I say, is included in the Senate bill, but it was removed when it was returned to the House, and it received unanimous approval by the Senate. 
   This is a commonsense clarification to the Tax Code to prevent lower income military personnel from being discriminated against when applying to live in affordable housing built under the low income housing tax credit. Our Nation's military families deserve access to safe, decent, affordable housing, and they should be given a fair opportunity to qualify for it. 
   This provision would clarify that members of the military will not have their military housing allowance counted against them as income when applying for affordable rental housing. The IRS does not consider military housing allowance as income, but, unfortunately, the Department of Housing and Urban Development does. The result is that some servicemembers, particularly enlisted ones, are considered to earn too much and are, thus, disqualified from living in affordable housing. Comparatively low-income civilians will qualify because they are treated differently by the IRS. 
   This clarification is needed now more than ever. A number of military installations across the country are experiencing housing shortages as a result the 2005 BRAC. For example, Fort Riley, an Army post located in the State of Kansas, is nearly doubling in size and will see an influx of nearly 30,000 people. Without access to adequate affordable housing opportunities, many families stationed at Fort Riley are being forced to live far away from post.     
   The House acted this year to exempt military housing allowance from income eligibility requirements under Head Start. Unfortunately, this discrimination persists when military families apply to live in affordable housing, and enlisted servicemembers and their families continue to be treated unfairly in communities across the country. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I support this legislation, I again am here to object to the exclusion of language that would level the playing field for our military enlisted men. I have introduced legislation to correct this issue; and should it not be resolved in this legislation, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1481.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, pharmacies play a critical role in delivering health care in America. Local pharmacists are the first line of defense in recognizing health problems and providing medical advice. Unfortunately, it is becoming more and more difficult to find and retain pharmacists who will practice in rural areas. With the impending retirement of the baby boomer generation, this problem only becomes worse. It is estimated that over the next 20 years, there will be a shortage of 150,000 or more pharmacists nationwide. 
   We are already experiencing this problem in Kansas. Seven counties in our State do not even have one single pharmacist; and 30 other counties have only one pharmacist in the county. 
   During my time in Congress, I have advocated for community pharmacies, and I currently co-chair the Congressional Community Pharmacy Caucus. 
   I was pleased that this week the House chose to address several important issues related to the issue of pharmacists in H.R. 6331, the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Provider  Act. This legislation includes provisions that community pharmacists from across my State have been tirelessly advocating for and that are important to keeping them in business. 
   The Congressional Community Pharmacy Caucus worked hard to get these necessary fixes included in this legislation, and I am gratified that they were included in H.R. 6331. These provisions are included in bills that I have sponsored, and they include prompt pay. The bill requires pharmacies to be reimbursed within 14 days if clean claims are submitted electronically and 30 days if submitted in other ways. 
   The AMP delay, this is the average manufacturer's price, the bill delays the implementation of the provisions creating the average manufactured price that was developed by CMS and which in my opinion is a terribly flawed system. The bill delays the implementation of the AMP system until after September 30, 2009. 
   Finally, the bill suspends the competitive bidding requirements in the durable medical equipment program for 1 year as well, as well as exempting diabetes test supplies from being subjected to the competitive bidding process. 
   It is important to the health of Americans and certainly to the health of rural Kansans that the Senate promptly adopt this legislation. 
   Also this week, it was my pleasure to participate in a ceremonial signing of the Kansas legislation that will allocate $20 million in funding to help the University of Kansas School of Pharmacy increase the school's ability to conduct more pharmaceutical research and expand the size of the entering class at the school. Under this proposal, nearly 200 students would be able to enter the program through a satellite campus in Wichita in a new building being built on the main campus in Lawrence. 
   The University of Kansas has a strong reputation for retaining graduates within our State. Sixty-three percent of KU pharmacy graduates live and work in Kansas. Increasing the educational capacity will give students an opportunity to learn, and will help address pharmaceutical shortages in our State. 
   I would like to commend the leadership of the university, especially the dean of the School of Pharmacy, Ken Andus; Executive Vice Chancellor Barbara Atkinson; Provost Richard Lavalare; and Chancellor Robert Hemenway. I would also like to thank the legislature of our State for seeing the importance of this expansion. 
   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to commend the investment in this worthwhile project, and I ask that Congress continue to do its part to see that pharmacies remain an important component of delivering health care across America.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (ENERGY MARKETS EMERGENCY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Goodlatte for yielding me time to speak in support of a bill that has been developed in part by the House Agriculture Committee. I am glad to see that this issue, the issue of speculation in the futures industry, is being handled by the committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Agriculture. I think it is important for us to continue our long-standing effort at oversight at CFTC and the futures industry that the Agriculture Committee has had now for many years. 
   This is an important issue. In fact, I don't think there is a more important issue that this Congress will face except for energy prices. It is a significant conversation, as we all know, and with dramatic consequences upon our constituents. 
   An e-mail from one of my constituents in Olpe, Kansas, ``What will it take to get beyond partisan politics and the blame game? Society expects children to get along, work together, but they have lousy role models when it comes to government. Many of us are losing hope of Congress ever getting beyond bickering--and in the meantime, our country's problems get worse and worse. It seems that most of our government officials are insulated from the reality that face middle and lower-income families day after day,'' talking about the cost of energy, the prices that Americans are encountering at the pump. 
   What concerns me, despite my support for this and a belief that CFTC ought to have every tool to discover manipulation, ought to have every tool to discover whatever ``excessive speculation'' means, and we ought to make certain that their enforcement capabilities are strong and beneficial on behalf of the consumer in this country, what concerns me most is that this issue has become the opportunity to do nothing on the underlying cause of why oil and gas prices are so high. And that is increasing demands at a time when we are doing little to increase supply. 
   And this Congress, we pass legislation dealing with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, requiring that our government no longer fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.     
   Whether or not that's a good idea or bad idea, I think all of us would admit it's not going to solve our energy problem. We debated and passed legislation dealing with antitrust and OPEC, and whether that's a good idea or a bad idea, all of us would agree it's not going to solve the problem with the price of energy and the cost at the pump. 
   And today we're on the House floor talking about speculation. I agree with the gentleman from Virginia. It is time for this Congress to get to this underlying issue that we face in this country: increasing demand for energy and a lack of increase in the supply. The laws of supply and demand work. As much as we Members of Congress might want to pass a law to overcome supply and demand, it cannot be done. And so this Congress needs to adequately express the laws of supply and demand that this country needs.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHY AND PLEDGING SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS OF SEVERE FLOODING IN EASTERN KANSAS -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding me the time, and I am here to lend my support for the gentleman from Kansas' efforts in regard to once again disaster striking our State. 
   We come from a State, Mr. Tiahrt and I and the rest of the Members of the Kansas congressional delegation, that really has known tough times over a long history. But especially within the last few months, really within the last year, Kansas has had winter storms that involved hail and freezing rain, ice, snow, as well as tornados. Greensburg, Kansas, became a national location, known by people around the world for a tornado that destroyed an entire town, and now most recently a large portion of our State has been struck by tremendous rainfall resulting in flooding. 
   I appreciate the gentleman from Kansas' (Mr. Tiahrt) leadership in bringing attention to this plight that we face in our State. 
   In fact, there are 69 counties in the First Congressional District. All but four of them have been declared natural disaster areas this year, since January 1 by the President, and FEMA and other emergency responders are at work. 
   The encouraging thing about our State is that local folks respond, and we've seen tremendous efforts by individual citizens from across the State arriving to help their neighbors, and we've seen the collection plates passed on Sunday morning, money being raised, response being had, and we've had tremendous support from our law enforcement community, from our emergency preparedness officials, as well as State and Federal officials. In many instances, I would report that FEMA has responded in a very noble and adequate way, and we're very grateful for that help. 
   Again, all the disaster has caused many Members of Congress to stop and talk to us from Kansas and wish us well. We've had encouragement and support from leaders around the world, in fact, due to the tremendous natural disasters that have occurred. 
   And so I'm here to express my support for Mr. Tiahrt's efforts and let him know that we all care about the portion of the State that has now been affected by these floods and will work closely with him, following his leadership to see that the response is appropriate from the Federal Government and that Kansans once again rebound from this significant natural disaster. 
   I, too, would like to commend Coffeyville Resources for their response. It's caused significant losses within the community of Coffeyville. It's also had a consequence upon all Kansans. It's one of our three refineries, and so gas and diesel prices have been affected as a result of the closing, at least temporarily, of a refinery in our State. But their responses, both in getting back into business and their response to being a good corporate citizen within the community of Coffeyville, should be recognized. 
   And finally, I thank the support we have had from my colleagues here in the United States House of Representatives. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (HEROES EARNINGS ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for yielding me his time. 
   I am here to commend the Ways and Mean Committee's efforts to make the Tax Code more equitable to our servicemembers. However, once again, I am on the floor to express my disappointment that the bill does not include an important provision providing more affordable housing opportunities for our servicemembers and their families. 
   This fix to the Tax Code that is missing from this legislation would prevent lower income military personnel from being discriminated against when applying for affordable housing built under the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program. There is a strong need for the tax bill that we are considering today, but the Senate will not approve it without this additional provision. 
   A number of military installations across the country are experiencing housing shortages as a result of the 2005 BRAC.     
   Fort Riley, an Army post located in the State of Kansas, is nearly doubling its size with an influx of 30,000 soldiers, family members and civilian workers. 
   When these new soldiers live outside the fort, they receive a military housing allowance for the use in paying rent. Though the Tax Code does not treat this housing allowance as taxable income, it is considered income when determining a military family's eligibility to live in facilities financed by low-income housing tax credits. The result is that many servicemembers, particularly our enlisted ones, are considered to earn too much income and thus are disqualified from accessing this affordable housing program. However, comparative low-income civilians receiving section 8 housing vouchers are more likely to qualify for this same housing. This is because, unlike the military housing subsidy, the Tax Code exempts section 8 assistance from being considered income. 
   Our Nation's military families deserve access to safe, decent, affordable housing, and they should be given a fair opportunity to qualify for it. Last December the Senate acted to fix this inequality, and the Senate included in their version of this legislation a provision exempting military housing allowance from income eligibility requirements when qualifying for affordable housing.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Under this Senate provision, the Governor of each State would be allowed to make this exemption if he or she determines that it is needed for a certain military installation within that State. This Senate provision is patterned after USDA's WIC nutrition programs for women, children and infants, and provides State agencies a similar option for WIC eligibility. Unfortunately, the House majority's refusal to include this provision has stalled this important tax legislation from moving forward. 
   The men and women serving our Nation are waiting for us to act, and I hope that the changes made by the Senate, which narrow the scope of the provision, will address many of the majority's concerns and a compromise can be reached. Until then, military families who are applying to live in affordable housing continue to encounter this discrimination. 
   While I will vote for H.R. 6081, our military men and women deserve a better shot at affordable housing.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Hare for his leadership on passage of this bill and my colleagues and staff on the House Veterans Affairs Committee for their support. I joined Congressman Hare as an original cosponsor of H.R. 2790. This bill creates a full-time Director of PA Services within the Department of Veterans Affairs. This legislation is beneficial in improving patient care for our Nation's veterans, ensuring that the 1,600 PAs employed by the VA are fully utilized to provide veterans medical care. 
   As a Member of Congress who represents one of the most rural districts in the country, I know that physician assistants are a key to providing medical care in underserved areas. Often, they are the only health care professional available. PAs help ensure those who live in our communities receive timely access to quality health care. 
   I want to be certain that PAs are appropriately utilized by the VA to serve our veterans. Like our armed forces that have full-time directors of PA services, this legislation will establish a dedicated expert in the VA Central Office. This PA Director will work to fully integrate the profession into VA health care, ensuring PAs have a stronger voice in the VA so they can better serve our veterans and their patients.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (TANKERS -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor late this afternoon to express my concern with the United States Air Force's decision to award the $35 billion contract to build the next generation of aerial refueling tankers to a foreign-led consortium of companies over a proposal put forth by American-based Boeing. 
   As I stand here today, Americans across the country are hopefully receiving in the mail our effort to stimulate the U.S. economy, that $600 check. Why, during this time when we're trying to address the issue of our economy and create jobs, is our government outsourcing a multi-billion dollar tanker contract to a foreign company instead of creating those jobs here in America? 
   The Air Force's selection of European Aeronautic Defence and Space will lead to about 19,000 aerospace jobs in Europe. This decision has a significant impact, of course, in my home State of Kansas. Boeing's finishing and test center for tankers would take place in Wichita. Throughout the State, local suppliers would provide support services and parts for Boeing. In Kansas alone, Boeing's proposal would create or sustain 3,800 jobs and $145 million annually, important investments that Europe now stands to gain. 
   Not only is the Air Force's decision a blow to American jobs, it's bad for our servicemembers and bad for the American taxpayer. Now that we've had a chance to look at the Air Force's analysis, we see how badly flawed the tanker selection competition was. The result is that the Air Force chose a tanker that is higher cost, higher risk, less capable, less survivable, and less efficient. 
   Boeing has filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office. I have listened to the explanation of the Air Force and the Department of Defense officials and I remain unconvinced that this was a fair competition. And so we now eagerly await GAO's results later this summer. 
   In the meantime, the Air Force's decision has raised questions that Congress should address. How does this decision impact America's economic security? How does it impact our military security? What are the national security effects of outsourcing critical military work to France and other foreign countries that often oppose our country's foreign policy? Should the Department of Defense's procurement process take into account billions of WTO-disputed foreign subsidies that give foreign manufacturers heavily weighted advantage in these competitions? 
   Air Force refueling tankers allow our military to operate around the world. In this day and age, the importance of modernizing our aging tanker fleet with the best available option cannot be overstated. In the coming weeks and months, I urge my colleagues in Congress to work to ensure that the right choice is made for Americans and America's military men and women.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, today we mark an event so important to our Nation that it can be identified, simply, by two numbers. The phrase ``9/11'' bears all of the emotions of that fateful day in 2001. Feelings of shock, helplessness and sorrow are still present 7 years later as our Nation engages its enemies abroad. As Americans, we stand to honor those who lost their lives that day, as well as the brave men and women of the armed services who sacrifice so much to protect us from further attack. 
   On September 11, 2001, we learned that heroes still exist. Just as those who serve our country are willing to forego life for the benefit of others, the firefighters, police and emergency personnel and those passengers who fought back provided the reassurance that Americans still will give their lives for others and preserve the future of our Nation. The heroes of 9/11 reaffirm that those who served in past battles did not serve in vain. Their examples allowed us a new generation of role models. 
   As we honor those who lost their lives at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, we must take this opportunity to recognize them as genuine heroes. The significance of their sacrifice is an incredible reminder of the great responsibility we have as Americans. There is not a U.S. citizen who is not affected by the events of that day. To honor their memory is to honor the sacrifice made by everyone who has laid down their life in defense of freedom. 
   9/11 marked a coming of age for the world. International terrorism had shown up at our front door and surprised a sleeping world. Though the events of that day will be remembered for the physical devastation that ensued, hope and renewed sense of patriotism will be September 11th's legacy. Our innocence shattered, we made renewed efforts to  keep our homeland safe and our world more secure. 
   Shortly after the attacks of September 11, I joined a half a dozen members of Congress in visiting New York City and the remains of the World Trade Center. I wanted to express on behalf of all Kansans our support and concern for the victims and their families and to express our condolences. 
   Just a few feet away from Ground Zero, New Yorkers created a makeshift memorial to those who died in the rubble of the Twin Towers. There, thousands of ordinary people brought cards and flowers as a tribute to those who died. While there, I happened to pick up a white piece of notebook paper, blue lines, jagged edge, torn from a spiral notebook. On that piece of paper was the writing of a child: ``Dear Daddy, How much I miss you. How I hope heaven is a wonderful place and I hope I can live a life good enough to join you there someday. Signed, Amanda, Age 12''. 
   Amanda, who I will not meet nor ever know, must never be forgotten. Her note to her Dad is a reminder that each generation is called on to preserve our way of life and that the cause is noble. That I, as a member of Congress and we, as American citizens, have a responsibility--there must be no more Amandas. 
   Thank you for the opportunity to express my gratitude for the heroes we are honoring today. Most importantly, I want to express my gratitude to the people who have made our freedoms a reality. Thank you, and may God bless you.

   I come from a State in which transportation matters. Long distances between communities, agricultural and commodity goods to be hauled to market.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I commend the committee's work in regard to the funding levels that are here before us in this Veterans Administration and Military Quality of Life appropriation bill.  
   I am pleased to be here in support of this legislation, but I do have an amendment. My amendment would transfer $125 million from veterans health administration accounts to the medical services account, and the purpose of doing so is to increase the amount of mileage reimbursement that disabled veterans receive for travel for medical services. 
   Currently, and, in fact, since 1978, our veterans have received 11 cents per mile. One would think that to be a misstatement on our part. I think it's very hard to believe that since 1978 we have not increased that reimbursement rate. 
   Because of funding constraints and priorities, I'm not asking that it be increased to what most of us would think is appropriate. Amendments have been offered in support on this House floor that have been demonstrated for the 48 1/2 cents allowed by IRS regulations. 
   On the floor today is the gentleman from Georgia who offered an amendment that passed unanimously by voice vote earlier this session that would increase the rate, authorize the increased rate to 48 1/2 cents. My amendment today appropriates the money, provides the money necessary to double the mileage reimbursement rate for disabled veterans from 11 cents per mile to 22 cents per mile. 
   A reasonable reimbursement rate is awfully important. This bill, in my opinion, goes a long way toward increasing the likelihood that veterans will have access to medical care and services that they so desperately need and so sincerely desire and deserve. 
   Those of us, however, who come from places in which it's a long distance to receive that service, to receive those benefits, are very concerned that there are people who are slipping through the cracks, as we have heard in other instances, within the VA system, because they cannot afford to make the trip to see the physician, to be seen at the hospital, to receive the services that they are entitled to. 
   I represent a district approximately the size of the State of Illinois. There is no VA hospital within the district. So my veterans must travel significant distances in order to receive care and treatment, and we know what has occurred in regard to the cost of travel with gas prices where they are today, as compared to where they were in 1978 when 11 cents per mile was established. 
   This concept is supported by our veterans service organization. I am a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. I have chaired the health care subcommittee. This has been an issue we have dealt with for a long time, and I have seen amendments offered in previously years often stuck on a point of order or for me to withdraw them. 
   Today, I think it's important that we move forward, particularly at a time when we were increasing the amount of money available within the VA funding stream. If we don't do it now, when will we do it? I offered this amendment, a similar amendment, in 2003, and most years since. It's always going to be next year. 
   With the levels of funding that are provided for in the underlying appropriation bill, it seems important for us, to me, for us not to sidestep this issue for another year. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards). I will have to admit to him that my amendment is not unintentional, and so his assumption that the offset that I'm providing is an unintentional offering on my part is not true. I'm aware of where the money comes from and still believe that this is a high priority. And, in fact, this bill, the medical administration account, receives a 14 1/2 percent, $458 million, increase over last year's funding levels, and $193 million more than the President requested in fiscal year 2008. And, in fact, our authorizing committee, both the minority and majority views, accepted those, the President's recommendation, as our suggested funding levels. 
   So again, in searching year after year for a place from which this money can come, it is not without concern that we have chosen these accounts. But this is the year in which there is a 14.5 percent increase in those funds. And even if my amendment would be adopted, it would still allow for a 10.6 percent increase in those administrative accounts. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (CHIROPRACTIC CARE AVAILABLE TO ALL VETERANS ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are thousands of veterans across this country who could benefit from additional medical care and treatment, and chiropractic care is one form of that care and treatment that we believe can be expanded to meet the health care needs of our Nation's veterans. 
   It's an honor for me to be here today, just a few days in advance of Memorial Day, in support of legislation that I believe will benefit those veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the year 2002, I joined my colleagues in an effort to see that chiropractic care became a significant component of the VA health care delivery system, and we have made progress in that regard. And that program has been implemented, but as the chairman indicated, as the gentleman from California indicated, it's only available in a small number of hospitals across the country. 
   This legislation takes what was a very good idea in 2002 and 2003 and expands it to make certain that, over time, all veterans in this country can access chiropractic care. 
   A recent VA study indicates that the demand for attention to back pain is only increasing, and we know that chiropractic care can address those issues. Numerous studies have demonstrated that chiropractic care is an effective therapy and would be an effective approach to low back pain, spasms, and other maladies suffered by not only all Americans but by our veterans in particular. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, this is a piece of legislation that I think will benefit all veterans across the country, widely supported by those veterans service organizations who speak here in our Nation's Capitol on behalf of veterans. The Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, AMVETS, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America all speak in favor of passage H.R. 1470. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come from a congressional district in which access to health care is a huge issue for all of my citizens. Long distances to travel, attraction of health care providers to rural communities is a challenging task and the more we can expand the number of providers, the type of care that can be provided, the more likely it is that veterans who live in my district and rural America will have access to that care. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I'm here on behalf of the veterans of America. I'm here on behalf of members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee to urge my colleagues to approve H.R. 1470, the Chiropractic Care Available to All Veterans Act. 
   I thank the gentleman from California for his encouragement of the passage of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, every year I conduct town hall meetings in each of the 69 counties that comprise the First District of Kansas. I want to hear what's on the minds of my constituents and receive my marching orders that I bring back to Washington, D.C. 
   And so now for the 12th year, I've made the rounds, some 5,000 miles with 69 town hall meetings, and I'm here on the floor tonight to visit one of those issues that has certainly been raised by Kansas voices, and I want to make certain that those voices are heard and that the commonsense that my constituents have is part of the debate on the issues that we face here in the Nation's capital. 
   While the issues that Kansans talk to me about every year--they change I guess from year to year a bit--one thing remains the same. Folks want to see good things happen in their own communities, and they want to see good things happen in their country. 
   This year, the issue I heard the most about was the high cost of energy. I heard from Kansans who can't take much more pain at the pump. Right now, prices which are expected only to increase are too high for Kansans, and it's past time in their opinion, and mine as well, for Congress to pay attention. 
   Farmers, truckers, manufacturers, teachers, seniors, all shared with me that something needs to change or they just can't make it. This is what I heard all across our State. Kansans are trying to get by, and their employers are struggling to keep them employed. 
   And it's not just about economics. It's about our foreign policy. We can look at the nightly news and see that our own foreign policy is distorted because of national security issues that  are presented by the fact that we're at the mercy of oil-rich countries, many of them who despise us. 
   Kansans understand that technology changes with time and so should environmental and energy policies. Exploring and drilling can be done with limited environmental impact. China, with Cuba's permission, is tapping our natural resources, our natural gas fields, right off our own coasts, where our companies are banned. They are banned even with advanced technologies and a strong commitment to see that there is no ecological disaster. 
   While I support increasing the domestic supply of oil and gas, I know it's not the only answer. We need to meet our country's energy needs in a diverse way. It's capturing the power of the sun. It's harnessing the wind that blows across my State of Kansas. It's using heat from within the Earth to generate electricity. All of these and many more energy sources are completely renewable. Renewable energy can create jobs at home and help our economy, improve our environment, and reduce our dependence upon foreign oil. 
   Energy conservation can also help. Too many of us have gotten away from the things that we always knew. Growing up, it was considered a sin in my family to leave the lights on when you weren't in the room. We need to get back to that mentality of being responsible with our energy use. 
   Across Kansas, folks are recognizing the benefits of conservation. Farmers are transitioning to no-till practices, which reduce the number of times the tractor passes through the field. Commuters are carpooling. Every gallon that we conserve, every degree we don't heat or cool, every empty room that doesn't have a light on, helps us reduce the demand. 
   I'm taking steps in my own congressional office to reduce energy use. 
   Tonight, I'm on the floor delivering a message from Kansans, like Brian and Laura Velasquez from the small town of Reading, Kansas, on the east side of my district: 
   ``Dear Representative Moran, we are a middle class Kansas family. It has become more difficult the past few years for us to make ends meet in spite of increased income. Since our lifestyle has not changed, the main explanation has to be the fallout from the cost of fuel. We are not the only ones in this predicament. The U.S. is at the mercy of too many oil-rich nations that are not concerned about our welfare. This needs to change now.'' 
   I agree with my constituents. It's clear that Americans want Congress to develop policies that increase the supply of energy, and they want Congress to encourage the development of new fuel sources. Until the supply of energy, renewable or fossil fuels, increases, prices will only continue to rise. 
   We must work together, not just with words but in action to promote energy conservation, develop domestic production of oil and natural gas, and aggressively pursue alternative fuels. Let all Americans know we hear their concerns and we will act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, it is easy to be in Washington, DC, making bold predictions and promises and then ignore the realities right in front of our noses. Congress' failure to meet the July 1 deadline to prevent the scheduled fee reductions for Medicare providers is shameful and our failure to act has real consequences.  
   Seventeen percent of the people I represent are on Medicare, roughly 114,000 people. Many of these citizens live in communities where there are few doctors and few health care options. If the available doctors stop seeing Medicare patients, the health care access for all Kansans will be severely damaged. We must prevent the scheduled physician fee reductions from going into effect, and I encourage the Senate to take up necessary legislation now. 
   Just this week, I received a letter from a family physician back home. He, of course, expressed his frustration with our current Medicare system. Here are his words: 
   ``It is with mixed emotion that I am writing to inform you of my intent to leave my family medicine practice. I have reached the point where I am no longer willing to expose myself or my family to the risk of having to rely upon an increasingly unreliable and poor source of income, Medicare. As a small business with 12 employees, I don't have the margin to absorb others' incompetence or our government's capricious reimbursement. I am not willing to be a pawn in an ideological chess match in Washington, and therefore as of today I will no longer accept Medicare patients. 
   ``I am considering a position in an economically booming region in another State that is nearly 95 percent private pay. What physician worth their salt will continue in a system that undervalues the work they do for a patient population that is the most complex and the most time demanding? 
   ``Congress and the Medicare system are taking advantage of good-intentioned physicians who are more interested in caring for patients and upholding and honoring the Hippocratic Oath than lining their pockets. Even now, writing this letter to you, I feel a sense of guilt as though I am betraying my Medicare patients. I have realized, however, that it is not I that have betrayed the elderly, rather Congress.'' 
   When doctors close their practices, it creates a gap that is almost impossible for us in rural communities to fill. Congress must understand that we have a responsibility in making physicians want to continue to practice medicine, to not give them the reason to walk out their clinic or hospital doors and never look back. Congress needs to look closely at our role in these trends and make sure we are not encouraging this situation by playing politics with people's health care and their lives. 
   I hope that the Senate will pass legislation this week that can keep our vital health care system in place and protect our most vulnerable citizens.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am here today with my colleague the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moore) as we commend and congratulate an amazing year at the University of Kansas in its Department of Athletics with an earlier victory at the Orange Bowl in the football program followed up by a victory by our basketball team at the Final Four in San Antonio, Texas, just a few weeks ago. We're anxious to have the Jayhawks--the players, the team, and school athletic officials--here so that our colleagues from Congress can greet and congratulate them, and we hope that happens in the near future. And we are also expecting that the President will invite the Jayhawks to the White House for the traditional commendation from the President of the United States. 
   I, of course, support House Resolution 1096 commending my alma mater, the University of Kansas. It's been a long time for Kansas Jayhawk basketball fans since ``Danny Manning and the Miracles'' shocked the sporting world and defeated the Oklahoma Sooners and won KU's last basketball championship. In that time since 1988, KU has had many memorable moments but also some real heartbreaks as at times it came up just a bit short in returning the championship trophy back to Kansas. 
   On April 7 the Jayhawks were trailing the Memphis Tigers 60-51 with 2:12 left in regulation. Then began one of the most amazing comebacks that we have seen in the history of basketball and one of the most memorable college basketball experiences. With just 2.1 seconds left in regulation, Final Four MVP Mario Chalmers hit a game-tying 3 point shot. It was the exact scenario that every young kid dreams of when practicing shooting those baskets in their home driveway. KU went on to defeat Memphis 75-68 to claim its fifth national championship to the jubilation of Kansans everywhere. 
   In our State we have a number of choices for students to attend college and a lot of rivalries within our State. Two of the greatest rivalries, Kansas State University and their outstanding program, as well as the University of Kansas and their program. But even our Wildcat fans and K State supporters were pleased and proud of the Kansas victory. Forty thousand fans celebrated that night in Lawrence, and later close to a hundred thousand Kansans came across our State to share in the Jayhawk victory parade in Lawrence, Kansas. 
   I should also mention that the class that all Kansans showed that night in celebrating, Kansans were typical Kansans that evening, well behaved but in a great mood of celebration. 
   The University of Kansas has one of the most distinguished histories in college basketball. The founder of basketball, Dr. James Naismith, was the first coach at the University of Kansas, and he was also the only coach in KU's history to ever have a losing season. This is KU's fifth national championship, and they've been to the Final Four 13 times and have captured an astounding 51 conference titles in history. 
   My congratulations to the chancellor of the university, my friend Bob Hemenway; and to my friend the athletic director, Lew Perkins; Coach Bill Self; the assistant coaches Danny Manning, Joe Dooley, Kurtis Townsend, Brett Ballard, and Ronnie Chalmers; and the outstanding KU basketball team. 
   All Kansans are proud. We commend you on this amazing year and your success. And as the congressman from Kansas (Mr. Moore) says, ``Rock Chalk Jayhawk.''

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (MEETING THE ENERGY NEEDS OF AMERICA IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to call the House of Representatives, the Congress, the administration, this country, to action. 
   Just this month, the price of oil hit $75 per barrel, and it seems that the proverbial, ``While Nero fiddles, Rome burns,'' in this case it is, ``While Congress fiddles, prices at the pump continue to escalate,'' with a tremendous consequence to the consumers across America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that we address the energy policy, the energy needs of this country, in a comprehensive way. And although we have tried that on a number of occasions, it seems to me that our efforts have been less than what is required and need dramatic attention. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, tonight I call for a broad approach for what we do to reduce the price at the pump, and clearly conservation is a component of that. We need as a country to make certain that we have policies in place that encourage conservation, that we do not waste energy. And in fact this week I will cosponsor legislation that establishes CAFE standards to try to improve the efficiency of our automobile fleet done in a way, Mr. Speaker, that is satisfactory, provides common sense and good scientific basis for the direction we need to go, something that is not unreasonable but is workable for the automobile industry and for the consumer. 
   Clearly, renewable fuels is an important component. We in Kansas have a lot to offer when it comes to renewable fuels, particularly as we have moved in the direction of ethanol and biodiesel. But I call for greater action, particularly in the area of cellulosic renewable fuels, cellulosic ethanol in which we can utilize the waste product of agriculture to meet our country's energy needs and not compete with the food supply and the use of corn, for example, to feed livestock. 
   Renewable fuels matter greatly to rural America, but they matter greatly across the country. It is about jobs in rural communities and about utilization of our agricultural production, and it is about the environment, and it is about trying to do something about the tremendous burden we face in importing oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also propose that we encourage greater exploration and production. Too often in this country we have an attitude that says we cannot drill and explore in our backyard, and yet we complain about the price of fuel. The opportunity continues to exist in this country to explore and find greater oil and natural gas and utilize our reserves. It also is an opportunity for us to pursue other sources of energy such as clean coal technologies and nuclear power. Again, we take so many things off the table and then complain that we can't afford the price. 
   Finally, I ask that we pursue once again increasing our refining capacity. The last refinery in this country was built in 1976. In Kansas in the 1980s we had 14 refineries in our State. Today we have three, and one of those three was closed because of flood waters. The consequence was a 14-15 cent increase in the price of gasoline per gallon. 
   It is time that we develop the capacity to meet the consumers' needs. Mr. Speaker, just last year in 2006 we spent $218 billion in purchasing oil from countries abroad, countries whose political circumstances are volatile, countries who have joined together to make certain that they control the supply and increase the price, and yet it seems we do nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
   It is clear to me that our national security is harmed by our policy, or lack of policy. It is clear to me that the economic consequences of our failure, of our fiddling while Rome burns is dramatic. 
   Mr. Speaker, again I ask the leadership of this House to pursue policies of a broad, comprehensive approach to reducing our dependence upon foreign oil and making a difference for the consumer in the United States, improving our economy, and increasing our national security.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (HEROES EARNINGS ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF TAX ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for recognizing me. 
   This, as you can hear, is an important piece of legislation that is widely supported and praised here on the House floor today, but I am disappointed that the majority in the committee rejected an amendment that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. English) offered. 
   This amendment was a commonsense, bipartisan fix to the Tax Code to prevent lower-income military personnel and their families from being discriminated against when applying to live in affordable housing built under the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. 
   A number of military installations across the country are experiencing housing shortages as a result of the 2005 BRAC. One of those facilities, Fort Riley, an Army post located in the State of Kansas, is nearly doubling in size and is now seeing an influx of 30,000 soldiers, civilian workers, and others. 
   When the new soldiers live off base, they receive a military housing allowance from the government that they use for payment of rent. Though the Tax Code does not treat the housing allowance as taxable income, it is considered income when determining a military family's eligibility to live in facilities financed with low-income housing tax credits. The result is that some servicemembers, particularly our enlisted men and women, are considered to earn too much income and are thus disqualified from living in affordable housing. 
   However, comparatively low-income civilians receiving section 8 housing vouchers from the Federal Government are more likely to qualify for this housing. This is because, unlike the military housing subsidy, the Tax Code exempts section 8 assistance from being considered income. 
   Our Nation's military families deserve access to safe, decent, and affordable housing; and they should be given a fair opportunity to qualify for it. The House acted in May to exempt military housing allowance from income eligibility requirements when qualifying for the Head Start program. The USDA's WIC nutrition program for Women, Infants and Children also provides for this exemption. Unfortunately, the discrimination persists when military families apply to live in affordable housing and enlisted servicemembers and their families continue to be treated unfairly in communities across the country. 
   I had hoped to offer amendment here today on the House floor to address this issue, but the procedure by which this bill is brought to the floor does not allow me that opportunity. I would urge and encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring H.R. 1481, The  Military Access to Housing Act, to correct this inequality, and to encourage the leadership of this House to bring this measure to the floor for a vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I rise this evening to address two important issues that USDA provides in serving my farmers and ranchers in Kansas and across the country, the desire to see that those services are provided at the local level. 
   The first issue, although not very glamorous, is very important. It is the funding of nondiscretionary FSA technology expenses. This winter, many of my producers went to their local FSA office only to discover the computers were not working. In many instances they had to set aside all of the other computers so they could try to allow the farmers to access the computer system and sign up for the programs. The delays were for months. 
   In the President's budget, $23.8 million was requested for fixed IT operating expenses. Those operating expenses are required to operate and maintain FSA's existing computer system. In this bill the committee only appropriates $10 million. FSA does not have a choice in paying its fixed IT operating expenses. If sufficient funding is not appropriated, FSA will be forced to reduce its staff to keep its IT system operating, and I believe that would adversely affect the services provided by our local offices. 
   The second issue is our NRCS county offices. The bill we are considering today has two provisions halting county office closures for NRCS's sister agencies, FSA and Rural Development, RD. The primary reason for delaying county office closures is we are currently in the midst of writing a new farm bill. And while I am glad to see that this bill addresses the FSA and RD office closures, I would also like to see the same approach taken with NRCS. 
   I look forward to working with the chairwoman and the ranking member and I would ask for the chairwoman to enter into a colloquy with me to indicate her interest in this topic.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon) for yielding me time today, and I rise in support of H.R. 3195. 
   In my world, in the way I look at life, all human beings, because we're created by the same God, are entitled to respect and dignity. In our framework in our country, our Constitution provides that we are entitled to certain rights. One of those, as I see it, is the right to an opportunity to succeed. 
   So I'm pleased that our country, in 1990, this Congress and the Senate came together with the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act. And I'm pleased today that we are here to restore certain of those rights that were believed to be there under the ADA passed in 1990. What this law will do is to require the courts to interpret this law in a fair manner. 
   We know that all of us are entitled to an opportunity to succeed. And I think all of us, as we look at our lives, look just for the chance to be judged based upon our own performance. We don't want special rights. We all just want to be gauged by people who judge us by what we do and how we do it and how well we do it. And so the original law and the Restoration Act today, as I see it, establishes that premise that we're all entitled to be judged based upon how we perform our tasks. 
   I support this legislation and am pleased by what I've heard on the floor this afternoon by the way it came about. And I appreciate being here to hear the gentleman from Maryland, the distinguished majority leader, speak about his sponsorship and authorship of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   One of my predecessors, Bob Dole, served in that similar capacity. I'd like to quote my predecessor when he spoke about the ADA and indicate that I believe that what he said then should be the words of today as well: 
   ``This historic civil rights legislation seeks to end the unjustified segregation and exclusion of persons with disabilities from the mainstream of American life. The ADA is fair and balanced legislation that carefully blends the rights of people with disabilities with the legitimate needs of the American business community.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I believe that's what the legislation before us does today, and again confirms the right that we all have to be judged based upon our ability to perform.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (CALLING FOR JUSTICE IN DARFUR -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, we see from time to time, way too often from my perspective, a divisive, partisan discussion, debate, and oftentimes nearly fisticuffs on this House floor. But, Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to speak about an issue that each of us, every one of us, can agree upon, where there is no partisan or political consideration. And that, Mr. Speaker, is what is transpiring, has transpired over the last several years in Darfur. 
   Mr. Speaker, we know that there have been 2 million citizens of Sudan who today no longer live in their homes or their villages, and we know that there have been 450,000 people killed in Sudan. It is something that demands our attention. It is something that we as a Congress, we as a country and we as a world must come together to bring the death and destruction, the inhumanity, the hunger, the violence to an end. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity several weeks ago to join the Honorable Steny Hoyer, the distinguished majority leader of the House of Representatives, in a visit to Darfur. And there, of course, we had the opportunity to meet with government officials, but we also had the opportunity to see for ourselves the conditions that human beings are living in today. And while I hope our meetings with government officials were useful, I know the view I saw, the scenes that were brought to my attention, the people I met transcend any meeting I could have with a government official to discuss what is going on but was an opportunity for me to have my life changed as a human being to see that we all have a cause to see that life prevails and justice endures. 
   Upon my return, Mr. Speaker, yesterday I took the opportunity to visit the Holocaust Museum. This week is the week of remembrance of the Holocaust, and while there, I saw the quote from Isaiah, Isaiah 43:10, that says: ``You are my witness.'' Mr. Speaker, that speaks to me and should speak to all of us. We are the witness of the holocaust today. And many Members of Congress, much more so than I and for longer periods of time than I have paid attention to this issue, have been trying to rise to the occasion and bring awareness to the world. And I commend my colleagues who have been outspoken on this issue for a long time, and I join them tonight. 
   And today I was back to the Holocaust Museum, where President Bush spoke. And, yes, it was a remembrance of the death and destruction that the Jewish community, the people of the Jewish faith suffered, but it also brought home the importance of addressing genocide and death today. And I commend our President for his demands that the Sudanese government allow an African Union/U.N. peacekeeping force, that they reach out to the rebel leaders, that they end their support for the violent Janjaweed militia and they permit humanitarian aid to pass. And President Bush outlined some steps that we as a country are willing to take and requests that we can make to the United Nations. 
   Congress has designated this week as the ``Days of Remembrance'' in order to commemorate those victims of the Holocaust. While at that Holocaust Museum, I learned much about the reach of the Holocaust and saw images of death and dehumanization. And as I reflected upon the Jews past and considered the future of African tribes in Darfur, I have to ask a question: Are we going to wait until the proportions of death are similar to the Holocaust before we take action? 
   The exhibit that moved me the most, Mr. Speaker, was the list of 10,000 individuals who took action during the Holocaust. They have been identified by the Israelis as ``the Righteous Among the Nations,'' those who risked their lives to save innocent Jews during Nazi rule. 
   When the conflict in Darfur has ended, everyone will feel sorrow for the unnecessary loss of life. But will our Nation be among those, will we as individuals be among those who feel shame for inaction or pride for standing up for justice in Darfur?

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment today that I would like the Committee to consider, which is a prohibition against the expenditure of funds. 
   In the year 2000, this Congress passed legislation that altered our trading relationship with Cuba. That legislation, the Trade Sanctions Reform Act of 2000, was put in place that would allow for the sale of agricultural commodities, food, and medicine to Cuba for cash in advance. That legislation was signed into law and was operational; and from that period of time, we have sold nearly $1.5 billion of agriculture commodities, food, and medicine to Cuba for cash in advance. 
   In the year 2005, the administration published a final rule clarifying the definition of cash payments in advance; and by that rule, it disrupted the sale of agriculture commodities, food, and medicine to Cuba. The change being that rather than payments in advance at the time the goods were delivered, the commodities were delivered in Cuba, the administration's rule requires that the payment be made before the commodities leave a United States port, a matter of days or weeks by advancing the payment. 
   This is contrary to our normal trading relationships, the norms within the international community, and has been disruptive and is an indication of our unwillingness to be a reliable provider of agriculture commodities to Cuba. 
   This amendment that I offer today prohibits the funding of the implementation or the enforcement of that rule promulgated by the administration in the year 2005, and so it would return us to the days following the passage of the original legislation, the Trade Sanctions Reform Act of 2000, that would once again say that cash in advance is payment when the commodity arrives in port in Cuba. And this change in rules has had an effect upon our ability of American farmers and agriculture producers to supply, to sell, for cash the things we produce in this country, a detrimental effect upon the farm economy. It is estimated that exports fell approximately 10 percent in value from 2004 to 2005. Wheat, which is important in my home State of Kansas, was decreased by 18 percent; rice by 38 percent; cotton by 87 percent; lumber by 100 percent; dairy products by 55 percent; seafood by 100 percent; course grains by 74 percent; and poultry decreased by 27 percent. And the goal is to try to restore those markets, once again be a more reliable supplier of food to the Cuban people, and to make certain that American agriculture is not harmed by our policy or is harmed less by our policy. 
   These are unilateral sanctions, Mr. Chairman, as you know. And unilateral sanctions are probably not effective in and of themselves when it is only the United States that fails to trade with Cuba. So, again, a rather modest modification in our policy, changing it to the days of the policies enacted by Congress before the administration changed the rules. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Chairman, again I would point out that this amendment today does not change the law and that all sales to Cuba must be for cash in advance. There is no agricultural credit through the United States Government that can be offered to Cuba to assist in the sale of purchases by Cuba nor can any U.S. financial institution be engaged in the activity leading up to the sale of these commodities to Cuba. 
   So we do not change the law. It is simply a matter of definition. And at least in my estimation, the definition was changed for purposes of making those sales less likely to Cuba, thereby harming farmers, ranchers, and producers across the United States. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Again, I would ask for adoption of this amendment. I offered the amendment on the House floor in July of 2000 that ultimately resulted in the passage of the Trade Sanctions Reform Act. 
   I admit that I came here in support of farmers in Kansas who thought it was useful to them and beneficial to them economically to be able to sell to Cuba. And over time, I have tried to examine this issue, and it has become something broader. I think there is a greater benefit in the efforts to change the nature of Cuba and to enhance the opportunities that Cubans have for greater personal freedom by an economic relationship between our two countries.  
   And so, although it was initially an economic issue with me and it remains important to the agriculture community, I think it also benefits the opportunity that we can enhance Cubans for greater freedom and personal liberty within their own country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be on the House floor today to raise a significant concern I have with the budget proposal that will be before the House of Representatives this week before its final passage. 
   At the moment, as we speak here on the House floor, Republican and Democrat members of the House Agriculture Committee are gathered in the House Agriculture Committee room to talk about a plan for a new 2002 farm bill. As we gather together, it's a wonderful thing that those of us who care about the farmers and ranchers of the country, who care about the environmental and conservation needs, who care about the food and nutrition needs of Americans, have decided we want to craft a farm bill together. We want to work side-by-side to reach the right priorities within the farm bill. 
   The problem is the budget priorities established under this budget are inadequate to provide a safety net for the farmers of America. There is a ruse going on here. The budget provides for a $20 billion reserve fund that the farm bill can access in the process of developing a new farm bill, but only if we cut spending someplace else, or we raise taxes. 
   So we are sitting in the Agriculture Committee trying to determine how do we meet the needs of the agriculture producers and the consumers of America, how do we meet the land and environmental and conservation needs of the people of our cities and our countryside, and we are going to try to determine that in a vacuum that suggests there is actually $20 billion in the budget that's not there. 
   It is simply a gimmick to allow us to try to write a farm bill to appeal to all the variety of interests that care about the outcome of this farm bill debate. But the money is not available. 
   For too long we have had the gimmicks in the budgetary process. To me,  this is one of the biggest I have seen in my time in Congress in which we pretend there is a fund to draft farm bill legislation. 
   The farmers of America, certainly the farmers of Kansas, struggle today. We are in perhaps the beginning of an end of a 6-year drought. Commodity prices are higher. The last farm bill, 2002 farm bill, spent $18 billion less than was expected. But do we get the advantage of that in agriculture spending? The answer is no. It's taken away from us because commodity prices at the moment are higher than they were. But we know, in agriculture, we know the laws of supply and demand and economic rules that govern our economy, that the result of higher commodity prices is lower commodity prices. 
   So as we draft a farm bill, we are going to pretend there's money there to meet the safety net needs of farmers when it's not there. Commodity prices will be lower. That's a natural result of higher commodity prices. 
   Conservation environmental needs will be greater. Food stamps and nutrition programs will need to be funded. Yet, this budget fails to meet those needs. Even the administration's proposal had a better offer for American agriculture than the Democrat-passed budget on the House floor today. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, there is talk about higher commodity prices for our farmers, but very few people talk about the purpose of the farm bill, which is to provide a safety net when the cost of production to produce the crop is higher than the commodity price that the farmer receives. Yes, commodity prices are higher this year than they were last year or the year before, but let me remind people of this body what has happened to the input costs that a farmer, in fact, all Americans, face. 
   Agriculture is an energy dependent business, with the increasing cost of fuel, fertilizer and natural gas, the price, the cost of producing agricultural commodities in this country has skyrocketed since the 2002 farm bill. Yet the budget that we are presented with today will allow us to do less for farmers, not more. 
   I rise just to raise serious objection to the budget, and to make my colleagues aware, as we work together in a bipartisan fashion in the Agriculture Committee, to craft a farm bill, the parameters that have been laid out by the budget make that process almost impossible to accomplish. 
   I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the time. Again, I rise to oppose this budget and its failure to meet the agricultural, environmental and food safety needs of Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, many things are going on in our country tonight and this week, and the Congress faces difficult decisions. But the death of a son or daughter, a family member, all these other things can pale in the tragedy that encounters many families across this country. 
   Tonight, I want to recognize the month of October as ``National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.'' Most years that I've been in Congress I have come to the floor in October to try to raise the awareness of the death and violence that occurs in our homes across America. I think significant progress has been made in calling the attention to domestic violence and helping victims and families recover from abuse; however, so much remains to be done because senseless acts of violence are still taking place in homes and communities across America. 
   Tragically, I was reminded of the need for greater efforts to combat domestic violence this past July when tragedy struck in my home State of Kansas. Tonight, I'd like to share with you the story of Jana Lynne Mackey. 
   On July 20, 1982, Jana was born in Harper, Kansas. Jana was raised primarily in my hometown of Hays, Kansas, where she was an active member of 4-H, an athlete, and a very talented musician; but most of all, she was a vibrant and caring young woman who fought for those whose voices would not otherwise be heard. 
   Following high school graduation, Jana completed a bachelor's degree where she discovered her passion, advocating for those who needed her help. She went on to pursue a law degree at the University of Kansas with the goal of using that education to further the cause of others. 
   Jana tirelessly fought for equality and social justice through her many local and national organizations that she belonged to and worked for. She was an active volunteer in the Lawrence Safe Center, a facility that aids victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. But on July 3, 2008, Jana's body was discovered in an ex-boyfriend's home. Her own promising life prematurely ended at the age of 25 by an act of domestic violence. 
   All too often, we think domestic violence doesn't occur in our own communities or to people that we know or families that we care about, but Jana's story is evidence that no State, no community, no family is immune to the far-reaching presence of domestic violence.     
   Domestic violence is a problem that does not discriminate on race, gender, age group, education, or social status. It wreaks havoc on our increasingly stressed health care network, our overflowing criminal justice system, and, of course, on our daily lives. 
   Domestic violence continues to impact communities in Kansas and across America. Each year nearly 4 million new incidents of domestic violence are reported in the United States. Of those 4 million cases, nearly 100,000 Kansas women fall victim to domestic violence each year. Each day in America, over 53,000 victims receive care through domestic violence programs, the programs that Jana volunteered and advocated for. 
   Despite the harsh realities, there is hope for tomorrow. It's my belief that with continued education, resources, and support, the victims of domestic violence can overcome their condition. In the 69 counties I represent, it's the same belief that maintains and encourages the nine domestic violence centers in that district. These agencies are vital to our communities as they raise awareness, advocate for victims, and provide support to those victims with resources and the care they so desperately need. 
   Jana made a greater impact in her 25 years than many individuals do in a lifetime. And while Jana's story is tragic, her example is a lesson and an inspiration for all of us to be more active in the fight against violence. This is why her family started the 1100 Torches campaign. 
   At Jana's funeral 1,100 people were in attendance, which indicates the magnitude of the impact of her live on others. In the aftermath of her death, her mother, Christie Brungardt, and her stepfather, Curt, along with family and friends launched the 1100 Torches campaign to serve as Jana's call to action; that despite our personal politics, we can make a difference in the world and in turn make it a better place to live. It is the campaign's hope that through Jana's story, 1,100 people will be inspired by her to serve others and to make a difference in their communities. I encourage my colleagues and all Americans to learn about Jana's story and the impact of domestic violence by visiting the 1100 Torches campaign Web site at www.1100torches.org and by learning more about this issue in your local community. 
   We're making progress and drawing attention to domestic violence this month in October; yet this problem continues to impact our communities and their families. We must not forget about those violent crimes that destroy homes and families and devastate lives. This October let us remember the victims of domestic violence and learn from their courage as we do our best to ensure that our communities are safe places to live, to work, and to raise our families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask for continued support and assistance of domestic violence prevention programs, and tonight I pay tribute to the young life of Jana Mackey.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I was before the Rules Committee requesting permission to offer an amendment, and I appreciate the courtesy that was extended to me by the Rules Committee, but would like to highlight, once again, that this omnibus spending bill does not include something that is of high priority to me and a high priority to many of my colleagues on the Republican side, but clearly a priority to Democrats who, last fall, signed a discharge petition attempting to bring to the House floor the issue of disaster assistance for farmers across the country. And despite the fact that 196 Members of the House, Democrat Members of the House, signed a discharge petition, we are still not at the point in which we are able to vote upon providing disaster assistance to farmers across the Midwest and around the country due to weather-related losses. 
   And I would encourage my colleagues, as we continue to work ourselves through the appropriation process, that we have other opportunities to pursue this. And I hope that the words that were expressed to me yesterday in the Rules Committee that that would be the case remains true.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, in large and small communities across our Nation, too many Americans find themselves placed in danger by the very people who are supposed to love them. It's estimated that 2 million acts of domestic violence take place each year in the United States. This is not just a problem for women; it's also a problem for children and a problem for men. We are doing no one any favors, least of all the abusers, by ignoring the problem. 
   I rise today to recognize October as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. And while we make gains in raising the awareness about domestic violence and in providing assistance to the victims, the violence continues. 
   According to a recent survey in my home State of Kansas, one domestic violence act occurs every 28 minutes. One out of four women will be abused in their lifetime, and more than 3 million children will witness some form of violence at home each year. 
   Domestic violence brings fear, hopelessness and depression into the lives of every affected victim. One incident can create a cycle of despair that's difficult not only for the victim, but also for their families to overcome. 
   When a victim is abused, the abuse does not stay in the home, and, therefore, we cannot fight this battle only on one front. Domestic violence is often seen as a private issue. However, the suffering often follows victims at work and at school. 
   It is important that medical professionals, educators, law enforcement officers, and community leaders are trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of domestic violence. Everyone, not just the victim but their children who suffer and the abusers themselves, will be better off if we can put a firm and rapid stop to every single case of domestic violence.  
   It is also important to support domestic violence shelters. These agencies provide essential services, help advocate for victims, and spearhead efforts to increase domestic violence awareness throughout the country. Tonight I commend those who work every day to help victims of domestic violence, especially those who work in the nine service areas that I am aware of back home in Kansas in my district: Dodge City, Emporia, Garden City, Great Bend, Hays, Hutchinson, Liberal, Salina, and Ulysses. 
   We must not forget the role Congress has to play. Federal grants made under the Violence Against Women Act provide essential funds for shelter operations and support services. We must ensure that shelters and crisis centers receive sufficient funding to provide this safety net to some of our most vulnerable citizens. 
   October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, but we must fight domestic violence and address its consequences all year long. Through education, enforcement and support, we can continue working together to break the cycle of domestic violence and bring hope to victims so terribly affected by these acts. 
   Tonight, I pray for the end of violence within our families and for the healing of those who suffer.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (THE REALITY OF A MODERN DAY SCHOOL TEACHER -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, when the question is asked, other than a family member, name one person who has made a difference in your life, the most often answered response is that of a favorite teacher. This simple response speaks volumes about the influence that an educator has on the lives of a young person and the future of our Nation. 
   The education profession has long been known for inadequate pay but a high job satisfaction. Teachers have been willing to forfeit material gain for the joy of seeing the eyes of their students light up when they discover a difficult concept or when they grasp a new idea. We have long understood that teachers truly shape the world by their work, and their greatest product is an educated child. 
   Lately, though, the job satisfaction that brought so many teachers into the profession seems to have left the classroom. Unfortunately, much of this development can be attributed to No Child Left Behind. The joy of teaching has been replaced by the pressure-filled staff meetings where educators spend their time talking, not about how to help a child learn but, rather, their school's test scores.     
   Morale in the education world has diminished, and more teachers are at wits end. 
   Recently, Holly Lindsay, a teacher in Lindsborg, Kansas, told me of her frustration with her profession. She writes, ``I am a first-year teacher, and I am beginning to get very discouraged. I went into the teaching profession to help students learn and to encourage them to follow their dreams. However, I am finding that more and more of my time is spent preparing students for standardized tests. These tests do not prepare students for any career. They only teach students how to take a test. I am very disappointed with the education system right now. With all these tests, we don't have time to teach. It is also very frustrating when we have to prove our abilities with countless hours to show that we are highly qualified. In no other profession are there such lofty goals for their employees with such little benefit. I truly feel that the time and effort I put into teaching is not worth my while. No Child Left Behind is wonderful in theory, but impossible to carry out. Not every child is equal in ability, and no teacher should be expected to make it so.'' 
   The number of teachers leaving the profession is exceeding the number of teachers entering the profession by 23 percent. With over 25 percent of our teaching force eligible to retire within the next 10 years, this young educator's thoughts should be a warning. Teachers that have been career educators are bailing out as soon as they can because they do not want to deal with the unnecessary red tape and the growing pressures that are being placed upon them. 
   Another staggering fact is that one-third of new teachers quit the education profession within the first 3 years of teaching. In my rural Kansas district, if we have to shut the doors on rural schools it will not be because of lack of students, it will be because we cannot find the teachers to fill the teaching vacancies. 
   Congress must be sensitive to the responsibility we hold in making educators want to walk out of the classroom and never look back. Congress needs to look closely at our role and the trends and make sure that we are not encouraging this situation by continuing to overregulate the classroom.  We need to strive for improvements in our education system, but we must make sure that we are not legislating accountability simply for the sake of a sound bite. We must not take the joy and passion out of this noble profession by requiring things that are simply not possible. 
   This year, Congress is set to examine No Child Left Behind and potentially reauthorize it. While I voted against this law, I voted against No Child Left Behind, I look forward to being involved in the upcoming discussions about how we reform and change the education system. My hope is that we will look closely at the unintended realities that so many of our teachers face and will be willing to make the changes necessary to provide the policies that will help them succeed as they go about the business of educating our greatest asset, our young people, and fulfilling the jobs they so love.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding me time. In my short time during my service in Congress, I have been a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and have chaired the Health Care Subcommittee, and I am here in the short amount of time I have been allotted to commend the Appropriations Committee for a couple of provisions included in this bill. One deals with travel. 
   This bill increases the travel reimbursement for our veterans going to a VA hospital or facility from 28.5 cents per mile to 41.5 cents per mile, while we have been discussing the cost of gasoline that has real effects upon our veterans. 
   As we work to boost VA health care funding, it's important to be reminded that the exceptional medical service that is offered by the VA can only be enjoyed if the veteran can afford to travel to that facility to see that physician. 
   For most of the time I have been in Congress, I have offered an amendment to the appropriations process to increase that mileage rate. For 30 years, it was 11 cents a mile. Last year, we were successful in increasing it to 28.5 cents and, today, 41.5 cents. I commend my colleagues for their support for that change. 
   Today's high gas prices mean that many veterans would not otherwise be able to see and be provided with the health care they need. 
   The second provision is fee-based care. I am pleased that this subcommittee and the committee has added $200 million in fee-based services to improve access to veterans care. Earlier this week on the suspension calendar we had legislation that I introduced that would allow a pilot project to access our veterans to health care providers outside the VA system for fee-based care. If you live such a long distance between where you live and the hospital, or where you live and the CBOC, the outpatient clinic, you would be entitled to receive that service through a private pay contract from the VA to that care provider. That bill is H.R. 1527. I am still hopeful it will be on the House floor this week. But this bill provides the funding to allow that service to happen. 
   So, again, as a Member of Congress who cares strongly about our veterans and who represents a district that is rural, this bill is important, and makes significant strides in taking care of our rural veterans.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, despite my belief in the inadequacies of the President's new strategy, to vote for the resolution with the troops already deployed is a step I cannot take. I am unwilling to--after the fact--say to them, I oppose your mission. 
   My vote should not be interpreted as approval of the administration's conduct of this war. I have had the opportunity to meet General David Petraeus, the new commander of the U.S. forces in Iraq. I believe he is one of the most capable military commanders America has available for this mission. General Petraeus has indicated there is a chance for success and that he will report to the American people in 6 months as to whether or not the President's plan is working. 
   Let us give the new leaders and the new strategy this short period of time to see if stability can be achieved--an investment necessary to ensure the lives lost and families damaged thus far have not sacrificed in vain.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (CALLING ON THE LEAGUE OF ARAB STATES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GENOCIDE IN DARFUR -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey yielding time. He has been a leader on this and other issues for so long, and I am honored to be here with him here today. 
   Madam Speaker, often on this floor, way too often from my perspective, we see a divisive, partisan discussion and debate. But, Madam Speaker, today we speak about an issue in which there is no partisanship and there is no political divide, and that, Madam Speaker, is what is transpiring and has transpired over the last several years in Darfur. 
   We know that there have been 2 million citizens of Sudan who no longer live in their homes or villages. We know that there has been 450,000 people killed in Sudan. It is something that demands our attention. It is something that we as Congress, we as a country, we as a world, must come together to bring the death and destruction, the inhumanity and the hunger and violence to an end. 
   Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity several weeks ago to join the honorable majority leader (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of this House, along with the ranking Republican of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, to visit Darfur. And there, of course, we had the opportunity to visit with government officials, as we in Congress often do. But we also had the opportunity to see for ourselves the conditions that human beings are living in today. And while I hope our meetings with government officials were useful, I know the view I saw, the scenes that were brought to my attention, the people of Darfur I met transcend any meeting I could have had with a government official to discuss what is going on. But it was an opportunity for me to see my life change as a human being, and to see that we all have a cause to see that life prevails and justice endures. 
   Upon my return, Madam Speaker, last Tuesday I took the opportunity to visit the Holocaust Museum. That week was the Week of Remembrance of the Holocaust. And while there, I saw the quote from Isaiah, Isaiah 43:10, ``You are my witness.'' Madam Speaker, that speaks to me and should speak to all of us. We are the witnesses of a holocaust today. 
   Many Members of Congress, much more so than me and for much longer periods of time, have paid attention to this issue and have been trying to rise to the occasion and bring awareness to the world, and I commend those colleagues who have been outspoken on this issue for a long, long time, and today I join them. 
   Recently, I returned back to the Holocaust Museum where President Bush spoke. He spoke certainly about the remembrance of the death and destruction of the Jewish community, the people of Jewish faith who have suffered, but he also brought home the importance of addressing genocide and death today. 
   I commend the President for his demands that the Sudanese Government allow the African Union and the United Nations peacekeeping force, that they be allowed to reach out and be increased in their force, that they reach out to rebel leaders, that the Sudanese Government end its support for violent janjaweed militia and they permit humanitarian aid workers to do their work. President Bush outlined some steps that we as a country are willing to take and requests that we will make to the United Nations. 
   Congress designated last week as The Days of Remembrance in order to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust. While at the Holocaust Museum, I learned much about the reach of the Holocaust and saw the images of death and dehumanization. 
   As I reflected upon the Jews' past and considered the future of African tribes in Darfur, I have a question to ask: Are we going to wait until the proportions of death are similar to the Holocaust before we take action? 
   The part of the exhibit that moved me the most, Madam Speaker, was the list of 10,000 individuals who took action during the Holocaust. They have been identified by the Israelis as ``the Righteous Among the Nations,'' those who risked their lives to save innocent Jews during Nazi rule.  
   When the conflict in Darfur has ended, everyone will feel sorrow for the unnecessary loss of life. But will our Nation be among those, will we, as individuals, be among those who feel shame for inaction, or will we have the opportunity to have pride for standing up for justice in Darfur?

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana. 
   Madam Speaker, I voted in favor of H.R. 6331 and will vote to override the President's veto today. This is a very important piece of legislation for those of us who care strongly about our communities and their survival. And in rural America the delivery of health care is in jeopardy. The pharmaceutical aspect of this bill is one that perhaps has been understated. But those of us who care about the community pharmacists believe that the direction that this bill provides in requiring a timely payment through prompt payments under part D and the elimination for 1 year of the average manufacturers' price, which will undercut the ability of pharmacists to deliver prescription drugs under Medicaid, and the elimination of bidding for durable medical equipment is awfully important. 
   Much of the focus is upon the elimination of the 10 percent reduction in reimbursement to our physicians for Medicare. And I want to quote from one of my physicians back home in Kansas in a letter to me dated July 7. ``It is with mixed emotions that I am writing to inform you of my intent to leave my Family Medicine practice in Kansas. I have reached the point where I am no longer willing to expose myself or my family to the risk of having to rely upon an increasingly unreliable (and poor) source of income; specifically Medicare. I do not have the margin to absorb others' incompetence or our government's capricious reimbursement. I am no longer willing to be a pawn in the ideological chess match in Washington and therefore as of today I will no longer accept Medicare patients. 
   ``I am at a point in my career where I must consider my family as well as my retirement. We once again have been threatened with an across-the-board 10 percent cut. Congress and the Medicare system are taking advantage of good-intentioned physicians who are more interested in caring for patients and upholding and honoring the Hippocratic Oath than lining their pockets. I feel a sense of guilt, as though I am betraying my Medicare patients. I have realized, however, that it is not I that has betrayed the elderly, rather Congress.''  
   I think it's important for us to move forward with this legislation. It's a matter of survival for the delivery of health care to many seniors, particularly those who come from places like I do where the population is Medicare dependent. And I appreciate the gentleman from Louisiana giving me the opportunity to express my position and to indicate once again that I will override President Bush's veto.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from Maryland in honoring the men and women who served in the United States Merchant Marine, and H. Res. 413 does just that. It recognizes the important role the Merchant Marine plays in ensuring our national security and strengthening our national economy. 
   The 465 U.S.-flag oceangoing commercial vessels and the approximately 69,000 men and women that comprise the U.S. Merchant Marine provide critical services to the United States, the transportation of maritime commerce to and from U.S. ports and their support for our armed services in times of national emergency. 
   It's appropriate that we do this today. This is National Maritime Day, which was designated by Congress to pay tribute to the merchant mariners, both current and past, and recognize their faithful service to the United States of America. Since 1933, the Nation has celebrated and commemorated the service of the merchant mariners on May 22 each year. 
   I, too, commend the resolution sponsored by my friend and colleague from California (Mr. Filner) for introducing this legislation. I join him in urging all Members to support this bill and the United States Merchant Marine. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHY TO THE CITIZENS OF GREENSBURG, KANSAS -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman from Maryland, I'm very grateful for his support and for his help in bringing this legislation to the House floor today. 
   I rise in support of H. Res. 400, which I introduced along with my fellow colleagues from Kansas. It does express the sympathy of the House of Representatives for the loss of life and the tremendous property damage to a community in my district of a population of about 1,500. 
   The tornado occurred at about 10 p.m. on Friday evening, May 4, now a little more than 2 weeks ago. It was an F-5 tornado, one of the most powerful tornados to strike the United States in more than 8 years. It was fortunate that the people of Greensburg had a 20-minute warning, that the National Weather Service performed its function. An emergency was declared, and people had 20 minutes to try to save their families' lives and to move to safety. 
   My guess is that that 20 minutes went by in a flash. Mr. Speaker, while 20 minutes may go by in a flash, I'm sure that the 2 minutes that the tornado was on the ground went by very, very slowly. It was an eternity. In that 20 minutes of warning, people did what they could do. In that 2 minutes, at least the buildings of the community were destroyed; 205-mile-an-hour winds can do great damage. 
   Mr. Speaker, we in Kansas are accustomed from time to time to tornados, but never have I seen the devastation and destruction that occurs to one community. The losses are significant. Certainly our prayers and support are with the families of those 10 individuals who died that night, but 95 percent of the town is gone. There is no high school. There is no grade school. There is no city hall. There is no hospital. There is no library. The entire business district, six or seven blocks of a business district in the county seat town, not a business remains. 
   Sixty-three people were injured, and while faced with such destruction, I've been to Greensburg seven times in the last 2 weeks, I have seen nothing but the sense of spirit about rebuilding lives. You can stand in front of a home that is totally destroyed and listen to the people there sorting through the rubble, trying to find something of value, and when you have a conversation with them, it doesn't take long before a smile appears on their face and they talk about how things could be worse than they are, how we're better off than our neighbors, how we'll get through this. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, in what is truly a time of devastation, it's also truly a  time of hope. And what we saw in Kansas that night and every day since reaffirms my belief in the value of caring for your family, love and compassion for your neighbor, that your community matters, and a sense that together we can get through this. 
   I'm proud, Mr. Speaker, to see the tremendous support that comes from across the country. Many Members of the House of Representatives have stopped to visit with me. Many ambassadors and Presidents of foreign countries have sent notes of condolences and concern. And I appreciate that President Bush came to Greensburg, Kansas, last Wednesday and spent 4 hours commiserating with the people of that community. 
   There is a sense in America that we're all in this together, and in this case the sense is more than just a feeling. It's been a reality. 
   An example, the nearby community of Haviland, population about 450, the grocery store there was open last Sunday. It's a typical grocery store in a small town. My guess is it makes no money. It's more of a community service than it is a business. It has the old wooden floors and the tin ceiling that is very traditional, very common in communities I represent. And I watched as the owner of the grocery store stood behind the counter, and people brought groceries to the counter and placed them there, ready to pay, and he would ask the question, ``Where are you from?'' And if the answer was, Greensburg, his answer was, ``No charge.'' 
   We've seen this exhibited time and time again by friends and family, but even as important as that, we've seen it demonstrated time and time again by people who know no one in Greensburg, Kansas. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, the tragedy was tremendous, the destruction was great, but in reality, people have the faith in their future and are willing to take the steps necessary to see that their community is rebuilt and that their children and grandchildren have a future in Greensburg. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution commending these people of Greensburg, Kansas, for their spirit, their bravery, their compassion, their love for friends and family, and I also say thank you to the Members of the House of Representatives and to Americans around the country who also have taken the steps to make sure that good things happen in the future of Greensburg. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHY TO THE CITIZENS OF GREENSBURG, KANSAS -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Beside me I have a photograph of Greensburg, Kansas, taken shortly after the tornado that perhaps gives Members of the House of Representatives and really America a sense of the extent of the destruction. 
   And there are Members of Congress, I suppose, who come from places different than the middle of America, and let me describe Greensburg, Kansas, to you. 
   Greensburg, Kansas, is a community of about 1,500 people. It's the county seat town of Kiowa County. It is the hub of activity for that county. It's in many ways a typical community that I represent. Its downtown consists of four or five blocks on both sides of the street of businesses, the hardware store, a drugstore, a grocery store. There's the seats of government, the city hall, the library, the hospital, the courthouse. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's a community in which people have lived there, in many instances, for four and five generations, and it's a community that welcomes newcomers. In fact, that's the plea of every Kansas community: We'd like to grow and see some prosperity, see new people in our town. 
   And so this is a community that has a combination of people who are senior citizens and young folks, a community that has folks who have lived there generation after generation, generally involved in agriculture, farming and ranching; but it's also a community that embraces new ideas and new people, a look toward the future. It's a community that has numerous churches, and yet today, as we talk about Greensburg, those structures, those buildings are gone. 
   But in many ways, what's happened in Greensburg only reinforces who the people who call Greensburg home are. The fact that the buildings are gone is something they will live with. In fact, their response was how quickly can we get back into town so we can begin the process of rebuilding our homes, our businesses and our lives. 
   On Saturday, I was in Greensburg for high school graduation. As I indicated, Greensburg is a town of about 1,500 people. Twenty-five seniors from Greensburg High School graduated on Saturday morning. Graduation was held under a tent on the golf course, the golf course because it's the only place in town that has no debris and rubble. Population 1,500, there were 1,800 people at graduation. They were there to tell the students, congratulations and best wishes.     
   They were also there to reinforce the importance of community, that life revolves around what goes on in the town, and life revolves around its future based upon its young people. Once again we saw the demonstration of how friends and family and neighbors and people who don't even know anybody in Greensburg came together in one more instance to make certain that there was love and compassion and care and concern demonstrated for the people of this community. I am so grateful again for the opportunity to represent the people of a community like Greensburg, Kansas. 
   The question particularly by the national media has been, Congressman, do you believe they will rebuild their community? I can tell you that effort is ongoing today, and it began on Saturday, Saturday morning the day after the tornado, and it continues each and every moment. 
   The city administrator, the mayor, the sheriff, the police chief, the county commissioners, the city council members all lost their homes. Yet Saturday morning, they were all gathered there to try to restore the services for electricity and gas and power and water to  the community. They lost everything, but yet, as community leaders, they were there. 
   My friend, Dennis McKinney, the Democrat leader of the House of Representatives of the State of Kansas, announced on Sunday, a week ago, ``I have already hired the contractor to rebuild the house on the same foundation where I lived before the tornado, because leaders have to be leaders.'' Again, we see the determination of people. 
   What I answered to the national media who asked me if they think Greensburg will be rebuilt, I don't know a lot of people in other communities, but I know the people of Greensburg, Kansas. In Kansas and in Greensburg, Kansas, we all have a place we love. It's called ``home.'' 
   There is a great attraction to make certain that we do everything in this Congress, that the Federal Government responds appropriately to help the folks of Greensburg. I can tell you that the love of home is sufficient, that the people of Greensburg, Kansas, are rebuilding today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (HONOR FLIGHT HONORS OUR WORLD WAR II VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is a special day. The story begins several years ago. In 2004, just a few days before its dedication, I put on my tennis shoes and walked outside  the U.S. Capitol Building and beyond the Washington Monument to the newly constructed World War II Memorial on the National Mall. As we know, it was inspiring. At long last, nearly 60 years after the war ended, veterans who did so much to protect our country and liberate the world, were to receive recognition for their service, their sacrifice and the victory through a national monument. 
   I had my cell phone with me, and I stepped away from the memorial and I called my 90-year-old father back in our hometown of Plainville. He is one of the thousands of Americans who left their families and lives behind in World War II to fight for our country. My father fought in Northern Africa and Sicily and Italy. 
   Fortunately, when I called, I got the answering machine. It's often difficult for sons and daughters to tell their fathers the things we should tell them. The message I left my dad was, ``Dad, I love you. Dad, I'm proud of you, and Dad, thank you for your service to our country.'' I told my dad what I should have said a long time ago, and what we all should say to our veterans. 
   It was too bad that many of the veterans of this greatest generation, now in their 80s and 90s, are unable, physically or financially, to visit our Nation's Capitol and see this beautiful tribute to their service and sacrifice and to hear those important words. 
   Earlier this year, Senator Bob Dole, himself a World War II veteran who led the charge to build the memorial, told me about a grassroots, not-for-profit organization called Honor Flight. Honor Flight enables World War II veterans to travel to our Nation's Capital to see the memorial created in their honor. Staffed by volunteers and funded by donations, Honor Flight used commercial and chartered flights to send veterans on a one-day, expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C.     
   Earl Morse of Ohio and Jeff Miller of North Carolina created the Honor Flight Network, which now operates in 30 States. 
   Over the past months I have joined Senator Dole to greet Kansas veterans arriving at the World War II Memorial by means of Honor Flight. It is a very moving experience as veterans recount tales of their time in the service to volunteers who are often local high school students. Tourists stop their sightseeing to shake the veterans' hands, and you see the excitement of the veterans' eyes, and many are moved to tears. It's a special day for that generation of heroes. 
   Of the 16 million veterans who served in World War II, only 2.5 million are alive today. And we are losing them at a rate of 900 each day. Honor Flight is working against time to say ``thank you'' to these veterans. 
   Tomorrow, after months of preparation and fundraising by volunteers, an Honor Flight of World War II veterans from Plainville to Stockton, from Hays, Hill City, Ness City, and a lot of other small towns of northwest Kansas will be arriving in Washington, D.C. On that flight will be my father, my dad, and 101 of his fellow Kansas veterans will finally see firsthand the World War II Memorial and experience our Nation's gratitude for their service. 
   Tonight I want to thank the Honor Flight Network and the thousands of volunteers and donors across the country who make these moving experiences possible. In particular, I thank Pat Hageman of Natoma for organizing tomorrow's Honor Flight, the students from Rooks County high schools who are serving as volunteers, the medical personnel, and especially the local businesses, individuals, and veterans service organizations in northwest Kansas who have financed this Honor Flight. 
   I doubt my dad or any of the other men and women who will be in Washington, D.C., tomorrow will be able to sleep when they go to bed tonight in the small towns across Kansas. They will lay wide awake with nervous anticipation and excitement. But though they lay awake tonight, the rest of America has been able to sleep because of the sacrifice of the World War II veterans. 
   Tomorrow, once again we all can say that these men and women of our country and our country's other World War II veterans, ``We love you; we are proud of you, and we thank you for your service to our country.''

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (VETERANS' PROGRAMS EXTENSION AND CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 6832, the Department of Veterans Affairs Construction and Extensions Act of 2008. I again thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for bringing this bill forward today. And I also want to thank the leaders of the Subcommittee on Health, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) for their bipartisan efforts in crafting this important legislation.  
   The construction authorization provisions in title I of this bill are identical to previously passed legislation here in the House, the construction authorization bill H.R. 5856, and they would authorize major VA medical facility projects and leases for the fiscal year 2009. This legislation is similar to what we have done in the past on an annual basis. The Veterans' Affairs Committee report for that bill H.R. 5856 with further explanation of the legislation background and intent of these construction authorizations. 
   Collectively, the provisions authorize approximately $2.2 billion over the next 5 years to improve access to health care for our Nation's veterans. The extension portion of this bill, the extension authorities in title III include a number of important authorizations. Ranking Member Buyer introduced a bill to extend the expiring authorities, H.R. 6802, on August 1 of this year, and this bill incorporates those extensions and others. 
   Among those that are significant and important are: Repeal of sunset on inclusion of non-institutional extended care services; permanent authority for provision of hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care to veterans who participated in certain chemical and biological testing; extension of nursing home care; and, extension of certain home loan guaranty programs. 
   The bill, in title III, would also increase the number of veterans participating in the independent living program and enhance refinancing of home loans by veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, with House action on this construction authorization and the extension of authorities, as well as the veterans' COLA we just passed a few moments ago in the form of Senate bill 2617, the House will have taken what many consider the must-pass bills for the 2008 session for the 110th Congress. Our hope is that our Senate colleagues will take up H.R. 6832 promptly, so that we may complete the actions on these legislative items that are of great importance to veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6832. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I am a supporter of S. 2617, the Veterans Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2008. On May 21 of this year, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5826, the Veterans Compensation Cost-of-Living Act of 2008, introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Rodriguez. 
   The legislation before us today is the Senate companion to that bill. It would increase, effective December 1, 2008, the rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled veterans. 
   I would like to thank the gentleman from California, the chairman, Mr. Filner, and the ranking member, the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Buyer, for bringing this bill to the floor in a timely manner, and acknowledge the efforts by our colleagues, the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Mr. Hall, and the ranking member, Mr. Lamborn, for their work and leadership on improving benefits for our veterans. 
   The legislation before us is an important annual authorization which provides our Nation's veterans with a timely increase in their compensation later this year. It was requested by the Bush administration, and the House passage today will send this bill to the President to be signed into law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (RURAL VETERANS ACCESS TO CARE ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in obvious support of H.R. 1527, as amended, the Rural Veterans Access to Care Act. This is a piece of legislation that I have worked on for a number of years, and I am pleased that under the leadership of Mr. Filner and Mr. Buyer this bill is now on the House floor, and I am excited about the opportunities that it presents to better care for veterans who live in rural America. 
   About 39 percent of our veterans enrolled in VA health care live in those rural areas. Many face challenges of accessing VA care because of the distances between where they live and where the facilities are located. 
   We are making some progress in regard to rural veterans. In the last several years, we have approved an amendment that I have offered for a number of years increasing the veterans' mileage reimbursement rate from 11 cents per mile to 28.5 cents per mile. The fiscal year 2009 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill that we passed earlier this year, back in July, would increase that from 28.5 cents to 40 cents per mile. So that's one step we have taken to help our rural veterans better access health care. 
   Recently the VA established an Office of Rural Health and a Rural Health Advisory Committee to develop solutions to the challenges of providing health care to veterans living in rural America, and the VA continues to expand community-based outpatient clinics and will activate an additional 44 new clinics in the next 15 months, bringing the number of those clinics to more than 1,000. The VA has also increased the number of readjustment counseling service centers, the Vet Centers, nationwide with plans to open an additional 39 Vet Centers by the fall of 2009. In my home State of Kansas, we have opened an outpatient clinic this year in Hutchinson and opened a Vet Center in Manhattan, Kansas; so progress is being made. 
   However, despite all those efforts, the reality is that many veterans live in remote areas of the country beyond the VA's ability to construct medical facilities to care for them. The congressional district that I represent in Kansas is an example of an instance where veterans experience great difficulty in traveling to VA facilities. My congressional district is more than the size of the State of Illinois. It has more hospitals than any other congressional district in the country but not one VA hospital. Some Kansas veterans are forced to travel up to 5 hours to a VA hospital for the care they need; and, unfortunately, more often than it should be, they simply forego that care altogether. 
   H.R. 1527, as amended, would require the VA to conduct a 3-year demonstration project to allow highly rural veterans living in four VISNs, Veterans Integrated Service Networks, to receive the covered services through non-VA providers. 
   This pilot will ask the VA to explore in several regions a practical approach when the VA care is not otherwise available close by. It would give those who live the farthest from VA facilities the choice to receive their care closer to home at the local hospital or the local physician's office. 
   There are criteria by which a veteran must qualify to receive this kind of assistance. A veteran must live at least 60 miles from a VA clinic, 120 miles from a VA hospital, or 240 miles from a VA specialized care facility when they're seeking that kind of health care. To ensure the continuity of care, the legislation requires the VA to develop the functional capabilities to exchange veterans' medical information between the VA and non-VA providers in this pilot, and the VA will be required to report to Congress annually on the cost, upon the quality of care, and upon patient satisfaction. 
   Forty-four percent of our military recruits are from rural areas, as are many Guards and Reserves that our Nation has increasingly called into service. This means that rural veterans are more likely to increase in number. Allowing the most underserved of these veterans to take advantage of the existing rural health care infrastructure is a commonsense approach. This is good for the veteran. It's good for the community. It's good for the health care provider. In many of the hospitals and clinics that I represent, in the communities that I represent, an additional patient is a very important thing. Hospitals in many instances are like schools. One more student matters to the viability of our school system just as one more patient matters to the viability of the private health care providers. We have approved this concept in our appropriation bill earlier this year. In July the VA military construction spending bill approved an additional $200 million to increase access to fee-based care for veterans in areas where the VA does not offer services. And with the high price of gasoline and its impact upon our rural veterans, it's even more important that this legislation pass. 
   We must fully consider this practical reform for highly rural veterans living outside the VA's ability to care for them, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1527. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Let me also take this moment to thank all of the employees, the staff, the medical providers within the VA system in Kansas and across the country who work hard on a daily basis to make certain that our veterans are cared for and also for all those who have volunteered their time, their automobiles, their days, and their driving skills, as we have had many veterans who have helped other veterans get to a medical facility, often miles and distance away.     
   These kinds of volunteer activities have been important and it is a way that some veterans have been able to access health care. But this legislation takes us in a very positive step, one that we have worked on for a long time to achieve, and I am very pleased by the efforts that we see, the culmination of those efforts that we see today. 
   Finally, let me thank the staff of the Veterans' Committee, both the minority and majority. I appreciate the approach and attitude, the diligence with which we have addressed this legislation. It has had its false starts as recently as a month ago. I am very grateful for the efforts that all made to make certain that this legislation is before us today, and in particular I thank the gentleman from California, Mr. Filner, who gave me his word back in early August that this legislation would be on the House floor this week, and I very much appreciate Mr. Filner's efforts.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to congratulate and to pay tribute to the Robert J. Dole Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in my home State in Wichita, Kansas, for 75 years providing outstanding services and care to our Nation's heroes, our veterans. 
   Caring for those who have borne the battle is our Nation's utmost responsibility. And for 75 years, the Dole VA Hospital has helped our Nation honor this commitment. Let us take time today to pay tribute to the work of the Dole VA leadership staff and volunteers and the Kansas veterans they  serve each day. Veterans are the people I hold in highest regard only to be exceeded by those individuals who serve those veterans. 
   Under the skillful leadership of the VA Network 15 Director Dr. Peter Almenoff and hospital director Tom Sanders, the Dole VA Hospital has worked to fulfill its mission: ``To improve the health and wellbeing of veterans we are honored to serve.'' In fact, the Dole VA has received national acclaim in its service to veterans. On a recent rating of VA hospitals for quality of veterans' care, the Dole VA hospital ranked third in the Nation. Our country is fortunate to have these individuals who made the commitment to serve these veterans. What we do in Washington, D.C., pales in comparison to what these individuals do each and every day for our veterans. 
   On November 16, 1933, the first patient, a veteran of the Spanish-American War, was admitted to the hospital. At that time, there were 150 beds. By the end of 1933, all beds had been filled. In 2008 over 2,000 admissions were recorded at the hospital. The Center now provides a full range of primary, acute and extended care services to veterans from 59 counties in Kansas. Many of these counties make up the First Congressional District that I represent. And despite covering more than 57,000 square miles, the First District is without a VA hospital of its own. Veterans in central and western Kansas rely on the care and services provided by the Dole VA. We are blessed to have such an outstanding facility in Kansas available to those who have given so much on our behalf. 
   Last month, I had the opportunity to participate in the 75th anniversary jubilee in Wichita attended by the hospital's namesake, former United States Senator Bob Dole, a member of the country's greatest generation and an unending advocate for veterans. Also attending the celebration was the Veterans Department Secretary James Peake, Kansas Senators PAT ROBERTS and SAM BROWNBACK, Kansas Congressman TODD TIAHRT, and Wichita Mayor Carl Brewer. 
   We listened to Dole speak of his own military service and recovery from wounds he received in World War II in a VA hospital, as well as his leadership in building the World War II Memorial, as co-chair of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. With his legacy of service and sacrifice to our country and its veterans, Senator Dole is an appropriate namesake and inspiration for the hard work and dedication of the leadership, staff and volunteers at the Dole VA. 
   Again, I wish to congratulate the Dole VA Medical Center for 75 years of care to our country's veterans. On behalf of veterans in Kansas, I thank them for their service.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (FARM BILL -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, today, the House of Representatives debated the conference report on what we in Kansas call the farm bill. Here in Washington, it's now called the Food, Conservation, Energy Security Act, and I note that the word ``farm'' is now missing from the farm bill. 
   As I indicate to Kansans, there probably is no more important piece of legislation that this Congress will consider than the 2008 farm bill from a Kansas perspective. Certainly, not every Kansan is a farmer, not every Kansan is a rancher, but agriculture is the backbone of the Kansas economy, and policies that we determine here today in the House of Representatives and tonight later in the Senate affect the Kansas economy and a way of life that we have revered in our State for generations. 
   Agriculture is not only a business. It's not only a way of earning a living. In fact, it's a very difficult way of earning a living. It is the opportunity that we have in our State for sons and daughters to work side-by-side with moms and dads. It's the opportunity for us to pass on values from one generation to the next. 
   And today, Madam Speaker, I worry that the legislation that we will soon be sending to the President is inadequate to meet the needs of Kansas producers and American agriculture. 
   In the 2002 farm bill, we passed a security net, a safety net for our farmers, and it's a three-pronged approach to making certain that our farmers are secure and have an opportunity to survive in difficult times, whether those times are difficult because of low commodity prices or difficult because the weather does not cooperate. 
   And today, Madam Speaker, we chose to reduce that security, that safety net that provides Kansans a future. 
   I had two criteria in trying to determine whether or not the farm bill was something I should vote for. One: Is this farm bill better? Is the 2007, now 2008, farm bill better than the one that was adopted by Congress in 2002? And clearly, the answer to that is no. 
   And the second criteria comes from listening to farmers for the last 2 and 3 years about what a new farm bill should look like. In fact, I listened to American producers from across the country. Since the passage of the last farm bill, I've chaired or been the ranking Republican, Republican leader on the subcommittee responsible for all farm programs and participated in 15 hearings across the country. And what I heard time and time again, especially from the folks back home is, whatever you do, Jerry, make certain that we don't lose the direct payment and make certain that crop insurance remains a viable option for us to protect  ourselves from risk. And unfortunately, once again, those two criteria were not met today. 
   So Madam Speaker, I pledge to my colleagues in the House of Representatives, and particularly my friends on the House Agriculture Committee, to continue to work in a very strong and bipartisan way to see if we can't improve the lives of farmers in Kansas and States across the country. 
   I served on the conference committee that provided the report that we have had before us today, and I offered amendments and supported amendments that I think would make significant improvements in the 2008 farm bill. They were rejected on straight, party-line votes, and it's a sad day for me because I've always enjoyed my work in the Agriculture Committee because I care about farmers and ranchers, and I care about their way of life. But never has our committee been partisan, and again, I pledge myself to work with my colleagues to see if we can restore the days in which we were in this together on behalf of American agriculture. 
   Madam Speaker, it's my belief that if we're going to spend as much money as we spend in this farm bill, which is a significant sum of money, we ought to spend it in much more wise and prudent ways than this conference report provides. We owe it to farmers across the country, and we owe it to the taxpayers of this Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague from Washington indicated, the Government Accountability Office this afternoon confirmed what many of us thought to be true--the Air Force's process in selecting a contractor to build a new air refueling tanker was badly flawed. The GAO upheld Boeing's protest, concluding that the Air Force ``made a number of significant errors.'' The GAO recommends this contract be re-bid. 
   This contract was awarded several months ago, and every conversation I have had with Air Force officials raised more questions than were answered. I agree with this independent finding. The Air Force should follow the GAO's recommendation and reopen the bidding. 
   Awarding this contract to Boeing would create thousands of American jobs. But the bigger question is should we even allow a foreign-subsidized company to bid for U.S. military work? While the GAO rejected the Air Force's process, Congress also needs to address the broader issue of keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States. 
   I urge the Air Force and Congress to work to make the right choice for American jobs, American taxpayers and the American military men and women.

   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the testimony and words as spoken by the gentleman from Illinois. I rise tonight to speak to congratulate Ross and Marianna Beach and the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art on the occasion of the museum's grand reopening. Located in Manhattan, on the campus of Kansas State University, the Beach Museum of Art has become a cherished cultural center in the Flint Hills of my home State. Over the years, the museum has nearly tripled the number of their works of art and has enhanced the lives of thousands of patrons. 
   Originally opening on October 16, 1996, the museum offers a wide array of services to the area. While continually adding to the collection of regionally inspired art, the museum contributors have also made educational programs, lectures, tours, and workshops available. The new 15,000 square-foot addition of the Mary and Morgan Jarvis Wing is evidence of the museum's continuing success and benefit. 
   Believing in art appreciation and education, the Beach Museum is poised to contribute to the culture in Kansas for generations to come. The impact the museum has on Kansas is immeasurable. Located on the campus of a nationally ranked university and in close proximity to Fort Riley, the Beach Museum serves a highly diverse population. Students, along with military personnel and their families, come from all over the globe to live, work, and learn. This oftentimes short-term community is always pleased to discover an art museum of such fine quality. 
   Through the efforts of Kansas State University president Dr. Jon Wefald and his wife, Ruth Ann, the museum has gained national notoriety. Mrs. Wefald's leadership on the museum advisory board has proven to be a major factor in the museum's rapid growth and expansion. 
   The university, the City of Manhattan and the State of Kansas have benefited tremendously from the Wefalds' dedication. Gratitude is owed for their committed devotion to the museum. Museum director Lorne Render should be commended for guiding the museum into the 21st century. Through Lorne's service to the arts, the Beach Museum continues to offer exhibits and programs that enhance the quality of life of all Kansans and, in fact, many Americans. As the museum continues to contribute to the appreciation of the arts, appreciation should be extended to Lorne for the museum and the museum's knowledgeable staff. 
   The museum would not have been possible but for the generous philanthropic ideals exhibited by the lead donors, Ross and Marianna Beach. The Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art was named by Mr. Beach for his wife in commemoration of their 50th wedding anniversary. Mr. And Mrs. Beach are longtime donors of talent and treasure to the State of Kansas. Their commitments to the arts extend beyond the Beach Museum in Manhattan. They were instrumental in establishing the Beach/Schmidt Performing Arts Center on the campus of Fort Hays State University in Hays, Kansas. This center has been providing a venue for plays, speeches, debates, and concerts for more than 20 years. The Beachs' commitment to the arts extends across the State and is appreciated by Kansans from all walks of life. 
   My wife and I are proud to serve on the museum's board of visitors. We have witnessed, firsthand, the results Ross and Marianna Beach have attained. It is certain that the Beach legacy will be experienced by thousands of people for generations to come.  
   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in acknowledging the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art along with Ross and Marianna Kistler Beach for their contributions to our society. Kansas is proud to have the museum for our enlightenment and enjoyment. And I am also proud to call Ross and Marianna Beach my friends and fellow Kansans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As we all know, our Nation owes its very existence to the brave men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. The freedoms and liberties that we cherish today were attained and protected through their sacrifice. These patriotic citizens have earned and should be provided the highest quality health care available. 
   I want to thank the leaders of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Chairman Filner, Ranking Member Buyer, as well as Subcommittee on Health Chairman Michaud and Ranking Member Miller for their bipartisan efforts in developing the bill before us today. I also want to thank Mr. Hodes for introducing this legislation to establish an Office of Ombudsman within Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   In 2007, following the disclosure of problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the President established a Task Force on Returning Global War on Terror Heroes and a Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. My predecessor in Congress, Senator Dole, co-chaired this commission. 
   The recommendations of this commission compelled the VA to initiative a variety of measures to better assist veteran patients and their families. Such initiatives included appointing patient counselor advocates at each VA medical center, providing coordinators for returning OEF and OIF veterans, providing transition patient advocates and establishing the Joint Federal Recovery Coordinator program to assist seriously wounded servicemembers. 
   H.R. 2192, as amended, would establish a centralized office to monitor the performance of these employees and provide veterans with a single point of contact for assistance with problems that cannot be resolved at the local level. The office would also track patient issues and complaints throughout the system and provide recommendations for improvements in policies, practices and procedures. 
   I support H.R. 2192, as amended, to ensure that our veterans receive the highest quality health care available, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I rise in support of H.R. 6445, as amended, the Veterans' Health Care Policy Enhancement Act of 2008, a bill that amends title 38 to the United States Code to prohibit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from collecting certain copayments from veterans who are catastrophically disabled, and a number of other purposes. H.R. 6445 includes the text of four other bills introduced by Members, both Republican and Democrat, and all provisions have bipartisan support. 
   Section 2 of the bill would ensure that veterans who have been determined to be catastrophically disabled from nonservice-connected would not be required to pay any copayment for their inpatient, outpatient, and long-term care needs. These veterans, because of their very complex medical needs, depend heavily upon the VA for their health care. 
   There are currently about 25,000 seriously disabled veterans who would benefit from this provision, and I thank our new colleague, the gentleman from Louisiana, Representative Cazayoux, for introducing this bill. 
   Section 3 of the bill would eliminate an outdated statutory requirement that a veteran being treated for a nonservice-connected condition be hospitalized in order for the VA to provide counseling services to the family members. In today's delivery of health care, this makes no sense. We must ensure that all families, regardless of the nature of the veteran's condition, are eligible for needed and valuable support services that will aid in the treatment of that veteran patient. I want to thank my friend and colleague from the committee, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hare) for bringing this provision forward. 
   Section 4 of the bill would require the VA to maintain current pain management policy and ensure that the policy is both effective and implemented in a consistent manner throughout the VA health care delivery system. The VA has long recognized the importance of providing early and appropriate care for management of pain. 
   In 1998, the VA developed a strategy of ``Pain Assessment, the Fifth Vital Sign,'' which established procedures for pain assessment, treatment, and outcomes at all VA clinical settings. The VA further enhanced its efforts in 2003, and issued a new directive establishing the National Pain Management Strategy. This legislation would support those VA efforts. I thank the gentleman, Mr. Walz, for introducing this measure to ensure the VA maintains a national standard to reduce the suffering of our veterans experiencing acute and chronic pain associated with a wide range of illnesses. 
   Section 5 of the bill would improve effectiveness of the VA's process for securing reimbursements from third-party insurance companies. This measure was introduced by our ranking member, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer). Mr. Buyer has long been at the forefront of this issue. Every dollar that goes uncollected is one less additional dollar that can be used to enhance the care of our veterans. 
   The Government Accounting Office has consistently reported the VA's processes and procedures for billing and collecting third-party payments are ineffective and limit the revenue received from those third-party payers. However, in the latest GAO report, June of 2008, the GAO found that the Mid-Atlantic Consolidated Patient Accounting Center, CPAC, achieved better billing performances and reduced billing time, leading to improved collections. The GAO also noted the VA may be leaving over $1.4 billion in uncollected care. 
   In 2005, the VA created the Mid-Atlantic CPAC in Asheville, North Carolina, to maximize its collections by using a private sector model tailored to VA billing and collection needs. Last Congress, we directed the VA to establish a Revenue Demonstration Project to improve its collections and develop a systemwide model to improve its performance. In fiscal year 2007, CPAC achieved 110 percent of its expected collections, a $20.3 million increase from its performance in the previous fiscal year. 
   Approximately $12 million for the fiscal year 2007 in additional collections was generated as a result of the Revenue Improvement Demonstration Project. Expanding this project will  continue to improve the VA's collections. Mr. Buyer's measure would require VA to establish no more than seven CPACs within 5 years, modeled after the successful Asheville, North Carolina project. 
   Improving collections is a win-win for our Nation's veterans, and I want to commend the ranking member for his continued work in this regard. 
   Finally, Section 6 of the bill would repeal outdated statutory language that requires the VA to provide separate written informed consent for HIV testing, as well as pre-and post-test counseling. Since the requirements were codified almost 20 years ago, there is a better understanding of HIV and its transmission. 
   The administration in its FY 2009 budget proposal requested this change in law so that veteran patients receive the same standard of HIV care that is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
   Ensuring veterans receive the best care possible requires effective use of VA authorities and resources for the provision of that medical care. I urge my colleagues to support the Veterans' Health Care Policy Enhancement Act. 
   I now reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE AND WESTERN STATES EMERGENCY UNFINISHED BUSINESS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the distinguished gentleman from California for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support, strong support, of the legislation that is before us this evening. In fact, my number one agriculture priority for 2007 is the passage of legislation similar to what we are addressing this evening. 
   We are going to deal with the farm bill later this year, but the reality is that many farmers in America and certainly the farmers I know in Kansas will not be around to take advantage of the provisions of the 2007 farm bill, absent some kind of assistance, due to no fault of their own. 
   In Kansas, we have struggled through five and six years of drought followed by this year's December 31, 2006, winter storms that caused 44 of Kansas' 105 counties to be declared natural disasters, followed by a winter freeze, three nights in April in which the temperatures were in the teens and much of what we thought was going to be a wonderful wheat harvest is now destroyed due to the cold weather. And as you have all seen most recently here just a few nights ago, tornadoes, hail and floods have now affected this part as well as the rest of the State of Kansas. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, if we care about an agricultural economy, this disaster assistance is so important. The average age of a farmer today in Kansas is 59 years old. There is almost no next generation. If we want young family farmers, we have got to make certain that the economic opportunities are there. 
   People will look to crop insurance. It doesn't work in the circumstances that we are talking about, multiyear disasters. Many crops, including livestock, are not covered. And we look to the farm bill. It is there for purposes of when the price of the commodity that the farmer sells is lower than the cost of production. So it is only through this type of agricultural assistance that we can see our farmers through from day to day. 
   If you care about life in rural America, if you care about the future of farmers, if you care about the future of the communities they live in, this is an important piece of legislation. In fact, you don't have to be a farmer to gain benefits from agriculture disaster. This is about whether or not in rural America we have people who shop on our Main Streets, whether or not we have kids in our schools. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation, and I ask my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to support this legislation. 
   I thank the majority for allowing it to be brought to the floor tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (LOWER REPUBLICAN RIVER BASIN STUDY ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1025, the Lower Republican River Basin Study Act. I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and the Resources Committee for helping to bring this legislation before the House today. 
   The timing of this legislation is significant, not only for farmers in Kansas who have dealt with successive years of drought and decreased water supplies, but because the respective states have already appropriated funds for the current fiscal year to conduct the feasibility study authorized by this legislation. 
   H.R. 1025 is a product of the Republican River Compact Settlement. That settlement resulted from litigation filed by the State of Kansas against the States of Nebraska and Colorado in 1998 because required amounts of water were not reaching Kansas under the Republican River Compact terms. In 2003, the Republican River Compact Settlement brought that litigation to an end. 
   The Settlement was signed not only by the party States, but also administration officials and was subsequently approved by the United States Supreme Court in 2003. As part of that Settlement, the Parties agreed to have the Secretary of the Interior conduct a study to determine the feasibility of implementing water supply and conservation projects in the Republican River Basin below Harlan Reservoir. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, H.R. 1025 provides that the cost of the study will be shared between the Federal Government and the States of Kansas and Nebraska. 
   As of today, the States have done their part under the settlement agreement. In fact, my home State of Kansas has already appropriated funds for the current fiscal year. I also understand that Mr. Smith's State of Nebraska has done the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, all that remains is for the Federal Government to meet its obligation under the settlement agreement. The feasibility study is desperately needed to increase water availability and encourage more efficient water use and delivery systems. 
   The Lower Republican Basin has a history of periodic droughts and water shortages. The upper third of the Kansas Bostwick Irrigation District, which lies above Lovewell Reservoir, received limited water allocations in 2003 and no water allocations in 2004 and 2005. 
   Producers in the lower two-thirds of the Kansas Bostwick Irrigation District have also experienced water shortages since 2003. Irrigators in this portion of the District have only received half of the base supply they were supposed to receive. The project facilities in the Lower Republican River Basin are over 50 years old. Changed hydrological conditions and aging facilities require better utilization of limited water supplies. 
   Mr. Speaker, the feasibility study authorized by H.R. 1025 is not only necessary to ensure the states remain in compliance with an interstate compact, but also to ensure the economic viability of the rural communities that rely on delivery of a consistent supply of water, and I urge Members to approve this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the gentleman from Indiana for yielding time to me. I express my appreciation to the Chair for recognizing me. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am here today in support of this legislation, but I think this legislation could be significantly improved. I come today to advocate on behalf of veterans who live in rural America, as well as servicemen and -women on leave from active duty. 
   I failed to have the opportunity to attempt to amend this bill in the Veterans' Affairs Committee because of the waiver of its jurisdiction. I appeared yesterday before the Rules Committee seeking the opportunity to offer an amendment today on the House floor. That authorization for offering that amendment was not allowed, was denied.     
   And I am concerned that as we look at veterans and our military retirees, as we look at those actively engaged in the military today and we try to address the needs that they face, there is a large area of veterans, there is a significant veteran and military active military population that are disadvantaged. That is those who live in rural America. 
   I represent a district, a congressional district the size of the State of Illinois, and yet, although we have more hospitals, private community hospitals than any congressional district in the country, there is no VA Hospital. There is no military hospital. And so you can be distanced from that access to care by hours, by 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours. 
   Legislation that I have introduced would try diligently to address that issue, to allow access to the private sector health care providers. If you live further away from a VA Hospital or an outpatient clinic, that you can take your VA card, you can take your active military benefits and see your hometown physician. 
   Examples from my own constituents. A veteran in the community of Hoxie was told he couldn't see the local optometrist, despite the fact that the optometrist is down the street. But, no, he has to go to Wichita, 4 hours away, in order to have his glasses adjusted. 
   Another veteran, who is incapable of travel, was told that, no, the local physician can't refill his prescription. He has got to travel to the VA Hospital in order to do that. 
   This legislation would correct that by allowing, in those circumstances where distances are so great, that the VA can enter into contracts with the private sector to meet the needs of those veterans and that a physician, a private physician, could fill a prescription. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I regret that, although this bill brings to the forefront and addresses many issues that our servicemen and women face, it fails in, at least in my belief, to address the needs that we see from rural veterans. 
   I was pleased that Mr. Barrow, the gentleman from Georgia, who I have joined with in past efforts to try to increase the reimbursement rate for mileage for rural veterans as they travel to a VA Hospital, his amendment was made in order. And I am pleased and will support that, would love to have the opportunity again to speak in favor of it. 
   But these are the kind of issues that we cannot let this Congress ignore. We are not a one-size-solution fits all. And those of us who have concerns for those who choose to live in rural America, we believe we can make this legislation better. So, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the time to speak in favor.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (AMENDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 TO RESTORE THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND BALANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6532. I come from a State located in the middle of the country. Transportation to and from one's home to their work, transportation from the State of Kansas in moving manufactured and agricultural commodities to the rest of the world, we depend upon infrastructure. Our highways are important to us if we are going to continue to compete in a global economy. 
   In the absence of this legislation, the State of Kansas would receive $120 million less, a shortfall which would mean that there is 90 less State and local projects at an estimated loss of 8,250 jobs. 
   Kansas receives about $370 million from the Federal highway trust fund. That would be reduced to $247 million. This is an important piece of legislation that continues to drive the Kansas economy and makes us competitive in a global economy. It is time for us to fix the system now in this short-term manner, but it is also important for Congress to reach a conclusion on how we fund highway and other transportation needs into the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (VETERANS' MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER CARE IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the gentleman from Indiana for yielding me the time, and I am very grateful for the efforts that he and our chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner) have made on this entire legislation. But I'm here tonight to express my gratitude for the inclusion of provisions that for a long time have been a high priority for me as a Member of Congress from a very rural part of America. I have always thought that our veterans should not be discriminated against based upon where they live. And while we've made progress in regard to caring for all our veterans, we've made progress in regard to caring for our rural veterans, we still have a lot of effort that needs to be made. This bill tonight takes one additional step that I think is very important. 
   The Department of Veterans Affairs, through our encouragement, has increased the number of outpatient clinics in this country so that those who live long distances from a VA hospital can access routine health care closer to home. We also have significantly increased the mileage reimbursement rate for veterans who live long distances. That is a major undertaking on our part, particularly with the ever rising cost of gasoline. And so we are making some steps that I think benefit rural veterans. 
   But still, despite that effort, many veterans, including many who live in my congressional district in the State of Kansas, drive up to 5 hours to access a VA outpatient clinic or a VA hospital. And so what a portion of this bill does tonight, the part I want to commend and bring forth for the Members of the House of Representatives to know and to understand, is this bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a 3-year pilot project that gives our highly rural veterans living in rural regions of this country the choice to receive health care at home. What this says is that the veteran can have the opportunity to see his or her hometown physician, be admitted to his or her hometown hospital, and that the Department of Veterans Affairs must enter into a contract to provide those services.  
   So while I am very appreciative of the outpatient clinics and I appreciate the service and care that our VA hospitals provide, we have the opportunity for our veterans, particularly those who are aging, and many of our rural veterans are older every day, many of them are World War II veterans in their eighties and nineties, and a trip that is miles away and hours from home requires a significant undertaking. This allows those who are that distance, and that distance being about 60 miles from a VA clinic, 120 miles from a VA hospital or 240 miles from a specialized care facility, to have those services provided at home. 
   It's also a good thing for the rural health care provider. I always describe it this way: Our hospitals, the infrastructure that surrounds the delivery of health care in rural America, is a lot like schools. We need every student we can get in a rural school to keep the school going, just as our hospitals and physicians need every patient that they can get in order to keep the hospital alive and well. 
   So I'm here to commend my colleagues for their support of this legislation. I am very grateful to Delores Dunn, the staff director of the subcommittee, who has shepherded this effort on my behalf but really on behalf of veterans across rural America, and I commend our chairman and ranking member for their strong efforts on behalf of rural American veterans.

<DOCNO>Mr. MORAN of Kansas. (TREATMENT OF FARMS WITH LIMITED BASE ACRES -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MORAN of Kansas. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in support of H.R. 6849. 
   I certainly support the fundamental purpose of this bill. I do have some concerns about the offset, the pay-for, that is necessary. I am also concerned that the bill only provides temporary relief. 
   As has been indicated, decisions were made in the farm bill to eliminate 10 acres from being considered for program payments under the new farm bill, and the attempt was made to make it clear that farmers could aggregate their properties. That has not been the case as the farm bill has been implemented by the Department of Agriculture, and we now are here to correct that mistake. 
   Mr. Etheridge and I, the gentleman from North Carolina, introduced legislation to do that in September, and this is the base behind the bill that we have before us today, although our plan was to allow farmers to combine base acres through two processes: either reconstitution or aggregation. 
   And when it became a concern that that bill would not pass in sufficient time and the offset was not there, the bill we have before us became the compromise; and I'm pleased knowing that this legislation must pass to be supportive of this compromise bill. It does mean that this Congress, the House Agriculture Committee, will need to come back in future years to make certain that we get this corrected. 
   Also, by speaking today, I want to raise the concern that I have with the offset that we're using. For a long time I have worried that my farmers, when they go to see their USDA officers, particularly FSA, at their county office, they have had tremendous delays in access to computers. And the offset for this bill is computer/IT funding in the Risk Management Agency, RMA. In my opinion, we need to find a more appropriate offset because we authorized only $60 million in the farm bill, $15 million in each of the 4 fiscal years for the IT system at the Risk Management Agency, and those systems were only updated--the last time was 15 years ago.  
   This would remove nearly $20 million from the original $60 million authorized in the farm bill, removing about a third of the money allocated for computer upgrades. 
   And so we have an opportunity, I hope, when the Senate passes similar legislation to sit down and see if we can't agree upon a different way of paying for this needed correction. 
   Without sufficient funding, the Risk Management Agency will be forced to limit future product approvals, enhancements, and expansions, and I believe that will adversely affect farmers and ranchers. RMA must be able to interface with 17 insurance companies that deliver Federal crop insurance covering more than 1.1 million policies and $89 billion in liability. 
   Upgrades are not only needed to allow services to continue but are also necessary to implement current technology to improve program integrity and data security and the protection of personally identifiable information. 
   Again, I raise the concern and hope that as this bill works its way through the process, that we can find a more satisfactory offset than the information technology, the RMA IT account, at the Department of Agriculture. 
   I am here to support this legislation. I appreciate the fix that it provides. We need to figure out a permanent solution, and we need to figure out a different way of paying for it. I look forward to continuing to working in the process to see that those two things occur.
